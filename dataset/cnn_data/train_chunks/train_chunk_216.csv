"(CNN) -- There's a trillion dollar virus that is spreading throughout Silicon Valley right now. It's called social networking. This virus, a relentless kind of digital blob, feeds on our most intimate data. The bigger a social network becomes, the greedier it becomes for our data and the more it invades our lives, voraciously feeding off our friendships and destroying our privacy. All the recent public hysteria about this virus has been concentrated on a social networking start-up called Path which is accused of surreptitiously copying the address books of its iPhone users through its mobile app. Twitter, too, has been accused of this same invasion of our privacy, copying the addresses that we store in our smartphones with neither our permission nor knowledge. But this virus goes beyond Path, beyond Twitter, beyond even Facebook. It's a virus that may be built into the very heart, the operating system of the trillion dollar social networking industry. Silicon Valley has even invented a law to explain this endemic virus. Metcalfe's Law, named after the Ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe, states that ""the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system."" Or, more simply, networks are worth more and more the bigger they get. Social networks have the same biology as viruses. If they don't radically replicate themselves, they die. And the most successful and valuable social networks -- Twitter, Google+, foursquare, Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr and LinkedIn --- are those which grow their membership the quickest. Helping us ""discover"" friends has, thus, become the crack cocaine of every online social network. The bigger our personal network, the more personal data we give out, the more people with whom we connect, the more valuable the network. It's not surprising, therefore, that Path and Twitter and, it is rumored, almost all of today's dominant social networks, have been ""borrowing"" our address books for years through their mobile apps. It's what Path CEO Dave Morin, in a stunning defense of his data grab, described as ""industry best practice"". But Silicon Valley's dirty secret now being exposed by insiders such as the legendary blogger Dave Winer and in damning new books like Lori Andrews' ""I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did"". Like Morin, I strongly suspect that the practice is endemic. Take, for example, LinkedIn, one of the most reputable social networks, whose IPO last May was, at the time, the largest since the Google IPO. I'm on LinkedIn and have always been curious about the network's ""People You May Know"" section, a feature that has always appeared to be eerily serendipitous. So yesterday I ran a test. Among the first 50 people that LinkedIn suggested I might know included my best English friend from childhood, the real estate broker who sold me a house in Alabama, a Californian friend and neighbor, my former Silicon Valley boss and the New York editor of my first book. The uncannily accurate list crossed continents, lives, cultures and epochs. And I really did know 90% of the LinkedIn list. Creepy, eh? ""Question: How is LinkedIn's suggestion list so uncannily accurate? How does it know my most intimate friends?"" I posted on Twitter. LinkedIn spokeswoman Krista Canfield had this response via email: ""As with many companies that rely on algorithms to deliver relevant suggestions to its members, we don¹t share too many details for obvious reasons. What I can tell you is that we use a variety of data points -- including but not limited to mutual connections and profile views, among others -- to make relevant suggestions. ""I also want to note that any data that we use is completely consistent with our privacy policy."" Another reply came from DJ Patil, a former chief scientist at LinkedIn, who is now a data scientist at venture capital firm Greylock Ventures. ""One of the things we look for in every data scientist is an 11 out of 10 in ESP,"" he tweeted. Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt said that he hoped his search engine would one day know us better than we know ourselves. And it seems that LinkedIn's goal is to know our own network more intimately that we ourselves do. But the problem, of course, is that most of us don't want our social networks to have 11 out of 10 in ESP. That's why the Path controversy has elicited such intense debate in Silicon Valley. And that's why Path CEO Morin, after being confronted by hundreds on irate users including the actress Alyssa Milano, made a full public apology for his actions. One of the shrewdest commentators on this virus is Nick Bilton, the New York Times' San Francisco based technology columnist and blogger. ""So many apologies, so much data mining,"" he wrote at the weekend in a scathing critique of Silicon Valley's dismissal of privacy. So I emailed Bilton and asked him how we should confront this seemingly unstoppable invasion of our privacy through the stealing of our data. His response was typically down-to-earth. ""As users of these sites and apps, we have no idea the type of information we are trading for 'free' access,"" he wrote. ""It's one thing for a service to tell me that it plans to read my e-mails, sift through my address book, or look in my underwear drawer — then it is my responsibility to decide if I want to use the service — but it's entirely different for these company's to do so at will. ""Sure, I want LinkedIn, Facebook and other services to offer a better experience, but I want to know what they are doing with my personal information, this way, I can choose to enter with caution, knowing the potential consequences, or try to find an alternative service that is more transparent."" Bilton is, of course, right. It's not enough for sophisticated data scientists like DJ Patil to boast about the intelligence of their social algorithms. What we need is a clear explanation of how a network like LinkedIn has such uncannily accurate knowledge of so many of our most intimate friendships. This currently doesn't exist. LinkedIn's user agreement , for example, is almost 6,500 words and users would need an advanced law degree to make head or tail of it. Equally important, Bilton argues, is the need to always remind ourselves of the ""information"" that we are trading for ""free"" access on the network. This is a critically important point. Social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Path, he reminds us, are free services in which we are actually the product that these businesses are selling to advertisers. The only way to control the trillion dollar virus spreading through Silicon Valley is by standing up to it. Either Dave Morin wins or we do. It is us or them. So, as Nick Bilton says, we need to demand to know what Path and the rest of Silicon Valley is doing with our personal data. If we don't do this, then the digital blob will consume all this data and our privacy really will have become an artifact of history. • Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The North Koreans know how to put on a show and this year -- the 60th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Korean War -- they've gone all out for the Mass Games. If you've toyed with the idea of going, this is the summer to do it. It's a lot easier to get into the Hermit Kingdom than you probably expect and the incredible spectacle that is the Mass Games officially runs until September 8, though it is often extended. You go in knowing there will be 100,000 performers -- gymnasts, dancers, acrobats -- that the music will be loud and there will be fireworks and strobe lights, but nothing prepares you for the sheer scale of the production. It's the Beijing Olympics opening night a dozen times over with a camp director and an unlimited budget. Half the people on the tour I went with opted to go a second night, hoping to catch some of the bits they missed the first time around. Why now is the time to go . Why go now? Because this could well be the last year that Arirang will be staged. Arirang is not the Mass Games -- it's the name of the theme the Games have followed for the last 10 years or so -- a Romeo and Juliet-like folk tale. So while there will almost certainly be a Mass Games next year, it may not follow this theme. What's more, without any anniversaries or significant dates to celebrate next year, it's expected to be far more low-key than the great pomp and ceremony that defines this year's show. Ethical debates persist over whether tourists should visit North Korea, a country with a poor human rights record. Critics say tourist dollars help the repressive government, but others say the tourism money generated in North Korea is minimal. To mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice -- what North Koreans call the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War -- no expense has been spared. New at the Mass Games . Regulars at the world's largest choreographed gymnastics performance say this year's show has plenty of new material, with familiar acts given a new twist. ""I've been about 50 times and 50% of it was different this year,"" says Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. ""There are whole new acts and there's a lot more technology -- the digital screens, the arches on top of the stadium, all that's new."" That new technology had a major hiccup the night I visited, July 27 -- Victory Day. Five minutes into the 90-minute show there was a total blackout. Power outages are everyday occurrences in Pyongyang, but to have one at such a high-profile event was unusual. The spectacle was just kicking off -- a wall of students on the far side of the stadium, the ""human pixels,"" were flipping through books of colored cards to flash up messages and images, giant strobe lights rolled across the arena, the music was pounding, thousands of performers surged across the stadium -- and we were plunged into darkness. Only the night before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had sat in the stadium watching the very same performance with Chinese Vice-President Li Yuanchao. Fortunately for show managers, the blackout didn't happen then. We sat in silence. No one booed, no one jeered and five minutes later when the power came on and the show began again -- from the beginning -- there was a round of applause. ""People live with blackouts all the time,"" says Cockerell. ""It's a sign that someone has been in North Korea a while when the lights go out and they just keep talking or doing whatever they were doing."" Military messaging dominates . North Koreans are big on military motifs and this year they've gone to town. Even a flower show we visited had scores of missiles and tanks tucked in among the red ""Kimjongilia"" blossoms. At the Mass Games, a large gold medal -- to celebrate War Victory -- floats above the May Day Stadium and massive video screens show footage from the Korean War and a video of the long-range rocket launched earlier this year. Given the massive show of military might and boys toys it's no surprise our tour attracted a fair few of 20-something men, but there's something for everyone at the Mass Games -- anyone who loves musicals will be on Cloud Nine, there's plenty of kitsch for the Camp Brigade and it's a photographer's dream shoot. Foreigner reactions . New Zealander Will Seal, 24, went to the Games two nights running: ""It was amazing, but I did get slightly concerned about all those kids spending time out of school, it's a massive undertaking."" He wasn't the only one in our group who was left wondering about the 20,000 children who spend months training intensively for the Mass Games. Briton Matthew Durling mused: ""Where else in the world could you martial thousands of school children, without paying them, and have them do something like that?"" The regulars in our group were quick to notice another new element this year -- at the end of the Arirang performance there is a five-minute segment dedicated to international friendship, especially between China and North Korea and Russia. While the ""human pixels"" flashed up messages of peace and friendship, as well as a rainbow between Pyongyang's Arch of Triumph and Beijing's Tiananmen Square Gate, Lion Dancers, Pandas and Russian Dancers strutted about on stage. The message of friendship with China came at the end of last year's games, too. But the grand gesture towards Russia this year is new. What does it mean? One of our guides said it was ""about politics."" Another said it was ""more about economics."" No doubt they're both right -- politics and economics make for cozy bedfellows and North Korea is waking up to the reality that if it wants to get on, to progress, it needs to start pulling in some hard currency. That's no doubt why visitors are made to feel so welcome, particularly at the country's best known tourist attraction. Currency matters . Foreigners aren't allowed to use the local currency -- the won -- and must bring cash in with them in either U.S. dollars, euros or renminbi. Renminbi, I discovered however, offers by far the worst conversion rate. First-class tickets go for €150 ($159), but this was conveniently rounded to 1,500 RMB ($195) making it a good 20% more expensive. Second-class tickets cost €100 and third-class tickets are €80. If you go a second night, you get a free upgrade. The only way to see the Mass Games is by joining a tour. Most tours leave from Beijing and the tour company will arrange your North Korean visa, travel to Pyongyang, hotels, meals and Mass Games tickets. There's still plenty of time to go this summer -- decide today and you could be there in 10 days. The best-established outfit is Beijing-based Koryo Tours, which has been taking groups since 1993 and has good relationships in North Korea. Koryo Tours offers a host of itineraries from a two-day Mini Break Mass Games Tour, which includes a Pyongyang city guide and Mass Games entry for €790 ($1,048) to a seven-night Ultimate Tour that takes in the Games as well as trip to the DMZ, Mt. Myohyamg and more for €1,690 ($2,242). New Korea Tours is a U.S.-based travel agency specializing in travel to North Korea -- available tours include a seven-night trip that takes in the Mass Games for $2,690. Remote Lands is another U.S.-based tour operator that offers trips to North Korea and other Asian destinations.","North Koreans put on a magnificent Arirang show to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War .

"(Mental Floss) -- Investigators are trying to figure out whether the financial fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff was, in fact, the largest Ponzi scheme in history. The alleged scam, which cost investors $50 billion, sounds like a classic Ponzi racket. The New York home of Bernard Madoff, who's accused in a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. But what is a Ponzi scheme? And why does it bear this name? First, you need to know a little bit about its namesake, Charles Ponzi. Anyone can work a simple swindle, but you have to be a special kind of con man to have your name become synonymous with ""fraud."" Ponzi pulled it off, though. After arriving in the U.S. from Italy in 1903, Ponzi knocked around in a variety of unskilled jobs that usually ended when he got into trouble for theft or cheating customers. A few years later, he moved to Canada, where he spent a hitch in prison for passing a forged check. When he eventually drifted back down to the U.S., he needed a way to make some quick cash.  Watch how a Ponzi scheme works » . Making money via mail . Ponzi eventually found his way to get rich quick using a vagary of the postal system. At the time, it was common for letters abroad to include an international reply coupon -- a voucher that could be exchanged for minimum postage back to the country from which the letter was sent. Thus, if you sent your buddy in France a letter, you could include a coupon so he could respond. (This practice still exists but is less common.) As exchange and postal rates fluctuated, though, there was an opportunity to make a profit. You only had to purchase postal reply coupons cheaply in some foreign country, send them back to the U.S. to swap them out for American stamps of a higher value, then sell these stamps. This arrangement was perfectly legal; it was just cleverly gaming the system. Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy, and he was making a good living doing it. Unfortunately, whatever defect made Ponzi steal from his employers and pass bad checks prompted him to get greedy here, too. He started to recruit investors into his system with the promise of 50 percent returns in just a few days. Investors would pay their cash in, and sure enough, Ponzi would get them the promised return. Everyone was happy with the results, and word started to spread about this Italian financial wizard. Within two years, he had employees all over the country recruiting new takers for this foolproof investment strategy. Ponzi was pocketing millions, and he enjoyed a sumptuous life outside of Boston. At his peak, Ponzi was raking in $250,000 a day, which enabled him to collect such necessities as gold-handled canes. He became a celebrity investor, almost like the Warren Buffett of his day. The scheme . Why is it hard to think of Ponzi's name without affixing ""scheme"" to the end of it, then? Ponzi's underlying ""business"" -- the arbitrage on the postal coupons -- wasn't actually as sound as he claimed. In fact, there wasn't even really a business. However, since so much money was flowing in from new investors, he could just pay off the returns for the old ones from the new cash. In fact, Ponzi didn't even need to pay off the old investors, since many of them wanted to reinvest their returns in this wonderful business. Ponzi's charms made it easy for him to placate any worried customers, and his con looked unstoppable. Mental Floss: 4 very big paychecks for very little work . Fuzzy math . Eventually, though, smarter financial heads started looking at Ponzi's business. Clarence Barron, owner of the Wall Street Journal and founder of the financial magazine that bears his name, realized Ponzi must have been a huckster and went on the offensive. While Barron conceded that there probably was a way for a person to make a small amount of quick cash on the postal reply coupon scheme, he figured that Ponzi would have to be moving 160 million coupons around to raise the cash he needed to support the business. Since there were only 27,000 postal reply coupons circulating in the world, Ponzi's story didn't check out. (Things only got worse when the Postal Service reported that there wasn't a huge flow of the coupons from one country to the other.) On top of that, Barron noted that Ponzi told newspapers he invested his own cash in real estate, stocks, and bonds like any normal investor. Barron pointed out the obvious question here: if Ponzi had this failsafe scheme in which he could make a 50 percent profit, why was he putting his own money into plain old investment instruments that would give him (maybe) a 5 percent return? Those certainly didn't sound like the actions of a financial genius. Barron's conclusions ran as front-page news in the Boston Post in July 1920, which would have been damning for most cons. Ponzi was such a charismatic force of nature, though, that many people chose not to believe the paper's report. Few believed that their hero, the man who had ""tripled"" their life savings, was anything less than 100 percent legitimate. In fact, the morning that the Post ran Barron's report, investors lined up around the block outside of his office in an attempt to give him more money -- even after they'd been told that they'd been scammed. Ponzi later boasted that he'd taken in a million dollars in new investments the day the report ran. Mental Floss: 5 of history's worst perpetrators of corruption . The unraveling . Things were starting to look less rosy for the scammer, though. Although he'd largely placated his investors after Barron's report, Ponzi must have realized his window of opportunity was closing. He hired a publicist, William McMasters, but the PR man saw through Ponzi's lies and renounced his client in the press. James Walsh reprints part of McMasters' slam of Ponzi in his book, ""You Can't Cheat An Honest Man."" Of Ponzi, McMasters said, ""The man is a financial idiot. He can hardly add...He sits with his feet on the desk smoking expensive cigars in a diamond holder and talking complete gibberish about postal coupons."" The next month, regulators raided Ponzi's office and discovered that he didn't have a huge quantity of postal reply coupons. Since Ponzi had used the mail to notify his marks of how their ""investments"" were performing, he faced serious mail fraud charges; in total, the government brought 86 charges against him in two separate indictments. Ponzi pled guilty to one of these charges in exchange for a light sentence of five years. He served around three and a half years, then got his release to face state charges, for which he received a sentence of nine more years. But before he could go back to jail, he jumped bail and tried to start new scams in Florida and Texas. (You'd think the government would have learned their lesson about trusting this guy.) Eventually, though, his time on the lam ran out, and he served his whole sentence. Upon his release, Ponzi was deported to Italy and spent the rest of his life in poverty before dying in 1949 in Rio de Janeiro, where he's buried in a pauper's grave.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Supporters and opponents of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsy clashed near Cairo's Tahrir Square on Monday, leaving one person dead and 26 others injured, an emergency official said. Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down . In one incident, a gunman opened fire near the square with an automatic weapon, and at least two people dropped to the ground, a witness told CNN. It wasn't clear which side the gunman belonged to. At least some of the clashes occurred when Morsy supporters who had been marching toward the U.S. Embassy shifted toward the square, where some Morsy opponents were, witnesses said. Some Morsy supporters had gathered outside the U.S. Embassy on Monday but were dispersed by Egyptian security forces, who fired tear gas at them, state-run EGYNews reported. The embassy is about 1 kilometer from Tahrir Square. The clashes come nearly three weeks after Morsy, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, was forced out of office by the Egyptian military..

"(CNN) -- A woman whose same-sex partner was killed in last month's stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair joined a personal injury attorney in pushing a federal lawsuit against the state of Indiana on behalf of those injured and the families of those killed. The lawsuit seeks to overturn the state's $5 million cap on damages that can be paid out on what lawyer Kenneth Allen called ""a first-come, first-serve basis."" It also addresses what he described as ""unfairness (and) prejudice toward gay and lesbian couples"" who might not be entitled to payments, if their civil unions or marriages aren't recognized in Indiana. Allen was joined at a Merriville press conference by Alisha Brennon, who spoke publicly for the first since suffering severe head and other injuries in the collapse. Her long-time partner Christina Santiago -- an activist for gay and lesbian rights and health issues with whom she officially was joined in a civil union in Illinois in June -- was killed, as were six others. ""She fought for everything that she believed in, and I believe she's still fighting,"" Brennon said. ""We're going to do it. We're not going to stop."" Brennon was among at least 40 people injured August 13 when the scaffolding collapsed during a severe thunderstorm that blew through the area just before country music duo Sugarland was set to perform. The structure fell onto fans gathered in front of the stage minutes after authorities had addressed the audience about the approaching storm. Allen claims that the lawsuit aims to compel Indiana to change its policies. That includes what he called its ""puzzling"" and ""wrong"" cap on how much the state can pay out ""no matter how many people are harmed, now matter how many are injured."" ""They're attempting to throw a bowl of crumbs to a bunch of pigeons,"" he said. ""Our clients aren't pigeons."" The lawyer alleged that the event's organizers ""cut every corner that they possibly could,"" calling their actions before and during that night ""reckless."" He claimed that the fact there was a limit on possible damages didn't give enough incentive to take every safety precaution. Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller told CNN affiliate WISH that he is not aware of a prior case where the courts have overturned caps on damages -- something that Allen acknowledged Monday, saying ""this case is without precedent."" Yet the most emotional part of Monday's press conference came from Brennon, who still carried bruises and cuts to her head six weeks after the accident. She said it was initially a ""perfect night"" for her, Santiago and others. Then at one point, she recalled, someone came on stage to say the storm would ""move around us"" while adding that an evacuation was possible. ""Five minutes later, I was knocked unconscious,"" Brennon said through tears. ""And I never saw (Santiago) again. It's not right."" Allen said that he would fight so that Brennon would get the same benefits as a wife might get if she lost her husband in the collapse. ""We should not stand by and allow this inequality,"" the lawyer said, calling gay and lesbian rights ""the last frontier of equal protection."" ""It makes no difference (if a couple is straight or gay, as long as they) love each other and are committed to each other."" In addition to Monday's lawsuit, the state faces 21 other potential lawsuits related to the collapse, according to CNN affiliate WRTV. The Indiana State Police, the state's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and an independent company hired by the state fair commission are all conducting investigations into the incident. ""Our goal is to learn everything we can why this tragedy occurred. We won't leave any question unanswered, from both a structural standpoint and the decision that was made,"" Indiana State Fair Commission Chairman Andre Lacy said last month. ""We know that many are eager for answers today. We don't have them. And we won't speculate.""","NEW: An injured woman says the death of her same-sex partner ""is not right""

"(CNN) -- This week, a mother called us about her child hospitalized with a Salmonella poisoning from his day care's chicken lunch. The child's condition was tenuous, with a blood infection, and treatment was especially challenging as the bacteria was antibiotic resistant. The mom turned to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, for information and help because key government's public health agencies and websites are shut down. Does this have an impact of food safety? You betcha! Regardless of whether this illness is related to the outbreak linked to Foster Farms chickens, it illustrates that each case of illness is important to track, and protecting our families from unsafe food should be considered an essential function of government. When the shutdown began, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would have to halt most of its food safety activities, including routine inspections of food manufacturers and monitoring of imports. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shuttered some of its key activities, including outbreak detection and infectious-disease surveillance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture kept its meat, poultry and egg inspectors on the job, but furloughed more than 1,200 other food safety workers. Despite the agencies' planning, a government shutdown makes it easier for contaminated food to slip through to consumers and harder for the federal government to identify and respond to outbreaks. The outbreak linked to Foster Farms chickenâ€”in which hundreds of people were sickened-- was already under investigation when the furlough began. Nonetheless, it demonstrate the shutdown's real human impact, as consumers are left confused about why there has been no recall and whether it is safe to buy the company's products. Government websites that would normally give them such advice remain dark. There are other effects of the shutdown that may not be felt for months. During the first six days of the furlough, the CDC shut down its primary systems (PulseNet and OutbreakNet) for gathering information from the state public health agencies. Instead, the few staff left at CDC gathered illness data from the states manually. Although CDC recalled a number of staff from furlough to continue handling the salmonella outbreak, the agency may end up weeks behind in investigating new outbreaks as it gets its systems up and running again. Meanwhile, key personnel at the food safety agencies that are tasked with preventing outbreaks are not at their posts, investigating suspect facilities, checking imports or analyzing lab samples. Outbreak investigations involve a complex choreography among many state, local and federal agencies. They begin with state and local agencies receiving reports of illnesses, investigating them, and forwarding their findings to CDC. CDC aggregates these state reports with data collected from monitoring programs. Next, it sifts through huge volumes of information to link up illnesses occurring in different states, identifying common pathogens and common food sources. That information is forwarded to USDA and FDA, which try to track outbreaks to their sources. USDA or FDA may issue a public health alert or issue a recall (or demand that a company recall potentially tainted foods), alerting consumers to avoid certain foods and getting them removed from supermarket shelves. Consumers only see the final action but have little knowledge of the complexity and labor- intensive steps by multiple agencies needed to take it. Yet 10 days ago, Congress sent these public health officials home and left consumers (and the food industry) vulnerable to the effects of dangerously contaminated foods. Food borne disease is preventable, yet 48 million consumers suffer illnesses each year. Usually symptoms are just an upset stomach, but more severe symptoms send 128,000 people to the hospital and kill 3,000 annually. Those who recover may still suffer life-changing conditions, such as kidney failure, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, and reactive arthritis. Our national investments in food safety are important tools that can help reduce those numbers. In the best of times, investigations of outbreaks of food borne illnesses are complex and hard to solve. But it is truly reckless to continue this government shutdown and leave so many, like the mother and child who called this week, unprotected. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Caroline Smith DeWaal.","Caroline Smith DeWaal: Shutdown can have serious impact on food safety, health .

"(CNN) -- It could be Juan Martin del Potro's week at the Shanghai Masters. Suffering from a fever in the early rounds, he needed a third-set tiebreak to see off Philipp Kohlschreiber in his opener. But then the Argentine caught a break, advancing to the quarterfinals when Tommy Haas withdrew with a back injury. Recovered from his illness, del Potro blasted his way past new world No. 1 Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-4 to reach Sunday's final against Novak Djokovic. It was del Potro's first victory over Nadal since 2009 -- the year the former won his lone major at the U.S. Open -- and booked his spot at next month's year-end championships in London. ""I played so solid all the time, hitting the ball so hard,"" del Potro was quoted as saying by the ATP's official website. ""I saw Rafa playing very far off the baseline, which is good for my game, for my serve, and confidence. That's the way to beat this guy."" Del Potro hit five aces, wasn't broken and consistently applied pressure on the Nadal serve, manufacturing 11 break points. Nadal had no answers. ""He played amazing,"" Nadal told the website. ""I just congratulate him. ""Very few times I play against a player with a level like today. I really go home with the feeling that I didn't play bad. That's the thing. It is fair to say that. I am humble enough to say that I played well and I lost 6-2, 6-4."" Del Potro will likely have to play just as well or better to defeat Djokovic, who boosted his winning streak in China to 19 matches by downing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2 7-5 earlier Saturday. Djokovic, now second in the rankings, regained his composure after a controversial line call in the second set. ""I would wish to get even a better performance tomorrow for the most important match this week,"" Djokovic, who crushed Nadal last week at the China Open, told reporters. ""But we'll see."" When Djokovic and del Potro last met, Djokovic prevailed in a near five-hour classic in the Wimbledon semifinals.","Juan Martin del Potro beats new No. 1 Rafael Nadal at the Shanghai Masters .

The film shares the experiences of Angel, Moses and the rest of the choir, in five countries over two years. Armed with incredible smiles, these children make you believe they've got the whole world in their hands. Almost all the kids come from the slums of Kampala, Uganda, and by traveling with the choir most of these children are getting an opportunity not only for a great education but also to be the main bread winners in their families.

I didn't have many clothes and I didn't have many pairs of shoes and now I have them."" The Grammy-nominated African Children's Choir was started in 1984 by human rights activist Ray Barnett. Barnett was called on to help the thousands of children who had been orphaned and abandoned following years of conflict. Barnett says: ""I felt a choir of African children, who were very underprivileged, could show the world the beauty, dignity and unlimited ability of the African child so they could see what their help could do."" The choir has successfully accomplished this for 28 years worldwide. As the director and visionary for the nonprofit, Barnett developed the team into an internationally acclaimed performing group while raising funds to help many destitute children. To date, more than 1,000 vulnerable children have been through the choir program. Funds from the choir have provided the opportunity of education and hope for many thousands like them in some of Africa's most impoverished areas. Some of the graduates have gone on to become lawyers, doctors, teachers and even leaders in their countries. Read more: 10 must-see African films . According to Julia Tracy, the group's international choir director, the experience has not only raised future leaders for their home countries but has left an indelible mark on every nation in which they perform. For 20 years, she has watched their powerful performances be a force of inspiration and unity for countless audiences. She notes that this is one of the group's strengths. They effortlessly create a relationship with the community and ""spread a different worldview,"" she says. The film's producer, Erin Levin, first met the kids at a fundraising event in Madison Square Garden. Reflecting on the experience, Levin says, ""I had always done this good stuff but never really had a reason to except that it was what I was taught ... and it made me feel good and I loved it. But, meeting these kids put a face and a heart and a name to everything."" At first, the journey of making Imba was a struggle. Levin says when she first arrived in Uganda to assess the production of the film she didn't have anyone to talk to. The girls in particular were shy and reluctant to talk with her. Angel and Moses are the stars of the film. The two were natural choices as they didn't hesitate to speak with Levin's crew. Now three years into production, Levin says most of the children speak English and can read and write in the Ugandan Luganda language. The children have been grateful to participate in the group and continue to marvel at their experience. ""Being in the choir means I will have my school fees paid, because if I go to school I can be whatever I want when I grow up,"" says a young girl called Patience. ""I need that to become a lawyer."" Read more: Artists take epic Africa road trip . ""The choir is going to change my life by giving us education,"" says choir member Kendrick. But funding the movie has been a real struggle. So far Levin has raised $200,000. In addition to this, she still has to reach a goal of $400,000 -- of which she has only raised $200,000. Levin hopes the film will become a movement. She says: ""The issue it addresses is not just the African Children's Choir. It's much bigger than that. It's education. All the kids in the choir can't go to first or second grade. Then they tour the world and now their education is paid for through college so that is what we are shinning a light on."" Levin credits all her success to her crew: director Danielle Bernstein and director of photography Jason Maris. She is deservedly unabashed in how proud she is of their work. Her message to others: ""Anyone can follow their dream and follow their heart. I am just a normal girl who believed in something and is going after it. And, I hope that people will see this and be inspired to do the same."" Imba Means Sing is due to premiere in 2014.","The African Children's Choir helps vulnerable children .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic and new World No.1 Rafael Nadal came through testing quarterfinal matches Friday to remain on course for a final showdown at the Shanghai Masters. Djokovic dropped the opening set to Frenchman Gael Monfils before going through 6-7 6-2 6-4 in a grueling near two and a half hour battle while Nadal dispatched in-form Stanislas Wawrinka of 7-6 6-1 in the last match on court. Monfils, working his way up the rankings, had beaten Roger Federer in the third round and was full of confidence from the off against his Serbian opponent. The pair exchanged breaks in the first set, which eventually went to a tiebreak, won by former No.7 Monfils. The 26-year-old Djokovic burst into life in the second set, winning it for the loss of just two games, and he claimed a crucial break in the decider which eventually settled the outcome, giving him his 18th straight win on Chinese soil. ""I was serving better as the match went on. Today was a very physical match and very intense. We played many rallies. I'm glad that I made it through,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. Monfils was also satisfied with his display and is already looking forward to the 2014 campaign. ""I'm still happy. He is one of the best players in the world, and I have no shame today,"" he said. Djokovic faces another Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in Saturday's semifinals. Seventh seed Tsonga, back on the ATP Tour after missing the U.S. Open with a knee injury, had earlier beaten Florian Mayer of Germany 6-2 6-3. Nadal's incredible season continued as he reached his 50th career Masters 1000 semifinal and improved his record against Wawrinka to a perfect 11-0. The Swiss, battling to make the ATP World Tour Finals in London next month, made life awkward for Nadal in the opener, forcing two set points in the 12th game, both saved by the Spaniard to force a tiebreak. That lasted 23 minutes with Nadal eventually clinching it 12-10 on his third set point. It broke the resolve of Wawrinka, who was quickly broken in the second set and slipped to defeat in one hour 47 minutes. Nadal said Wawrinka had really tested him in the opener and he was relieved to have got through. ""His serve was huge. He came to the court with that determination to hit every ball by taking the ball earlier so it was very difficult to stop him."" Nadal also spoke of his shock over the sudden death of female F1 driver and compatriot Maria de Villota. ""It's very difficult to say things on day like today,"" he said. ""All the best for her family. Very difficult to find a word because is a very sad, sad day for all of us."" Nadal will play Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro for a place in the final. The sixth seed, fresh from winning the Japan Open title, breezed past Nicolas Almagro, the Spanish 15th seed, 6-3 6-3. Meanwhile, Germany's Angelique Kerber clinched the eighth and final spot for the season-ending WTA Championships in Istanbul when she reached the semifinals of a tournament in Linz, Austria. Kerber beat home hope Patricia Mayr-Achleitner, 6-3 6-1. She joins Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Agnieska Radwanska, Li Na, Petra Kvitova, Sara Errani and Jelena Jankovic in the prestigious season closer.","Novak Djokovic taken to three sets by Gael Monfils of France .

"(CNN) -- The Russian spring may have been postponed this year, both on and offline. Last December, after the spontaneous popular demonstrations in Moscow against the ""results"" of the parliamentary elections, suggested that Russia's internet hamsters might be outfoxing Vladimir Putin. But I'm afraid that this weekend's Presidential elections have reestablished the primacy of the old regime over internet activists. Indeed, even President elect Putin may now be outsmarting popular bloggers like Alexei Navalny. So much then for the transformational power of the democratic network; so much, too, for the power of digital society to rearrange power in Russia. The problem is that the Internet doesn't have transcendental powers. Technology is just technology. It can't magically invent political parties, platforms, ideologies or leaders. And it certainly can't transform the well-intentioned democratic activists on Russian social networks like Vkonkakte and Live Journal into coherent organizations that can effectively challenge Putin's leviathan state. As one of Moscow's savviest political observers emailed me yesterday about the current political situation in Russia: ""It shows that the best defense against revolution are not tanks and security forces, but a phony compromised opposition created by the government to preempt any real opposition. ""It also shows that the opposition that does exist is still very much a limited Moscow phenomenon. The Internet is only a medium. It can't create an appealing opposition candidate out of a bunch of clowns. It also can't create a middle class where there is none."" And as Alexei Navalny tweeted yesterday: ""We overestimated ourselves. We thought the rest of the country knew what we know."" So why doesn't the rest of Russia know what the anti-corruption activist Navalny knows? According to Edward Shenderovich, a Moscow based venture capitalist who runs Kite Ventures, it's because Putin controls the media. Of the 140 million people who live in Russia, Shenderovich explains, only 35 million of them are on the internet. The rest rely for their information on radio, television and newspapers which are mostly managed by Putin apologists and allies. The opposition is not only mostly limited to Moscow, but it's also politically naive. Last night, in Moscow's Pushinskaya square, protestors gathered to demonstrate against the legitimacy of Putin's electoral coronation. It was a slightly disappointing turnout (around 20,000 people) and after Alexei Navalny and presidential candidate Mikail Prokhorov spoke, a rump of the crowd became embroiled with the riot police. According to Gazeta.ru, all the talk amongst the resistors was to set up a tent city along the idealistic lines of the Occupy Wall Street movement. But haven't these Russian activists been keeping up with the news from America? If the Occupy Movement in Manhattan's Zucotti Park couldn't fight Michael Bloomberg's New York City cops, then what chance does a Moscow civic protest camp have against Vladimir Putin's tens of thousands of heavily armed militiamen? Fortunately, there are some political realists who understand that the most effective way to resist Putin isn't through a directionless Occupy Movement or via absurd theatrical stunts like the FEMEN activist in Moscow who bared her breast at the Moscow polling station where Putin had just voted. ""The opposition now has to recognize the agonizing fact that creative flash-mobs won't get rid of Putin. We need to learn stubborn, routine and -- at a first hipster glance -- useless old-school political work,"" noted the Opposition leader Vladimir Milov yesterday . Nor will more high-tech digital technology get rid of Putin. Indeed, the regime has cynically appropriated cutting-edge technologies such as ""transparent ballot boxes"" to establish its honesty. Putin even installed 180,000 web cameras at Russian polling stations in a surreal attempt to prove the legitimacy of an electoral system that is anything but radically transparent. If there is to be a political spring in Russia, it may be led by the ex CEO of Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once the wealthiest man in Russia and now a prisoner in a very low tech Siberian labor camp. Khodorkovksy has penned a seven point plan for the opposition which include a focus on peaceful protest, the establishment of two or three political parties, getting activists out of Moscow into the regions and establishing working pacts with moderates within Putin's regime. Khodorkovksy' realism is echoed by the venture capitalist Edward Shenderovich. Demonstrations in Russia will continue, he explained to me. But while the internet is a great ""communications platform"" for organizing people and collecting money, politics, Shenderovich told me, exists ""outside"" the online world. The focus, he insists, should be on building a clear opposition leader and platform that will challenge what he calls ""the most corrupt society in the world."" ""Putin beats the spread"", noted Matthew Rojanksy, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program. The losers in the Presidential election, he explained, were the middle class, young people and the United States. But Rojansky left out a fourth loser from Sunday's election: the Russian internet. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a Democratic plan to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for middle income Americans while rejecting a Republican alternative to continue all of the cuts -- twin votes that help to crystallize the position of the two parties on a critical issue heading into the fall campaign. The Democratic proposal passed in a sharply polarized 51-48 vote, while the Republican plan was defeated 45-54. Vice President Joe Biden, the constitutional presiding officer of the Senate, was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary. Strategists on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that neither plan has a chance of passing both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. GOP leaders in the House have indicated they have no intention of bringing the Democrats' plan to a vote. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, pledged in a written statement after the votes to ""stop the tax hike,"" and insisted Republicans are the only ones addressing the ""threat to our economy."" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Democrats for backing a ""disastrous plan to raise taxes on small businesses and job creators"" while putting ""their tax-and-spend agenda ahead of creating jobs."" President Barack Obama, however, said, ""House Republicans are now the only people left in Washington holding hostage the middle-class tax cuts for 98% of Americans."" The U.S. economy ""isn't built from the top down, it's built from a strong and growing middle class, and that's who we should be fighting for,"" he declared. Rival Bush tax plans . Wednesday's votes were primarily about political positioning in the heat of the 2012 election season, as well each party's opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session this autumn. The economy is approaching a so-called ""fiscal cliff"" brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts. ""At the end of the day this (legislative maneuvering) isn't going to solve the problem. It's going to be political posturing all the way up to the November election,"" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. The Democratic bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday would extend the Bush tax cuts -- now set to expire at the end of the year -- just on incomes under $250,000 for a couple and $200,000 for an individual. The GOP bill would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers -- including the wealthiest Americans -- and includes a requirement that Congress tackle comprehensive tax reform within a year. Republicans argue that any tax hikes could derail what is already considered a weak recovery. Opinion: Taxmageddon is headed our way . After Senate leaders jockeyed for days over procedural issues tied to consideration of the bills, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, unexpectedly announced Wednesday morning that Republicans would agree to Democratic demands and hold back-to-back votes requiring neither side to garner a filibuster-proof 60-vote margin. McConnell's decision gave the Democrats bragging rights, allowing them to tout the fact that their bill is capable of passing the Senate. But it also gave Republicans the ability to put several centrist Democratic senators on the spot, forcing those Democrats to vote for a politically contentious plan that raises taxes on certain Americans. ""We owe it to the American people to let them know whether we actually think it is a good idea to double down on the failed economic policies of the past few years or whether we support a new approach,"" McConnell said before the vote. ""By setting these votes at a 50-vote threshold, nobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while leaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery."" For their part, Democrats point to polling that shows a majority of Americans support their approach. ""Our bill has the support of President Obama, has the support of the Democratic caucus and has the support of the American people. A majority of Americans, including a significant majority of Republicans, agree taxes should remain low for the middle class and the top 2% should pay their fair share to reduce the deficit,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. ""The only place there is no agreement is with Republicans in Congress."" Want to attend one of the political conventions? Tell us why CNN should send you.

"(CNN) -- We found him in the foggy mountains of central Chile, near the town of Aguila Sur, conducting a ritual at dusk with two assistants. Dr. Milton Flores, 58, is not the leader of a religious sect or underground cult. He's a psychiatrist who's unusual in many respects. But in this South American country, it's his crusade to legalize marijuana that has earned him notoriety. When asked to describe marijuana, he says it's ""a tool and a medicine."" Flores has used cannabis for years to treat patients with different conditions, including depression and anxiety. He also admits he has smoked pot since he was 14. Flores is Chile's main advocate for the legalization of marijuana and similar drugs including peyote, ayahuasca and San Pedro. Flores and other experts call these drugs entheogens. They're all psychoactive plants that were used in Latin America by shamans and healers in religious ceremonies well before the arrival of European conquerors in the 16th century. Flores' main contention with these drugs' illegal status is that the state gains nothing by criminalizing individuals who use them for medicinal or spiritual purposes the way he does. ""Cannabis is neither good nor bad,"" he says. ""Its use can be appropriate or inappropriate. It's a tool that can have very significant effects."" Throughout his career, the psychiatrist has spoken publicly about his position regarding these drugs. He's gone to great lengths to make his point. His property has been raided twice by Chilean authorities. In March, police confiscated several marijuana plants at his mountain retreat. His case went all the way up to the Chilean Supreme Court, but it was dismissed on a technicality. More recently, Flores was found guilty of growing 116 plants of marijuana on his property in Aguila Sur; he was sentenced last week to 541 days, or more than 18 months, of probation. ""There's no willingness to hear the pleas of a citizen who decides to exercise his freedom of conscience and his freedom to grow what is sacred to care for his life,"" Flores told CNN. ""This to me is the most serious violation that has become evident [by this ruling]."" Not surprisingly, Flores has a significant number of fans among young Chileans, including Oscar Bustamante, a 27-year-old student at the University of Chile in Santiago. ""Consuming marijuana, whatever the reason, is totally and absolutely a personal choice and should not be banned as long as the individual doesn't harm anybody else,"" Bustamante says. Some Chilean politicians are sympathetic to Flores' cause. A few years ago, a government minister acknowledged he smoked marijuana. Some senators and representatives followed suit. And even though smoking marijuana no longer has the stigma it once had, and smoking it is rarely prosecuted, the country still bans the production, sale, distribution and large-scale possession of marijuana. The Chilean government is getting pressure from two sides. Unintentional marijuana exposures up in Colorado kids . On the one hand, countries such as the United States and Colombia favor a tough, law-enforcement approach on drugs. On the other hand, liberal politicians advocate making a distinction between public health and national security when it comes to dealing with drugs. It's a debate that leaders in the United States and other South American countries know well. Uruguayan legislators have been arguing for nearly a year over a bill that would legalize marijuana. The bill would give the Uruguayan government the power to regulate the production, sale and distribution of marijuana. Leftist President Jose Mujica is said to favor the legislation. Former Latin American presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Vicente Fox of Mexico have all publicly spoken in favor of legalizing not only marijuana, but several other drugs. The war on drugs, Fox told CNN in November, ""costs a lot of money. It costs a lot of lives and blood; it costs a lot of foreign investment lost, a lot of tourism that we have lost in Mexico."" Its effectiveness, the former president says, is questionable at best and countries should take a public health approach to the drug problem. Patricio Navia, a Chilean-born professor of liberal studies at New York University, says a growing number of legislators in his country favor the idea of decriminalizing marijuana so law enforcement can concentrate efforts on more addictive drugs such as crack. ""The drug problem in Chile has to do with crack,"" Navia says. ""Among the low-income population, crack is the biggest problem that's associated with crime. People who smoke marijuana don't go and assault other people in order to get more money to keep on smoking marijuana."" Flores' biggest fan is, perhaps, his own daughter. Carola Flores-Fernandez, a 33-year-old anthropology doctoral student at the University of California-Santa Barbara, says her father's crusade has opened an important national debate on drugs -- a topic that used to be taboo. ""I'm very proud, and I think it's something that is slowly changing the perspective of many people in different levels in this country,"" Flores-Fernandez says. Back at his mountain retreat near Aguila Sur, Flores says he's no longer growing marijuana, although he keeps small plants of San Pedro and ayahuasca. His hope is that his crusade will allow him to grow and consume these drugs without fear in the near future.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast Monday near a political rally left 18 people dead in a Pakistan tribal region, a local government official said. The strike occurred in the Kurram district, Riaz Khan said, and also wounded at least 56 people. Khan said the blast was detonated remotely and 10 kilograms of explosives were used. The explosion occurred during a rally staged by the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman group, a right-wing religious party with sympathies for the militant Taliban movement. The incident occurred as Pakistanis prepare to go to the polls Saturday for national elections. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility. It said it attacked because one of the candidates, Munir Orakzai, has handed over members of the mujahedeen to the United States. ""We will never forgive him nor leave him alive,"" a statement from Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said. Jan Achakzai, a spokesman for Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, said more than 2,000 people were attending the rally. Dr. Anayatur Rehman, who works at the hospital that received the bodies, said 18 people died. Achakzai said more than 50 people were injured and two candidates received minor injuries. ""We will continue our politics of peace and reconciliation in Pakistan's tribal region despite these cowards' attacks,"" Achakzai said. Violence has marred the run-up to the elections. The anti-Taliban Awami National Party and the Muttahida Quami Movement and their personnel also have been targeted recently. Maulana Fazal Rahman, the head of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal Ur Rehman, condemned the attack and said it prompted him to underscore the importance of national unity and deplore sectarian hatred. ""We cannot replace Sunnis with Shias, nor Shias with Sunnis, but we can remove hatred between various sects, ethnicities, linguistic groups,"" he said.","NEW: Pakistani Taliban says it carried out the attack .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- If Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are staying up late worrying about whether they can win the election, they should ponder another, ultimately more important, question: Will their campaign rhetoric make it impossible for them to be effective if elected president? The decisions that each man makes in his effort to defeat the other will shape the political environment in January 2013. Although we often consider the campaign phase of a presidency to be entirely separate from governing, the truth is that the two are intimately connected. Whoever takes office in January will face many difficult challenges that will force him to compromise, adjust and move away from campaign promises that no longer fit the reality of the times. The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, along with the payroll tax cut designed to boost the economy. The pressure will be on for the president and Congress to make deep spending cuts and revenue increases. The president's health care law will either need to be implemented and funded, or it will have been ruled unconstitutional, thus pushing to the forefront once again the skyrocketing costs of health care. In foreign policy, the Middle East, Iran, North Korea and China all point to hot spots that are volatile and unpredictable. And these are just the known challenges, let alone the crises we can't yet see coming. For Obama, the dangers are significant. To keep Democrats excited about a second term, it appears that he will continue to focus on the rhetoric of economic populism as well as on attacking the do-nothing Congress. Although he has governed like a moderate, his speeches have increasingly stressed the liberal themes of progressive economic policy, criticism of Wall Street and big business and, to some extent, laments about the growing inequality in American life. In his State of the Union Address, Obama castigated Wall Street with populist rhetoric, saying that the problems in the economy had stemmed from the fact that ""Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules."" He promised that this time around, ""It's time to apply the same rules from top to bottom: No bailouts, no handouts and no copouts."" The danger for Obama is twofold. One the one hand, if the president veers too far to the left on the campaign trail, he will offer more fodder to his opponents who want to paint his every move as being those of a left-of-center Democrat. This will be even more problematic than it was in 2009 and 2010, when Obama still enjoyed political capital from his election, which allowed him to rebuff some of these charges and push through his legislative agenda. After his re-election, Republicans wouldn't have any fears about retribution and they wouldn't have any reason to compromise. As with every second-term president, he would be a lame duck from day one. Just as important, many moderate Democrats could be leery about supporting him unless they were sure that doing so wouldn't hurt their chances for re-election. At the same time that a rhetorical shift to the left could alienate possible legislative support, it could also create inflated expectations within the Democratic base. Just as many of Obama's supporters have been disappointed in his decisions after a campaign that promised transformation, liberals would be doubly dejected if his populism proved to be pure posturing. He could leave many Democrats deeply disappointed over the dim chance of ever delivering on these core ideas. Finally, in the coming months, Obama will continue to succumb to the lure of big money. With all his talk about change, this election looks awfully familiar. The Obama campaign has embarked on an aggressive fundraising project, including relying on super PACS. The kind of fundraising and interest group mobilization that will occur might very well define Obama by the end of this season as much as any of the bills that Congress has passed. Romney has challenges of his own. Romney's most obvious campaign struggle will be what to do about the right. The tea party Republicans will continue to pressure Romney to play to the base so he can prove he is not the Etch A Sketch candidate his critics present him to be. Romney will face a strong temptation to echo their positions as he looks to the tea party to mobilize supporters to vote in swing states. But if Romney pushes too hard in this direction, trying to overcompensate for his perceived centrism, he would make it difficult to appeal to moderate Democrats in a first term. Without the support of at least a handful of moderates, persuading Congress to pass legislation will be extraordinarily difficult. Romney will also face growing pressure to promise that he will oppose any kind of revenue increase, including an assurance that he would support an extension of the Bush tax cuts for wealthier Americans. Given the size of the deficit, such promises would put him in a difficult bind, setting him up for the kind of challenge with the Republican base that faced George H.W. Bush in 1990 when he had to settle for revenue increases after promising in his campaigning that he wouldn't agree to any new taxes. The enormity of the deficit will require revenue increases in addition to spending cuts. If the next president and Congress decide that they must significantly lower the deficit, these painful choices would be on the table.. He will need to keep bargaining room to raise taxes so that this doesn't haunt him. Some presidents have faced trouble as a result of the way they campaigned. Most famously, President Harry Truman pulled off a stunning upset against Thomas Dewey in 1948 by running against a ""Do Nothing Congress."" Although Truman's victory is often recounted, what is usually forgotten is that his relationship with Congress was terrible over the succeeding few years. Many of the Republicans who had worked closely with the Democratic Truman in 1947 and 1948 were furious at the campaign theme. Sen. Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, who had been Truman's key ally in the creation of the national security system, complained to one Republican operative that, ""Not even Wallace [third party candidate Henry Wallace] is saying things better calculated to split the country into snarling vendettas at a moment when our destiny cannot afford these soap box luxuries."" The result was bitter conflict over domestic issues such as civil rights and the war against communism . Yet there have been times when campaigning and governance went hand in hand. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson of Texas used his campaign to define his agenda broadly, contrasting himself with right-wing Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona and extolling the virtues of liberalism. During the campaign, Johnson took part in staged events extolling programs that Congress had passed. The election increased the Democratic majority in the Congress, giving him needed support for passing bills such as Medicare and federal aid to education, and became a platform to govern. Obama and Romney will have to navigate this difficult path. As they focus on each other and the kinds of tactics that will be needed for victory, they must also consider what happens if they do win and how the campaign will help or hinder their chances as president. The decisions that give Romney or Obama the best chance to win in the Electoral College may make success almost impossible to achieve in the White House.Â . Â Â .

"(CNN) -- In a recent column for The New York Times, David Brooks argued that the nation has now entered into a ""capitalism debate."" Brooks wrote that President Obama, who he said is feeling defensive about the failure of his policies to revitalize economic growth, has launched an all-out assault on capitalism by depicting Mitt Romney as the embodiment of corrupt and vicious economic practices. The president's decision to focus on Romney's work at Bain Capital, Brooks argues, has shifted the ""focus of the race from being about big government, which Obama represents, to being about capitalism, which Romney represents."" Romney responded in kind, ""I'm convinced he wants Americans to be ashamed of success."" If this shift continues, the campaigns will spend the next four months presenting voters with a false impression about the the real contest. While both parties have a strong incentive to ramp up the rhetoric to mobilize voters to turn out, this kind of campaign features a debate that has little to do with the governing that will actually take place after the election. This election is not a choice between government and markets. The reality is that we will continue to have a system that mixes government and markets, with the political battles centering on the particular priorities that the nation emphasizes within that mix. Obama, as Brooks points out, has not really been a critic of free-market capitalism. His policies have done little to challenge the forces of globalization, and he has worked closely with economic leaders in his efforts to fix the economy. His financial regulation did little to curb the freedom of Wall Street investors. Obama is not some kind of exception among American liberals. Indeed, since Franklin Roosevelt, American liberals have been firm supporters of American capitalism. Their goals have been to tame the excesses of this economic system and to make capitalism fairer for all Americans. Many of FDR's economic policies, such as the National Recovery Act, depended on voluntary cooperation from big business. FDR backed away from any proposals that entailed the federal government obtaining strong control over managerial decisions. The point of legitimating unions, which happened through the Wagner Act (1935), was to provide workers with some kind of countervailing power to business owners within the capitalism system. Other Democrats, such as Harry Truman, followed in this market-friendly liberal tradition. Lyndon Johnson offered economic assistance to the poor and educational assistance to all students, so that more people could participate and enjoy the fruits that the capitalist system produced. With his support of deregulation and deficit reduction, Jimmy Carter moved market-based Democrats even further to the center. Bill Clinton embraced globalization and believed that nurturing free markets could offer the best opportunities to those struggling at home and abroad. While liberalism has always been a political system that sought to use government to strengthen the market-based economy, conservatives have usually been comfortable with government. Despite their rhetoric, conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of American life. Romney has been no exception. As governor, he was not some kind of radical slasher of government services. The centerpiece of his term was a bold health care initiative that expanded that role of government in ensuring access to health care. Romney cut services, but he also increased all kinds of government fees. During his current campaign, Romney is not talking about eliminating the big-ticket programs like Social Security, and he has firmly defended robust levels of national security spending. Like Obama, Romney reflects his own political tradition. Libertarianism has long been dead among conservatives. During the Cold War, conservatives like Sen. Barry Goldwater and author James Burnham pushed for the government to spend more on the fight against communism. During the 1970s, historian Gareth Davies recounted, many conservatives came to accept federal programs such as education as an inevitable part of domestic life. President Ronald Reagan, the iconic conservative, quickly backed off proposals like an initiative to reduce certain Social Security benefits when they stimulated a strong political backlash, and he left many other kinds of domestic spending, like Medicare or agricultural subsidies, intact. George H.W. Bush brought the federal government into new areas of domestic life, providing, for example, protections for people with disabilities. Congressional conservatives like Newt Gingrich proved that they were not much different, as they too were aware that Americans in red states often depended on the government they lambasted. George W. Bush and the Republican Congress grew government in the early part of this century. Bush pushed several significant domestic initiatives such as No Child Left Behind and a costly prescription drug benefit. Like all Republicans, he did little to take out the massive welfare state of tax exemptions and deductions upon which many industries depend. In 2008, he saved financial markets through government with TARP, not through deregulation. His homeland security program involved an aggressive expansion of government power, and he launched two wars abroad. Like it or not, liberals have always accepted capitalism, and conservatives have proved more than willing to live with, and even to use, the federal government for certain purposes. The debate today is not between big government and free market capitalism but rather about how we should structure our mixture of these two systems. The more we have these kinds of overblown debates, the less voters get a sense of what politicians are actually about and what they'll do once in power. A more realistic debate would be about which portion of the public will have tax cuts extended. Rather than an all or nothing debate, we should hear which specific parts of the budget will be trimmed and where will each candidate try to find more efficiency in government. In terms of the economy, where and how will they use government to stimulate economic investment and to curb the deficit, how else will candidates try to raise revenue. This current rhetoric is not only unrealistic, it fuels public frustration with government by generating false expectations and providing campaign discussions that have little to do with real life in Washington. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Pundits are painting President Obama as the anti-capitalist candidate, says Julian Zelizer .
But this election is not a choice between government and markets, Zelizer says .

"(CNN) -- Severe weather -- including suspected tornadoes -- swept through the South on Wednesday, killing at least four people and injuring others, officials said. Three people were killed in York County, South Carolina, when a storm swept through a rural area shortly after 6 p.m., according to the York County sheriff's office. Half a dozen homes were destroyed or extensively damaged and five people were taken to hospitals, said Lt. Mike Baker of the sheriff's office. Searchers ""expect to be (at the scene) through the night and through the morning (Thursday). This is considered a search-and-rescue operation at this time,"" Baker told CNN Wednesday night. iReport: Are you there? Please send photos and videos . Sabrina Gast of the York County coroner's office said authorities were ""not sure if the number (of deaths) is going to rise, because we don't know if people were home or not."" Another fatality occurred in Forsyth County, Georgia, when a tree fell on a car, the fire department said. Four people were injured in Mississippi, but their injuries were not critical, according to National Weather Service reports. A possible tornado caused ""major damage"" to a mobile home park near Opelika, Alabama, with homes and vehicles demolished, the weather service said, citing an emergency manager in Lee County. It was not immediately known if anyone was injured. In North Carolina, an apparent tornado in Davidson County south of Winston-Salem damaged ""multiple structures,"" but there were no reports of injuries, according to state emergency management spokeswoman Julia Jarema. Downed trees, damaged homes and buildings, and power outages were reported across north, central and west Alabama and Georgia, including in metro Atlanta, from high winds and possible twisters. Georgia Power said it had 1,975 customers without power -- 594 in metro Atlanta, 1,375 in the Manchester area, and scattered outages elsewhere. A high school in Harris County, Georgia, was also reported damaged. Eastern Alabama's Lee County received ""significant reports of damage,"" said Rita Smith, a public information officer with Lee County Emergency Management. ""We've got reports of damage at an apartment complex, structures at a lake, mobile homes and trees down,"" she said. In Auburn, Alabama, Jim Goldberg told CNN, he and his wife were working at home when warning sirens went off, rain came down so hard it was difficult to see and wind pushed their patio furniture into a neighbor's yard. ""We got into our pantry as quickly as possible at that point,"" he said. ""You could tell something bad was happening out there."" At least half a dozen trees fell on his property and a nearby home's roof was damaged, he said. In the west Alabama city of Demopolis, damage was reported to roofs downtown, and a boat was overturned at a dealership, the National Weather Service reported. In the capital city of Montgomery, trees were reported down in a neighborhood from a possible tornado. Earlier in the day, a suspected tornado in Louisiana's Tangipahoa Parish moved a home with four people inside off its foundation, but no one was hurt, according to the National Weather Service. A possible tornado also touched down near Kentwood, Louisiana, according to parish emergency management authorities. In Terrebonne Parish, near Houma, damage was reported from a suspected tornado at the Houma-Terrebonne Airport, the National Weather Service said. Shingles were blown off a home, and a shed was blown out of a residential yard and onto the grounds of a nearby school. Windows at the school were blown out, the weather service said. A survey of damage is planned for Wednesday. Sharon Henry, principal of Village East Middle School, said five windows at the school were blown out and debris littered the school yard. No one was injured, she said, as the school day had not begun. The windows were being repaired and school was in session Wednesday, she said. Homes were also reported damaged near Jones, Mississippi, about 30 miles northeast of Hattiesburg, the National Weather Service said. In the town of Laurel, Mississippi, three homes were reported damaged with people trapped inside, according to the weather service. Four people with noncritical injuries were taken to a hospital. Power outages were reported in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, the weather service said. The storms were associated with a cold front moving Wednesday across the Southeast. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch for Alabama and portions of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee until 7 p.m. ET. A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for severe thunderstorms and the development of tornadoes.

"(CNN) -- Investigators found the blood of Susan Powell, the mother of two who went missing in 2009, inside the family's Utah home and a handwritten will saying she feared for her life at the hands of her husband, court documents show. The documents, unsealed late Friday, offer a glimpse of the evidence authorities collected that put Powell's husband at the center of the investigation into her December 2009, disappearance. They also raise questions about why he was not arrested prior to killing himself and his two sons in a murder-suicide in February. ""If he had been in jail, our grandchildren would still be alive,"" Chuck Cox, the father of Susan Powell, told Seattle-based CNN affiliate KOMO. Authorities say Josh Powell snatched the two boys -- Braden and Charlie -- from a social worker, who was delivering them for a supervised visit. He locked the doors and killed them and himself moments before his Puyallup, Washington, home exploded. ""Despite these events, Susan Powell is still missing. Her whereabouts, we haven't solved that yet. What happened to her, we still need to work on that,"" West Valley City Police Chief Thayle ""Buzz"" Nielsen told reporters, according to CNN affiliate KSL of Salt Lake City. ""My department is committed to locating Susan and bringing a resolution to this case. That's why it's still active."" The documents used as part of an affidavit to request a search warrant of Josh Powell's Washington home are also tied to a criminal case involving his father, Steven Powell. Josh Powell maintained his innocence in his wife's disappearance until his death. He had said he last saw her on December 6, 2009, after he and his two sons left after midnight to go camping in below-freezing weather in a desert area in Tooele County, Utah. Susan Powell's sister reported her missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to Washington where he moved in with his father. But the documents paint a picture of a man uncooperative with authorities whose story about the night his wife disappeared changed several times. They also reveal that one of the sons, Charlie, told a police investigator that ""his mommy went camping with them, although she did not come back with them and he did not know why,"" the documents said. Weeks later in Washington, Charlie told a teacher that ""my mom is dead."" In the hours after Susan Powell was reported missing, authorities said they found two fans inside the living room sofa that appeared to have just been cleaned. A search of the Powell home found ""blood evidence was located on the tile floor next to the carpet adjacent to the sofa. Forensic tests of this blood indicated it was Susan Powell's,"" the documents said. The documents also reveal authorities found Susan Powell's cell phone in the possession of Josh Powell. The phone was switched off and its portable memory chip, known as a SIM card, was missing, the documents said. ""We believe Josh intentionally removed that SIM card from the cell phone to intentionally thwart investigators,"" said West Valley City Police Sgt. Mike Powell, who is not related to the family. He also later surrendered his cell phone to authorities, who say that phone also had its SIM card removed. During the early days of the investigation, a detective located a safe deposit box that Susan Powell opened at a bank in Salt Lake City. In the box, the detective found a letter that was folded and stapled around the edges. The letter was titled ""Last Will & Testament for Susan Powell."" ""This handwritten document indicates that she did not trust Josh Powell at all,"" Sgt. Powell said. She wrote that her husband had ""threatened to destroy her if they get divorced and her children will not have a mother and father,"" the documents said. It also said, according to the documents, that ""if Susan Powell dies it may not be an accident, even if it looks like one."" The documents also reveal that Susan Powell was terrified of her father-in-law, Steven Powell. Authorities have said they discovered child pornography on the computer of Steven Powell. He was subsequently jailed and charged with 14 counts of voyeurism involving two child victims, and one count of possessing pictures of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct, according to court records.","The blood of Susan Powell was found on tile, court documents say .

"(CNN) -- One of the worst-kept secrets in tech has been confirmed: Apple will hold an event October 23 in San Jose, California, at which the company is widely expected to unveil a smaller, cheaper version of its popular iPad. Apple sent e-mails to members of the press Tuesday that read simply, ""We've got a little more to show you. Please join us for an invitation-only event at the California Theatre in San Jose on October 23 at 10:00 a.m."" Unlike last month's invite to the unveiling of the iPhone 5, which contained a not-so-subtle ""5"" in its graphic, Tuesday's colorful rainbow design offered few hints about what Apple might announce, although the word ""little"" could be a clue. Numerous news reports suggest the secretive company will introduce a 7- or 8-inch version of its popular tablet, which currently has a nearly 10-inch screen when measured diagonally. Apple has not confirmed any of these reports, of course. Nor have they revealed what such a mythical device may be called, which hasn't stopped the tech media from labeling it the ""iPad Mini."" Other details about the rumored tablet remain vague, although some analysts predict it will not have the high-definition ""retina display"" that's on the current iPad. Most observers believe it will be priced under $300. A smaller iPad would allow Apple to compete head-to-head with rival small tablets, such as Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7, that have weakened Apple's domination of the tablet market. Those devices are priced in the $200 range, while Apple's current iPad lineup starts at $399 for last year's iPad 2 and $499 for the third-generation iPad released in March. Tuesday's Apple invite came the same day prices were revealed for Microsoft's upcoming line of Surface tablets, which will start at $499 and hit stores October 26. Some reports also say Apple will introduce other new products at the event, including a 13-inch MacBook Pro with ""retina display"" and an upgraded Mac Mini.","Apple sent invites to members of the press Tuesday for an October 23 event .

"(CNN) -- Brain-eating amoebae were found in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, where a 51-year-old woman died from an infection in 2011, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said. The parish's Waterworks District No. 1 -- one of 14 systems in the parish -- was to flush its system with additional chlorine Wednesday to kill the amoeba, the department said in a release Tuesday. Residents, over the next two months, ""may notice a change in the smell and taste of the water throughout the chlorine burn. However, the water will remain safe to drink,"" the department said. The state selected the district's water for additional testing because of the 2011 death. After the Naegleria fowleri amoeba was detected last month in St. Bernard Parish near New Orleans -- and linked to the August death of a 4-year-old boy -- the state tested DeSoto Parish's water as a precautionary measure. The district serves almost 5,000 customers in DeSoto Parish, which includes the city of Mansfield, south of Shreveport. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the amoeba's presence; there are no known current illnesses reported in the state. ""Families can take simple steps to protect themselves from exposure to this (amoeba), the most important being to avoid allowing water to go up your nose while bathing or swimming in a pool,"" state health officer Jimmy Guidry said in the release. ""It is important to remember that the water is safe to drink; the (amoeba) cannot infect an individual through the stomach."" The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection. They include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the CDC website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" The state released a list of precautions residents could take to lower their risk of infection. Among them: Don't allow water to go up your nose while swimming, bathing or washing your face; lower yourself carefully into tubs and pools to avoid splashing; avoid playing in sprinklers or on Slip 'n Slides; run taps for five minutes before use; use boiled or distilled water for sinus rinse solutions and neti pots; and be sure to keep swimming pools and hot tubs disinfected. Officials say the Mississippi 4-year-old who died in St. Bernard Parish in August had been playing on a homemade waterslide made of a long sheet of plastic when he contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis. In 2011, a woman, 51, in DeSoto Parish and a 20-year-old man near New Orleans died after rinsing their sinuses with neti pots, the Department of Health and Hospitals said. Officials say fewer than 1% of patients survive the deadly brain infection caused by the amoeba, but an experimental drug from the CDC has shown promise in fighting it. Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old in Arkansas, survived after contracting the amoeba in July, possibly at a Little Rock, Arkansas, water park. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and David SImpson contributed to this report.","Brain-eating amoeba found in DeSoto Parish .

"Zanzibar, Tanzania (CNN) -- Two young British women were injured in an acid attack carried out by two men on a motorcycle on the east African island of Zanzibar, local police said Thursday. The women, who were attacked in Stone Town, the island's historic center, had been working as volunteer teachers on the island, travel firm i-to-i Travel said. Stone Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site popular with tourists. The Zanzibar government and a spokesman for the women's families identified the victims as Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup, both 18. The attack occurred Wednesday night as the women were walking unaccompanied along a street, said police Cmdr. Muccadam Khamis. The attackers, who did not take anything from their victims, left the scene on the motorbike, he said. Eyewitnesses said the acid was splashed on the women's faces, chests and hands. The government condemned the attack and vowed to find the perpetrators. ""The event is a great tragedy, and an attack of this nature against a foreign citizen, has never happened here before,"" the Zanzibar government said in a statement. ""The government is appealing to the general public to assist in the arrest of the offenders and is offering a reward of 10 million shillings (about $6,000) to anyone providing information leading to an arrest,"" the statement continued. The government also said it would regulate the purchase of acid and other related products, and warned that such attacks could seriously damage the island's tourism industry, one of its main sources of funds. Police patrols will be stepped up in major tourist spots, officials promised. The women were given first aid treatment at a local medical center before British consular officials helped them reach a hospital in the city of Dar es Salaam, on the Tanzanian mainland, Khamis said. The UK Foreign Office is providing consular assistance and is in contact with the Tanzanian authorities, a spokesman said. Acid attack victim fights for justice . The women, who were in the final week of their trip when they were attacked, have been discharged from the hospital in Dar es Salaam, i-to-i Travel said in a statement. ""The motive for the incident is as yet not known and we will await the report from the local authorities in Zanzibar before any comment can be made,"" a company statement said. Russia's Bolshoi Ballet director may lose sight after acid attack . ""The safety of our customers is of paramount importance to us and our own investigation will be launched as soon as it is possible to do so."" Gee and Trup, both from London, are expected to fly out from Zanzibar on Thursday evening bound for the United Kingdom, the agency said. The women's families asked for privacy until they're reunited with their daughters. ""Both families are extremely upset and distressed about this completely unprovoked attack on their lovely daughters who had only gone to Zanzibar with good intention,"" relatives said in a joint statement. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack but it comes against a backdrop of rising extremist Islamist sentiment in the area. Last month, Tanzanian media reported that a businessman of Arab origin who had built a mall close to the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam was also injured in an acid attack. He is believed to be in South Africa for treatment. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania, a nation of just over 48 million people. According to the CIA World Factbook, the population of Zanzibar is 99% Muslim, while the residents of mainland Tanzania are split roughly evenly among Christian, Muslim and indigenous beliefs. British authorities have said tens of thousands of British holidaymakers travel to Zanzibar every year and that this is the first such incident to affect foreign visitors to the island. i-to-i Travel says it aims to provide young travelers with ""meaningful travel trips"" and life-changing experiences by placing them as volunteers with community projects overseas run by non-governmental organizations. Its website advertises trips lasting from two to eight weeks teaching English in Stone Town. Actress in critical condition after acid attack in Pakistan .

"New York (CNN) -- A year after CNN investigated a California charity that said it was helping veterans, the California Attorney General's office on Friday announced the charity would pay a $2.5 million fine and agree to the resignation of most of its principal officers because it had spent most of its donations on fundraising and what the state called ""excessive compensation"" for its executives. Attorney General Kamala Harris said Help Hospitalized Veterans executives had ""improperly diverted"" donated funds to themselves as well as purchasing country club memberships and in one case a suburban Washington condominium for use of its officers. ""I am pleased that this settlement forces these officials to resign, in addition to paying restitution,"" Harris said in a statement. When CNN investigated Help Hospitalized Veterans in August 2012, it found that most of the donations sent to veterans hospitals around the country amounted to so-called ""craft kits"" for recovering soldiers to use while hospitalized. The kits included instructions for making paper airplanes. Tax returns from Help Hospitalized Veterans showed six-figure salary payments to several of its key officers, including Chief Executive Officer Michael Lynch. At the time, Lynch told CNN in a brief on-camera statement, ""We hope these unproven allegations will not diminish the more than 40 years of service HHV has provided to our nation's most valuable treasure, our veterans. HHV looks forward to the chance to tell its story and we hope this action will not impede its ability to add its support to hospitalized veterans nationwide."" Help Hospitalized Veterans has been the subject of state and federal inquiries for several years. In 2008, a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, spent a day seeking testimony from the charity's founder, Roger Chapin, as well as other Help Hospitalized Veterans executives. Chapin died last month. Waxman told CNN in 2012 that in his view, executives of the charity ""ought to be put in jail"" because of excessive spending. Help Hospitalized Veterans, which is based in Temecula, California, will not close, said Hugh Quinn, the charity's attorney. He said $500,000 of the fine will be paid by the charity. The remaining $2 million will eventually be paid from the estate of Chapin's wife, Quinn said. Lynch will retire after 35 years and will collect a pension of $160,000 per year, Quinn said. Above the law: America's worst charities . In a written statement, Quinn said he saw the fine and settlement as a victory for Help Hospitalized Veterans. ""As long as there's a need, HHV will be there and we're looking forward to reconnecting with veterans and their families and our supporters so that our work continues,"" he said .","California Attorney General says charity ""improperly diverted"" donated funds .

"(CNN) -- Texas health officials are recommending that state residents make sure they're vaccinated against pertussis, a sometimes fatal disease that is on track to sicken more Texans this year than at any time in decades. ""If we continue to have cases in Texas at the rate we've had them so far this year, we'll have more cases than has been reported for the last 50 years,"" said Dr. Carol J. Baker, professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and executive director of the Center for Vaccine Awareness in Research at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. The threat grows when one considers that scientists estimate 10 cases of pertussis, popularly known as whooping cough, occur for every one reported, she said in a telephone interview, adding, ""We're clearly having an epidemic."" So far this year, Texas has tallied nearly 2,000 cases, two of them fatal, and the total is expected to exceed the 3,358 recorded in 2009, when the last such outbreak occurred, the Department of State Health Services said. There does not appear to be any single explanation for the spike, said Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the department. ""It really looks like several things working together,"" he said in a telephone interview, noting that outbreaks tend to occur in cycles. ""We see a peak and a lot of people will be exposed and develop natural immunity,"" leading to fewer cases. ""Then it wears off and it (the number of cases) will go up again."" It is not clear how much bigger this outbreak is when compared with previous ones. That's because increased public awareness and improved diagnostic tests appear to have led to more cases being identified, he said. But there is no debate about the seriousness of the disease. As many as two in 100 adolescents and five in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, including pneumonia and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal health agency recommends that women get the vaccine during each pregnancy, ideally between the 27th and 36th week -- since an estimated 30% to 40% of babies who contract whooping cough get it from their mothers -- and that their children undergo a series of five pertussis vaccinations beginning at 2 months of age. That first shot is to be followed by injections at 4 months and 6 months, and boosters at 15 to 18 months and again at 4 to 6 years of age so that children's immunity will be robust during the first months of life when they are most vulnerable. Both of the Texas fatalities were in children younger than 2 months. ""We want to make sure that they are getting the immunizations on that schedule so that the waning immunity won't be as much of an issue,"" Van Deusen said. A separate vaccine is recommended for children ages 11 to 13 and for adults. It is considered especially important for people who are around newborns since the bacteria that cause the disease spread easily. Antibiotics are used to treat the disease. Texas' peak is not being replicated nationwide, according to the CDC. The numbers are declining this year, with 14,270 cases reported through August, compared with 32,680 cases through August 2012. A CDC spokesman said he was aware of no major outbreaks this year. ""We do not keep a comprehensive list of pertussis outbreaks since states only alert CDC to those if they need assistance,"" said Jason McDonald in an e-mail. But Washington state declared an epidemic last year, and California did so in 2010. ""It's our turn,"" Baker said of Texas. Since January, her hospital in Houston has seen 63 pertussis patients younger than 7 months of age, 62% of whom were hospitalized, she said. Of those, 41% were treated in the intensive care unit, three of them for more than a month. ""It's a very severe disease,"" she said. The younger the patients, the greater the risk to their lungs. ""All those airways are small,"" she said. ""When they're all blocked up, it's a huge problem, and they have to go on breathing machines and sometimes cardiac bypass just to get oxygen into the brain."" The disease can cause coughing so violent that patients' ribs fracture and they pass out. Pertussis got the name whooping cough because of the characteristic sound some stricken patients make. ""Children have a whoop after the cough because they're out of breath, so they go 'whoop, whoop,' "" Baker said. Increasing vaccination rates are a problem, particularly because the series required to confer protection is so complex. Though more than 90% of children nationwide get the first three doses, the number who get boosters is far lower, said Baker, who served from 2008 to 2010 as chair of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which sets U.S. policy on vaccines. In all, 45% of pregnant women at Texas Children's Hospital Pavilion for Women get inoculated during pregnancy, far outstripping the state average of less than 10%, but that's not good enough, she said. ""We need to do better."" During the 1930s and 1940s, before widespread vaccination against pertussis, its annual toll comprised nearly 300,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths, she said. In 2006, there were 15,600 cases and 27 deaths. Still, pertussis is the most prevalent disease among the pantheon of illnesses against which Americans get vaccinated, and there is no indication that it will go away soon, said Baker, who cited as obstacles to progress those parents who refuse the vaccine for their children and those adults who don't know they need it. Though reporters may be writing about Texas this year, they could easily be writing about New York or Georgia next, she said. ""Pertussis is going to be, in my prediction, an ongoing problem.""","Nearly 2,000 pertussis cases have been reported in Texas .
""We're clearly having an epidemic,"" a pediatrics professor says .
Ten cases are estimated to occur for every one that's reported .

"(CNN) -- There's always another strange crustacean out there somewhere. There are blue lobsters and yellow lobsters. Something on YouTube called a Japanese mitten lobster. Giant cannibal shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico and supergiant albino shrimplike creatures off New Zealand. Then there's Lola.

"Paris (CNN) -- Seventeen police officers were injured in violent clashes with young people in the city of Amiens in northern France overnight, Interior Minister Manuel Valls said Tuesday. In addition, three public buildings were badly damaged during several hours of disorder, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. Amiens Mayor Gilles Demailly told BFM that the damage amounted to millions of euros. People were shocked and upset by the violence, he said. Images from the north Amiens neighborhood showed burned-out cars and the charred wreckage of a kindergarten and a sports center. Clashes were reported in the same area Sunday night, BFM reported. The latest violence, involving about 100 young people, broke out late Monday evening and carried into early Tuesday. The police officers were injured with buckshot, fireworks and projectiles, BFM reported. Police responded with tear gas but made no arrests. Speaking at a news conference in Amiens, Valls said that the violence shown toward police was ""unacceptable"" and that law and order must be restored. More security forces would be deployed Tuesday night to ensure there was no repeat of the trouble, he said. Valls said those suffering most from the disorder were the residents of the neighborhood affected. The area had already been designated a ""high security zone"" because of drug trafficking and other problems, he said, meaning extra resources were to be used there. A local resident told BFM the community was angered Sunday when police carried out an ""aggressive"" traffic stop as a funeral was being held for a young man killed in a road accident last week. Sabrina Hadji, a sister of the victim, said police fired shots as people -- including women, children and the elderly -- were gathered for the ceremony. The community is tired of being treated without respect and ""like animals,"" she told BFM, and a silent march was organized as an expression of ""anger because we are never listened to."" Valls acknowledged there is tension between police and the community after the incident and said an inquiry has been ordered into the police operation. However, nothing excused violence directed at police and the torching of public buildings, he said. Valls said he had not come to Amiens to point the finger at anyone, but the rule of law must be followed. After the initial unrest Sunday, the mayor appealed for ""calm, respect and dialogue"" in a statement on the official website for Amiens, a city of about 130,000 people. Demailly urged communication between police and residents, saying it is important they have confidence in each other. Earlier Tuesday, Valls traveled with President Francois Hollande to the Var area, in southeastern France, to pay tribute to two women police officers who were killed in the line of duty in June, BFM reported. Hollande addressed the trouble in Amiens, saying that public security is ""not just a priority, but an obligation"" for authorities. More must be done to prevent and punish violence, delinquency and criminality, he told reporters. Hollande, who was sworn in as president three months ago, said the next budget would include additional resources for policing, after years of cutbacks. France has been shaken by unrest in poorer urban areas on several occasions in recent years, notably in 2005, when the deaths of two young men of North African descent sparked weeks of rioting.

"(CNN) -- PGA star Hunter Mahan chose family over work this weekend, and though it may have cost him more than $1 million, he sounds ecstatic. ""What a whirlwind of a day,"" Mahan tweeted Sunday morning, ""but I'm happy to announce the birth of my daughter Zoe Olivia Mahan born at 3:26 am. Thanks for all the support! ""Both Baby and Mom are doing great. Thanks to all to my sponsors who appreciate what's important in life and all my fans for being Awesome!"" he added in a second tweet. Mahan was halfway to his sixth career PGA Tour tournament victory, with a two-shot lead after Friday's second round of the RBC Canadian Open at Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, Ontario. But after receiving a call early Saturday that his wife, Kandi, had gone into labor, he withdrew from the tournament and flew home to Dallas to be present for the birth of the couple's first child rather than continuing to pursue the $1.008 million first prize. ""Kandi and I are thrilled about this addition to the Mahan family, and we look forward to returning to the RBC Canadian Open in the coming years,"" Mahan said Saturday, according to PGATOUR.Com. Mahan has made more than $2.3 million already in 2013, with four Top 10 finishes this year, including a tie for fourth place at the U.S. Open and a tie for ninth place at the British Open over the past two months, PGATOUR.com says.

"Paris (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Saudi Arabia will support military intervention in Syria by the United States and its partners. ""They have supported the strike and they support taking action,"" Kerry said after a long meeting of Arab League ministers originally called to discuss the Mideast peace initiative. ""They believe that it's very important to do that."" Kerry told reporters he had a very good side meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, and Saudi Arabia was one of the countries to sign on to a statement condemning the reported use of chemical weapons last month by the Syrian military against rebels. Saudi Arabia is a diplomatic heavyweight in the Arab world but hasn't publicly called for an international military reprisal after the incident. With its vast air force and bases, Saudi Arabia could offer a lot of resources to Western militaries. But it's not expected to participate directly in any attack on Syria, because that would be likely to inflame a widespread Arabian Peninsula antipathy against Western military forces intruding into Arab affairs. Kerry also said the Arab League ministers unanimously condemned the August 21 incident. ""As we discussed today, all of us agreed -- not one dissenter -- that (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad's deplorable use of chemical weapons -- which we know killed hundreds of innocent people, including at least 426 children on this occasion, this one occasion -- this crosses an international, global red line,"" he said. He said the foreign ministers discussed the ""possible and necessary measures"" needed to deter al-Assad from using chemical weapons again. Kerry said a ""number of countries immediately signed on"" to an agreement reached by 12 countries on the side at the recent G20 summit. And while he named Saudi Arabia as one of those nations, he said the others that had agreed to help would make their announcements in the next day. The statement called for a ""strong international response"" and ""supports efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons."" It did not expressly endorse military action, although U.S. officials said the nations who signed it interpreted the statement as tacit support for strikes. The Syrian government has denied being behind chemical weapons attacks, which it blames on rebels. Al-Assad on Sunday denied again he had anything to do with the use of chemical agents, U.S. journalist Charlie Rose reported. The PBS anchor and CBS ""This Morning"" co-host said al-Assad told him during an interview to be broadcast Monday that Syria was prepared to retaliate if there was a military strike by the United States and its partners. ""It doesn't surprise us that someone who would kill thousands of his own people, including hundreds of children, with poison gas would also lie about it,"" a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, said. Al-Assad's rare interview with U.S. media comes as U.S. President Barack Obama lobbies Congress and the country to support military action. Congress officially returns to Washington Monday after a monthlong summer recess to debate and vote on a resolution giving Obama the authorization to take military action. The president will go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday and make his case to Senate Democrats, a Senate leadership aide said Sunday. Obama will also address the nation on Syria Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET from the White House. Videos that purport to show the results of a chemical weapons attack are part of a White House campaign to inform Congress about the nature of the incident, Kerry said. ""The reason for this is to make sure everybody understands what is at stake,"" he said. ""Those videos make it clear to people that these are real human beings, real children, parents being affected in ways that are unacceptable to anybody, anywhere, by any standard."" He said a vast majority of the members are undecided as to how they will vote on authorizing force against Syria. Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohamed al-Attiyah appeared at the news conference with Kerry. ""Qatar is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people,"" he said, according to a translator. Kerry met later with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in London on Sunday. Britain's Parliament has ruled out getting militarily involved in Syria, but Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to continue to push for a tough response against the al-Assad regime. Kerry's efforts with European allies paralleled those of his boss, Obama, who tried to rally members of the G20 in St. Petersburg, Russia, last week. Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg summit Friday. But despite both saying the talks were constructive, there was no sign of consensus. CNN's Elise Labott reported from Paris. CNN's Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- In recent weeks, Sen. Rand Paul galvanized the nation with a 13-hour filibuster, became the toast of the Conservative Political Action Conference and embraced immigration reform before the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. It's naive to think that a few speeches can reshape the Republican Party, but Paul may well represent a tectonic shift on the American right. The junior senator from Kentucky has a vision of the Constitution in full, advocating the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms and the Fourth Amendment's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. He's for civil liberties -- to protect against police abuse or presidential drones, as well as economic liberties and the freedom to run a business without unnecessary regulation. And he wants to give the blessings of those liberties to those who come to America in search of a better life. Rand Paul has some ideas for Republicans . As a libertarian and a traditional conservative, we disagree with Paul on a number of issues. Yet we both see his constitutional conservatism as auguring a future in which social tolerance, fiscal temperance and a humbler role for government are pursued not as ends in themselves but because that's the best path. Conservatives ""conserve"" society by reacting to the excesses of previous generations, but the issues that prompt the reactions vary according to the times. Even the solutions to the same problems may shift with new information and reflection. National Review founder William F. Buckley, a key figure in the modern conservative movement, famously changed his mind about civil rights, the drug war and even Iraq. Conservatives started the environmental movement with Theodore Roosevelt's protection of national parks at a time when natural resources were plundered without regard to public health. But now, environmentalists abuse the Endangered Species Act to protect salamanders at the expense of jobs and the Clean Water Act's wetlands protections to prevent development. Similarly, conservatives argued for larger police and military forces in response to crime and communism, but now that cost is part of our fiscal problem. Opinion: Rand Paul is right . Modern conservatives need to remember these lessons as they consider the future. Their predecessors were largely successful in defeating communism, liberalizing the economy and reducing crime. But those policies weren't perfect (or cheap): the crime-fighting of the 1980s and '90s, with an emphasis on policing and incarceration, contributed to current problems such as unfunded pensions, bloated government unions and overcrowded prisons. After the election losses in 2012, some Republicans have advocated a need to change. In comes Rand Paul, who may well be on the leading edge of a new conservatism, which will focus on four areas: . 1. Its social policy will focus primarily on protecting freedom of conscience in an increasingly pluralistic society, while undoing the excesses of the drug war and punitive sentencing for nonviolent crime. For example, as the country moves toward acceptance of same-sex marriage, some states have restricted the ability of Catholic charities to continue functioning without violating key religious tenets. People may disagree on moral issues, but a nation where religious charities can't operate is a far worse place. 2. This new conservatism will align with the ideas of governors such as Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who are fighting battles for domestic policy reform. At stake are the power of public-sector unions and the future of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. The challenge is to fix our fiscal woes while protecting the vulnerable in society, as religious conservatives understand is required by their faith. Without fiscal temperance, as well as education reform and a better regulatory environment, there will neither be the opportunity for social mobility nor resources for a social safety net, public or private. 3. We also need to unwind our military engagements while maintaining flexibility in a rapidly changing world. Numbers don't lie, and our debt and deficits demand a reduction in military spending. Conservatives should aim to achieve the necessary reductions in a smart fashion that maintains readiness and doesn't endanger America's interests. This will be a challenging balancing act, but it should be driven by strategic concerns rather than arbitrary benchmarks. 4. Finally, conservatives should consider comprehensive immigration reform that would allow skilled and unskilled workers to seek their American dream while granting parole, not amnesty, to those hard-working migrants now here illegally. Paul, Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP . This recipe may not be the ""ideal"" that conservative pundits would like to see, and it doesn't necessarily reflect our utmost individual preferences, but it reflects the practical realities of this age. Rand Paul hasn't (yet) changed conservatism, but his views will shape the movement's future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilya Shapiro and Francisco Gonzalez.","Ilya Shapiro, Francisco Gonzalez: Rand Paul may represent a shift in conservatism .
Shapiro, Gonzalez: Paul has a vision of the Constitution in full, which is promising .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Johnson once told me something surprising about her famous partnership with Dr. William Masters, which helped revolutionize America's understanding of human sexuality. Despite Masters and Johnson's worldwide fame, ""We were absolutely the two most secretive people on the face of the Earth,"" she said. ""There's simply no one who knew us well. People have a lot of speculation, but they don't know."" On Thursday, as I read the obituaries about Johnson's death at age 88, I was reminded of Virginia's words. There's a sense of marvel about her life story and how she managed to affect the lives and happiness of so many people, especially independent-minded women like herself who wanted to make their own decisions about sex outside the dictates of men. Johnson's life seems like a modern-day Pygmalion story. Down on her luck, a twice-divorced women and with two kids, she went back to Washington University at age 32 looking for a degree. She was working as a secretary at the university-affiliated hospital in St. Louis when she met Masters, the top ob-gyn and fertility expert in town. A hard-driving, ambitious physician, Masters wanted very much to win a Nobel Prize for documenting clinically just how the human body responded during sex, so that medicine could come up with effective treatments for married couples having troubles in the bedroom. Bill realized he needed a female partner for such a risky venture. The few female doctors around in the 1950s didn't want to go near his potentially explosive experiment that could bring career ruin. Not even Masters' wife -- with two young children at home in the suburbs -- wanted to get involved. Virginia changed everything. Almost immediately she showed a native genius for what made men and women tick, sexually and in matters of the heart. First as a dutiful associate and eventually as the full-fledged partner to Masters, Johnson convinced dozens of women and men -- nurses, residents, graduate students and various people around St. Louis -- to become part of their secretive decade-long study, the biggest sex experiment in U.S. history. Their work was published in 1966 in ""Human Sexual Response,"" which outlined, in its own obtuse medicalese, just how the body worked during sex. Like cartographers, they mapped how each body part vibrated, sweated and became aroused during lovemaking. Without Virginia Johnson's extraordinary zeal and persuasiveness, Masters conceded their study would have failed. To his everlasting credit, Bill gave ""Gini"" credit for her remarkable contributions, far more than any male doctor in the 1950s would have done, sharing his byline with her on their first book. Time would underline Johnson's impact even more. Despite their guarded language, the first book documented the power of female sexuality, showing that women were capable of multiple orgasms -- a veritable fireworks display -- compared to most men's single firecracker. Their clinical evidence became part of the spark for America's so-called sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, reflected in everything from key feminist writings to Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. Even the rosy women's magazines, filled with recipes and homey bromides, began writing about sex, using the same clinical phrases that Masters and Johnson made acceptable in polite society. But Virginia's impact became particularly evident in the duo's second book, 1970's ""Human Sexual Inadequacy,"" which landed them on the cover of Time magazine and television talk shows. It was Virginia who largely developed the team's ""sensate"" therapy from a hodgepodge of influences -- including behaviorism, Freudian talking methods and even urology studies from other medical researchers -- that soon had couples flocking to their clinic for a cure for their sexual difficulties. That a woman without a degree had come up with such an effective approach heralding a quintessentially America quick-fix -- an 80% success rate within a mere two weeks (as opposed to years on a Viennese analysts' couch talking about your feelings about poor old Mother!) -- was galling to the medical establishment. Yet Masters and Johnson's pioneering work created the modern sex therapy industry, with clinics around the world relying on their methods and wisdom to this day. Later in life, Virginia would say her 24/7 devotion to her research and their patients hurt both her relationship with her children and her marriage with Masters (they divorced in the 1990s shortly before their clinic closed) --expressing this with the same regret some women today share in balancing work and family life. She was also concerned that their pioneering work on sex might be used by libertines to avoid the necessity of caring for their partners as real, loving human beings, rather than pornographic holograms in the bedroom. But mostly, Johnson became aware that many younger women today had adopted her independent-mindedness about sex, once so verboten in 1950s America. Only they, and not some fatherly figure in a white lab coat, would rule their bodies and set the terms for when, how and with whom they would share themselves. Johnson's remarkable personal and professional adventures make her one of the most extraordinary American women of the 20th century. Her passing should remind us of just how great an impact her life had on all of us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Maier.","Thomas Maier: Virginia Johnson, who has died, helped women take control of their sexuality .
From modest beginnings, she partnered with William Masters on revolutionary sex research .

"(CNN) -- When Dustin Bockman, his younger brother Ryan and their friend Cole Landers put their 17-foot boat into the Big Black River last weekend about 20 minutes from where they live in Vicksburg, Mississippi, they had no clue that they would soon be caught up in an hours-long battle against a record-setting alligator. ""We put the boat in at 8 o'clock on Saturday night and we got back to the dock with the alligator about 9:30 a.m. Sunday,"" the 27-year-old UPS driver told CNN in a telephone interview. It was a long night. Bockman had been one of 920 people picked from 27,000 applicants to participate in the state's 10-day alligator season. His selection and his $100 license gave him the right to catch two alligators -- one of any size, and a medium-size one. Though they'd never hunted alligators before, the men were well equipped: a bright light to illuminate their quarry's eyes, which typically sit just above the surface of the water, a crossbow attached to a 150-pound fishing line, a deep-sea fishing pole with a snagging hook, a shotgun, Mountain Dew and root beer. During the first few hours, they saw plenty of alligators, but passed them by. ""I wanted to get an alligator 10 feet or better,"" he said. Texas teen bags state-record-sized alligator . About 1 a.m., they found one that fit the bill. ""We didn't realize how big it was, we just knew it was big,"" he said. Under the rules of the lottery, hunters are not allowed to shoot alligators in open water, he said. ""You have to get a line on them."" That wasn't easy. Each time they approached the alligator, he submerged, only to pop up a few minutes later dozens of yards away. Finally, after about two hours, Bockman -- an experienced hunter -- shot him with the crossbow, striking him in the back. The line was attached to a homemade buoy -- made with a 3-liter water jug containing bells and glow sticks ""so when it took off you could hear and see it at nighttime."" A few minutes later, they got a second line on the gator with the fishing pole, and the animal took off, sinking to the river bottom and sitting -- for up to 20 minutes at a time -- as the three men tried repeatedly to pull him to the surface. ""It was like trying to pull up a tree."" Finally, another two hours later, success: ""My buddy grabbed the boat fishing line and pulled him to the top,"" Bockman said. But by then, the fishing line had caught around a tree, so they cut it. That meant their only connection to the alligator was the buoy line. Another 90 minutes or so later, they used the buoy line to pull the alligator to the surface and tried to cover his head with a snare. ""It's like a noose -- you put it around his neck and, when you pull it up, it tightens up."" But the animal's head was about two feet long and bigger than the snare could accommodate. ""When we pulled it tight, he went to fighting, then broke the bow fishing line. All we had was the snare,"" which was not firmly in place. At that, Bockman stuck the barrel of his Remington 1100 20-gauge shotgun into the water, aimed it at the soft spot on the back of the animal's head and pulled the trigger. In an instant, the longtime hunter learned a lesson in physics. ""The gun barrel peeled back like a banana peel,"" he said. ""The gas can't escape at the end of the barrel (under water). I didn't know that before, but now I do. It was pretty crazy. I thought they'd gave me the wrong bullets."" It was still useable, however, and two more shots finished the job, which left them with another challenge. Knee-deep in mud, the three men tried to load their catch into the War Eagle boat, but discovered after much pulling and pushing that they couldn't, so they called for reinforcements. ""We just pulled him over to a sandbar and waited for daylight so we could call some people to help us load him."" On Sunday morning, two of their friends arrived and helped them pull the alligator into the boat. It was only then that they realized they had bagged a big one. But they had forgotten to bring a tape measure, so they were reduced to guessing its size. ""We didn't realize until we took him back to my buddy's house and took him out of the boat with a tractor and put a tape measure on him that we needed to go get him weighed for a state record,"" he said. Here are the official measurements: 13 feet 4.5 inches long, 727.0 pounds. Its belly girth measured 67 inches and its tail measured 45.5 inches in girth. Officials estimated its age at 50 to 60 years. Their catch beat out the state's previous record winner in the weight category, which had been set just an hour earlier by a hunting party led by Beth Trammell of Madison, Mississippi. That gator's 723.5 pounds and 13 feet, 5.5 inches had broken the previous weight record of 697.5 pounds. The current length record is 13 feet 6.5 inches, set by an alligator taken on the Pascagoula River in 2008. Bockman has stored his prize catch in a deer processor's walk-in cooler. He plans to keep some of the meat, give away most of it to friends, then get the hide tanned, mount the head and the mushroomed gun barrel on a plaque and display it to his friends. But he has no illusions that his record will last long. ""They could break my record tonight,"" he said. ""There's bigger alligators out there."" And he need not worry about the restriction on size. Bockman's brother Ryan also won the lottery, granting him the right to bag an even bigger animal when they go out again later this week. In Florida, gator takes bite out of crime -- and man .","Each time they approached, the alligator submerged, Dustin Bockman says .

"(CNN) -- The outrage is clear, but the impact on Rolling Stone's bottom line is not. As some retailers refuse to sell the latest issue, featuring a controversial photo of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover, it seems inevitable that some people who might have picked up a copy now won't. But any immediate loss could be minuscule for Rolling Stone overall. And recent history suggests that the frenzy could ultimately help move copies. ""It is absolutely impossible to predict what newsstands sales are going to be,"" Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told NPR after the anger erupted. ""... It's something you have to be mindful of, but at the same time, put out of your mind on a case-by-case basis. ...We really go with our gut on these things, usually."" While the focus has largely been on newsstand sales, they account for only a tiny portion of the magazine's overall circulation. Rolling Stone's circulation is 95% subscription, accounting for about 1.4 million copies. The remaining 5%, about 75,000 copies, comes from individual sales. Rolling Stone did not immediately respond Tuesday to a CNN request for information on how the latest issue is selling. Support swells for trooper who released photos in response to Rolling Stone .

One had ""phallic cover art"" about hedge funds; another, about airline mergers, was ""illustrated by an image of two planes seemingly having sex."" Opinion: Rolling Stone is right, the backlash is wrong . The ""more buzzy covers"" have lifted sales by up to 70% above yearly average, an official with Bloomberg Businessweek told Ad Age.

The issue went on to sell slightly above average, according to Ad Age. Rolling Stone sales: a mixed picture . Some critics call the Rolling Stone cover a desperate effort to boost sales. Rolling Stone's circulation has stayed relatively steady, edging slightly upward, in recent years.

"Washington (CNN) -- What a difference a decade makes. When George W. Bush and Dick Cheney led the United States to war in Iraq over the issue of chemical weapons 11 years ago, they had the support of all but six of the majority Republicans in the House of Representatives. Now there are three times as many Republicans on the record against a strike on Syria. U.S. Senate: How they'll vote on Syria strike . U.S. House: How they'll vote on Syria strike . Bush has declined to weigh in on Syria and Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, running for U.S. Senate in a tough primary challenge against fellow Republican Mike Enzi in Wyoming, has come out against Obama's plan to strike Syria. Cheney told a town hall meeting in Wyoming on Tuesday that Obama has taken ""an amateurish approach to national security and foreign policy,"" according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide. Cheney also said her opposition to intervention should not be misconstrued. ""The press will try to portray this Syria debate as a battle between wings of the Republican Party,"" she said, according to the newspaper. ""Don't believe them."" But there's a lot of evidence that there is a battle going on in the GOP. Start with Cheney, who has defended her father's involvement in the lead-up to the Iraq war and who, before she was a Senate candidate, talked about the need for red lines in Syria. If Obama wants to lead the United States against Syria this year to ward off the spread of chemical weapons, he'll have to do it in spite of a Republican House, not with its help. Senate panel backs military strike plan . What happened between now and then? War -- 11 years of it in Afghanistan and Iraq. Those wars are not popular with Americans and neither is the prospect of military strikes within Syria. Two polls out Wednesday from ABC News/The Washington Post and from Pew showed opposition to military strikes far outweighed support. Polls: Should U.S. launch strikes against Syria? There are stalwart security-minded Republicans who beat the drum and argue the United States should lead the international community against bad actors. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the party's standard-bearer in 2008, has been the single most vocal lawmaker in favor of U.S. military action against Syria. McCain, Graham issue tough warnings on Syria dilemma . Borger: Obama's irony, McCain's agony . But most of the convincing he'll have to do is among his own party, which rode the war on terror into Iraq on the premise of weapons of mass destruction. When McCain ran for president, he easily defeated Rep. Ron Paul of Texas in the primaries and at times he laughed off Paul's noninterventionist approach to foreign policy. McCain isn't laughing now at Paul's son, Rand, the Kentucky Republican and potential 2016 presidential candidate who shares many of his father's noninterventionist views and is organizing the effort against a strike on Syria. Paul to Obama: Don't rush into war in Syria . The first test vote on Capitol Hill came Wednesday when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 10-7 in favor of the president's proposal. That's a margin close enough to raise questions about whether the proposal will have enough support to get beyond a filibuster. Five of the committee's Republicans, including Paul, voted no. McCain joined the majority of Democrats in voting yes. A number of Republican leaders have joined the call for military strikes, including House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor, the top Republicans in the House. But they're just two of eight Republicans in the House to publicly endorse military action. Other voices in the party are growing louder in their opposition. Sarah Palin, who defended the war in Iraq as McCain's running mate in 2008, posted a Facebook message on Syria that declared Americans should just let ""Allah sort it out."" Obeidallah: Palin's offensive remarks about Syria . Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, has questions about the motives of the Syrian opposition fighting against the government there. He said the airstrikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would turn the U.S. military into ""al Qaeda's Air Force."" Certainly, there are Democrats who opposed the war in Iraq who are now arguing for intervention in Syria. Both Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Barbara Boxer of California voted against the resolution in 2002 that gave Bush the authority to invade Iraq. They both supported Obama on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. John Kerry, the secretary of state making Obama's case this week, came to regret his own vote in favor of invading Iraq. Now he finds himself arguing that the use of chemical weapons in Syria requires that the United States takes action. But the story of foreign policy transformation here seems more definitive on the Republican side. Nowhere is that tension more obvious than with Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican and another potential 2016 presidential candidate, who seems torn between McCain and Paul on the issue. Rubio has long been critical of the Obama administration on Syria and called for more support of the rebel factions struggling to topple Assad. But Rubio ended up voting against giving the president war powers on Wednesday even as he said Obama should have done much more earlier. ""While I have long argued forcefully for engagement in empowering the Syrian people, I have never supported the use of U.S. military force in the conflict. And I still don't. I remain unconvinced that the use of force proposed here will work,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Confirming earlier rumors, Apple launched a new program Friday that will allow customers to trade in old iPhones at U.S. Apple stores for credit towards a newer model. Apple already has an online recycling program that lets users trade older iPhones for credit on an Apple gift card. This new nationwide program lets customers bring their phones into stores for a discount on a new handset -- most likely the next iPhone, expected to go on sale next month -- provided the new phone comes with a wireless contract. You may want to hold off until Apple makes its latest iPhone announcements so you're not stuck with last season's model. The company is widely expected to unveil two new iPhones at an event on September 10. ""iPhones hold great value. So, Apple Retail Stores are launching a new program to assist customers who wish to bring in their previous-generation iPhone for reuse or recycling,"" said Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette in a statement. ""In addition to helping support the environment, customers will be able to receive a credit for their returned phone that they can use toward the purchase of a new iPhone."" According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and 9to5 Mac, the most Apple will credit someone for an old device is $280, and the store credit needs to be used on a new iPhone. Apple's Reuse and Recycling programs are not new, but they seem to get renewed attention every August, just ahead of September iPhone announcements. A version of program has been available through Apple.com for years. After answering some questions about the state of a device, you can trade eligible computers, iPhones, iPads and iPods for Apple store credit. The new in-store program will be operated via a third-party re-seller, Brightstar (the online recycling program is run through PowerOn). Prices may vary between in-store and online trade-ins, although there are fewer limitations with Apple's online option. You get store credit that can be used towards any product, and no contract is necessary. Right now, a top of the line, mint-condition iPhone 5 can net $406 in Apple store credit. Before handing your old device over to Apple, check all your options to make sure you're getting the best price. Carriers including AT&T and Verizon also offer store credit in exchange for old iPhones and other smartphones. Sites like Gazelle and NextWorth will also give a free quote for selling old iPhones, and they pay in cash that you can use on another iPhone, a rival model or a fancy dinner. To determine how much your old smartphone is worth, Apple and the other companies will ask if it's had any water damage (thanks to a small sensor in the headphone jack, they can tell if you're lying), make sure everything is working properly and check the exterior for scratches and other flaws. If you have patience, eBay and Craigslist can also bring in good prices for old devices. Or, if you're feeling charitable, there are nonprofit organizations that accept iPhone donations.","iPhone users now can trade in old models at Apple stores for credit on a new phone .

"Lakeside, California (CNN) -- Days after being rescued in the Idaho wilderness when an FBI agent shot her abductor dead, 16-year-old Hannah Anderson attended a fundraiser Thursday for her and her family near their Southern California home. The teenager could be seen entering the Boll Weevil restaurant in Lakeside, a community of about 20,000 people located 20 miles northeast of San Diego. Hannah didn't speak publicly before entering the building, though her father later did talk to reporters. The media were invited to the fundraiser at the family-friendly restaurant but were not allowed inside. ""This is a small community that we are a part of, and the community came together putting on this great fundraiser for Hannah and hopefully for her future and healing,"" Brett Anderson said, before he thanked local residents, family and friends, the media and law enforcement. ""This is how Lakeside rolls."" Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice in San Diego County, California, on August 3. The next day, the bodies of her mother, 42-year-old Christina Anderson, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east in the burned Boulevard house of James DiMaggio, who had been considered a friend of the Anderson family. Affidavits: Teen's mother, brother 'tortured and killed' That horror spurred a manhunt, which zeroed in on central Idaho after two critical clues: the discovery of DiMaggio's blue Nissan Versa outside the city of Cascade and a sighting of the pair by horseback riders. Affidavits: Teen's mother, brother 'tortured and killed' One of the horsemen recalled noticing multiple ""red flags"" during their brief interaction with the pair, including their brand-new camping equipment and the pajama-like bottoms Hannah was wearing. Brett Anderson said Thursday that he'd been able to offer ""our thanks and our love"" to the horseback riders in a phone conversation. ""It was a chance encounter, but it did save my daughter's life,"" he said Thursday. The dramatic ordeal ended last Saturday, after authorities spotted DiMaggio and his teenage captive's campsite near Morehead Lake. Hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene, local sheriffs' departments said. Eventually, they got close enough, and an FBI tactical agent fatally shot DiMaggio, before whisking Hannah away. California teen rescued, her alleged abductor killed . Speaking Thursday about her condition, Brett Anderson said ""she's just happy to be here."" ""Hannah sends her love,"" her father said. ""She's doing good day by day, and we'll keep moving forward from here."" One of her friends, Alyssa Haugum, said from outside Thursday's fundraiser that she was looking forward to seeing Hannah in person and giving her a hug. They had communicated via Facebook, she said. Haugum described Hannah, whom she knows from school and dance, as strong, funny and ""usually really bubbly."" ""It takes a lot to make her upset,"" she said of her friend. The entire ordeal was surreal and scary, as it hit so close to home, Haugum said. ""It just felt like it was untrue: One day somebody could be with you, and the next day they are missing and you don't know where they're at,"" Haugum said. Then, alluding to her friend Hannah, she added, ""But I knew she was strong. I knew she would come back."" Hannah Anderson discusses kidnapping on social media .

"(CNN) -- I'll take saddest Jeopardy misspelling ever for $3,000, Alex. Social media is still howling after last week's perceived slight of eighth-grader Thomas Hurley III and his misspelling of ""Emancipation"" during Kids Week on ""Jeopardy!"" Thomas knew the answer to the Final Jeopardy question: Abraham Lincoln called this document, which took effect in 1863, ""a fit and necessary war measure."" But the 12-year-old Connecticut boy added an extra ""t"" to his answer: emanciptation proclamation. Host Alex Trebek said Thomas ""misspelled it badly."" ""That's unfortunate,"" he said. ""The judges are ruling against you."" Teen gives greatest 'Jeopardy!' question ever . Thomas, who was in second place with $9,600 in winnings, had wagered $3,000 on the answer. He hung his head. ""The thing that bothered me most was the way Alex Trebek and the producers treated my son. They were kind of smug,"" his father, Thomas Hurley II, told CNN on Sunday night. ""It's a kids' tournament! Everyone knew what he meant."" The show was recorded in February, but aired Wednesday. Hurley said his son ""was barely holding it together, he was almost in tears. He had to relive it on Wednesday."" Watch: I Lost on Jeopardy . Jeopardy producers stood by their decision. ""If Jeopardy! were to give credit for an incorrect response (however minor), the show would effectively penalize the other players. We love presenting young people as contestants on our show, and make every effort to be fair and consistent in their treatment."" Right or wrong, the younger Hurley still would not have won. He ran into a buzz saw of a competitor in Skyler Hornback, who set the all-time record for kids with $66,600. Skyler's haul was also the third-largest one-day total in the game's history. For placing second, Thomas took home $2,000. The Internet was not amused. ""I used to love Jeopardy, but how Alex treated that kid and embarrassed him was uncalled for,"" Luke Tran said in a post on the Jeopardy! Facebook page. ""He called him out on his spelling saying it was badly misspelled when it wasn't that badly misspelled it was just misspelled slightly."" Some questioned the point of the game show. ""Jeopardy is not a spelling bee game and frankly before Alex Trebek or the judges penalize this boy for not spelling a word correctly then Alex trebek needs too explain too the contestants that spelling matters in the final around,"" Ash Cruz Rios-James also said on Facebook. A healthy back-and-forth ensued with those who found the show made the right call. ""Bravo Jeopardy!"" said David Sneen on Twitter. ""If you were to give credit for a misspelled answer...how close would the spelling need to be?"" Facebook user Jan Manire put it in perspective: ""Am sorry Thomas feels that he was 'cheated' because of misspelling.

"(CNN) -- For the first few moments of her life, Veronica was with her birth mother. For the next two years, she was with her adoptive parents. And for the last week, the toddler has been with her biological father, over 1,000 miles away from the only home she'd ever known. It's been a long, complicated journey for young Veronica -- one made possible by a federal law meant ""to protect the best interests of Indian children"" that, in the process, has tugged at the heartstrings of all involved. The story began in 2009, when Veronica's biological mother and father, Dusten Brown, signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption. Brown's attorney, Shannon Jones, says that her client signed the waiver but didn't quite understand it. Soon after the girl was born, Brown -- a U.S. Army soldier -- headed off on a 1-year deployment. It was then that the baby moved on as well, to the Charleston, South Carolina, home of Matt and Melanie Capobianco. It was an open adoption, family friend Jessica Munday said. That meant the girl's birth mother could and did maintain a relationship with the girl. But Brown, the biological father, wasn't on board. Four months after Veronica's birth, he began legal proceedings seeking custody of her. ""My client has been fighting for custody of his daughter since shortly after her birth,"" Shannon Jones, Brown's Charleston-based lawyer, said by e-mail. ""He loves this child with all his heart."" Brown appeared to win that battle late last year. On New Year's Eve, he arrived in South Carolina, picked up Veronica from her adoptive parents, and headed west to his home in Oklahoma. ""It's awful,"" Matt Capobianco said days later to CNN affiliate WCIV. ""Everyone keeps saying how bad they feel for us. But, I mean, she's a 2-year-old girl that got shoved in a truck and driven to Oklahoma -- with strangers."" Key to Brown's case is a 1978 federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act. Its aim is to ""promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings."" Brown is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation, a ""federally-recognized government"" of Indians that has ""inherent sovereign status,"" based near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. That means young Veronica has Indian blood, as well. Chrissi Ross Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation, says that the protections inherent in the Child Welfare Act are clear and important. Applied as she sees it, Brown -- as an Indian and the biological father of Veronica -- is entitled to custody of the girl. ""There's a placement preference. If children are removed by the state or if they're placed in private adoption, the first preference is for a family member,"" Nimmo told CNN affiliate KOTV. Others disagree. CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman, for one, said the law was misused in this case. ""It's a wonderful law which seeks to protect the integrity of ... Native American families,"" she said. ""But it cannot be used as a bludgeon to destroy existing families."" Jones insists that Brown ""would still be entitled to custody of his daughter under South Carolina law."" ""It is important to understand that the Indian Child Welfare Act was not used as a loophole in this action,"" the lawyer said. Whatever the legal arguments, the emotions are still raw. The Capobiancos have spoken to Veronica once since she left, on New Year's Day. ""She said, 'Hi Mommy! Hi Daddy! She sounded really excited to hear us. And she said, 'I love you!' numerous times,"" Melanie Capobianco told WCIV. She added that her husband felt like he'd failed as a father, sending her off with people she didn't know and not knowing what the little girl must think of them and the whole situation. Melanie Capobianco said she is worried about what's next, and how Veronica is getting through each day and night. ""We just wish we could be there, if she was afraid,"" she said.","A Cherokee Indian man wins custody of his 2-year-old biological daughter .

"London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child who will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . • As the wait for the royal baby continues, so does the debate over the Duchess of Cambridge's actual due date. Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports Friday, citing ""well-placed sources,"" that medical staff at St. Mary's Hospital -- where Catherine is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was July 19. • A royal source told CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. Why are some babies overdue? • The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born, as was his brother Harry. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. • Could the world's media be camped outside the wrong hospital, though? The Telegraph reported that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical. • There's no doubting the media interest in the royal birth. The Sun newspaper is streaming live video of the entrance to the Lindo Wing, as is Stylist magazine. The days-long vigil outside the hospital has also inspired a spew of #GreatKateWait tweets from the waiting media pack -- as rounded up by New York Magazine. • One person who won't be at the Lindo Wing is Home Secretary Theresa May. Asked by a fellow lawmaker whether she would be attending the royal birth, as was formerly customary, she replied: ""In fact, it is no longer the case that the home secretary is required to attend a royal birth. The tradition -- now defunct -- goes back many centuries, she said, explaining that ""the home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby hadn't been smuggled in."" • Some people are thinking further ahead already. An Ipsos Mori poll released Thursday revealed almost two-thirds of those surveyed think William and Catherine's child should have a normal job before taking on royal duties. One in five disagrees. However, 70% of those polled think that it is impossible for the children of royalty to have a normal upbringing. The same survey found support for Britain's monarchy remains high, with more than three-quarters in favor of a monarchy over a republic. • There's been plenty of speculation about the baby's name -- and betting is going strong. The famous Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, which takes in and finds homes for lost and unwanted pets, has gone a step further and named a litter of kittens after the bookies' favorites: Alexandra, Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria, Grace, James and George. • Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England on Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: ""I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday."" • Prince Charles' wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. ""We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,"" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. ""I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there."" • The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. • Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. • The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. • The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. • Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. • William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered ""daughter"" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, ""Thank you, I will take that for my d--"" but then stopped herself. • The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. • The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. ""I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,"" she said. • It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. • The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.","NEW: Poll suggests Britons want the royal heir to lead a normal life -- including a regular job .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new rules aimed at limiting the amount of carbon pollution coming from new power plants. The standards, which would set separate limits for natural gas and coal power plants, are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants. ""Power plants are the single largest sources of carbon pollution,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in remarks prepared for delivery at the National Press Club in Washington. ""New power plants can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies. These technologies offer them a clear path forward, today and in the long-term."" New coal power plants and small natural gas plants would be limited to 1,100 pounds of C02 emissions per megawatt-hour. Larger natural gas plants would be limited to one thousand pounds a megawatt-hour. These restrictions are slightly looser than a set first proposed in 2012. McCarthy said the new proposal factors in public feedback from public comments received last year. Existing power plants are exempt from the proposed carbon regulation, but McCarthy said regulations on those plants will be proposed in June. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents coal-rich West Virginia, criticized the administration as trying to hold the coal industry to ""impossible standards"" ""Never before has the federal government forced an industry to do something that is technologically impossible. Forcing coal to meet the same emissions standards as gas when experts know that the required technology is not operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense and will have devastating impacts to the coal industry and our economy,"" he said in a written statement. McCarthy said the EPA has a history of pollution standards driving technological development. ""The old rules may say we can't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we've always used new technologies, we've used science, we've used research and development and discovery to make the old rules obsolete,"" McCarthy said. The president and CEO of the National Mining Association also had harsh words for the proposal. ""The regulation announced today by EPA effectively bans coal from America's power portfolio, leaving new power plants equipped with even the most efficient and environmentally advanced technologies out in the cold,"" said Hal Quinn, asserting that the EPA is ""recklessly gambling with the nation's energy and economic future."" He said standards should be based on the best technology available today. An EPA official briefing the media on the new clean air proposals Friday said that if they are finalized, the method of recouping costs associated with the new regulations would be determined by the industry. When pressed, the EPA official refused to say if the increased costs would be passed on to consumers. The standards will be open for public comment for 60 days, during which time the agency said, it plans to hold public hearings. U.N. panel says it's more certain that humans drive global warming .

"(CNN) -- You've fed the birds in London's Trafalgar Square. Lit a candle in Notre Dame in Paris. Enjoyed that relaxing cup of cafe con leche in Madrid's Plaza Mayor. What next? If the usual itinerary of cathedrals, palaces and souvenir shops has ceased to thrill, maybe it's time to abandon the well-trodden tourist circuit on your next trip to Europe and head to the river. During the past two decades, a number of European cities have invested heavily in redeveloping blighted industrial river fronts, turning them into charming urban retreats that emphasize sustainability, sports and local culture. Visitors can explore on foot, or cycle, skate and even skateboard along these riverfront renovations that artfully combine traditional and modern elements to reveal a bit of each city's soul. Madrid Rio . Spain's royal family once enjoyed pastoral views of Madrid's Manzanares River from Palacio de los Vargas. But until recently, the Manzanares, consumed by a major motorway constructed along its banks, was unrecognizable. The traffic-clogged highway cut the river off from the city center, barred public access and enveloped nearby neighborhoods in a cloud of pollution. What do you get for $60,000 a night? Today, a six-mile stretch of the Manzanares known as Madrid Rio is one of Europe's newest, most ambitious riverfront projects. The old motorway has been removed, replaced with a greenbelt that features more than 25,000 trees, foot paths, a variety of athletic and playground facilities and scenic vistas and bridges from which to observe city landmarks. Madrid Rio also links up with other green corridors, including cycling paths that extend throughout the city. Once an enormous slaughterhouse, Matadero Madrid is one of the most stunning transformations of Madrid Rio. It's now a contemporary cultural center featuring art exhibits, creative workshops, music festivals, documentary film and theatrical performances. 10 ultimate U.S. adventures . A short walk from Matadero, the newly expanded Arganzuela Park includes three large pools alongside the river for wading and playing amid lively fountains. Lounge chairs and umbrellas provide pleasant waterside spaces for sunbathing. Finally, visit La Huerta de la Partida, the long-neglected orchard of Palacio Vargas. It has been replanted with nearly 900 trees typical of the region, including olives, almonds, pears, figs and quince. Stop at the mirador (viewpoint) for a great view of many of the city's major monuments. Berlin - River Spree . Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, this progressive city has strived to maintain a balance between large corporate development projects that bring investment and jobs, and preserving the history and artistic character of its dynamic neighborhoods. It's a fascinating time to witness this struggle for the heart of the city, and a lot of it is playing out along the River Spree, in neighborhoods like Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain. World's best hotel restaurants . After the wall fell, these areas—on either side of the river—flourished as hip, alternative havens. Vacant lots became vibrant community gardens and art spaces, and drab apartment blocks became artists' studios, cheerful cooperative living spaces and diverse underground nightclubs. These areas have gentrified considerably, but you'll still find eclectic flea markets, independent designer shops and great global cuisine. Consider taking a walking tour led by the nonprofit Institute for Creative Sustainability, which emphasizes grass-roots efforts to maintain the green, creative character of the neighborhoods. Finally, visit the East Side Gallery, one of the last standing segments of the Berlin Wall, which has become an inspiring artistic monument to peace and freedom. Next, head to Mitte, literally the center, or ""middle,"" of the city. In the middle of the Spree, you'll find Museuminsel (Museum Island), home to several museums that collectively feature 6,000 years of artifacts and art. Close by is the historic Reichstag (German parliament building) with its strikingly modern glass dome and the Berlin Wall Memorial. It's not far from here to other important historic sites like the Monument to the Murdered Jews of Europe and the Brandenburg Gate. Before you go, be sure to visit the famous ""beach bars"" on the banks of the river. As you sip your caipirinha or local brew in a beach chair surrounded by palm trees, you'll marvel at how rapidly this city evolves and changes. Lisbon -- Tagus River (Rio Tejo) Centuries ago, the Tagus River launched Portuguese explorers out to sea on their journeys to Asia, Africa and the Americas and guided immigrants into this port city. The exchange of cultures that gives Lisbon its distinctive architectural and culinary character is also apparent in the city's riverfront development, which began in the 1990s when Lisbon was named the European Capital of culture. There are several points from which to embark on the 4.5-mile walk along the river. One nice starting point is the enormous and colorful Praça do Comercio, one of Lisbon's best-known squares. Moving from tradition to trendy, the next stop is Cais do Sodre. Redevelopment rid the area of its reputation for seedy bars and brothels; today it's home to hot clubs and great restaurants. Visit the famous Mercado da Ribeira for fantastic fruits, vegetables and flowers. Fodor's 100 Hotel Award winners . Carry on and you'll arrive at the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, with its river views and impressive collection of ancient art. Another opportunity for good food and drink awaits at the cafes along the Santo Amaro docks. You'll need your energy for the next leg of your journey to Belem, a neighborhood rich in museums, gardens and cafes. Then again, maybe it's best to save another full day for Belem's treasures. Instead, grab a pasteis de belem (a custard tart) from a traditional bakery, and lose yourself back at the river's edge. London - River Thames . The Thames is already a popular tourist destination, but until recently, most visitors didn't make it farther east than the Tower Bridge. That's changing with the impressive transformation of a once bleak wasteland known as the Docklands. Until the mid-20th century, East London's docks supported one of the busiest ports in the world. But between the 1960s and the 1980s, the docks closed as shipping traffic shifted to larger coastal ports, and London was left with more than 5,000 acres of derelict land. Since the government put a plan in place to revitalize the Docklands in the early 1980s, the area has grown to become a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial properties, with Canary Wharf—now a major business district and shopping destination—as its centerpiece. The 2012 Olympics provided another huge opportunity to expand waterfront redevelopment, accentuating the contrast between old and new. Today you can wander narrow cobblestone streets to find cafes and historic riverside pubs, and then ascend to spectacular views atop the Shard, a spire-shaped, gleaming glass skyscraper completed in 2012. Don't miss the Museum of London Docklands, which surveys the area's history from Roman times to its recent redevelopment. A fun way to see the Docklands is via the new Emirates Air Line cable cars that cross the river to Greenwich, home of the Royal Observatory, on the South Bank of the Thames. Rent a bike and take it on the cable car to explore the Thames Cultural Cycling Tour, which passes through Greenwich and eventually crosses back to Canary Wharf and historic neighborhoods like Wapping before returning to the South Bank via Tower Bridge.","Madrid Rio has been transformed from a highway to an urban river paradise .

"(CNN) -- Thomas Muller scored a hat-trick as Bayern Munich secured their first victory in a competitive match under new manager Pep Guardiola Monday. Their 5-0 win over SW Rehden in the German Cup was to be expected against opposition from Germany's fifth tier, but the holders avoided the pitfalls that have befallen other top Bundesliga sides in the early rounds of this competition. It also followed a 4-2 defeat to arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in the Germany Super Cup last weekend in Guardiola's first competitive match in charge. Muller's goals -- including a penalty -- helped the European champions to a comfortable win, with Brendan Shaqiri and Dutch star Arjen Robben also on target as they went into Saturday's second round draw. Guardiola's men open their Bundesliga title defense against Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Allianz Arena Friday. Moenchengladbach fell victim to a first round cup defeat Sunday as they were beaten on penalties by Darmstadt. Werder Bremen also exited to third division opposition in Sarrebruck Saturday. Guardiola put out a strong Bayern side for their cup match, but rested Franck Ribery and captain Philipp Lahm while new signing from his former club Thiago Alcantara also had to be content with a place on the bench. Schalke also went through earlier with a win over FC Noettingen 2-0. Meanwhile, France striker Loic Remy has moved to English Premier League side Newcastle on a season-long loan deal from Queens Park Rangers. Remy had been expected to leave after QPR were relegated from England's top flight last season as he looks to secure his place in the French international side ahead of the 2014 World Cup. He was one of QPR manager Harry Redknapp's key signings in last season's winter transfer window, but despite impressing was unable to prevent them from avoiding the drop. Remy is the first major signing of the latest transfer window for Newcastle. Earlier, Tottenham Hotspur completed the signing of Spain striker Roberto Soldado from Valencia for a club record Â£26 million( $40 million).","Bayern Munich beat minnows SW Rehden 5-0 in German Cup .

"(CNN) -- A Florida appeals court Wednesday struck down a state law barring gay men and lesbians from adoption on the basis of equal protection under law. The Florida 3rd District Court of Appeal upheld a trial court ruling that Florida's explicit ban was unconstitutional, noting that the state's adoption law required officials to assess potential adoptive parents in ""the best interests of the child."" ""By the time of the trial below, the application of the statutory ban was contrary to both the professional judgment of the Department and the legislative directive to assure 'the best interest of the child' in 'every' adoption,"" wrote Judge Cindy S. Lederman in the 42-page ruling. Shortly after the unanimous ruling was announced, Gov. Charlie Crist -- who is running for a U.S. Senate seat as an independent -- said the state would ""stop enforcing the ban."" A supporter of the ban earlier in his career, when he was a Republican, Crist added that he was very pleased with the ruling. Joe Follick, the spokesman for the Department of Children and Families, said the department has 30 days to decide on an appeal, ""but we will make a decision sooner than that."" ""We are analyzing the court's opinion and wish to give any decision to appeal a thorough review,"" he said, adding that their decision would consider ""the impact on the family directly involved in this case."" ""As of now, this decision does stand as the law in Florida, and we are currently not enforcing the ban,"" he said. ""The primary consideration on whether to appeal is finding the balance between the value of a final ruling from the Florida Supreme Court versus the impact on the Gill family."" The Florida Supreme Court several years ago considered a challenge to the law based on equal protection but sent the case back to the district court to collect more information. The case was later abandoned. The current case involved a gay man who was a licensed foster parent, allowed under Florida law, who wanted to adopt two boys who had been placed in his care after the Department of Children and Families removed them from their home for neglect. The Center for Family and Child Enrichment, a private, nonprofit company that provides adoption services through a contract with the state, reported that ""the home presented a suitable environment"" and that the gay man -- identified as ""F.G."" in court documents and as Martin Gill by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented him -- ""met all the criteria required to adopt the two boys."" But the center recommended against the adoption because of the Florida law, and the department denied the application. ""The Department acknowledged that it would have approved the application if it had not been for the statute,"" Lederman wrote. Gill sued, and the trial court agreed that the ban was unconstitutional. The department appealed the ruling to the district court. In the ruling, Lederman wrote that gay men and lesbians are the only people barred from adopting in the state law and that the ban could stand up only if ""there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment."" Instead, she wrote, the argument against was not that gay men and lesbians were unfit parents. ""Instead, the Department argues that there is a rational basis for the prohibition on homosexual adoption because children will have better role models, and face less discrimination, if they are placed in non-homosexual households, preferably with a husband and wife as the parents,"" she wrote. ""But that is not what the statute does."" The law does not prohibit single people from adopting -- and does not bar gay men and lesbians from fostering children or guardianship, she noted. ""It is difficult to see any rational basis in utilizing homosexual persons as foster parents or guardians on a temporary or permanent basis, while imposing a blanket prohibition on adoption by those same persons,"" she wrote. Gill was delighted with the ruling. ""This is just the news that we have been waiting so anxiously for here,"" he said in an ACLU statement. ""This is a giant step toward being able to give our sons the stability and permanency that they are being denied.""","NEW: Department of Children and Families has 30 days to decide on appeal .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Every day the fate of 200,000 Mumbai residents' lunches lie in the hands, and on the heads, of the city's lunch delivery men, the dabbawalas. Lunch is served: The dabbawalas have been serving up lunch to Mumbai residents for 118 years. A corp of around 5,000 tiffin lunch box dabbawalas have been supplying the city's hungry workers with hot home-made lunches since Mahatma Gandhi was a 21-year-old law student. From Monday to Saturday, regardless of monsoon rains or sweltering heat, they can be seen across the city balancing up to 40 metal lunch pails on their heads or pushing fully laden hand carts . ""The world is advancing and people are taking outside food, but maybe only once in a week. People still like to take homemade food, usually every day, so that's why we're in demand,"" says 33-year-old dabbawala Manish Tripathi from his apartment in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai. Not only providing a necessary and recession-proof service -- even in tough economic times, people will always need lunch -- the dabbawalas are a cooperative that can boast a business record of reliability that would have any operation salivating with envy. In a city of 18 million people living cheek by jowl, most of them appearing on the move at the same time, the chances of a lamb biryani ending up in the place of a tarka dahl would seem to be high . However according to Tripathi, for every 16 million deliveries only one will go AWOL. ""Really it is magic,"" he said, perhaps revealing the unexpected secret of success of the dabbawalas. The six sigma rating the dabbawalas received by Forbes magazine precipitated a rush of interest from management supply companies and business schools searching for the secrets of its success. The rating means that the dabbawalas have a 99.9 percent efficiency rate. The ""magic"" Tripathi goes on to explain has less to do with an intangible mysticism and more to do with the tight-knit group of dabbawalas and the unique delivery system.  Watch Manish Tripathi explain how the dabbawalas work » . A typical day for a dabbawala starts at around 8 am when the cylindrical metal tiffin boxes are collected from homes and taken to the nearest railway station where they are loaded onto crates and transported by train to downtown Mumbai. Tripathi and his group of dabbawalas work along the city's Marine railway line and begin to gather at Churchgate station at 11.30 am. Each wearing a white Gandhi topi hat, the dabbawalas have time to chat and organize the tiffin boxes between them, before taking up to 40 tiffin boxes each, slung over bicycle handlebars, loaded onto hand carts or carried on long trays balanced on top of heads. On average one tiffin box will change hands four times in its journey from a home kitchen to a hungry office worker. So far, so simple. However, the majority of the dabbawalas are illiterate and the sorting is done mostly by a system of color coding handles and tiffin box covers that has hardly changed since the first tiffin was delivered in 1890. As well as the long-practiced delivery system, and the cheap, extensive and reliable rail network of the city, it's the unity of the dabbawalas that Tripathi credits with being a key factor in their longevity. The dabbawalas belong to the Vakari sect and have roots to the simple farming community of Pune outside Mumbai in Maharashtra state. ""They are a single DNA,"" he says. ""Everyone is a Marathi, they are made from the same cloth, speak the same language, everyone's lunch is the same, everyone's god is the same. So there's a high degree or coordination and commitment. ""When you have organizations with people with different backgrounds, different castes, different languages, there's bound to be disagreement and a problem among them."" Despite the growing social mobility of India's middle classes, caste then still has a central place in the lives and options open to millions more in India. For Tripathi and the other dabbawalas their success and longevity is source of pride in their heritage. If the delivery system of the dabbawalas and hiring system is archaic, Tripathi can be credited with bringing the collective into at least the 20th century. He set up a dabbawala web site five years ago and in 2006 started a text message ordering service for dabba customers, which 5 to 10 people use every day. Companies haven't been slow to tap into the dabbawalas network or reputation of reliability and trustworthiness. The Bank of India, and India's booming mobile phone and Internet providers including Airtel and Reliance and have used the dabbawalas to distribute flyers for their services with the tiffin boxes. ""Once in a while the customers don't mind, but if this is happening every day the customer will get annoyed, so we keep it to a minimum,"" says Tripathi. While small groups of dabbawalas operate individually of other groups in different areas of the city -- sharing the months taking equally between all; an average dabbawala wage is around $100 a month -- there is an informal hierarchy. A board of directors is made up of around five senior dabbawalas who in their dotage don't have to carry the lunch boxes until they kick the can, but are on hand to resolve any disputes. Expansion of the network of dabbawalas is limited, however, the extra revenue from associations with the likes of Airtel, lectures and media operations goes to the Dabbawala Foundation, a social security fund for the dabbawalas and their families, a well as a means to buy new carts for bicycles. As well as delivering the tiffin boxes, English-speaking Tripathi is the chairman of the Dabbawala Foundation, who clearly enjoys his extra role as patron. ""I get the money from various sources,"" he says. ""I can't talk about where the money is from,"" he continues, his eyes dropping to the floor, "" but I can say that money is never a problem. If you're intentions are good, money will come automatically,"" he smiles the twinkle returning to his eye. By finding a way through the network of unmapable Mumbai streets and latterly discovering ways in which to tap into new revenue streams the dabbawalas appear future-proof, their unique system more than capable standing up to and economic downturn or personal changes in taste.","Mumbai's dabbawalas have been delivering lunches in the city for 118 years .

"Washington (CNN) -- It was a mystery for nearly 70 years: What happened to Nazi Party leader Alfred Rosenberg's diary, a valuable document with insights into the Third Reich? Rosenberg was the party's chief ideologue and became a confidante of Adolf Hitler after meeting him in 1921. He joined the party before Hitler and gained fame writing anti-Semitic tracts and editing the Nazi newspaper. He eventually became head of the foreign policy office and was one of the chief architects of the plan to systematically exterminate Jews. The influential Nazi intellectual was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and hanged in October 1946. Parts of his diary -- a loose-leaf collection of notes he kept from 1934-1944 were used by the tribunal, but the bulk of the diary, dating from 1936-1944, went missing after the trial. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, working with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and investigators in Delaware, finally solved the case, tracking down 400 missing pages of the diary. Scholars hope it will help them learn more about how the Nazis operated in the years before and during World War II. ""This is one of the great detective stories of our time. The diary was known at the time of the military tribunal in Nuremberg when the leadership of the Nazi Party was tried and it then disappeared for nearly 70 years,"" ICE Director John Morton told CNN. ""It was in fact smuggled out of Nuremberg into the United States, probably by Robert Kempner, who was one of the prosecutors for the United States in Nuremberg."" Investigators from the Department of Homeland Security and the Delaware United States Attorney's office received a tip in November 2012 from an unnamed ""source"" -- an art security specialist working with the Holocaust Museum -- and were able to locate and seize the diary, according to a Wednesday news release from Charles M. Oberly III, the U.S. attorney for the district of Delaware, announcing the seizure, which took place in April. A criminal investigation is now under way to determine how the papers ended up in the possession of Herbert Richardson, an academic in Buffalo, New York, according to a government official. A CNN reporter's calls to Richardson seeking comment on the case were not returned. The yellowed pages of the diary -- some written on Nazi Party stationery -- cover the lead-up to World War II and party activities during the war. Containing frequent mentions of ""Der Fuhrer,"" referring to Hitler, they describe conflicts between Nazi leaders like Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels -- the chief propagandist -- who battled over who was closest to Hitler. See pages of Rosenberg's diary (in German) Kempner, a German-Jewish lawyer who fled to the U.S. during the war and later returned to serve as the deputy chief counsel at Nuremberg, removed the Rosenberg diary from U.S. government facilities and kept them until his death in 1993, according to the release from the Delaware U.S. attorney's office. According to a memo the Holocaust Museum found among Kempner's documents, Kempner received permission from the Office of the Chief of Counsel of War Crimes to keep unclassified documents ""for purposes of writing, lecturing and study"" as the trials drew to an end and he returned home with an unknown number of documents in his possession that were kept out of reach of other scholars. The press release from Oberly's office stated the documents were removed ""contrary to law and proper procedure."" David L. Hall, an assistant U.S. attorney who investigated the case, said Kempner was not given title to the documents. ""There would not have been any authority to do that because they were U.S. government property,"" Hall told CNN. ""The bottom line is they were improperly removed from government custody and retained by Kempner. Now that the diary has been recovered, it will eventually be given to the Holocaust Museum, where it will be accessible to scholars and the public. Rosenberg also wrote in the diary about his plan to steal art and cultural treasures from all over Europe. By the end of war, the task force he established had shipped almost 1.5 million rail car-loads of artwork and artifacts from German-controlled Europe to the Reich, according to the Holocaust Museum. Henry Mayer, who worked as chief archivist at the Holocaust Museum for 16 years and now serves as a senior adviser there, spent 17 years looking for the diary and helped authenticate the papers after they were seized. Experts have not yet been able to review all 400 pages, which were written in German. In examining the papers, Mayer and other researchers hope to learn more details about how Rosenberg carried out his role as head of the German-controlled territories in Eastern Europe, including Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine and parts of Belarus, where a large number of war crimes were committed. Mayer said the diary provides insight into the mind of ""another perpetrator who has given, so to speak, testimony or witness in his own hand about what was going on -- how he was administering the territory, how he felt about Jews and how he dealt with the Jews under his control."" Mayer himself played an important role in finding the papers. He finally got a break during a visit to a storage locker where some of Kempner's papers were being kept. While there he spoke with the sister of one of Kempner's legal secretaries. ""The person that I was with in the storage locker was the sister of one of the legal secretaries who since that time had passed away and she recalled that her sister was interviewed by a reporter from the German news magazine Der Spiegel and she told this reporter that she remembers that she gave the diary to somebody, a former academic who lived in both the Buffalo area and Canada, that she had given this diary to him -- quote-unquote -- for safekeeping,"" he said, describing the ""eureka"" moment he experienced during that conversation. ""At that moment we said 'OK now we know pretty much where this thing ended up and therefore we had a reason to go and pursue it, OK? Before then we only had surmised that it might have gone to him."" Now that the long search is finally over, researchers like Mayer will be able to delve deeper into the mind of a man who shared responsibility for murdering millions.

"(CNN) -- A reported tornado briefly touched down Friday afternoon in northern Alabama, causing damage and scares days after twisters proved deadly in Texas. The twister was part of a severe thunderstorm that rolled through the Southeast, prompting tornado warnings Friday afternoon. Law enforcement officials reported a funnel cloud -- indicative of a tornado -- at 2:15 p.m. (3:15 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service noted. The same agency later noted there had been a ""brief touchdown"" of a tornado. A couple of homes in Athens -- a community of about 22,000 people some 20 miles west of Huntsville -- suffered minor damage as the storm rolled through, said Rita White, spokeswoman for Limestone County's emergency management agency. Strong winds knocked down trees and power lines, she added. This severe weather struck two days after at least 16 tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service, ripped through parts of central Texas. Six people died. The same storm system produced a tornado Thursday in Waskom, Texas, which is along that state's border with Louisiana. The National Weather Service rated that twister as an EF1 -- on the enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale that runs from zero to five, which is the strongest -- meaning it contained winds blowing at about 100 mph.

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The military judge overseeing the trial of admitted Fort Hood gunman Maj. Nidal Hasan told defense attorneys Thursday that they can't drop out of the case -- even though they believe it's tantamount to helping him commit suicide. ""This is nothing more than their disagreement with Major Hasan's strategy in conducting his defense,"" said the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting Hasan as he represents himself. The attorneys argued Wednesday that Hasan is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence. Osborn's decision sparked a bitter fight in a trial focused on charges that Hasan shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the November 2009 rampage at the Army installation near Killeen, Texas. ""We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics. It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel,"" said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team. He asked for a stay on her order, which would prevent it from going into effect. The judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with Hasan would be an ethical violation. ""I will make it easy for you. I've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability,"" Osborn said. Poppe would have nothing of it, his voice raised in obvious frustration. ""The order does not relieve us of the responsibility. ... We believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant. This is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today: assist this man in achieving the goal, which we believe is achieving a death sentence."" The lead prosecutor chimed in, questioning the defense team's claims, saying that Hasan is mounting a legitimate defense. ""The government sees only two defenses: either 'I didn't do it,' or 'I did it, with an excuse.' He was caught with a gun in his hand,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan. ""I don't understand how that's repugnant to defense counsel -- I'm truly perplexed."" In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges. But on Tuesday, Hasan used his opening statement to declare ""I am the shooter."" After the standby counsel argued Wednesday that Hasan was seeking the death penalty, Hasan objected, calling it ""a twist of the facts."" But he refused to submit his objection in writing, a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court. The defense attorneys Thursday immediately appealed Osborn's ruling. But she gave no stay in the meantime. ""We're going to move forward,"" the judge said, allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in. The trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of Hasan's shooting spree. The attorneys' request Wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony. Although Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was granted his request to represent himself, Osborn ruled before the court-martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings. Expert: Judge can't let attorneys stop . Geoffrey Corn, a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the defense lawyers are in ""a terrible predicament."" ""They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck, and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers,"" he said. But Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself, ""he has the right to do it poorly"" -- even to the point of asking for death. ""The defense lawyers would love to get off this case, because it becomes unbearable,"" Corn said. ""If you imagine having to sit there, being an ardent opponent of capital punishment, watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes, it must be torture. But the judge can't let them off the case."" Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions . Witnesses describe horror of shooting . Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage. He listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that November day at a processing center for soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford stared hard at Hasan, appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times. But Hasan just stared back. The courtroom turned silent as Lunsford was called as a witness. He was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan. Lunsford recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" pulled out a pistol and began shooting. ""It was a state of panic,"" Lunsford said. Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots. As Lunsford was checking behind him, ""Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,"" he said. ""He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head."" A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified. Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. After the prosecution finished questioning Lunsford, the judge asked Hasan whether he had any questions for the witness. ""I have no questions,"" Hasan said. Hasan also declined to question Michelle Harper, who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began. Prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call, where she pleaded for help. Scheduled to go to Afghanistan . Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case. Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said. Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like ""terrorist killing,"" ""innocent,"" ""Quran,"" ""fatwas"" and ""suicide bombings,"" Mulligan said. Hasan told the panel in his opening statement, ""We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion."" But, he added, ""I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor."" The mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the Islamic faith. Witness: 'His punishment will come' Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved.

"(CNN) -- Spanish football club Real Madrid completed the signing of Gareth Bale from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur Sunday, to end weeks of speculation over one of the off-season's most anticipated transfer deals. Bale joins the La Liga giants for six seasons, Real said on its website, and he will be unveiled at Real's Bernabeu Stadium Monday at 1 p.m. local time. Neither club has disclosed the value of the deal but British media outlets Sky Sports and the BBC reported it was a world-record move worth $132 million that was greater than the $124 million fee Real Madrid produced to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United in 2009. According to a pair of Spanish newspapers, though, Bale's switch wasn't a world record. El Pais put the transfer value at about $120 million on Sunday, just as AS did earlier in the weekend. Whatever the amount, Bale was thrilled while thanking Spurs for some ""special times."" ""I am not sure there is ever a good time to leave a club where I felt settled and was playing the best football of my career to date,"" Bale told Tottenham's website. ""I know many players talk of their desire to join the club of their boyhood dreams, but I can honestly say, this is my dream come true."" Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club had no intention of selling Bale but the ""attention"" from Real Madrid and the player's own wishes ultimately took precedence. Likely in anticipation of Bale's departure -- and the money on the way -- Tottenham had signed seven players this summer. ""Such has been the attention from Real Madrid and so great is Gareth's desire to join them, that we have taken the view that the player will not be sufficiently committed to our campaign in the current season,"" Levy told Tottenham's website. ""We have, therefore, with great reluctance, agreed to this sale and do so in the knowledge that we have an exceptionally strong squad to which we have added no fewer than seven top internationals. ""More importantly, we have an immense team spirit and a dressing room that is hungry for success."" The 24-year-old Welsh international has twice been named the Footballer of the Year in England for his outstanding performances for Tottenham, most recently in the 2012-13 season where he scored 26 goals in 44 appearances. But this was not enough to lift the London club into the European Champions League after they finished fifth in the EPL. Speculation about Bale's future reached fever pitch during over the transfer window that followed. Bale, an attacking player who is normally deployed in a wide position, joined Tottenham from his first club Southampton in 2007. He has made 41 appearances for his country since his debut in 2006, scoring 11 goals. ""I am well aware that I would not be at the level I am today were it not for firstly Southampton and then Spurs standing by me during some of the tougher times and affording me the environment and support they have,"" Bale said. ""Tottenham will always be in my heart and I'm sure that this season will be a successful one for them. I am now looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my life, playing football for Real Madrid."" If the British reports about Bale's fee are correct, it would mark the latest occasion that Real have broken the world transfer record, dating back to the signing of Portugal's Luis Figo from arch rivals Barcelona in 2000. The record was again broken when French World Cup star Zinedine Zidane signed from Serie A Juventus in 2001. The $82.58 million fee remained the record until Los Blancos broke it twice in 2009, first acquiring Brazil's Kaka from Milan and then Ronaldo, who remains a key figure at the Bernabeu. New manager Carlo Ancelotti will be hoping the attacking combination of Bale and Ronaldo will herald a new era of domination for a club who have won the European Champions League, formerly European Cup, a record nine times, but not since 2002. Real, then managed by Jose Mourinho, had to play second fiddle in La Liga last season to Barcelona and were beaten in the semifinals of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund. Bale didn't play in Tottenham's 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday.","Gareth Bale has signed for Spanish club Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- Two former U.S. Border Patrol agents -- whose cases became flashpoints in the controversy over border security -- were released early from prison Tuesday, one of their attorneys and a congressman said. An artist's sketch shows Ignacio Ramos, left, and Jose Compean. The agents were convicted in 2006 of shooting and wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant and then covering it up. President George W. Bush issued commutations for both men during his final days in office last month. Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean had received 11- and 12-year prison sentences, respectively. After the commutation, their prison sentences were set to end March 20. Ramos was released on furlough to travel from prison in Phoenix, Arizona,  to his home in El Paso, Texas, where he will serve the remaining portion of his sentence under house arrest, said his attorney, David L. Botsford of Austin, Texas. After March 20, Ramos will be on ""supervised release"" -- similar to probation -- for up to three years, Botsford said. Compean had been incarcerated in Elkton, Ohio, said U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California. ""At last, Ramos and Compean have been rightfully reunited with their families,"" Rohrabacher said in a statement. ""This day is long overdue. I wish the Ramos and Compean families the best as they now try to pick up the pieces and begin to heal from this terrible ordeal."" Both men had requested presidential clemency, and the U.S. Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney was reviewing their requests when Bush made his decision, office spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said. ""The president has reviewed the circumstances of this case as a whole and the conditions of confinement and believes the sentences they received are too harsh and that they, and their families, have suffered enough for their crimes,"" a senior administration official said. The official noted that both Democratic and Republican members of Congress had supported a commutation, including President Barack Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, and Texas GOP Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn. Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Richard L. Skinner, in a statement posted on the agency's Web site, confirmed that his staff wrongly told members of Congress last September that Compean had stated he ""wanted to shoot a Mexican."" ""At the time my staff made that statement, they believed it to be true, although we later learned it was inaccurate,"" Skinner said. ""In fact, Mr. Compean had stated in a sworn statement that 'my intent was to kill the alien ... and I think Nacho [Ramos] was also trying to kill the alien.' "" Critics of U.S. immigration policy have been campaigning for a pardon for the two agents, arguing they were just doing their jobs. The shooting happened February 17, 2005, on the U.S.-Mexico border southeast of El Paso, Texas. During their trial, Ramos and Compean said that the illegal immigrant, Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, had brandished a gun while actively resisting arrest. Aldrete-Davila said, however, that he was unarmed and trying to surrender when Compean attempted to beat him with a shotgun. Aldrete-Davila was shot while fleeing toward the Rio Grande. Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure. After receiving immunity to testify in the case against the two agents, Aldrete-Davila was arrested in 2007 on charges of bringing more than 750 pounds of marijuana into the United States. The case became a political flashpoint, with advocates of tighter border controls defending the agents and civil liberties groups saying that the agents had used illegal and excessive force against Aldrete-Davila. Bush granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations during his eight years in office, far fewer than Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan in their two-term administrations. A commutation reduces a convict's prison term, but the conviction remains on the person's record. A pardon wipes the slate clean by erasing the record of the conviction. A president has the sole authority to grant clemency to whomever he chooses, although a Justice Department office usually reviews applications and makes recommendations after considering such standards as a person's degree of remorse and ability to lead a responsible and productive life after release. Those applying for a pardon through the Justice Department are required to wait at least five years after their conviction or release from confinement.","The two men were convicted of wounding an unarmed illegal immigrant .

"(CNN) -- Ashley Adams and her husband, Andy, were shocked to discover they were expecting quadruplets in March. The couple have been married for four years and were looking to start a family. After trying unsuccessfully for some time to conceive, Ashley underwent infertility treatments and received a double dose of Clomid, which often results in a multiple-birth pregnancy. ""When the doctors told us we were having quads, we were extremely terrified and ridiculously excited all at the same time,"" Andy said. ""It was just unimaginable."" Ashley added, ""I didn't know how to process it initially, but it felt like a blessing."" But their surprise turned to fear when doctors diagnosed 24-year-old Ashley with thyroid cancer four months into her pregnancy. ""We were pretty overwhelmed when we found out,"" Andy said. ""We were lost and scared and didn't know what to do."" Doctors had discovered an abnormality in Ashley's thyroid during an ultrasound, and a biopsy diagnosed it as stage 1 cancer. The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. ""It was scary to find out about the cancer and thinking about what could happen, but if I stressed out about it, the babies would feel it, and I could possibly go into labor even earlier,"" Ashley said. ""Dying was not an option, and our doctors were so reassuring that we just held on to that."" Multiple-birth pregnancies are often complicated, said Ashley's doctor, Julie Scott, a high-risk obstetrician at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora. As a result, Ashley wanted to wait until after the babies were born at 30 weeks to undergo cancer surgery. She delivered one boy and three girls, two of them identical twins, on August 26. Her surgery, a seven-hour procedure that included a thyroidectomy and lymph node removal, took place a few weeks later and was successful. Scott has seen thousands of patients, many with higher-order (three or more fetuses) pregnancies. She said it is not uncommon to diagnose cancer in pregnant women because that's often when they have their first extensive health examinations. What's scary is that the cancer may have been lying untreated -- and spreading -- for years. ""Ashley has probably had that cancer for several years, and it went undiagnosed, probably because with her young age,"" Scott said. ""The doctors missed the warning signs."" According to the National Cancer Institute, thyroid cancers are a highly curable form of cancer, with an overall survival rate of 97.5% over a five-year period. ""In cancer -- which is always unfortunate -- Ashley is fortunate that she had a form of cancer that was slow-growing and wasn't going to be altered by the course of pregnancy and could be managed,"" Scott said. The Adamses are now waiting for Ashley's test results to come back to determine a treatment plan. She may require a combination of both chemotherapy and iodine radiation, or just iodine radiation. Either way, she and her doctors would like to postpone treatment for as long as possible -- without putting her health at risk -- so that she can continue to breast-feed the quadruplets. Six weeks after her cesarean section and nearly one month after cancer surgery, Ashley is recovering and the babies are growing. Wyatt, her son, is expected to come home from the hospital this week. Identical twins Samantha and Braelynn each weigh five pounds, and Rylie is the smallest of their girls, weighing in at just under five pounds. They will remain in the University of Colorado Hospital until they are full term to make sure they can breathe on their own and there aren't any complications. The girls are expected to return home before Thanksgiving. Andy said he is excited about the babies coming home and not at all intimidated by thoughts of four babies crying simultaneously, or of all the diapers to change. The only fear that lingers is ""having something happen to them and their health when there aren't a thousand nurses around,"" he said. The couple said they are optimistic about what lies ahead for their family, but do they see more babies in their future? Andy laughs and says, ""I will tell you no more; she will tell you maybe. But it's definitely no for me.""","Ashley Adams was diagnosed with stage 1 thyroid cancer four months into her pregnancy .

"(CNN) -- The high-profile case of a girl adopted by a South Carolina couple is moving toward another legal showdown after Oklahoma's governor ordered the extradition of the girl's biological Native American father, who is accused of custodial interference. Gov. Mary Fallin on Wednesday ordered that Dusten Brown be extradited to South Carolina after she became convinced that the father disobeyed an Oklahoma court order to allow the adoptive couple, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, to visit Veronica, 4. But Brown's attorneys told CNN that they will challenge the extradition order at a hearing scheduled for October 3. Brown turned himself in to authorities Thursday morning in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, and was then released on $10,000 bail, said Robert Nigh, his attorney in South Carolina. Fallin said Wednesday that her goal ""in the Baby Veronica case has been to encourage both Mr. Brown and the Capobianco family to reach a quick settlement and come to an agreement that protects Veronica's best interests."" ""I said previously that I was willing to delay Mr. Brown's extradition to South Carolina as long as all parties were working together in good faith to pursue such a settlement,"" Fallin said in a written statement. ""Unfortunately, it has become clear that Dusten Brown is not acting in good faith."" Brown's attorneys claim their client did not break a law in the ongoing custody dispute. In June, a divided U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Capobiancos, who are white, when Brown sought to assert his parental rights. They had legally adopted Veronica when she was a baby. The justices said the adoption was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father, a registered member of the Cherokee tribe, over where his daughter would live. The court said Brown could not rely on the Indian Child Welfare Act for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings, which were initiated by the non-Native American birth mother without his knowledge. The father then took his case to Oklahoma courts. Timeline of 'Baby Veronica' adoption case . Brown refused to hand over the child . After the Supreme Court order, a family court in South Carolina developed a ""transition plan"" to ease any transfer, taking into account the girl's age, sensitivities of the parties involved and the Native American heritage dynamic underlying the larger legal dispute. Brown did not attend a transition meeting, saying he had National Guard training out of state and was unable to get out of that duty. The South Carolina family court then ordered that Veronica be turned over immediately. Brown refused to hand the child over and was cited for contempt. A warrant was issued on August 10 for ""custodial interference."" As he did Thursday, Brown turned himself in to authorities in Oklahoma and posted bail after that warrant was issued. Fallin acted after South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley filed a request with the Oklahoma Supreme Court seeking ""the prompt return of a South Carolina child to her adoptive parents and ensuring that Mr. Brown is held accountable for criminally withholding Veronica Rose Capobianco from her parents for nearly one month,"" according to a court document. Fallin's ""unfortunate"" order does not mean Brown will be extradited, according to another attorney, Clark Brewster. An Oklahoma judge will determine whether the father broke any laws, he said, adding his client did not do so. Brown and his attorneys ""will appear before a judicial officer, point out the defects in the order and defend themselves,"" Brewster told CNN. Brewster also claimed his client has tried to accommodate the Capobiancos during the appeal process. But Haley, in her court filing in Oklahoma, said Brown has been in ""willful defiance"" of South Carolina courts that ordered him to return Veronica to the Capobiancos. South Carolina wants to prosecute Brown for custodial interference. The Oklahoma Supreme Court issued an emergency stay on Friday to temporarily delay the transfer of Veronica to the Capobiancos. The order was made public on Tuesday. Case has tested federal law . The extradition order does not affect the current placement of Veronica, according to Fallin. She would be able to stay with Brown's relatives. The four-year case has spanned state lines and tested an unusual federal law. The Capobiancos legally adopted Veronica at birth in September 2009. When Brown learned of her adoption a few months later, he asserted his custody rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act, setting off a lengthy legal fight. A family court judge ruled in Brown's favor in late 2011, and he took his daughter back. The Capobiancos have fought ever since to have Veronica returned, arguing federal law does not define an unwed biological father as a parent. Fallin claimed that Brown denies visitation between the adoptive couple and the girl. ""He is acting in open violation of both Oklahoma and South Carolina courts, which have granted custody of Veronica to the Capobiancos. Finally, he has cut off negotiations with the Capobiancos and shown no interest in pursuing any other course than yet another lengthy legal battle,"" the governor said. ""As governor, I am committed to upholding the rule of law. As a mother, I believe it is in the best interests of Veronica to help end this controversy and find her a permanent home,"" Fallin said. Melanie Capobianco has told reporters that Veronica is being ""illegally held against the wishes of her parents and the courts,"" and she pleaded for her daughter's return. CNN's Joe Sutton, Michael Martinez, Bill Mears and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Dusten Brown posts bail after surrendering to Oklahoma authorities .

"JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- Located outside a small Pennsylvania city, John Murtha airport may not see many passengers. But it's seen plenty of arrivals of tax dollars from Washington, most recently economic stimulus funds. Democratic Rep. John Murtha says it's his job to direct federal funds to his district in Pennsylvania. The airport offers three commercial flights. In between the arrivals and departures, airport officials admit there are few faces around the facility. ""When the flights are coming in, there are people. Other than that, it's empty,"" said Scott Voelker, manager of the John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport. But one face is everywhere. Rep. John Murtha, the airport's namesake, is hard to miss. Considered one of ""the kings of pork"" on Capitol Hill by taxpayer watchdog groups, the 19th-term Pennsylvania Democrat has piloted almost $200 million from Washington to Murtha airport. Much of the funding has come in the form of legislative earmarks that are attached to bills before Congress. Taxpayer watchdogs have said earmarks -- often derided as ""pork-barrel"" spending -- are designed to fund congressional pet projects. ""[Murtha's] dumped in nearly $200 million into this project that has virtually no passengers. It's practically a museum piece,"" said Steve Ellis with the Taxpayers for Common Sense.  Watch why critics say the airport is wasteful » . Murtha declined CNN's request for an interview.  His staff issued a statement saying Murtha airport is vital infrastructure designed to ""attract additional business"" to the Johnstown area. On his House Web site, Murtha strongly defends earmarks, saying it's his ""job"" to direct federal funds to his district. amFIX: Your thoughts on how congress spends your money . Earlier this year, the airport found a new revenue stream, receiving $800,000 from the stimulus to repave a crosswind runway that's used as a backup to the facility's main landing runway. Even though Voelker said the runway is perfectly safe, he said he believes the stimulus project ""makes a lot of sense."" He noted the runway hasn't been repaved since the 1980s. ""Asphalt and concrete need to be replaced,"" Voelker added. In December, Murtha made a direct appeal to the Federal Aviation Administration to fund the runway project.  The request was rejected.  At the time, the airport did not meet FAA criteria for funding because the facility had fewer than 10,000 passengers. But earlier this year, the FAA notified Murtha airport officials the facility had been approved for stimulus funding.  The FAA said Murtha did not request the stimulus money. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said Murtha airport received stimulus money because it was ""shovel-ready.""  It ""met all of the requirements for the use of the stimulus money,"" Brown said. Murtha airport is not the only remote airport landing stimulus funds. According to the FAA's Web site, hundreds of big and small airports across the country are slated to receive $1 billion in stimulus upgrades.  Many of the airports are in such far-flung places as U.S. territories Guam and American Samoa.  Even King Salmon, Alaska, (population 447) is expecting $9.7 million, according to FAA records. See the records . Taxpayer watchdogs said they wonder if some of that's pork. ""The problem is you're not getting the multiple bang for your stimulus buck that you're looking for,"" Ellis said. He added, ""when you see deadbeat airports getting cash so they can do their second runway, it really feeds cynicism around the country about the stimulus and about the projects."" Brown defends the use of stimulus money for other remote airports such as Guam. ""Guam is a U.S. territory and is part of the U.S. economy as far as I know,"" she said. Murtha airport's manager said taxpayer money is going to waste at his facility, but not on the runway project. He points to an unstaffed $8 million air traffic radar system installed in 2004. ""It's been sitting over there, and that radar has been spinning for all those years with no purpose. Just sitting there,"" Voelker said. Voelker said he has brought the matter up with both the FAA and Pennsylvania Air National Guard, which uses the air traffic control facility. But he said nobody can explain why the radar system hasn't been staffed.","Pennsylvania's John Murtha airport offers three commercial flights .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, President Barack Obama's two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with Russia's foreign minister to shape a twist in the Syria debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis. It took an idea from being an off-the-cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the United Nations. Perhaps more importantly for the President, it may help save him from a political showdown in Congress where it seems increasingly likely he cannot win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the White House and of deep concern to the American people. The first move came from the current secretary of state, John Kerry. In a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue (probably because it was), Kerry raised the possibility that if Syria were to give up its chemical weapons, an attack might be avoided. Although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the British foreign secretary characterized it as impossible, the idea quickly began to gain traction. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem announced that his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had proposed that Syria's chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a U.S.-led attack. Moallem went further, welcoming the initiative. It turned out Kerry had spoken to Lavrov. And while Washington's first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the Syrian government in the past, it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the Congress -- and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region -- some in the administration felt it was worth considering. So, hours after a senior official had told CNN the Kerry statement was a ""major goof,"" the press office in the White House was claiming credit suggesting that the ""credible threat"" of a U.S. plan had triggered the diplomatic opening. Next up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss/potential predecessor, made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the White House. She called the idea that Syria might give up its chemical weapons an ""important step"" if the Russians and the Syrians actively followed up on it. This was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning's seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room. Further, while Clinton did not address the specifics of Obama's proposed Syria intervention, she did say that she would support him. Up until now, her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the Obama team's muddled handling of the proposed Syria intervention. But Monday's message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in America and around the globe. In the wake of her remarks, there were initially reports that other nations, such as France, would welcome giving the Russian initiative a chance. The President framed it as a ""potentially positive development."" Then on Tuesday, the Syrian government formally accepted the Russian proposal. The U.S. and France took the plan to the United Nations to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution. It is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum. Nonetheless, even should it blow up, appearing to consider it allows Obama to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem. And for the more the hawkishly inclined, it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful, political outcomes. Either way, for a moment, an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and, arguably, the Syrian Opposition (to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons) gained surprising traction. This was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of America's current top diplomat, to his swift interaction with his Russian counterpart, and the added weight his predecessor's views brought to the matter. It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident, promoted by parties who have regularly lied, and cautiously embraced by a U.S. administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure. Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not, it speaks volumes about how bad our options are. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Kerry, Clinton collaborated (accidentally?) to add hopeful twist on Syria .

"Washington (CNN) -- The captain of Southwest Flight 345, whose nose gear was broken while landing at LaGuardia Airport in New York last month, took control of the aircraft from his co-pilot when the plane was below 400 feet -- a critical phase of flight during which control is rarely changed between pilots, experts say. The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday updated its investigation into the July 22 incident, noting the last-minute cockpit switch but did not reveal the captain's explanation for the change. Other details released by the safety board, however, could provide an explanation, pilots contacted by CNN said. The Southwest pilots told investigators the wind changed direction as the plane was landing, shifting from an 11-knot tailwind below 1,000 feet to an 11-knot headwind on the runway. Passenger sues airline over LaGuardia nose landing . The captain took control at a point roughly midway through that period, ""at a point below 400 feet,"" the NTSB said. The wind shift, experts said, could have caused the plane to deviate from its glide path. ""This wind shift will most likely be part of the focus of this investigation,"" said Capt. Kevin Hiatt of the Flight Safety Foundation. ""The captain evidently saw something that concerned him enough that he elected to take control of the aircraft at that time,"" Hiatt said. ""Does it happen? Not often. Does it happen sometimes? Yes, it does."" While emphasizing that it is still early in the investigation, pilots consulted by CNN said it is unusual for a pilot to take control of an aircraft in the final moments of landing. Investigators likely are questioning the pilot about that decision, and, if there were problems with the approach, why he did not abort the landing. ""That's a key question: why did the captain feel the need to take over?"" said Mark Weiss, a former 737 pilot and civil aviation leader at The Spectrum Group in Washington. Commercial aircraft can manage abrupt changes in wind direction, experts say. But the changing wind direction would have tilted the plane nose-up, and the pilot may have responded by pushing the nose down to maintain the proper glide path, pilots contacted by CNN speculated. 'It was pretty chaotic' as landing gear collapses, passenger says . The Boeing 737-700 aircraft went from a 2 degrees nose-up attitude, when the plane was about 32 feet off the ground, to a 3-degrees nose-down attitude upon landing seconds later, according to information previously released by the NTSB. The plane landed nose wheels first, instead of on the main landing gear as designed, and the nose gear collapsed, sending the plane on a lengthy skid down the runway. About 10 passengers were injured. The NTSB said it has thus far found no anomalies or mechanical malfunctions with the plane. It is continuing its investigation. Among the new details released Tuesday by the safety board: . -- The captain of Southwest Flight 345 had flown for the airline for almost 13 years and had been a captain for six of those years. He had 12,000 total flight hours, including 2,600 hours as pilot-in-command of B-737s. This was the pilot's second flight into LaGuardia, and he was ""pilot monitoring"" in both instances. (Pilots tell CNN the captain's inexperience flying into LaGuardia was likely not a factor in the incident. Commercial pilots frequently fly into unfamiliar airports and study the approaches before landing. In addition, the pilots of Flight 345 were using an operational instrument landing system, which should have assisted in making the landing routine.) -- The first officer had been with Southwest for 18 months and had 5,200 total flight hours, with 4,000 as pilot-in-command. He had about 1,100 hours in B-737s, with none of those as pilot-in-command. The first officer had experience at LaGuardia, including six flights this year. -- This was the first trip the flight crew had flown together and was the second leg of the trip. -- The weather in the New York area caused the flight to enter a holding pattern for about 15 minutes. The crew reported that they saw the airport from about 5 to 10 miles out and that the airplane was on speed, course and glide slope down to about 200 to 400 feet. -- Investigators have five videos showing various aspects of the crash landing.","Southwest Flight 345's captain took over during LaGuardia landing, NTSB says .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said he is not seeking ""regime change"" in Syria. Military action in Syria, he said this weekend as he sought congressional approval, will be limited. These assurances are meant to reassure those who fear a repeat of Iraq. But the idea of a limited intervention is an illusion. Once the United States becomes directly involved in Syria, there can be no turning back. The purpose of limited strikes would be to convey a message to Bashar al-Assad: Don't use chemical weapons. But a U.S. attack could potentially widen, rather than halt, the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Syria, as a united entity, exists today only on the map. On the ground, competing interests have fractured the country. No party can claim to represent even a modest plurality of Syrians, and no power can claim authority over a majority of the territory. But a formidable Arab state exists in Damascus, and the numerous forces striving to seize it or bring about its demise are so hopelessly riven internally that they cannot possibly win without external support. For more than two years now, they have attempted to incite Western intervention by exhibiting evidence of the Assad government's brutality. Is it 'High Noon' for Obama on Syria? By intervening now to inflict limited punishment on al-Assad because chemical weapons have been used, the United States is erecting a precedent that could be exploited in the future by the more unscrupulous factions of the opposition looking to provoke further interventions. The knowledge that Washington will intervene if chemical weapons are used could create an incentive for their re-use by those who would benefit from such an intervention. By seemingly spurning meticulous multilateral investigations led by the United Nations in a rush to fix the blame on al-Assad, the United States is signaling also that, in its opinion, only the regime is capable of carrying out large-scale chemical attacks. This template will produce deadly temptations. As the novelist Amitav Ghosh, who spent long years studying insurgencies in Asia, has observed, in civil conflicts ""the very prospect of intervention"" often becomes a stimulus for the ""the escalation of violence"" by the weaker side. If limited use of chemical weapons can succeed in drawing the United States into the conflict in a way that 100,000 deaths by conventional arms could not, they could be viewed by al-Assad's adversaries -- particularly by the foreign fighters affiliated with al Qaeda -- as a blessing rather than a scourge. The effort to ""liberate"" Syria could become dependent for its success on the partial annihilation of Syrians with chemical weapons -- since they are the only agents of murder that can trigger a U.S. reaction. We cannot be certain about the security of the chemical weapon stockpiles in the Syrian government's custody. Its power structure has so far remained largely intact, but, as last year's suicide bombing in Damascus that killed al-Assad's inner circle and maimed his brother demonstrated, the regime is not impregnable. Syria vote could have consequences for 2016 . In a land shattered by war, loyalties are constantly shifting and obtaining fatal nerve agents may not be tremendously difficult. In 1995, for example, an obscure Japanese cult called Aum Shinrikyo managed to kill 13 passengers on the Tokyo subway by releasing sarin gas developed from commercially available chemicals. So what will the United States do the next time chemical weapons are used in Syria? More than 1,000 deaths are prompting the United States -- despite the absence of conclusive evidence linking the Assad regime to the crime -- to intervene. Can it refuse to live up to its own precedent if 10,000 Syrians were killed in a fresh massacre after Obama's ""limited"" intervention has concluded? Won't the voices that are now so stridently opposing patient investigations and diplomacy in favor of military action amplify their demands? But a deeper military involvement will be so self-wounding as to be suicidal. Syria has become a catchment for foreign fighters from more than 60 countries. Their ambition is not simply to defeat al-Assad. It is to establish a theocratic state in the most resolutely secular corner of the Arab world. It is the rise of these jihadists that has compelled Syria's secularists and religious minorities, who at the beginning of the uprising in 2011 had marched alongside the opposition, to return to al-Assad's fold. To rid Syria of al-Assad's dictatorship and prevent it from falling into the hands of jihadists who are cut from the same ideological cloth as the men who drove the planes into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the United States may have to commit itself to Syria for more than a decade -- fighting the jihadists, subduing al-Assad and his allies in Hezbollah, protecting Israel and preserving Lebanon's fragile peace. After Afghanistan and Iraq, is there an appetite for such an enterprise anywhere? Military has concerns about Syria mission . Intervening in Syria will perhaps pacify Obama's conscience. But in Syria, there's every chance that it will escalate the conflict. Ultimately tantalizing the losing side in the Syrian civil war with a brief, punitive, ""limited"" entry on its behalf will only hasten the creation of conditions that will eventually suck America back into the conflict. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kapil Komireddi.","Kapil Komireddi: If U.S. engages in Syria over chemical weapons, it could be in for the long haul .

"(CNN) -- Kendrick Johnson, the teenager whose body was found rolled in a wrestling mat in a south Georgia high school in January died from blows to the neck and elsewhere, not from accidental suffocation, a newly released, independent autopsy report says. The report, obtained exclusively by CNN, directly contradicts the finding of an autopsy conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that determined Johnson's death was the result of ""positional asphyxia."" The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office determined it was accidental. The new report blames ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" Johnson, 17, was found January 11 in a rolled wrestling mat in a Lowndes County High School gym in Valdosta. Inconsistencies in the initial official reports on the condition of Johnson's body led the family and community to question the ruling on the cause of death. The family's attorney, Chevene King, has sent the independent autopsy report to the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney for Georgia's Middle District and the Lowndes County coroner for review. The coroner has the power to call an inquest, a process that resembles a grand jury proceeding. After reviewing evidence and testimony, a jury would decide the cause of death, although the findings alone would have no civil or criminal consequences. ""Coroner's inquests are not something you do every day. I cannot tell you the last time a coroner's inquest was done in this office,"" Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson told CNN. ""I want to do the right thing by the people and the county and all concerned, I'm just not sure we have enough information,"" he said. ""I'm not about to refute anybody's findings because I'm not a doctor."" On May 1, a judge granted the Johnsons' request to exhume their son's body for the purposes of a conducting an independent autopsy at their expense. That autopsy, conducted June 15, found blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues ""consistent with inflicted injury."" That supports the narrative of the initial patient care report, written January 11, the day Johnson's body was discovered, citing ""bruising noted to the right side jaw."" However, the January 25 report by the Valdosta-Lowndes County Regional Crime Laboratory cited ""no signs of blunt force trauma on Johnson's face or body."" The May 5 autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified ""no significant injuries"" A spokesperson for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told CNN it stands by its report after reviewing the findings of the independent autopsy. U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said his office has been ""working on this for some time. I'm sure at the appropriate time I'll speak with his pathologist."" Moore is reviewing the case but has not launched a formal investigation. ""There are some members of the community that question the result. I want to make sure members of the community and the family and everyone involved has confidence in my work and my decision,"" Moore told CNN. There was no immediate response to CNN's request for comment from the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. The Johnsons' attorney told CNN he will respond at a later date.","Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a wrestling mat in a Lowndes County school .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Asiana Airlines says it will proceed with its planned lawsuit against an Oakland, California, television station, but it's not going to pursue legal action against the National Transportation Safety Board. Over the weekend, the Korean airline had said it would sue both entities after an intern at the NTSB mistakenly confirmed ""inaccurate and offensive"" names as those of the pilots of Flight 214, which crash-landed nine days ago at San Francisco International Airport. The bogus names that phonetically spelled out phrases such as ""Something Wrong"" and ""We Too Low"" were read during KTVU's noon broadcast Friday. The airline called the report ""demeaning"" and said it was ""reviewing possible legal action."" On Monday morning, the airline seemed to have a partial change of heart, at least concerning the NTSB. Airline spokesman Na Chul-hee said Asiana has retained a U.S. law firm to file a defamation claim against the TV station. But, he said, the company didn't have plans to file a separate suit against the NTSB. ""After a legal review, the company decided to file a lawsuit against the network because it was their report that resulted in damaging the company's image,"" he said. KTVU anchor Tori Campbell read the names Friday. The news station, a CNN affiliate, later apologized on air and on its website. ""We sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites,"" according to Tom Raponi, KTVU/KICU vice president and general manager. ""Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again."" The key to a defamation case is to determine whether what was said damages an entity's reputation and causes injury, and what care was taken, if any, to prevent that, said Ken Paulson, president of the First Amendment Center and the dean of the College of Mass Communication at Middle Tennessee State University. ""It's very difficult to conceive of a defamation suit prevailing here,"" he told CNN. ""Everyone who heard this understood it was a prank. And as ludicrous as the report was, at least the news station made a call to try to check."" KTVU said the names it gave were confirmed by an NTSB official in Washington before they were aired. The NTSB apologized for the ""inaccurate and offensive"" names, which it said were erroneously confirmed by a summer intern. A government official with knowledge of the situation said Monday the intern is no longer with the agency. ""Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,"" the NTSB said Friday in a statement. Paulson notes that the real names of pilots were not given in the news report. ""Where is the real damage? Yes, it was tasteless and undoubtedly it caused some short-term emotional distress, but nothing that rises to the level of litigation,"" he said. NTSB: 2 Asiana pilots call for landing to be aborted . It was not immediately clear who produced the fake names, but the NTSB said it was not the intern. ""The names were presented, by the station, to the intern for confirmation,"" NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. ""The intern did not make up the names and provide them to the station."" The NTSB said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or other people involved in transportation accidents. ""We work hard to ensure that only appropriate factual information regarding an investigation is released and deeply regret today's incident,"" the NTSB statement said. The NTSB did not identify the intern, but said, ""Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A man has been arrested for making threats against Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, law enforcement officials said Thursday. Anirruddha Sherbow was apprehended by Mexican law enforcement officers in Tijuana on Wednesday. The FBI and U.S. Capitol Police said Sherbow made threats against the Hawaii Democrat this month that were ""deemed credible."" Officials would not describe the nature of any statements allegedly made by Sherbow involving the congresswoman, and court documents remain under seal. According to the Hawaii Reporter, Sherbow, a former resident of Hawaii, sent an e-mail to the FBI threatening to decapitate Gabbard. That report also said Gabbard obtained a three-year restraining order against Sherbow in 2011. Sherbow is facing a charge of transmission of threats in interstate commerce. Mexican authorities turned Sherbow over to FBI agents in San Diego, where he is expected to have a court appearance on Friday. Gabbard's press secretary, Heather Fluit, said the congresswoman was ""grateful for the work of the U.S. Capitol Police, FBI and all law enforcement officers involved in this investigation.""","Law enforcement officials say Anirruddha Sherbow threatened Hawaii Democrat .

"(CNN) -- For some, going to work after losing a son would be unthinkable. For others, it's a way to cope. That's the route Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson took, choosing to play Sunday, just two days after the death of his son, who was living with his mother in South Dakota. The woman's 27-year-old boyfriend, Joseph Robert Patterson, has been arrested on felony battery and assault charges in the child's death, according to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, police. ""Even if it's bad, I try and take the good from it. That's the way I approach life, with all situations,"" Peterson told reporters after the game. ""I never thought about not playing. It was all about going out there and praying that I had the strength to get through and help my team, so that was my focus."" Peterson, who rushed for a season-low 62 yards and caught three passes for 21 yards in the Vikings' 35-10 loss to the Carolina Panthers, took some heat for the decision from people who questioned how he could play a football game so soon after losing a child. In a text to a Fox Sports reporter, Peterson said he decided to play Sunday for the same reason he participated in the NFL's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007. ""God wants good to come from it,"" he told NFL on FOX sideline reporter Laura Okmin in a text before the game Sunday. ""We mourn and grieve, but heaven had the baddest welcoming party for my son. That knowledge gives me peace,"" Peterson said, according to Fox. ""I'm still hurt and feel the pain of life, but I'm able to function because of the peace and joy of knowing my loved ones are in a much better place."" Peterson confirmed the child was his in a tweet Friday. He tweeted that another child, Adrian Peterson Jr., lives with him and is fine, and he asked people to stop distributing pictures of that child. On Friday, he tweeted thanks to fellow players, some of whom had taken to the social network to defend his decision to play. ""The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets, phone calls and text messages from my fellow players,"" he tweeted Friday. After Sunday's game, Peterson's teammate, tight end Kyle Rudolph, praised Peterson's determination and heart. ""I can't imagine, you know, the heavy heart that he had today, being out on the field,"" Rudolph said. ""But he spoke to us right before the game, right before he took the field and said he was going to give it his all, for all four quarters, and that's exactly what he did."" ""He said, 'I'm going to give it my all, and I expect you guys to do the same,' "" Rudolph said.

"(CNN) -- Neanderthals likely died off about 30,000 years ago, but they may have come up with a tool-making technique that influenced later humans in Europe, a new study suggests. Scientists have uncovered evidence that Neanderthals were making specialized bone tools before modern humans arrived in Europe. ""It opens the possibility that in this case, maybe they"" -- modern humans in Europe -- ""learned this tool type from Neanderthals,"" said Shannon McPherron, co-author of the study and an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. This is only one possible scenario, however. Another is that modern humans arrived earlier than scientists thought, and influenced Neanderthals' tool-making. Or maybe the groups just came up with the same ideas independently. Archaeologists will need to keep digging for more evidence. The new research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The artifacts, approximately 50,000 years old, come from two locations in France. Modern humans are thought to have arrived in Europe some 40,000 years ago. One of the sites is a classic Neanderthal cave site called Pech-de-l'Aze. There, researchers found part of the tip of a bone tool, just a few centimeters long. Scientists believe it is part of a bone tool because of how rounded and polished the tip is. The other site is Abri Peyrony, located about 35 kilometers away in a shallow valley up against a low cliff base, McPherron said. At Abri Peyrony, excavators found two more fragments like the one at Pech-de-l'Aze, and a complete tool specimen. McPherron said both of these sites are known to be the stomping grounds of Neanderthals because other fossils and tools characteristic of their species have been found there, and artifacts and bones from modern humans have not been uncovered there. At Pech-de-l'Aze, the skull of a Neanderthal child was found. ""Here we have just Neanderthal deposits, and so we can rule out any contamination from later time period deposits,"" McPherron said. Scientists already knew that Neanderthals could make bone tools, but previous specimens looked just like their stone tools. Archaeologists had established that Neanderthals would take bones and remove flakes to make scrapers, notch tools and hand axes, McPherron said. These tools didn't make use of the inherently distinct properties of bone. ""This paper adds further evidence that during their final 20,000 years, the Neanderthals displayed aspects of behavioral complexity that we normally associate with modern humans,"" said Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the study, in an e-mail. The four newly discovered tool fragments appear very similar to a leather smoother called a lissoir, meaning ""to make smooth."" Neanderthals appear to have made them from the ribs of an animal the size of a red deer. Feeling like a Neanderthal? Here's why . A lissoir compacts a hide, makes the leather more water resistant and easier to work with, and gives it a shine, McPherron said. This type of tool is commonly found at some of the oldest modern human sites in Western Europe. High-end leather workers today still use such tools. To emphasize this point, McPherron and colleagues bought one on the Internet. Researchers compared the wear and tear on one of their specimens to damage to a tool that the researchers produced themselves, used against a hide. They found similarities -- but they haven't proven that the Neanderthal tools were for leather crafting. ""A whole study has to be done to actually demonstrate that that's what they were used for,"" he said. The lissoir is a tool made of bone that cannot be made of stone, McPherron said. It ""takes advantage of the flexibility and pliability and supple aspects of bone."" These are the oldest specialized bone tools -- meaning they were made in a way that focuses on the properties of bone -- in Europe, McPherron said. They are not the oldest in the world. In Africa, modern humans were making similarly complicated bone tools around the same time. In Turkey, sophisticated bone tools have been found as well, from about the same time. So, did Neanderthals learn these tool-making technologies from humans who came from elsewhere? If that's the case, that means modern humans were in Europe earlier than previously believed, McPherron said. He and his colleagues suspect that these tools predate the arrival of humans, which would suggest that Neanderthals invented them independently. But he suspects there will be debate about whether the 50,000-year-old tools are old enough to be certain that there weren't already modern humans in Europe. There are still a lot of open questions: How widespread are these tools? How did Neanderthals make them, and how did modern humans make them? What kind of animals were used? Ron Pinhasi, researcher at the University College Dublin, called this research ""an important and interesting study"" in an e-mail. But he noted that this does not suggest that Neanderthals had the same cognitive capacities as modern humans. Cave art and art objects are one of the hallmarks of modern humans during this time period, called the Upper Palaeolithic. There have not been any clear-cut discoveries of Neanderthals making bone ornaments or other such objects, Pinhasi said. ""In my opinion, it is the capacity to produce objects whose function is non-utilitarian (and most likely symbolic) which marks a major leap in human evolution and this leap is not yet evidenced in the case of Neanderthals and other premodern humans,"" Pinhasi said. So, Neanderthals may not have been carving bone for art's sake, but they may have independently invented something useful enough to be sold online today.","Archaeologists uncover 50,000-year-old specialized bone tools .
The tools are discovered at Neanderthal sites .
Modern humans are thought to have arrived in Europe at least 40,000 years ago ."
"(CNN) -- Japan says it will hunt whales in the Southern Ocean this winter and will send a Fisheries Agency ship to guard its whalers against promised intervention by a conservation group. ""The Fisheries Agency will send a patrol boat and take increased measures to strengthen the protection given to the research whaling ships,"" Fisheries Minister Michihiko Kano said at a news conference Tuesday. At its annual meeting in July, the International Whaling Commission passed a resolution calling on its member countries ""to cooperate to prevent and suppress actions that risk human life and property at sea."" Last winter, Japan cut short its planned December-to-April hunt by two months after anti-whaling activists from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society repeatedly interfered with the whaling vessels. Sea Shepherd claims it saved 800 whales by its actions during last season's hunt. Japanese whalers killed 171 minke whales and two fin whales during the Antarctic hunt, according to IWC figures. In a statement issued last Friday, Sea Shepherd vowed to take on the whaling vessels again. ""They will have to kill us to prevent us from intervening once again. ... We will undertake whatever risks to our lives will be required to stop this invasion of arrogant greed into what is an established sanctuary for the whales,"" Sea Shepherd's leader, Paul Watson, said in a statement on the organization's website. Sea Shepherd will have more than 100 people in the Southern Ocean to block the Japanese whaling fleet, according to the statement. Kano said Japan wants to continue research whaling with the aim of establishing that whale stocks are sufficient to resume a full commercial hunt in the future, according to Japanese media reports. Sea Shepherd contends that the research hunts are a sham, with meat from the hunts being sold to consumers and served in restaurants. Australia's government condemned Japan's decision to resume its research hunt and its plans for future commercial hunts. ""The Australian government remains opposed to all commercial whaling, including so-called 'scientific whaling.' We will keep working to achieve a permanent end to all commercial whaling,"" Environment Minister Tony Burke said in a statement. ""Australia believes Japan's whaling is contrary to international law and should stop,"" Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland said. ""That is why Australia is taking our case in the International Court of Justice to bring to an end Southern Ocean whaling permanently."" Japan also hunts whales in the Northern Pacific, taking 100 sei whales, 50 Bryde's, 119 minke and three sperm whales last season, according to the IWC. Iceland and Norway also conduct whale hunts. Aboriginal whale hunts are permitted in the Danish territory of Greenland, the United States, Russia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.","Japan's hunt last winter was cut short 2 months due to activists .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A group of former U.S. military and intelligence officers, including retired Navy SEALs, appear in a 22-minute documentary that was released on Wednesday asserting that the Obama administration has leaked considerable classified intelligence about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden for political gain. They also claim that the administration has given itself too much credit for this feat of American arms and intelligence gathering. The film even makes the dramatic charge that the Obama administration is ""purposefully putting lives in jeopardy"" because of its purported leaks about national security. The charges bear some resemblance to the ""Swift Boat"" tactics used against Sen. John Kerry in the tight 2004 presidential election against President George W. Bush in which Kerry's service in Vietnam, seemingly a strength of the candidate, was turned into a weakness. GOP strategists: Bain attack ads are this year's Swift Boat campaign . The particulars of the indictment against Obama as laid out in the new film, which is titled ""Dishonorable Disclosures,"" are: . -- The president announced the bin Laden raid before intelligence picked up from bin Laden's compound could be fully exploited. -- The use of hitherto covert ""stealth"" helicopters on the raid was publicized. -- The name of the secret unit that executed the raid --SEAL Team Six -- was made public putting them and their families at risk. -- The name of the Pakistani doctor recruited by the CIA to help find bin Laden was leaked, jeopardizing him and the CIA's ability to recruit spies in the future. The doctor is now serving 33 years in a Pakistani prison. Pakistani doctor who helped US appeals verdict . -- Obama has taken way too much credit for killing al Qaeda's leader. ""Mr. President, you did not kill Osama bin Laden, America did. The work that the American military has done killed Osama bin Laden. You did not,"" says a former Navy SEAL interviewed in the film. Criticism of the way that the bin Laden raid has been discussed publicly by the Obama administration makes up the bulk of ""Dishonorable Disclosures,"" but the administration is also taken to task for supposedly leaking details of covert U.S. actions against the Iranian nuclear program to New York Times reporter David Sanger (who has said he was not the recipient of ""deliberate leaks out of the White House"") and outlining to other journalists the personal involvement of Obama in selecting targets for the CIA drone program in Pakistan. One former Navy SEAL featured in the film demands dramatically, ""Tell the president to stop leaking information to the enemy."" Is there any merit to these serious accusations? In fact, Obama and his national security team made every effort -- successfully -- to keep the intelligence about bin Laden a closely held secret for almost a year, from the time they first identified what they believed might be the al Qaeda leader's hideout in the city of Abbottabad, Pakistan, in August 2010 until May 1, 2011, when the raid was launched to kill him. The raid itself was conducted as a covert operation under the overall direction of then-CIA Director Leon Panetta. I have written a book about the hunt for bin Laden during the course of which I was the only journalist granted access by the Pakistanis inside the compound in Abbottabad where bin Laden was killed. I also spoke on the record about the hunt for bin Laden with a variety of current White House, Pentagon and intelligence officials, as well as former Defense Department and CIA officials familiar with aspects of the story. None of them divulged classified information about the bin Laden operation. Indeed, they went to great pains to avoid doing so. What precipitated the operation going public was not Obama's announcement of the raid but the crash of one of the Black Hawk choppers used in the raid, which turned what had hitherto been a covert operation into a very public event. Pakistani journalists started arriving at bin Laden's Abbottabad compound soon after the helicopter crashed and started filing stories about the mysterious helicopter and its oddly shaped tail rotor. An Abbottabad resident even tweeted about the unusual sound of helicopters flying over the city in the middle of the night. It wasn't much of a leap for reporters to ascertain that these helicopters had particular features that had prevented them from being detected by Pakistani radar. Soon after the SEALs had raided the Abbottabad command, Pakistani officials on the ground were interrogating bin Laden's wives and children at the compound who told them that bin Laden had just been killed. None of this was going to stay secret for long. Indeed, it was Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Pakistan's top military officer, who sped up the Obama administration's announcement of the raid. A few hours after the raid, Kayani told his American counterpart, Adm. Mike Mullen, ""Our people need to understand what happened here. We're not going to be able to manage the Pakistani media without you confirming this. You can explain it to them. They need to understand that this was bin Laden and not just some ordinary U.S. operation."" Mullen then told Obama and his national security team, ""Kayani has asked for us to go public,"" which swayed Obama to announce the raid sooner than was planned. (Obama wanted to wait for 100% DNA confirmation that it was bin Laden. At the time of the president's announcement about the raid the confirmation was at 95%.) During his speech to the nation and world, Obama did not divulge the name of SEAL Team Six, saying only that a ""small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability."" A visit to Osama bin Laden's lair . It quickly leaked that SEAL Team Six had executed the raid, but this was hardly surprising as the SEALs are the principal Special Operations Forces in the Afghanistan/Pakistan theater, something that has been discussed in multiple news stories over the past several years and in bestselling books such as ""Lone Survivor"" by former Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell. And the SEALs have hardly kept a low profile of late, cooperating in a movie ""Act of Valor"" that was released in theaters this year, which actually featured real SEALs playing the parts of the heroes of the movie. Perhaps if you had absolutely no knowledge of the U.S. military, or indeed access to Wikipedia where SEAL Team Six has had an entry since 2004, it would be news to you that SEAL Team Six, along with the Army's Delta Force, are America's premier counterterrorism units. Obviously, a mission to take out bin Laden would not be entrusted to any other than these elite units. So the notion that the public naming of the unit that killed bin Laden endangers the lives of its members and their families is overwrought. Members of SEAL Team Six are well able to take care of themselves and their families. And who first leaked the involvement of SEAL Team Six in the bin Laden operation remains unclear. It is just plain wrong that anyone in the U.S. government leaked the name of the CIA asset in Pakistan, Dr Shakil Afridi, who was recruited by the agency in its quest to find bin Laden. This information first surfaced in a story in the Guardian newspaper in July 2011 after Afridi was arrested by the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. It is obvious that this information was leaked not by the Americans but the Pakistanis who have done their own investigation of the bin Laden raid, which embarrassed them considerably. As to the notion that Obama has taken too much credit for the bin Laden raid, well he is commander-in-chief, and it was entirely his decision to launch the risky raid on Abbottabad based on the only fragmentary intelligence that bin Laden might be there. As Adm. William McRaven, who was the military commander of the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last month, ""at the end of the day, make no mistake about it, it was the president of the United States that shouldered the burden for this operation, that made the hard decisions, that was instrumental in the planning process, because I pitched every plan to him."" The raid decision was opposed by Vice President Joe Biden, who had run for the Democratic nomination for the presidency against Obama. If Biden had won the White House in 2008, Osama bin Laden might still be alive. And the decision to do the raid was also opposed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who had served every president going back to Richard Nixon. Gates was concerned about some kind of replay of the 1980 Iran hostage rescue debacle, which helped to turn President Jimmy Carter into a one-term president. The notion that the decision to greenlight the risky raid was made by anyone other than Obama is just plain silly, and it was a decision he made against the advice of both his vice president and his secretary of defense. The film ""Dishonorable Disclosures"" gets even sillier. At one point one of the former officers interviewed for the film charges that the Obama administration ""divulged to the world we are using drone technology."" The fact that the United States uses drones in Pakistan is one of the world's worst kept secrets. In fact, the New America Foundation where I work has maintained a public database of these attacks since early 2010.' First look at the Osama bin Laden movie . Similarly, the claim that the Obama administration has recently leaked information about the Stuxnet virus attacks on the Iranian nuclear program to the New York Times is overblown, as this information has been reported since 2010, and the Iranians themselves publicly acknowledged that their nuclear program was under cyberattack two years ago. It is true that the U.S. role in the cyberattacks was disclosed in the New York Times. And in June, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed two federal prosecutors to investigate leaks including the New York Times story about Obama ordering the cyberattacks against Iran with the Stuxnet virus. There remains much that is unknown about the still-classified intelligence surrounding the bin Laden raid, including: . -- How did the CIA find the real name of bin Laden's courier who was the key to finding him? -- How was the courier's cell phone first tracked down? -- How was he tracked to bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad? -- How did the CIA establish a safe house in Abbottabad? And who staffed it? None of this information has been leaked, and it remains classified for good reason as it gets into the CIA's ""sources and methods."" Don't expect to hear any of those details any time soon.","Former U.S. officers accuse Obama of leaking classified information for political gain .

"(CNN) -- Michael Petrina's mother passed away from Alzheimer's disease 15 years ago. That's one of the reasons the 67-year-old retired attorney works his mind so hard. Petrina took first place in the AARP National Spelling Bee on Sunday, beating more than 50 contestants in 47 rounds. The winning word? Rhizoctonia, a genus of imperfect fungi. ""R-H-I-Z...,"" Petrina started to spell before breaking into laughter as he spoke to CNN Monday. ""Is that right? I hope. I'll look it up while we're talking."" The AARP started the spelling bee in 1996 as a way to motivate members to keep their minds sharp. While Alzheimer's and other types of dementia are a big concern for seniors, even normal aging can slow the brain's processes over time. As fetuses at six months, ""we actually have more brain cells than we will ever have in our lives,"" Dr. Gregory Jicha says. ""[After] six months in the womb, nerve cells start dying."" As an associate professor of neurology, Jicha works at the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging in Lexington, Kentucky. Since 1989, the center has been studying the healthy brains of seniors in hopes of identifying exactly what keeps someone from developing a cognitive disorder. Researchers have some ideas, Jicha says, but there's little definitive evidence. Part of the problem is the brain's complexity; each type of memory is affected differently as we age.The good news is that it's not all bad news, says Dr. Suzanna Penningroth, a gerontologist from the University of Wyoming. Your brain's processing speed -- how fast you can interpret and recall information -- slows as you age, according to Penningroth. Episodic memory, like what you ate for breakfast this morning, is also on the decline. But studies have shown seniors are much better at prospective memory, such as remembering to take a daily medication, and have larger knowledge bases than younger generations. Penningroth says that semantic memory stays strong as we age. The aging brain: Why getting older just might be awesome . In other words, you might not remember where you parked this morning but you'll always remember how to drive. Here are some tips to keep your thinking skills sharp, starting now: . Engage the mind . To prepare for the spelling bee, Petrina wrote out 20,000 words on flashcards and went over them again and again. He also enjoys crossword puzzles and reads often to keep his mind active. Fortunately for those who aren't bookworms, mind engagement can come in many forms. Learning a new dance or musical instrument counts, Jicha says. So does playing card games or adding up scores during a game of golf. Enrich your environment . The amount of time we spend communicating often declines with age. Americans age 55 to 64 spend 13% of their time socializing and communicating, compared to 8% of those older than 75, according to the 2010 Older Americans report.Studies have shown that lab animals in an empty cage form far fewer nerve cell connections than those who are given neighbors and toys. ""We can take that as a lesson, that we as human beings need to be in an enriched environment,"" Jicha says. ""In the face of the fact that we're losing nerve cells every day, we need to keep making these new connections.""Case in point -- the morning after the AARP competition, Petrina was packing for a trip to Turkey. Whether it's for work or pleasure, Jicha says new experiences are an important part of keeping the mind healthy. Eat right . The mind uses nutrients as building blocks to form new connections, Jicha explains. Since the brain is one of the fattiest organs, eating omega-3 fatty acids from fish, seeds and nuts can help rebuild damaged tissue. Brain suffers when fish oil falls short . Also important is eating fresh vegetables and fruits. Their antioxidants help defend and repair our cells, Jicha says.""Our brain, we're only given one. If we're going to live to 80, we've got 80 years of healthy nerve cell life we have to protect."" Exercise Petrina works out with a trainer twice a week. He knows exercise is important for keeping his brain fit.Exercise can stimulate cell growth, Jicha says. One area of the brain that can produce new cells is the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory.""It's nice to know that something as simple as physical exercise can actually lead to biological change,"" he says. Exercise also keeps the cardiovascular system working efficiently, increasing blood flow to the brain and reducing the risk of vascular dementia. Strength-training key in preventing Alzheimer's . Encode better . Even if you eat right, exercise frequently and stay engaged with your environment, your mind is going to fade, Penningroth says. ""You just have to know what your weaknesses are. If you understand these weaknesses you can easily compensate."" To boost memory, shut your eyes . Paying attention is the first step to encoding new information, she says. Use repetition, like saying a new friend's name several times to make sure it sticks. Then keep checklists or other aids to help you complete important tasks.If nothing else, try to remember that everyone is in the same sinking boat as you are. ""I always like to kid that I think my brain was at its best at 25,"" Jicha says. ""And it's been downhill ever since."" 10 best cities for successful aging .","The AARP National Spelling Bee started in 1996 to motivate members to keep minds sharp .

"(Parenting) -- I was scrolling through family photos on my computer, admiring my two beautiful babies, when I spotted a disturbing trend: My laptop was open in almost all of the pictures. There's my daughter, at 8 months, playing at my feet while I typed away on the couch. There's me and my son, a year later, with the laptop at my side as I held him in my arms. I'd heard about Internet addiction before, but always assumed it was something limited to socially challenged guys who played too much World of Warcraft. Now it seemed my Internet ""habit"" was slowly but surely crossing the line. Sometimes I found myself up into the wee hours of the morning, surfing the Web while my family slept. I read the news, kept up with friends, and looked up answers to endless questions. I wrote my personal blog and read dozens of others, just for something to do. It turns out I'm not the only mama who plugs in and zones out. Coleen Moore, coordinator of resource development at the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery in Peoria, says that she's seeing more and more women coming in for Internet addiction. They're young, they're often new mothers, and they're addicted to blogs, message boards, and Second Life, she says. These moms are contributing to a growing global addiction. There's a movement among psychiatrists to recognize Internet addiction as an official mental disorder (just like alcohol dependency). And a recent Stanford University national survey found that 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from it for several days at a time; 9 percent try to hide their ""nonessential Internet use"" from their loved ones; 8 percent admit they use the Web as a way to escape problems. You're likely not the kind of addict that Moore has seen -- women who don't bathe and abuse drugs to help them stay ""up"" for more online time. You may have noticed, though, that going online has become an imposing part of your life, which, at the least, means a load or two of laundry goes unwashed (and who cares about that?). But it may also mean you're missing out on time with your baby -- something you probably do care about. Here, why we're so susceptible as new moms to that blue glow of the screen.

Since her husband works long hours, Barksdale was alone most of the day. ""When my husband got home from work, I was clingy and dying for someone to talk to. I started to feel like a crazy person. I was becoming depressed without any interaction,"" she says. Parenting: When postpartum depression lasts . Desperate, she went online and found the community she needed. ""I'd talk to people in chat rooms for hours."" But not about babies or parenting. ""I needed to feel like a normal person who could have normal conversations that weren't about breastfeeding or how many ounces my son gained."" Soon, she was spending as many as eight hours online every day. ""In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void,"" says Moore. ""Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical -- typically, we're trying to fill it."" For many new moms, she says, that void is the isolation -- both the tangible isolation of being home alone with a demanding newborn and the mental isolation of diving into uncharted waters -- they often experience during the transition to parenthood. ""Being a mom of young children can be very solitary,"" agrees Jay Parker, cofounder of Internet/Computer Addiction Services in Redmond, Washington. So it's easy for them to turn online, he explains, to find other parents and create a world there where they are not alone. Once that world is created, it becomes an escape that moms may turn to whenever they're stressed, lonely, bored, or sad. In addiction, they become dependent on that escape. Parenting: Ways to beat new-mom stress . ""I called it my 'avoidance cycle,'"" says Jessica Rigby (her name has been changed), a pregnant mother of three from Idaho who used to write four blogs. ""Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I would escape into mindless Web surfing. I'd find myself circling through the comments section on my blogs to my photos on Flickr to see if anyone had commented on them, and then over to Twitter to see if anyone was chatting with me there. I'd waste hours just waiting for someone to respond to something I'd said or posted."" Because she'd skip errands and allow her kids to make a mess of the house, she says, her stress only amplified, and she'd dive into the avoidance cycle all over again. And even now that Barksdale's son is a healthy 5 months and allowed to socialize, she still finds it hard to resist the Net. ""Today, I had to unplug my computer so I wouldn't go online,"" she says. ""I probably spend the same amount of time online as I did when it was all I could do."" 'I can be a different person' If it were just an escape that moms were looking for, however, they could flip on the TV or pick up a book. But according to a recent Babytalk.com poll, more than double the number of moms choose the computer over books or the boob tube during their babies' naps, showing that they're looking for something more than an escape: connection, yes, but also a way to express themselves. After giving birth, says Moore, many women feel like they've given up their identity to the all-consuming role of ""mother."" ""It's another sense of loss common in new moms,"" she says. Flirting with ex-boyfriends on Facebook or buying a handbag online may remind us of the people we used to be -- the working woman, the woman who had time for art projects, the woman who wore skirts and lipstick. ""I'm just a mother in real life, but online, I can be a whole person,"" says Ashley Bryan, a mom of 2-year-old twins from Las Vegas, of her four-hour-a-day online habit. On virtual-living sites like Second Life, where users create avatars, moms can become anyone from a leather-wearing motorcycle chick to a college cheerleader. In moderation, trying on different personas can be healthy, assures Moore. It becomes problematic when the online identity becomes so appealing that you neglect your real-life role. Parenting: Moms' dirty little secrets . ""My husband feels like I don't spend enough time with him,"" says Bryan. ""He says that every time he's home and can watch the girls, I dash online."" 'I have so much to do!' Online, you can pay bills, order diapers, upload photos, and look up possible causes of your kid's constipation. In fact, you can almost accomplish too much online. ""Ticking items off a to-do list is intoxicating when you feel like you don't have much control over other parts of your life,"" says Parker (and what's more uncontrollable than life with a newborn?). Diane Anderson, mom of a 7-month-old in Memphis, knows the feeling. ""I started following coupon sites and became so engrossed in finding deals that I neglected the important things, like time with my son, for a while."" After the Internet, real life can seem, well, unproductive. ""When I play with my boys, I feel like I should be getting something done,"" says one mom of 18-month-old twins in New York City. ""I almost get antsy just hanging out with them, and I take regular breaks to check my e-mail, respond to a Facebook friend request, or order photos from Snapfish. I'm addicted to online errands.""

Then assess what you're missing out on when you do it -- sleep, family time, work? Also note in your journal what was going on each time you decided to sit down at the computer. Was it right after a fight with your husband? Were you bored? By figuring out the triggers that send you seeking refuge online, Moore says, you can come up with alternative activities that help you deal. If you're stressed, for example, you might take your baby out for a walk. Moore also suggests making small weekly goals that get you involved with the real world: Join a playgroup or grab coffee with a friend.

"New York (CNN) -- A federal jury in New York ruled Tuesday that a man who identifies as black and Hispanic and the nonprofit he founded must pay punitive damages to an African-American employee after a previous ruling that the use of the ""n-word"" is inappropriate among minorities in a workplace. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by Brandi Johnson, who is African-American, against STRIVE, the employment center where she worked, claiming she was a victim of a hostile workplace after enduring verbal harassment and a series of statements filled with profanity and racial slurs from her supervisor. The employment center in East Harlem argued that the use of the word was part of a ""tough-love culture."" The jury ruled Tuesday that center founder Rob Carmona must pay $25,000 and his organization must pay $5,000 in punitive damages. Jurors last week awarded $250,000 in compensatory damages to Johnson, 38, who sued Carmona personally and STRIVE, which he founded in 1984. Carmona's lawyer, Diane Krebs, issued a statement that said in part: ""We are disappointed by the verdict, as we do not believe that it comports with the full facts applicable to the case. Nevertheless, we respect the jury's decision and the judicial process. We are exploring all our options moving forward, including appeal, and look forward to the judicial process taking its entire course."" Papa John's CEO apologizes to Florida customer for employee's racist rant . Carmona's n-word-peppered rant toward Johnson was captured on a four-minute audio recording on Johnson's iPhone without her boss knowing in March 2012 and was played for a federal jury last week. ""You and (a previous employee) are just alike. Both of you are smart as s---, but dumb as s---. You know what it is ... both of you are n------, y'all act like n------ all the time,"" Carmona said to Johnson, according to audio evidence played in court and obtained by CNN. Carmona called Johnson the n-word eight times during the recording. ""And I'm not saying the term n------ as derogatory; sometimes it's good to know when to act like a n-----, but y'all act like n------ all the time ... both of you very bright, but both y'all act like n------ at inappropriate times,"" Carmona said in the audio recording. From the stand Tuesday, Carmona explained tearfully that he was only trying to help. ""I come from a different time ... What I'm trying to do is help ... that's the transition... (this case) has showed me I got to take stock in that at my age,"" said Carmona, 61. According to STRIVE, Carmona is a Harlem native who spent his early teenage years addicted to drugs and in and out of prison. He found solace in an alternative incarceration program where he cleaned up and eventually attended college. The center's website says that it has helped nearly 50,000 individuals across America enter the workforce. 'Cracker' conveys history of bigotry that still resonates . ""This case is most important because this is the first where we essentially have the n-word on trial,"" said Johnson's attorney, Marjorie Sharpe. ""You have heard the connotation that the n-word can have different meanings depending on the speaker; there is an undisguised belief that if the person saying the n-word is black or African-American, somehow it makes it OK. ""There are a number of cases where the n-word has been used in a workplace, but usually it's been done between people of different races, and when we're having that discussion, it seems that it's clear that if you're not African-American and you use the n-word, absolutely it's insulting,"" Sharpe said. Johnson claimed she was a victim of a pattern of negative comments and that the audio recording was her last stand. ""This has been a long and arduous journey for me working at STRIVE, and to be belittled and degraded by the founder and to have him justify him disrespecting me was hurtful,"" Johnson said Tuesday. ""So for the jury to make a statement saying that the n-word is not permissible in the workplace and or any business I was happy about that, yes."" Johnson claimed Carmona targeted her with negative comments after she tried to defend a graduate from a STRIVE program who had allegedly been sexually harassed by a STRIVE employee, according to the complaint. After many attempts to have the issued addressed, Johnson claims Carmona showed no interest in the allegations and told other employees not to socialize with Johnson, according to the complaint. On April 11, 2012, Johnson sent a formal complaint to Phil Weinberg, the organization's CEO, telling him of the numerous harassing, discriminatory and retaliatory acts she had endured from Carmona. Weinberg said that he did not wish to discuss Carmona's actions and that Johnson was being ""out of line"" and ""emotional,"" according to the complaint. On June 11, 2012, Weinberg fired Johnson. Johnson said she was terminated in retaliation for her complaints about the graduate's sexual harassment and because of her race and gender. ""Hopefully this sets an example that it won't be tolerated no matter what your race is,"" Johnson said after the ruling Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- On Sunday night Miley Cyrus put on a performance at MTV's Video Music Awards that appeared specifically contrived to elicit controversy and, by Monday morning, sure enough the controversy had arrived. For those who missed it (and in fact I missed it until compelled to watch it on YouTube due to the controversy), Cyrus put on a performance that ranged from simply bizarre to crudely offensive, with plenty of twerking and rude gestures with a foam hand more reminiscent of a drunken frat party than good art. Such a performance is bait, and I use that term on purpose, for the more sanctimonious set to thunder about the degradation of our society. Outraged parents: Miley, what were you thinking? As if on cue, the Parents Television Council, a nonprofit ""watchdog"" group and perennial foil of naughty media everywhere, issued a press release condemning the VMAs, which, of course, succeeded in little more than drawing more attention to them. The council called also for legislation that would allow viewers to select cable stations buffet-style rather than getting stuck with multiple channels they don't want. I'm actually sympathetic to this kind of a la carte cable system (although adult viewers should have the opportunity to select more adult-oriented channels if they wish and efforts to scrub cable clean seem nannyish). On the other hand, if you went in watching the VMAs, particularly with Lady Gaga headlining, with no clue you might see something shocking, you went in uninformed. First, let's put things in perspective. Were elements of the VMAs artistically dubious and in poor taste, particularly if you (somehow) didn't see it coming? Absolutely. Are they the end of civilization as we know it? Absolutely not. Opinion: Miley is sexual -- get over it . Although it's common to imply that media images such as these are harmful to minors, evidence for this has been inconsistent at best. Two early studies linked watching sexy media with small increases in the likelihood of initiating sex earlier in the teen years. However, psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Kathryn Monahan reanalyzed one of the datasets and found that, with other variables properly controlled, the influence of sexy media was negligible. And we must remember that, though explicit media are probably more available now than at any time in history, teens have been having sex later than in previous generations, and becoming pregnant less often. We have to be careful not to mix moral outrage, which may be justified, with a public health crisis when one is not apparent. Miley upholds VMAs tradition . All of this outrage appears calculated to me, however (it doesn't help that Cyrus' father sits on the board of advisers for the Parents Television Council). The performers who do outrageous stuff do so on purpose because scandal sells. And ""watchdog"" groups themselves often thrive off outrage. Such groups would wither financially if it were not for the public's outrage and fear of media. The council's website contains handy instructions on how not just to donate money but to include the group in your estate, give stocks, an automobile, etc. Fairly common for advocacy groups to be sure, but it still gives them skin in the game. Members of these groups may act in good faith, but let's not mistake them for objective, financially uninterested parties. The irony is that likely all the furor has probably only encouraged teens to see what all the fuss is about on YouTube. If one is serious about reducing sexual content in the media, making a big fuss only draws attention. Telling teens they shouldn't watch only makes them want to watch more. If you would like to see less of Cyrus twerking (and count me among those masses), the answer is quite simple: Change the channel. We need less outrage, less nannying and more apathy toward such silliness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Ferguson.","Christopher Ferguson: Miley Cyrus' performance seemed calculated to spark controversy .
He says the act succeeded in drawing attention and provoking objections from watchdog group .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's annual Halloween parade may go dark for a second year if organizers don't raise $50,000 by Monday to make up for losses caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012. For the first time in its 39-year history, the parade was canceled at the last minute in 2012 after Sandy ""Frankenstormed"" the event. In order to host the hundreds of puppets, more than 50 bands, dancers, artists and thousands of costumed New Yorkers, organizers say they must raise the sum by Monday. The organizers started a campaign to raise the money through online fundraising site Kickstarter.com that will end Monday. As of Thursday the online campaign had raised $47,200 donated by more than 800 backers. ""We fronted money for the parade that we never got the chance to make back. This is a huge obstacle for our tiny not-for-profit arts organization,"" organizers said in the online campaign. ""We lost a lot of money this year. We really went down,"" Matthew Fass, musical director of the parade, said in an online video, ""It's looking like we can't have this parade unless we get your support, and we need help from everybody."" Online organizers say that the parade will also provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses after being hard-hit by the storm. Often referred to as the Village Halloween Parade, the annual festivities have taken place every year on Halloween since 1973 and include more than 60,000 participants. Two million spectators line a mile-long stretch of 6th Avenue to watch, the online campaign boasts. ""It's really up to you,"" Jeanne Fleming, artistic and producing director of the parade for the past 33 years, said in the online video, ""We really need your help.""","Superstorm Sandy forced organizers to cancel the parade in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Three Senegalese peacekeeping officers were killed in an attack on a convoy in Darfur on Sunday, the United Nations said. An unidentified armed group ambushed a water convoy on its way to a regional headquarters of the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force, a U.N. statement said. One truck was hijacked but recovered later. Seven Tanzanian peacekeepers were killed in a similar ambush in July. The UN estimates as many as 300,000 people have been killed and almost 3 million people have been displaced from their homes since a conflict began in 2003 in Darfur, a region of Sudan along the border with the new nation of South Sudan. Widespread atrocities have occurred during fighting between Sudan's government forces and militias and other rebel groups. The peacekeeping operation began in 2007. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the government of Sudan to apprehend the attackers. Mohamed Ibn Chambas, special representative for the peacekeeping force, commended the Sudanese military for pursuing and firing on the assailants. ""Such incidents are a reminder to all of us of the great price everyone pays in the absence of peace. Our peacekeepers have made the ultimate sacrifice while attempting to bring peace to Darfur,"" Chambas said.","Slain peacekeepers were from Senegal .

"Rome (CNN) -- The death toll from a ship that capsized Friday in international waters near the Italian island of Lampedusa climbed to 31, according to the Maltese military. More than 200 survivors were pulled from the water, but the search continued for more than a dozen people still believed missing after the ship carrying hundreds of migrants sank, the Rescue Center of Malta, a branch of the Armed Forces of Malta, told CNN. ""We are trying to save as many people as we can,"" said Maltese military spokesman Keith Caruana. Italian and Maltese military forces using helicopters and boats pulled 206 of the 250 people believed to be on board the ship, authorities said. The shipwreck occurred in international waters about 60 nautical miles south of Lampedusa, an island south of Sicily, Italian navy spokesman Alessandro Busonero said. According to a statement released by the Armed Forces of Malta, the ship was being followed at about 4 p.m. local time by military chase planes when it ""appeared unstable."" ""A few minutes later, the aircraft reported that the boat had capsized and that numerous persons were in the water. Initial assistance was provided by the aircraft, which dropped a life raft in close proximity of the persons in distress,"" according to the statement posted on the agency's Facebook page. A significant number of the survivors were rescued from the life raft, Maltese authorities said . The Italian navy sent helicopters and two boats to the scene. Its sailors have rescued at least 50 people, Busonero said. An Italian navy patrol vessel, the Libra, rescued 56 people, including nine children, the Maltese authorities said. Another 150, including 17 children, were rescued by the Maltese navy patrol vessel, P61, the Maltese military said. It was not immediately known where the ship began its journey, and the Italian and Maltese military have not released the identities of the migrants. Island a destination for refugees . Lampedusa, not far from Sicily and the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries -- and such deadly shipwrecks are all too common. On October 3, a boat carrying more than 500 African migrants sank off the coast of Lampedusa, killing 309 people in what Lampedusa Mayor Giusi Nicolini called ""the biggest sea tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea since World War II."" That ship originated in Libya, caught fire off the Italian coast and sank. Survivors, many of them from Eritrea, told CNN they used bodies to keep themselves afloat until they were rescued. The incident sparked calls for efforts to reform migration policies in the region. A week ago Friday, the United Nations' human rights office urged the European Union to work to prevent another such incident. The agency called on authorities to work to reduce migrant trafficking and address economic and security issues that have driven thousands of African residents to make the risky voyage to Europe in search of a better life. Just under 115 kilometers (70 miles) from Tunisia, Lampedusa has been the first point of entry to Europe for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999. In recent years, the Italian coast guard says it has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees around the island. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 31 people have died, the Maltese military says .

"(CNN) -- On December 21, 2012, our calendar will align with the Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, completing a great Maya cycle of time. There's been a lot of hoopla that we are about to face a doomsday -- better known as the Maya apocalypse. There are television specials and panic buying of disaster supplies in Russia, a reminder of the stockpiling that took place for Y2K back in 1999. While the Maya date will coincide with the solstice, the shortest day of the year, will it also coincide with the end of the world? I'm no seer, but I am confident that December 22 will see the dawn. The ancient Maya of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras were close keepers of time. They charted every day, organizing them into 20- and 400-year periods. Using a base-20 counting system (ours is base 10) and zero, they easily calculated thousands of dates, some noting the existence of millions of years. Why we're fascinated with the apocalypse . During the height of their civilization in the 8th century, the Maya recorded dates and deeds at dozens of city-states, from births and battles to the triumphant wrenching of trophies from enemies. Artists inscribed their signatures on painted pots and stone sculptures. Stucco inscriptions adorned monumental pyramids that crested over the rainforest canopy. But to continue building ever grander structures, the Maya needed resources. Most of all, they needed timber to burn limestone in order to make cement. By the late 8th century, the rainforest was in retreat, fuel was scarce and recurrent drought led to desperation. Eventually, there was chronic warfare as well. And so one of the most extraordinary civilizations came to a crushing halt. Small groups of desperate dwellers in some cities held out behind hastily thrown-up palisades. Elsewhere, foes burned enemy cities to the ground and smashed monuments, leaving them scattered across the surface to be found in recent times. Scrub jungle overtook what had been sparkling white plazas. Compact ball courts that had seen raucous competition of a team sport played like soccer went silent. Wildlife scavenged lavish furnishings for their nests and dens. The reasons were many, and the outcome was shocking. The Maya civilization collapsed in most of its southern lowlands, leaving only abandoned pyramids in silent cities. This was the true face of apocalypse. Did they see it coming? Just a few years before the rot set in, Maya painters at the site of Bonampak, a small city in Chiapas, Mexico, covered the walls of a small three-room palace with extraordinary murals. They painted more individuals -- men, mainly, but women and children, too -- than had been rendered before, numbering more than 250. They deployed more fancy pigments than had been used before, more than would ever be used again in ancient Mexico, some 47 vibrant blues, reds and yellows. The paintings reveal the social layers of courtiers and lords, musicians and dwarves, victims and their blade-wielding sacrificers. Musicians, singers and performers lined up to perform on plazas and pyramids. None of these activities or materials was new, but what was new was the rapidly crumbling world around the Bonampak painters. No one could change -- the paintings seem to tell us. The Maya ignored the crisis in front of them, instead dancing with great panaches of precious quetzal feathers on pyramids, as if the present would forever hold. Now in the 21st century, perhaps we have also reached a precipice. Global warming is not just fearful thinking -- it's real. Weeks after Superstorm Sandy, scientists are now predicting the near-term and long-term effects of global warming as more dire that previously thought. Some, perhaps like our Maya predecessors, would rather not see the writing on the walls of our flooded cities. The crises pile up in front of us, one after another, and we ignore them at our peril. Acknowledging and doing something about the problems in front of us seems hard. Give us more feathers. Build more walls. Stockpile canned goods and buy a generator. As for December 21, rest easy. This day will pass as if it were nothing more than the Maya Y2K, the nonevent of the decade. We'll wake up on December 22, and the world will still be here. And so will our pressing environmental challenges. We need to make some hard decisions and resolve that we will confront our own brewing apocalypse before it's too late. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Miller.","There are doomsday fears of Mayan apocalypse on December 21 .
Mary Miller: The world will not come to an end, but we have pressing challenges .

"(CNN) -- In choosing a new CIA director to replace David Petraeus, President Barack Obama has a range of well-qualified candidates to choose from, although some of the most qualified were in management roles at the CIA when controversial interrogation techniques were used by agency interrogators questioning al Qaeda prisoners and the CIA was maintaining secret prisons overseas to detain members of al Qaeda. Michael Morell, a three-decade veteran of the CIA, is now the acting director of the agency and a leading contender to become the next director of central intelligence. As a candidate for the permanent job, Morell has all the advantages and disadvantages of someone who has been instrumental in recent successes at the CIA such as tracking down Osama bin Laden. But he was also was in a managerial position at the CIA in the George W. Bush years when the agency waterboarded three detainees and also imprisoned a larger number in the secret prisons overseas where they were subjected to other coercive interrogation techniques. Any confirmation hearing for Morell would run the risk of a public discussion of the efficacy and ethics of such controversial practices. And there would also be the risk that such a hearing might open up the Pandora's box of the CIA's many failures that led to the fiasco of the deeply flawed assessment that Saddam Hussein was building up his weapons of mass destruction program in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. Petraeus probe includes top general in Afghanistan . There is also the current controversy about why the intelligence committees in Congress were informed only on Friday about the FBI investigation into Petraeus. Morell and the FBI's deputy director, Sean Joyce, are scheduled to meet with members of the intelligence committees Wednesday to discuss the matter. In contrast to Morell, other potential candidates for the director's job at CIA, such as former U.S. Rep. Jane Harman or Michael Vickers, the top intelligence official at the Pentagon, were not working at the CIA when coercive measures were used on al Qaeda detainees. On the other hand, few have played such a key role in some of the most dramatic moments in the war against al Qaeda as Morell has. From the day that Bush took office on January 20, 2001, every morning, six days a week, Morrell was the CIA official who briefed the president about what the intelligence community believed to be the most pressing national security issues. On August 6, 2001, eight months after Bush was inaugurated, Morell met with the president at his vacation home in Texas to deliver the president's daily brief. The top-secret briefing that Morell delivered was titled ""Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S."" A month later, on the morning of September 11, 2001, in Sarasota, Florida, Morell gave the daily briefing as usual to the president. There was nothing memorable in it. Who's who in the Petraeus scandal . Then Morell got into the president's motorcade to head to the local elementary school where Bush planned to meet with some students. At the school, where Bush was reading a story to a group of second-graders, the news came on TV that a second jet had hit the World Trade Center. Bush and a small group of other officials including Morell were hustled out of the school to head to Air Force One, which took off for Barksdale Air Force Base near Shreveport, Louisiana. In Washington, news soon circulated that a Palestinian terrorist organization, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Bush summoned Morell, asking, ""What do you make of this?"" Morrell replied, ""The DFLP has a history of terrorism against Israel, but its capabilities are limited. It does not have the resources and reach to do this."" In the early afternoon, Air Force One headed from Louisiana to Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska. Bush asked to see Morell again, and pushed him for his opinion about who was behind the attacks. ""I don't have any intelligence as yet, so what I am going to say is my personal view,"" Morell said, ""There are two terrorist states capable of conducting such a complex operation -- Iran and Iraq -- but neither have much to gain and everything to lose from attacking the U.S."" The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex . Morell added, ""The responsible party is almost certainly a nonstate actor and I have no doubt that the trail will lead to bin Laden and al Qaeda,"" according to a U.S. intelligence official with knowledge of the conversation. Five months later on January 4, 2002, again at Bush's vacation ranch in Texas, Morell had the delicate task of informing the president that it was the CIA's assessment bin Laden had fought at the Battle of Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan during mid-December 2001, but he had survived and escaped. Bush was incensed at this and became hostile, as if Morell himself were the culprit. Flash forward to the summer of 2011: Morell, an unassuming, scholarly analyst in his mid-50s who speaks in terse, cogent paragraphs, was now the deputy director of the CIA. He was one of a small group of officials at the agency who knew there was a quite promising lead on the possible whereabouts of bin Laden that led to a large compound in the northern Pakistan city of Abbottabad. Then-CIA Director Leon Panetta, together with Morell and some of the analysts working on the hunt for bin Laden, went to Obama and told him, ""We think there is a strong possibility that bin Laden is in the Abbottabad compound."" The analysts believed this with varying degrees of certainty, with most estimating the probability at 80%. The lead analyst was at around 90%, while Morell was at 60%. ""Why do people have different probabilities?"" Obama asked. ""Intelligence is not an exact science,"" Morell explained. ""Even if we had a source inside the compound saying bin Laden was there, I'd only be at 80% because sources are of varying reliability. Those analysts who are at 80% to 90% have been tracking al Qaeda in recent years and have had great success stopping plots and undermining the organization. They are confident. The folks at the lower end of the range are those who lived through intelligence failures, particularly the Iraq WMD (weapons of mass destruction) issue."" Of course, we now know that bin Laden was indeed hiding in the compound in Abbottabad, and the fact that Morell was the overall manager of the investigation that led to al Qaeda's leader will surely weigh in his favor to be the nominee for the top job at CIA. Given the personal problems that have faced Petraeus and now perhaps Gen. John Allen, the outgoing commander in Afghanistan, character issues will surely weigh heavily in Obama's considerations. Petraeus biographer made trips to Afghanistan . There are others whom Obama might pick to run the CIA, such as John Brennan, his top counterterrorism adviser, who had a distinguished career at the agency, including a tour as station chief in Saudi Arabia and who also led both the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and its successor, the National Counterterrorism Center, following the 9/11 attacks. Brennan, a no-nonsense graduate of Fordham who speaks Arabic, was Obama's first pick for CIA director in 2008 but withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear that his nomination hearings would be complicated by some in Congress who would grill him about the waterboarding of detainees in CIA custody and the agency's prisons overseas. It's also not clear why Brennan would want the CIA job given the fact that in his present position he gets to see the president far more often than any CIA director, and from his windowless office in the basement of the West Wing of the White House, he has dominated U.S. counterterrorism policy on issues such as drones, Pakistan, Yemen and the hunt for al Qaeda's leaders, including bin Laden. Another plausible candidate is Michael Vickers. He had a storied career at the CIA, where as a young man he was the agency's principal military strategist on the Afghan ""account"" during the 1980s war against the Soviets. Vickers helped to funnel vast numbers of weapons through the Pakistanis to the various Afghan mujahedeen groups that defeated the Soviets. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . Vickers' doctorate in military history from Johns Hopkins and owlish exterior mask the fact that he is a risk taker, albeit in a calibrated, cerebral way. He left the CIA when he was only 32, having already played a key role in the most successful covert operation in the agency's history -- expelling the Soviets from Afghanistan -- to get an MBA at Wharton. And he was a Special Forces officer in Central America. Like both Morell and Brennan, Vickers also played a key role in the operation to find bin Laden. In his previous job at the Pentagon, he was the civilian overseer of Special Operations Forces and was intimately involved in the planning of the SEAL raid in Abbottabad. But unlike Morell and Brennan, Vickers wasn't at the CIA when waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques were being employed by the agency. Given all the consternation on Capitol Hill about the circumstances surrounding the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September in which the U.S. ambassador was killed along with two CIA employees, the Obama administration could decide to tap someone who has deep experience on the Hill. An obvious candidate would be Harman, who as a member of the House of Representatives from California between 1993 and 2011 served on all the major committees focused on national security: Armed Services, Intelligence and Homeland Security. Now running the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Harman is regarded as one of the Democratic Party's leading experts on national security. If appointed and confirmed, Harman would be the first woman director of the CIA. A further consideration: Another former nine-term Democratic congressman from California, Panetta, now the defense secretary, led the CIA for more than two years and is regarded as one of the most effective directors of the agency in recent decades.

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai will meet with President Barack Obama on Friday to discuss the post-2014 American presence in Afghanistan. The U.S. military has already given Obama options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in Afghanistan after 2014. Those forces would work as advisers to the Afghan army and mount special operations raids against the Taliban and al Qaeda. Read more: U.S. may remove all troops from Afghanistan after 2014 . But on Tuesday, Ben Rhodes, the White House's deputy national security adviser, told reporters that the Obama administration is mulling the idea of removing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan after the NATO combat mission finishes at the end of 2014. This may be a negotiating ploy by the Obama administration as it gets down to some hard bargaining with Karzai, who has long criticized many aspects of the U.S. military presence and who is likely to be reluctant to accede to a key American demand: That any U.S. soldiers who remain in Afghanistan after 2014 retain immunity from prosecution in the dysfunctional Afghan court system. It was this issue that led the U.S. to pull all its troops out of Iraq in December, 2011 after failing to negotiate an agreement with the Nuri al-Maliki government. Read more: Defense officials to press Karzai on what he needs . Or this may represent the real views of those in the Obama administration who have long called for a much-reduced U.S. presence in Afghanistan, and it is also in keeping with the emerging Obama doctrine of attacking al Qaeda and its allies with drones but no American boots on the ground. And it certainly aligns with the view of most Americans, only around a quarter of whom now support the war in Afghanistan, according to a poll taken in September. Security Clearance: Afghanistan options emerge . In any case, zeroing out U.S. troop levels in the post-2014 Afghanistan is a bad idea on its face -- and even raising this concept publicly is maladroit strategic messaging to Afghanistan and the region writ large. Why so? Afghans well remember something that most Americans have forgotten. After the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, something that was accomplished at the cost of more than a million Afghan lives and billions of dollars of U.S. aid, the United States closed its embassy in Afghanistan in 1989 during the George H. W. Bush administration and then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world under the Clinton administration. It essentially turned its back on Afghans once they had served their purpose of dealing a deathblow to the Soviets. As a result, the United States had virtually no understanding of the subsequent vacuum in Afghanistan into which eventually stepped the Taliban, who rose to power in the mid-1990s. The Taliban granted shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda organization from 1996 onward. Read more: Court considers demand that U.S. release photos of bin Laden's body . After the overthrow of the Taliban, a form of this mistake was made again by the George W. Bush administration, which had an ideological disdain for nation building and was distracted by the Iraq War, so that in the first years after the fall of the Taliban, only a few thousand U.S. soldiers were stationed in Afghanistan. The relatively small number of American boots on the ground in Afghanistan helped to create a vacuum of security in the country, which the Taliban would deftly exploit, so that by 2007, they once again posed a significant military threat in Afghanistan. In 2009, Obama ordered a surge of 30,000 troops into Afghanistan to blunt the Taliban's gathering momentum, which it has certainly accomplished. Read more: Inside the Taliban . But when Obama announced the new troops of the Afghan surge, most media accounts of the speech seized on the fact that the president also said that some of those troops would be coming home in July 2011. This had the unintended effect of signaling to the Taliban that the U.S. was pulling out of Afghanistan reasonably soon and fit into the longstanding narrative that many Afghans have that the U.S. will abandon them again. Similarly, the current public discussion of zero U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan after 2014 will encourage those hardliner elements of the Taliban who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the Americans out. It also discourages the many millions of Afghans who see a longtime U.S. presence as the best guarantor that the Taliban won't come back in any meaningful way and also an important element in dissuading powerful neighbors such as Pakistan from interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Read related: Afghanistan vet finds a new way to serve . Instead of publicly discussing the zero option on troops in Afghanistan after 2014, a much smarter American messaging strategy for the country and the region would be to emphasize that the Strategic Partnership Agreement that the United States has already negotiated with Afghanistan last year guarantees that the U.S. will have some form of partnership with the Afghans until 2024. In this messaging strategy, the point should be made that the exact size of the American troop presence after 2014 is less important than the fact that U.S. soldiers will stay in the country for many years, with Afghan consent, as a guarantor of Afghanistan's stability. The United States continues to station thousands of troops in South Korea more than five decades after the end of the Korean War. Under this American security umbrella, South Korea has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest. It is this kind of model that most Afghans want and the U.S. needs to provide so Afghanistan doesn't revert to the kind of chaos that beset it in the mid-1990s and from which the Taliban first emerged.

"Washington (CNN) -- Getting a deal done on the government shutdown was ugly, divisive and controversial. And it has left a few people missing pork. Days after Republicans kept their House majority in the 2012 election, Speaker John Boehner doubled down on a ban on earmarks -- those legislative nuggets that get embedded into bigger bills directing funds to specific pet projects. These legislative provisions were generally the grease that made Congress go -- leadership in the House and Senate would add earmarks to bills as a way to win votes on a larger controversial proposal. The ""earmark ban shows the American people we are listening,"" Boehner said in 2012. ""We are dead serious about ending business as usual in Washington."" But with that announcement, Boehner was tying one hand -- a hand that many of his predecessors had used before -- behind his back. He would have to pass legislation without the ability to woo members with money for their districts. ""Trying to be a leader where you have no sticks and very few carrots is dang near impossible,"" Trent Lott, former Republican Senate Majority leader and House Minority Whip told CNN. ""Members don't get anything from you and leaders don't give anything. They don't feel like you can reward them or punish them."" Lott, who is now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Boehner's job during this recent shutdown and debt ceiling crisis would ""absolutely"" have been easier had he been able to use earmarks. ""When I was the whip in the House in the 80s, I had a shop window hours when members could come in and say they had a problem and ask for help,"" Lott said. ""Then when I came to do my whip job, the members"" were more receptive to support him. Lott, however, operated in a different Republican Party. ""Bringing home the bacon"" back then was seen as a good thing, where today, many tea party and conservative Republicans campaigned on the idea that earmarks represented the seedy, pay-to-play deals of Lott's Congress. Even in Wednesday's Senate deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling there was a little pork. The spending bill added more than $2 billion for a system of locks under construction at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and between Kentucky and Illinois. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has received some blow back for the money, but Democratic and Republican leaders say McConnell did not ask for it. ""I find it funny that people keep coming back to this,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that has been vocally supportive of the earmarks ban. ""I don't think earmarks are this sort of panacea that would make the trains all run on time."" The group has put out different research on earmarks, backing up Boehner's ban and pointing out some of the more earmark-laden bills of the past 20 years. Ellis says it is ""preposterous"" to assume that conservative members of Congress who ran against Washington spending could be ""bought off"" with earmarks. ""If you are willing to shutdown the government over the issue of Obamacare,"" why would a road project in your district change your mind, he said. Earmarks, while something long used in congressional spending bills, grew significantly between the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In 1996, the defense appropriation bill included 270 earmarks. In 2005, there were 2,506 earmarks in the defense spending bill, costing taxpayers over $9 billion. For other bills, like the energy and water development appropriation, earmarks made up 24.8% of the money spent in 1994 and 30.3% in 2002. Proponents of earmarking will argue that the small amount of money they cost is a price worth paying to make government run more smoothly. Opponents, however, say earmarks are what lead to massively expensive appropriation bills, making them more difficult to pass. Earmarks have also caused Congress -- and specific members -- a number of public relations headaches. Some of the projects earmarks have funded are laughable and make for comedic fodder. * In 2010, $1.8 million was approved for the Las Vegas Neon Boneyard, a museum to neon, as part of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. * In 2009, Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington backed a $250,000 earmark for window repair and limestone sill replacement at ""The Rainier Club"" -- a high society club in Seattle. * Then there was the 2005 ""Bridge to Nowhere,"" a project in Alaska slated to cost nearly $400 million that was secured with an earmark by Rep. Don Young and the late Sen. Ted Stevens. It became a notorious illustration of pork-barrel spending and was never built. * Another infamous pet project line item was some $450,000 in 2005 to the New River Community Partners Museum Development Project, which was responsible for the Sparta Teapot Museum of Craft & Design in North Carolina. The money was eventually returned to the government. ""They are a tool,"" said former Democratic Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas. ""For years they were an overused tool and now they are an absolutely underused tool. There has got to be something in between."" Lott acknowledged that, at times, earmarks got out of hand and needed to be reformed. But that doesn't mean, he said, they should have been outlawed all together. ""There needs to be a defined process,"" he said. As for whether his support of earmarks opens him to criticism from other Republicans, Lott laughs. ""Some of them may say you sound like a RINO,"" Lott said, using the acronym for ""Republican In Name Only. ""Look, I was conservative before many of these turkeys were born.""","Former congressional leaders say earmarks could remedy Congressional dysfunction .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds filled a small-town Michigan church on a chilly and overcast Tuesday to say a final goodbye to a teenage hero who died just after scoring a winning shot that lifted his high school's basketball team to a perfect winning season. Friends and family paid their last respects at a funeral for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. The night before, his teammates charged into a gym, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with his number -- 35 -- and the phrase, ""Never forgotten."" Fans erupted in a standing ovation and wiped away tears during a moment of silence before the tipoff of Fennville High School's first game without Leonard as the point guard. The Blackhawks won their first state playoff game, 65-54,  before a crowd of thousands. ""This was a game he would like to watch. There's no doubt his eyes were upon us,"" Fennville coach Ryan Klingler told reporters, choking back tears. Friends came to the game with homemade shirts and signs, saying he was their angel on the court, CNN affiliate WZZM reported. The teen's parents sat in the sold-out crowd of nearly 3,500 people. His brother sat beside teammates on the bench. ""Wes was like a brother to us,"" Fennville player Xavier Grigg told WZZM. ""We were all like family. We knew he would have wanted us to come out here and keep the streak alive."" Leonard died moments after scoring the winning basket in overtime Thursday, securing a perfect season for the Blackhawks. He scored his team's last four points in the 57-55 victory. An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A.

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, President Obama and former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton are due to attend the grand opening of President George W. Bush's presidential library and archive in Dallas, Texas. The opening of the library offers an opportunity to think again about the legacy of the Bush presidency. As Obama and the former presidents look around the museum, they will see many exhibits that symbolize how the jury is still out on most of the major issues. Events in the coming years will play a huge role in how history is likely to remember Bush's White House. There are four big questions about his presidency. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' 1. How effective and how just were Bush's counterterrorism policies? Bush came into office much more concerned about domestic issues like education and taxation, but after the 9/11 terror attacks, he invested a great deal of his power in the counterterrorism program. He and his supporters have felt that the absence of major attacks until last week and that the re-establishment of calm in the United States was a defining achievement. It is not surprising that one of the artifacts that Obama will see during his visit is the bullhorn Bush used in his famous address to first responders who were working at Ground Zero. But our continued vulnerability became clear when two bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last week, killing three people and injuring many others. The attacks immediately raise the question as to what kinds of risks were not addressed and what holes exist in our security program. There are already questions facing the Obama administration about the handling of a tip about Tamerlan Tsarnaev received by the FBI from the Russian government in 2011. There are also questions about how Boston responded, as authorities virtually shut down the entire city during the hunt for the suspects and, some argue, unnecessarily gave potential copy cats the impression that they could cause even greater turmoil through similar acts. In addition, the hunger strike in which Guantanamo prisoners have been protesting their treatment and the infringement of basic civil liberties raises the question about the costs of Bush's programs. The violation of civil liberties through the use of torture proved to be a huge blow to America's international standing. Many critics argue that these practices, many of which Obama has allowed to stay in place, actually has fueled support for terrorist networks overseas. Brazile: Bush came through on Katrina . 2. What is the long-term impact of Bush's fiscal policies? When Bush started his term, the country enjoyed a sizable budgetary surplus for the first time in decades. Once in office, however, Bush chose a series of policies that turned the surplus into a deficit. The president argued that tax cuts offered the best path to stimulating economic growth, adhering to the supply side economics of the Reagan era. Bush and his advisers argued that reducing the tax burdens of Americans, especially wealthier Americans who had money to invest, would grow the economy for all. The tax cuts, combined with spending for defense after 9/11 and new domestic programs such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit, generated massive federal deficits. The problem for Bush is that the economic record since 2001 has been checkered, with the huge financial collapse in 2008, a recession and an extremely sluggish recovery. Economic inequality has worsened. Thus far, the record remains poor. 3. Did federal education standards improve the nation's schools? The No Child Left Behind Act (2001) was a major achievement and fulfilled a central objective of the Bush presidency, to impose stringent standards to improve the quality of education. The law extended the reach of the federal government by setting up a strong set of standardized measures to judge school performance. But the law has been hugely controversial. Many teachers complain that the standards have had a detrimental effect on education, forcing them and students to focus their energy on tests to meet the standards rather than the kind of substance important to the development of a child. As Bush's Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings said, ""What gets tested gets taught."" Right now the debate continues, and there are many advocates on different parts of the political spectrum who argue that the law needs substantial reform. Whether there is a demonstrable improvement in education outcomes as a result of the standards will be a very important factor in determining his legacy. 4. What was the result of engaging in pre-emptive wars? Bush made a strong argument that pre-emptive war was essential to preventing terrorism. The results of this strategic outlook were wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though the operations were initially successful and knocked out the leadership of both countries, the post-war reconstruction had tremendous human and economic costs. While each situation was eventually stabilized, new democratic processes established, and U.S. troops drawn down, the wars remain hugely controversial with the American public. One of the most ambitious promises from administration officials was that these kinds of wars would not only diminish the chances for terrorism to find state sponsors but also would also change the dynamics of the region and create pressure for dismantling the autocracies that have dominated the Middle East. But the region remains in turmoil and in transition. While some of Bush's supporters initially hailed the fall of the governments in countries like Egypt as proof that his strategy worked, the election of an Islamist government created new fears. The ongoing battle in Syria between the government and rebels is a reminder that the region remains a tinderbox. The way in which these stories unfold will play a big role in shaping how we evaluate Bush. These are just some of the open questions that historians, journalists and the public will be looking to answer. The Bush library offers one approach, mostly reflecting the views of his supporters, but Americans will debate the impact of those controversial eight years for a long time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer says opening of Bush library rekindles debate over 43rd president .

"(CNN) -- This time Jason Dufner hung on to the lead, and his reward was winning a first major at the PGA Championship. Two years ago at the same tournament, Dufner led by five shots in the dying stages but he crumbled and eventually lost in a playoff to pal Keegan Bradley. Although he's not one for showing too much emotion, it hurt. Having overtaken overnight leader Jim Furyk at Oak Hill on Sunday, Dufner carried an advantage down the stretch and didn't buckle to beat his fellow American by two shots. His 68, two under par, wasn't as sizzling as his 63 on Friday that tied a low score at a major. However, it marked his third consecutive strong final round at a major -- he hit 67s at the British Open and U.S. Open. Overall he registered a 10-under-par 270. His lone two bogeys came on the last two holes, when he could afford be cautious. ""To come back from a couple of years ago, when I lost to Keegan in the playoff, feels really, really good,"" Dufner said in a televised interview. ""I'm privileged to play in these tournaments and it is a great feeling to win one."" Dufner's celebration was typically low key. He hugged wife Amanda and received a congratulatory hug from Bradley. ""I decided I was going to be confident, put my best foot forward, be aggressive and try to win this thing, not be scared or too soft,"" Dufner said. ""I'm happy to get the job done and it is a big step in my career."" Furyk held a one-shot lead entering the final day. By no means was his round poor -- he finished at one-over 71 -- but he couldn't match Dufner. Bogeys on the last two holes didn't help. ""I needed to keep the pedal down and make pars there and keep the pressure on him and I just didn't do it,"" Furyk was quoted as saying by AFP. He also couldn't maintain his lead at last year's U.S. Open, although Furyk at least owns a major. Swede Henrik Stenson came third, three shots behind Dufner, with Jonas Blixt, another Swede, a further shot adrift. Tiger Woods, meanwhile, will see his drought at majors extend to six years after he finished in a tie for 40th. Woods, still stuck on 14 majors, finished with an even-par 70. ""Is it concerning? No,"" he told the Golf Channel. ""As I've said, I've been there in half of them. So that's about right. ""If you are going to be in there three quarters or half of them with a chance to win on the back nine, you have just got to get it done."" Woods dealt with an elbow injury earlier in the summer and said he played Sunday with a stiff back. ""It's been tight all day,"" the world No. 1 said. ""Just one of those things."" Fresh off his success at the British Open, Phil Mickelson couldn't repeat his heroics at the PGA Championship. But if it was any consolation, Mickelson concluded with a 72, six shots better than Saturday. He tied for 72nd, better than a mere two players who survived the cut. Defending champion Rory McIlroy had an outside shot of catching the leaders, six shots behind Furyk entering Sunday. But his hopes faded following a triple-bogey seven at the fifth.","Jason Dufner wins the PGA Championship at Oak Hill for his first major .

"(CNN) -- Disbelieving Chelsea fans have been celebrating with their Champions League-winning team in London on a victory parade the day after the club won the trophy for the first time in their history. Chelsea's squad and temporary manager Roberto di Matteo traveled on two open-top buses, waving blue scarves as they showed off the famous trophy with the ""big ears."" Cheering fans crowded onto the streets and even climbed up trees and lampposts and onto bus stops around southwest London to catch a glimpse of their heroes, including matchwinner Didier Drogba. Chelsea, who overcame Barcelona in the semifinals, were 1-0 down against Bayern Munich with seven minutes remaining at the Allianz Arena, but Drogba conjured an 88th-minute equalizer. The Ivorian striker then scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out with what could be his final kick for Chelsea. The 34-year-old's contract runs out this summer, and he has been linked with a move to China. It capped a remarkable few months for Chelsea, who sacked Portuguese manager Andre Villas Boas in late March with the team toiling in the Premier League and trailing 3-1 against Napoli after the first leg of their Champions League last 16 match. Under Di Matteo, Chelsea somehow overturned the deficit against Napoli, but a miraculous victory over Barcelona managed to overshadow that. Chelsea looked doomed again after skipper John Terry was sent off early in the second leg and they went 2-1 down on aggregate, but once again the Blues triumphed against the odds -- and repeated the trick against Bayern in the German's club's home stadium. The win also guaranteed Chelsea a place in the Champions League next season after missing out via the Premier League by only finishing sixth. Tottenham, who finished fourth in the English league, will have to settle for the Europa League. As the buses came to a halt on Sunday, Terry, who was suspended for the final but lifted the trophy with Frank Lampard, led the players and fans in a chant of ""champions, champions, ole ole ole."" When the microphone was passed to Drogba, he was serenaded by both players and fans with ""Didier Drogba, we want you to stay."" Roman Abramovich, the club's wealthy Russian owner, was also on the parade to witness the celebrations of Drogba, Fernando Torres, Ashley Cole, Petr Cech, Juan Mata, and countless other signings made under his big-spending ownership. Winning the Champions League had been Abramovich's dream and plenty of managers were fired over their failure to deliver it, but Di Matteo's future is still far from secure. ""Whatever the club decides I will respect, it's as simple as that,"" the Italian coach said after the match in Munich. As the Chelsea fans celebrated, the mood in Munich was predictably somber. Once the delirious opposition fans had departed -- an estimated 100,000 Chelsea supporters were in Munich -- the city was left to mourn what most of the German newspapers saw as a desperately unlucky defeat. Sports daily Bild's headline read: ""Schweini, we are crying with you!"" Bastian Schweinsteiger, the talisman of the Bayern team who came through the youth system at the club, hit the post with a hesitant penalty in the shoot out. Former Chelsea winger Arjen Robben had missed a chance to wrap it up even before the shoot out when he had a penalty saved by Cech in extra time. Chelsea had one corner in the entire match and scored from it through Drogba. Bayern had 20 corners, and 43 attempts on goal to Chelsea's nine. ""It's like a nightmare,"" Bayern director of sport Christian Nerlinger said. ""When you see how the game played itself out, it's like a bad film. ""This is frustrating and depressing to digest. This defeat is very difficult to take."" Munich daily SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung concluded: ""How much bad luck fits into a single football match?""","Chelsea parade the Champions League trophy through southwest London .

"(CNN) -- Liberals need to stop complaining about the right. In recent weeks, the chorus of criticism emanating from liberals has been intensifying, focusing on how right-wing Republicans have shut down the government and are threatening the global economy. Many observers agree with this criticism, including a number of Republicans who are also frustrated with their own party. A recent Pew poll showed that support for the GOP has plummeted since September. But simply criticizing congressional intransigence never goes very far in Washington politics. Liberals who rail against the right are unlikely to accomplish much. The 40 or so conservative Republicans who have been controlling the House Caucus don't really care what liberals in Washington have to say. Even if some House Republican politicians are listening to their critics, most of the short-term electoral incentives are pushing them in a different direction than Democrats hope. If liberals want to bring change and truly alter the political dynamics in Washington, they are going to need to build grass-roots pressure to shape national debate and genuine electoral pressure in the states and districts of Republicans who are not among the hard-core of the right-wing -- still a majority of the GOP. Political scientist Matthew Green estimates that there are 48 Republicans in the ""fearful caucus,"" who are not in the hard ""no"" faction but whose primary concern is being at risk in a primary challenge. There are 29 Republicans who are loyal to the House leadership, and 17 more in districts won by President Barack Obama who are interested in a compromise. Thus far, it has been striking during the federal government shutdown to see the relative inaction of the left in terms of mounting actual grass-roots pressure on legislators to reopen the government, raise the debt ceiling and deal with budgetary disputes through the normal paths of the legislative process. Although the budgetary process is not an issue that has the same urgency as immigration reform or climate change, the stakes of continuing with this kind of budget politics are enormously consequential. The more that Republicans can normalize the decision to shut down the federal government, the more comfortable they will be in disputes to do this again. If they are willing to go to the length of actually sending the government into default over health care, they will use this kind of threat in future policy disputes. Republicans, to some extent, are comfortable with this outcome. They have been warning about the ills of government for decades, so this kind of breakdown fits well within their broader narrative. Liberals need government to work, as they believe that government is an essential part of a fair and just society. In the past, liberals have scored their biggest breakthroughs against congressional conservatism through grass-roots pressure. Between the late 1930s and the early 1960s, a conservative alliance of Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans held up progress on legislation meant to benefit African-Americans, union members and Americans living in the cities. Since Southern Democrats chaired many of the major committees, they were able to prevent bills from coming up for a vote or they forced legislation to be so watered down by the time of passage that it was ineffective. In the Senate, they could use the filibuster on bills such as civil rights to ensure that bold measures did not come up for a vote. During the early 1960s, liberals were finally able to break the hold of this conservative coalition through a massive and dramatic grass-roots mobilization, spearheaded by the civil rights movement. This changed national opinion and created electoral pressure on Midwestern Republicans to break ranks with their Southern counterparts. During the 1980s, liberals faced similar problems. After the 1980 election, President Ronald Reagan allied with the newly Republican Senate and an expanded conservative coalition in the House to push through major legislation, such as the historic tax cut of 1981, that took away revenue the federal government badly needed and made the tax code less progressive. Reagan also obtained a huge increase in the defense budget and undertook an aggressive shift in foreign policy that heightened tensions with the Soviet Union. His team avoided negotiations with the Soviets and insisted on a build-up of intercontinental missiles in Europe. But liberals pushed back. When Reagan proposed cuts to Social Security in 1981, House Democrats worked with organizations and citizen groups allied with the elderly to stop this in its tracks. During the 1982 midterms, liberals focused on ""fairness"" in the economy and blamed Reagan's policies for the economic recession. In 1983 and 1984, the millions of Americans involved in the nuclear freeze movement generated immense support for the need to reduce international tensions and created the framework for negotiations that started in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev emerged on the scene. A new book by historian Michael Foley, ""Front Porch Politics,"" shows how grass-roots activists in this period participated in a wide range of protests on issues such as industrial policies for depressed areas to gay rights. Liberals have an opportunity to influence the political debate. An unusual alliance is possible. First, liberals will find support from Republicans who care about the party's national standing and are unhappy with the polls reflecting the public's discontent with House GOP tactics. Second, a growing number of leaders in the business community are starting to consider the possibility of funding primary challengers to hard-right Republicans whose policy demands are threatening the economy. But liberals will have to be part of the equation of isolating the far right politically by building pressure in swing states, generating support for Democrats who push back against these kinds of tactics, staging protests, holding marches and meeting with constituents in states where Republican politicians will feel pressed to moderate the ways of their party. Conservatives have been quick to turn to protest politics, such as the recent protests at Washington monuments, so there is no reason liberals should be hesitant to do the same, although they will need to do so on a much larger scale. Without that kind of grass-roots pressure from liberals, the current stalemate is likely to be the new normal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Liberal complaints about the tactics of the right accomplish nothing .

"(CNN) -- A fire and ""technical issue"" aboard two Boeing 787 Dreamliners on Friday raised new safety concerns for the long troubled airliner. The fire ignited on an empty 787 operated by Ethiopian Airlines that was parked at London's Heathrow airport. No one was hurt and the incident shut runways for about an hour before operations resumed, the airport said. Details were unclear about the fire's cause or location aboard the plane, but the incident was enough to spur U.S. aviation experts to investigate. In a separate incident on Friday, Thomson Airways reported a ""technical issue"" aboard its Dreamliner flying from Manchester, England, to Florida. The aircraft returned to Manchester as a ""precautionary measure,"" Thomson said in a statement. Engineers were ""inspecting the aircraft,"" the statement said. Passengers were transferred to another plane. The airline offered no other details of the problem. Related: Dreamliner interactive layout . The Dreamliner, which has been flying since 2011, has been closely watched since last January when all 50 of the world's 787s were grounded due to overheating problems in its new light-weight lithium-ion battery system. The planes were allowed to return to service in April after Boeing engineered a solution that satisfied U.S. aviation authorities. Heathrow reopened Friday evening and Boeing officials were at the airport to analyze the problem, the company said. Ethiopian Airlines: Bringing the Dreamliner to Africa . It was not known if the battery system was associated with the latest incident, but a statement released by Ethiopian Airlines said the jet had been ""parked at the airport for more than eight hours"" before the fire. The Federal Aviation Administration is sending ""an official"" at the invitation of the British government, the agency told CNN in a statement. The FAA said earlier it was ""in contact"" with Boeing about the matter. The National Transportation Safety Board tweeted it also was sending an ""accredited representative"" to the airport to help the investigation. Friday's fire triggered renewed doubt about the 787 among the aviation community, including aviation lawyer and former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo. ""If today's Boeing 787 problems are battery related,"" she tweeted, ""the FAA may reconsider its decision to allow them to fly before NTSB identified"" what caused the battery troubles. Video of the aftermath showed foam surrounding the Ethiopian aircraft and what appeared to be burn marks on its fuselage. ""There's still hope for Boeing,"" Schiavo tweeted later. ""The burn marks are not next to the batteries."" Japanese Dreamliner held due to A/C power glitch . The news sent Boeing's shares on Wall Street down more than 4%. Boeing's stake is huge. Hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on the success of the Dreamliner, which represents a new generation of lighter, more efficient money making airliners. Its development was marked by production delays and other problems. During their first few years in service, every airliner experiences ""teething pains"" as they shake out minor problems, experts say. But the FAA's decision to ground the Dreamliner put it under a microscope. The lone U.S. 787 operator -- United Airlines -- owns a fleet of six. During a six-day period in June, United diverted three of them, each with a different mechanical problem. Indicators showed possible issues with oil levels, oil filters and the braking system. Related: Another 787 Dreamliner diverted for mechanical problem . Dreamliner's lithium-ion batteries were blamed for two overheating instances this year in Boston and Japan. No one was hurt in either case, but the problems spurred the FAA to ground the planes. In March, the FAA approved a Boeing certification plan to fix the 787 battery system and prove the new design is safe. A team of experts from Boeing and from outside the company redesigned parts of the battery system in what they called a ""robust"" fix that included separating the battery cells, integrating a new charging system, and setting the batteries in a containment box that would vent outside the aircraft any smoke from overheating batteries.

Related: Can 'game-changer' Dreamliner live up to its name? In an apparent show of confidence in the new aircraft, United announced last month that it was ordering 20 additional 787s, specifically the 787-10 model, a longer version of the plane.

"(CNN) -- Scott Jamieson was so close to breaking new ground at the Portugal Masters on Saturday. No golfer on the European Tour had ever shot a 59, and there the Scot was on the 18th and last hole, needing a birdie to achieve the magical round. But Jamieson couldn't convert a roughly 15-foot chip and had to settle for a 60, instead becoming the 18th man on the European Tour to card that score. The world No. 110 couldn't hide his disappointment when he missed the birdie putt, sinking to his knees in front of expectant fans at the Oceanico Victoria Golf Course in the Algarve. ""I said to Richard (his caddie) playing 17 I really want to make a birdie here so we have a chance of it going down the last and I could not have asked to hit a better shot in,"" Jamieson told the European Tour's website. ""It pitched just short of the hole."" ""When I birdied the 13th, I said to Richard then, 'A few more and we could be part of history.' I was definitely nervous but thinking about it from the tournament point of view the leaders are going to be a minimum of 16, 17 maybe 18 under going into tomorrow so that kept me going."" Jamieson only made the halfway cut by a shot but now trails leader Paul Waring by merely two shots in a four-way tie for second. He won his first and only European title at the Nelson Mandela Championship in South Africa in December. Earlier this year, American Jim Furyk became the sixth man to shoot a 59 on the PGA Tour.","Scotland's Scott Jamieson misses out on a historic 59 at the Portugal Masters .

"(CNN) -- In an ever-evolving, increasingly crowded beverage market, Starbucks is waking up and smelling the coffee. The problem is it's not their house blend. ""Here's a statistic that people are surprised by. Despite the long-term success that we've enjoyed, we have less than 10 percent share of coffee consumption in North America. And less [than] 1 percent share internationally,"" Starbucks Chairman, President and CEO Howard Schultz told CNN Money. Advertising Age also recently pointed out that despite Starbucks being the world's largest coffeehouse chain with more than 13,000 locations in more than 50 countries, even its most devout customers purchase only three of every 10 cups of coffee they drink from Starbucks. So, who is stealing Starbucks' mojo? Folgers, a division of J.M. Smucker Co., is still the largest producer of retail packaged coffee in the United States. Its coffee brands include Folgers and Millstone, and it also manufactures and distributes Dunkin' Donuts coffee to sell in grocery stores. Then there is the other American coffee titan, Maxwell House, which is a Kraft Foods brand. Kraft reported soaring earnings in its 2010 first quarter, linking the growth to new advertising and innovation behind existing Kraft brands such as Maxwell House. This competition is stirring Starbucks to step up its home-brewed strategy, partially by adding some flavor. An AC Nielsen panel recently found that more than 11 percent of American households purchase flavored coffee for home use, making it a $265 million business in the United States. Starbucks Corp. will enter the fray in June when Starbucks Natural Fusions, in vanilla, caramel and cinnamon, arrives at grocery stores. Additionally, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by leaning on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's Best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points. Starbucks acquired its former competitor, Seattle's Best Coffee, seven years ago. ""We are uniquely positioned to reach into these channels because of the brand equity and trust we build with the customers who come into our stores,"" Starbucks said in a statement to CNN. Seattle's Best, in part, will take aim against Starbucks' typically lower-priced, quick-service rivals such as McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. In a new rebranding effort, Starbucks plans to distribute the Seattle's Best brand in Burger King and Subway restaurants nationwide. McDonald's coffee sales have increased every year since the company first introduced its McCafe line of premium coffee in 2006. In April, McDonald's announced its U.S. comparable sales rose 3.8 percent, citing beverages, including the new McCafe offerings such as Frappes, as a top contributor to that growth. Despite all this, Starbucks CEO Schultz said the expanding marketplace might just be an advantage to all of its players. ""The level of awareness that was created by McDonald's' tens of millions of dollars of advertising created more trial in the marketplace and differentiation.""","Starbucks wants a bigger share of N.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pakistan-based terrorist group that is actively attacking American troops across the border in Afghanistan is an ""arm"" of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the top U.S. military officer told Congress on Thursday. The blunt accusation from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Michael Mullen, reflected the growing impatience of U.S. officials with Pakistan's unwillingness to stop the attacks and the belief that Pakistan is actively supporting the insurgents. But the recent high profile attacks by insurgents in Afghanistan represent a shift in strategy by the Taliban, who have ceded control of territory in much of the country, the U.S. secretary of defense said Thursday. ""The insurgency has been turned back in much of the country, including its heartland in the south, and Afghan National Security Forces are increasingly strong and capable,"" Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing. The attacks, including last week's attempt to strike at the NATO headquarters and the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and this week's assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was leading efforts for reconciliation talks, have raised questions about the ability of Afghan security forces to maintain control. But Panetta, testifying to the committee along with Mullen, said the Taliban strikes are a sign of weakness. ""We judge this change in tactics to be a result of a shift in momentum in our favor and a sign of weakness in the insurgency,"" Panetta said. He said many challenges remain. ""We must be more effective in stopping these attacks and limiting the ability of insurgents to create perceptions of decreasing security,"" he told the committee in his opening statement. The chairman of the committee, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said the ability of the Haqqani network, a Pakistani militant group accused of being responsible for last week's Kabul attack and numerous others in which U.S. and NATO troops have died, to launch attacks over the border from Pakistan is unacceptable. Levin expressed frustration with the Pakistani government, which has yet to use its troops to crack down on the insurgents and has not publicly condemned the attacks in Afghanistan, either. Mullen, appearing for the last time in front of the committee before his retirement at the end of the month, spoke candidly about concerns about the threat posed by the Haqqanis. Pakistan is ""exporting"" violence to Afghanistan, he said. ""The Haqqani network, for one, acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence,"" Mullen said. He said Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency supported the Haqqani insurgents who planned and executed the attack on the U.S. Embassy and other strikes in Afghanistan. In doing so, Mullen said, the agency is jeopardizing Pakistan's relations with the United States and Afghanistan. But he added that the solution is not to give up on Pakistan and said a flawed relationship is better than no relationship. Mullen has spent a significant amount of time during his chairmanship building relations with the Pakistanis. ""Some say I have wasted my time,"" Mullen said, but he disagrees, saying the situation would be far worse if not for U.S.-Pakistan relations. In recent meetings between U.S. and Pakistani officials, including Mullen with the top Pakistani military officer and CIA Director David Petraeus with Pakistani's top intelligence officer, the United States has pushed Pakistan to crack down on the Haqqani network, Panetta said. Given the public nature of Thursday's hearing, Panetta would not discuss what further steps the United States is willing to take to stop the attacks, but a U.S. official said this week that the CIA has increased drone strikes against the insurgent network within Pakistan. In Pakistan, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry denied that ISI supports the Haqqani insurgent group, brushing aside the U.S. categorization of the connection as ""perceptions."" In a press briefing held in Islamabad on Thursday, spokesman Tahmina Junjua said Pakistan is not helping the Haqqani network. Replying to a question on whether Pakistan is involved in a proxy war in Afghanistan, Junjua said, ""I would say a categoric no."" Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Friday that the accusations coming out of Washington are unacceptable to Pakistan. ""You will lose an ally,"" Khar said on GEO TV. ""You cannot afford to alienate Pakistan. You cannot afford to alienate the Pakistani people."" Members of Congress have raised the idea of cutting back on the billions of dollars in aid given to Pakistan. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the Senate Appropriations Committee has placed conditions on counterterrorism aid, including that the secretary of state must certify that Pakistan is cooperating in U.S. efforts against the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups. Panetta differs with the State Department on whether that is a fair condition, but said he does support the message it will send. ""Anything that makes clear to them that we cannot tolerate their providing this kind of safe haven to the Haqqanis, and that they have to take action, any signal we can send to them I think would be important to do,"" he said. The top Republican on the committee, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called for slowing down the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to maintain the advantage of the surge of troops added last year. Mullen said there is ""increased risk"" in pushing ahead with the withdrawal of 10,000 troops by next summer, as announced by President Obama. ""While the risk is up, I think it is manageable,"" and military success can still be sustained, he said. McCain pressed Panetta on whether the Rabbani assassination shows the Taliban has no interest in reconciliation. ""It does raise concerns. It raises suspicions. Nevertheless, I think, obviously, we have to continue to try to pursue the opportunities that are out there. But we ought to do it with our eyes open,"" Panetta said. ""The best signal we can send to the Taliban is that we're going to continue to fight them and that we're going to continue to be there, and that we're not going anywhere. And if we can send them that clear signal, I think that, more than anything, would influence their willingness to develop reconciliation."" The top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, believes Taliban fighters in Afghanistan are upset and frustrated, Mullen said. With ""their leadership parked in Pakistan,"" Allen sees ""the fighters on the field in Afghanistan are more and more disgruntled. Their morale is down,"" Mullen explained. Regarding Iraq, Panetta said the United States continues to negotiate over any presence of American troops in that country after 2011. Currently, all U.S. troops will be withdrawing from the country, in accordance with the existing agreement with Iraq. ""No final decisions have been made,"" Panetta said. Iraq has expressed a desire to maintain U.S. trainers and other aid going forward, he noted, to help them deal with security threats. ""I want to be clear that any future security relationship with Iraq will be fundamentally different from the one that we have had since 2003. The United States wants a normal, productive relationship and close strategic partnership with a sovereign Iraqi government going forward,"" Panetta said. ""This kind of security assistance would be a means of furthering our strategic partnership with Iraq that looks to the kind of future role that can best address Iraqi security needs."" McCain urged that the United States not abandon Iraq and ""not withdraw from Iraq as irresponsibly"" as the Obama administration accused the the Bush government of being when the war was started. Panetta and Mullen also warned about cutting too much from the defense budget. If Congress cannot come to an agreement on further spending cuts, an additional $500 million in defense spending would be cut. Mullen said too harsh a cut would have a ""good chance of breaking"" the military. ""We are not going to solve the debt problem on the back of the Pentagon,"" he warned. Panetta was equally emphatic in arguing against further cuts beyond the $350 billion the Pentagon has already committed to over the next 10 years. ""If we pulled that trigger would we be shooting ourselves in the foot,"" asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""We'd be shooting ourselves in the head,"" Panetta said.","Pakistan denies its intelligence agency supports the Haqqani network .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's top diplomat angrily rejected U.S. newspaper reports alleging the Turkish government leaked Israeli intelligence secrets to Iran. ""This is just a smear campaign. This is not true. It is dirty propaganda,"" Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said, according to a ministry spokesman. Davutoglu was referring to a column published in the Washington Post on Thursday. Citing ""knowledgeable sources,"" the Post's David Ignatius reported that in early 2012, the Turkish government revealed to Iranian intelligence ""the identities of up to 10 Iranians who had been meeting inside Turkey with their Mossad case officers."" The Mossad is Israel's intelligence service. The reported leak took place at a time when relations between Turkey and Israel were at an all-time low, after Israeli commandos killed eight Turks and an American activist during a botched 2010 raid against the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish aid ship seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Until then, Turkey and Israel had enjoyed decades of close military, intelligence and economic ties. ""With the full knowledge of the Turks, we used to use the Turkish soil in order to run intelligence operations,"" said Danny Yatom, a retired Israeli major general who spent several years running Mossad. Speaking in a conference call with journalists, Yatom said Israel likely reduced its intelligence-sharing with Turkey after the rupture in relations following the Mavi Marmara raid. But, he added, ""this information that was transferred by the Turks to the Iranians about a year ago, this is information that they (the Turks) might acquire from Israel many years ago."" Washington, a close ally of both Turkey and Israel, has sought to smooth over differences between the Middle Eastern countries. Earlier this year, U.S. President Barak Obama helped broker a telephone apology for the Mavi Marmara raid from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his Turkish counterpart. On Thursday, Turkish officials suggested that the Washington Post report was part of a broader effort to discredit Turkey's top spymaster, Hakan Fidan. A week ago, the Wall Street Journal published a profile of Fidan, who is the head of the Milli Istihbarat Teskilati, or MIT, Turkey's main intelligence agency. The article suggested Fidan was the architect of a policy that has funneled weapons and money to rebels in neighboring Syria. Turkey has been one of the most vocal supporters of the Syrian opposition throughout civil war of the past two and a half years. The Syrian National Coalition, one of the main opposition groups in exile, opposition activists and rebels have been hosted in Turkey, which has also provided health care to injured fighters. In addition, CNN journalists have witnessed weapons being smuggled across the border from Turkey to Syrian opposition groups. But in recent months, several hard-core al Qaeda-linked fighting groups have begun challenging more moderate rebel factions for control of northern Syria. Last month one such group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, drove Syrian rebels out of the northern border town of Azaz. Since then, ISIS militants have repeatedly clashed with rebel groups, which continue to control a key customs terminal on the border between Turkey and Syria. Turkey, meanwhile, has kept the border gate firmly closed. This week, the Turkish military announced its artillery fired at ISIS positions near Azaz in retaliation for a suspected ISIS mortar shell that landed near the Turkish border town of Kilis. One Turkish expert suggested the artillery strikes against al Qaeda-linked targets should be interpreted as a message to Turkey's NATO allies. ""What the Turks did yesterday, is to try to send a message to Turkey's critics, especially in the West, that the Turks have not gotten too cozy with the jihadists,"" said Henri Barkey, a professor of international relations at Lehigh University. This was not the first time Turkish army has engaged in cross-border artillery duels along the frontier with Syria. As the warring parties have grown increasingly fractured, reports say Turkish military units have fired at Syrian government forces, rebels groups, and even Kurdish militias. ""Our engagement rules compel the military to strike back whenever we see a threat to our own borders,"" said a Turkish government official, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity.","""This is just a smear campaign."" says Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- San Diego Mayor Bob Filner, facing a growing tide of sexual harassment allegations, has completed his two-week intensive behavior therapy a week early and will begin outpatient treatment, his lawyer said. But he might not be back at work in his office any time soon. His chief of staff changed the locks, according to numerous reports, including one by CNN affiliate KFMB. Attorney James Payne said in a statement that Filner began treatment on July 29, a week before the mayor previously told reporters he would start. Filner was to complete that phase of treatment Saturday, Payne said. Did mayor target victims of military sexual assault? In the same statement, Payne said Filner would take some personal time this week and would not be available for comment. It is unclear when Filner will return to work, but he is believed to be back in the city he governs after his rehab stint. Victims start talking . An increasing number of women are saying that Filner inappropriately touched them, prompting his chief of staff to resign and fellow Democrats to call for him to step down. In a personal letter to the mayor Friday, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, who addresses Filner as ""Bob,"" wrote: ""We've known each other for a long time. ... So I am speaking to you now on a personal and professional level, and asking you to step down as mayor and get the help you need as a private citizen."" California's other senator, Democrat Dianne Feinstein, has also asked Filner to resign. Eleven women have now accused Filner, 70, of sexual harassment while he was mayor or a congressman. The latest is nurse Michelle Tyler, who said Tuesday that Filner rubbed her arm in his office and asked for dinner dates in June in exchange for his helping a brain-injured Iraq war veteran. She said Filner told her he wanted to kiss her. While Filner acknowledged last month that ""I need help"" and said ""I'm clearly doing something wrong,"" he has also said he believes he will be vindicated when all the facts come out. The mayor has vowed not to resign. The idea that Filner has now completed rehab and could come back to lead San Diego did not sit well with many of his constituents. ""It's ridiculous,"" said Gary Sehnert, a San Diego resident. ""Why is this continuing?"" ""Really mayor? You did what you did and now you want to stay as mayor,"" said William Sawaya, another San Diego resident. ""(Expletive), you're not staying as mayor."" Filner served 10 terms, or 20 years, in Congress before being elected mayor of San Diego last year. CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Los Angeles. Melissa Gray reported and wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- First the good news. Significant progress has been made over the past 13 years in meeting the targets the international community set for social and economic development by 2015. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of government planning agencies, U.N. entities, global aid organizations, international foundations and civil society groups, half a billion fewer people now live in extreme poverty, four out of five children routinely get vaccinated for a variety of diseases, and deaths from malaria have fallen by one quarter. Family planning programs have helped slow population growth, contributing, in particular, to a significant reduction in fertility in the developing world. Maternal death has been reduced, and we are now saving the lives of about 3 million children every year who previously would have died from childhood illnesses. We are also providing primary education for a record number of boys and girls in the developing world. Read this: Men, step up on family planning . However, it's clear that come 2015, the world's report card on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be scored ""Incomplete."" And that's not just because we are likely to fail to meet some of the targets we set for ourselves in the early days of the new century. (We have fallen short on our goals on maternal health and family planning, for example.) We will also get an ""Incomplete"" because we are now facing challenges, like climate change, whose significance we failed to appreciate when the original goals were drafted. With that in mind, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon appointed a U.N. System Task Team on the Post-2015 U.N. Development Agenda to facilitate consultation with stakeholders ranging from member states to civil society, academia and individual citizens. As part of their work, the Task Team produced discussion documents proposing basic principles for a new development framework. The Secretary-General also appointed a High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons to outline a new set of goals designed to complete the work of the original MDGs and address the new challenges of the century ahead. The Secretary-General's vision for the new development framework centers on ending poverty through sustainable development, dealing with the problem of global climate change, and reducing inequality -- between men and women, and between rich and poor. The authors of this article, one of us the president of a developing nation and the other the head of the U.N. Population Fund, believe that Africa will be the test case for the world's resolve and success, or failure, to achieve these goals. This isn't a case of parochialism, though we both happen to be African. It is, instead, our shared judgment that Africa is likely to become the litmus test for whether the global community will have the resolve to work cooperatively to tackle the big issues that will affect us all on our increasingly interconnected and interdependent planet. Consider this. The world has added approximately a billion people since the United Nations drafted the Millennium Development Goals, and is expected to add approximately 3.7 billion more by 2100. Significantly, U.N. experts predict that almost all of that future growth will take place in developing nations, and that a disproportionate share of it will take place in sub-Saharan Africa. With this population growth will come increased demand for food, energy and water; increased pressure on the natural environment; increased demand for medical care; and an increased need for education and jobs. In addition, the effects of climate change are expected to hit sub-Saharan Africa particularly hard, exacerbating all of the challenges above. But the flipside of challenge is opportunity, and the opportunities in Africa are abundant. The 54 countries of Africa comprise, collectively, about 1 billion consumers with an average age of just under 20. This will represent an enormous market for the world's goods and services in the decades ahead. Ozwald Boateng: New wind of change is blowing through Africa . By mid-century, Africans will also represent one quarter of the global labor force, and by the end of the century, Africa will have the world's highest ratio of working age population to dependents. This is a giant potential ""demographic dividend"" that Africa can build upon. With far-sightedness, African countries can also tap the enormous potential of African women and girls. Educating women, providing age-appropriate sex education and access to family planning methods, will free and empower women and girls to make even more significant contributions to Africa's economic development. In many ways, the ""face"" of Africa's future is the face of a teenage girl. Africa's economy will also continue to benefit from the continent's enormous mineral wealth, which, if managed sustainably and equitably, should fuel accelerated economic growth in the decades ahead. The continent's potential for growth is also underscored by the fact that Africa has the world's largest share of underutilized arable land and water. The opportunities are extraordinary, the challenges many. As the United Nations drafts a new set of goals to follow the MDGs, Africa will be the ultimate testing ground for new strategies to end poverty, mitigate the impact of climate change and reduce inequality in the 21st century. However, if Africa gets it ""right,"" the continent will also be the new century's greatest success story.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday that he and Afghan President Hamid Karzai resolved ""the major issues"" of an agreement to keep some U.S. military forces in Aghanistan after 2014. But a potential deal-breaker, legal immunity for U.S. troops, was referred to a council of elders. The immunity issue caused the abrupt pullout of U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. ISAF member killed in Afghanistan . Without an agreement, U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan with all NATO forces at the end of 2014. The NATO mission now has about 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, about half from the United States. American and Afghan diplomats have worked for a year on a new agreement which would allow roughly 10,000 American troops to remain. Karzai said he did not have the authority to negotiate immunity for foreign troops. ""We will leave this to the representatives of Afghanistan who will come to the Loya Jirga, and then take it to the Afghan Parliament, and the Afghan people can decide on this,"" he said through an interpreter at a joint press conference in Kabul. After Karzai recited a list of complaints about American operations in the country, Kerry struck a positive tone. ""We have resolved in these last 24 hours the major issues the president went through,"" he said, adding the United States would ""respect completely"" the need for the agreement to be approved by the Loya Jirga council of elders next month and then the Afghan Parliament. Karzai complained that the United States' security guarantees have fallen short of protecting his country from attacks short of invasion -- a reference to possible threats from Pakistan. But he sounded satisfied with assurances that American troops would limit their operations inside his country. ""The U.S. has agreed to stop all unilateral operations in Afghanistan,"" Karzai said. He added later, ""And under no circumstances foreign forces go and search the homes of Afghans.""

"Washington (CNN)  -- The NAACP has passed a resolution that condemns what it feels is rampant racism in the Tea Party movement. Members passed the measure on Tuesday at the organization's 101st annual convention in Kansas City, Missouri. Tea Party activists have swiftly denounced the action as unfounded and unfair. The resolution pits the nation's oldest civil rights organization, with its storied history of wins on behalf of racial justice, against a grassroots conservative movement that has won some recent political races and is flexing its muscle in Republican circles. ""We take no issue with the Tea Party. We believe in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in a democracy,"" Ben Jealous, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said in a statement. ""We take issue with the Tea Party's continued tolerance for bigotry and bigoted statements. The time has come for them to accept the responsibility that comes with influence and make clear there is no space for racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in their movement,"" Jealous said. Tea Party leaders reacted to the NAACP action with swift and angry derision. ""I am disinclined to take lectures on racial sensitivity from a group that insists on calling black people, 'Colored,' "" Mark Williams, national spokesman of the Tea Party Express, told CNN. ""The Tea Party [movement] is about the constitution of this country...[and] ensuring equality for each and every individual human being."" Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Tea Party favorite, said the charge from the NAACP is ""false, appalling, and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand."" ""To be unjustly accused of association with what Reagan so aptly called that 'legacy of evil' is a traumatizing experience, and one of which the honest, freedom-loving patriots of the Tea Party movement are truly undeserving,"" she wrote in a posting on her Facebook page Tuesday night. Palin responds to allegations of Tea Party racism . Palin said the only purpose of such an accusation is to dissuade Americans from joining the Tea Party, a movement she said is ""motivated by love of country and all that is good and honest about our proud and diverse nation."" But NAACP leaders feel there is ample evidence to prove Palin and others who deny there is racism in Tea Party are wrong. Hilary Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, laid out what the group feels is the proof during an interview with CNN. ""After observing Tea Party activities throughout the country -- which culminated with the outrageous and racist behavior of Tea Party activists during the historic congressional vote to pass into law comprehensive health care legislation -- the NAACP began more closely investigating the Tea Party. Specifically as it was reported to us that Tea Party activists spat on [Congressman] John Lewis, a veteran civil rights activist and associate to Dr. Martin Luther King, and called Congressman Emanuel Cleaver the 'N-word' and called [Congressman] Barney Frank ... one of the first openly gay members of Congress, the 'F-word,' "" Shelton said. The NAACP also claims that Tea Party activists have engaged in racist behavior, for example, by waving signs that degrade African Americans and President Obama, in particular. Also, the NAACP says, a number of Tea Party members think that issues of importance to African Americans get too much attention. ""Rather than talking about the real issues of these incidents that have happened ... [activists] wind up blaming the messenger,"" Shelton said. ""It seems like its denial ... that allows them to focus on themselves."" iReporter says Tea Party must address issue of racism . Many Tea Party leaders have publicly denounced elements of prejudice. During a May 6 interview on ABC's ""The View,"" Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express, pointedly looked into the camera and told any prejudiced followers, ""This is not a racist movement. We don't want you here. Go away if that's what you're about. We're about the fiscal issues and about being American."" Williams, the Tea Party Express spokesman, said, ""We've had these people show up on the fringes of our group ... because we attract TV cameras. What these people all universally learn, the racist groups included, is that they're not welcome."" Other Tea Party leaders also have publicly spoken out against racism in their movement. While Shelton acknowledged the effort from ""a few"" leaders, she said the level of repudiation is not stopping displays of racism from many Tea Party followers. ""Not only are some elements of the Tea Party movement being resistant to that [message of repudiation], but we've seen some elements acting out, in some cases in a violently racist behavior. And that is what we want to see stop,"" Shelton said. Shelton cited the movement's loose-knit patchwork of small, local groups that might not toe the line of Tea Party leaders.","NAACP passes resolution blasting Tea Party for ""continued tolerance for bigotry""

"Blair, West Virginia (CNN) -- We're at the peak of Blair Mountain in the middle of southern West Virginia. It's about 85 degrees, the coolest it has been all week, and there's a slight breeze that carries voices before we can see the singers. ""This land is your land. This land is my land."" More than 600 dusty, sweaty people are singing as they hike through the hardwoods up the mountain. Their protest signs -- ""Save Blair Mountain"" and ""Abolish Mountaintop Removal"" -- poke through the leaves. The song is a Woody Guthrie tune, the one that became a folk anthem of sorts in the 1960s, and it seems very appropriate for this moment. ""As I went walking that ribbon of highway, I saw above me that endless skyway,"" the marchers continue. See a preview of ""Battle for Blair Mountain: Working in America"" About 150 people in this group have been walking the twisting mountain highways through West Virginia's coal fields for six days. The 50-mile march is re-creating the 1921 March on Blair that led to a bloody battle between thousands of coal miners and coal company supporters. The fight eventually brought unions, along with respectable wages, to the coal mines of West Virginia. But this time, the march isn't about unions. It's about saving a mountain. It has been organized to oppose ""MTR,"" or mountaintop removal, a highly effective type of mining that involves blasting away slopes to get at the profitable coal seams underneath. Coal companies own most of the land rights on Blair Mountain now, and they have fought national historic landmark status for the site, which would protect it from being destroyed. ""If you stand for preserving our cultural heritage instead of destroying it, you stand for Blair Mountain,"" Chuck Keeney said to his followers before he led marchers out of Marmet, West Virginia, last week. Keeney is a history professor at the local community college, and the great grandson of Frank Keeney, one of the organizers of the original March on Blair. Chuck believes in replacing mountaintop removal with more traditional underground mining, which he says will employ more people. ""If you stand for more jobs instead of fewer jobs, you stand for Blair Mountain,"" he says. But this is coal country, where families and fortunes depend on coal jobs, and most people who live here believe the opposite of what Keeney says. ""Why don't they get a job, instead of taking ours,"" one young coal miner watching from his porch asks. Ten miles from their destination, group organizers, and even miners opposed to the march, tell us that the protesters have now entered ""the belly of the beast."" ""Don't Support Coal?...Sit in the Dark!!"" reads one of many homemade signs hung on fences and porches along the route. Coal is used to generate about half of the electricity consumed in the United States, and West Virginia is the second largest producer of that coal. Wyoming is first. ""I don't want to ruin the entire West Virginia economy, which is based on the coal industry. That is not my goal,"" a young activist said during the march. ""I just don't want to see coal mining that destroys rivers, drives away the biodiversity of such a beautiful place and also drives away other jobs that could be in place of coal mining."" She is surprised when told that her environmental stance against coal is interpreted by local miners as attempt to take away their jobs. Bob Shultz is a union miner watching the march from his front porch. He lost his job when the coal company near his home was denied a mountaintop removal mining permit by the Environmental Protection Agency. ""Mountaintop removal is what built this house, sends that little girl to school, provides insurance for my wife, bought two cars and that motorcycle I showed you in the garage. I'm not real impressed,"" he says as the marchers pass. Joe Stanley is one of a handful of miners who have joined the protest. The retired miner believes more miners would be involved in this march if they weren't afraid. ""This is a tough situation here. This is the only game in town,"" he tells us. ""That is why these people are yelling at us today, because they are brainwashed to think 'Oh, I can't have a job unless it's a mountaintop removal job.'"" ""Welcome to Coal Country"" says a sign greeting the marchers as they cross the Logan County line. Three generations of protesters gather at the entrance to a public lake where the marchers plan to camp that night. What toddlers, parents and grandparents scream and shout at the protesters can only be described as hateful. They seem almost oblivious to our cameraman. One mother utters in earshot, ""I wonder if they hate us as much as we hate them?"" A toddler at her feet screams, ""Go home, go home,"" as the long line of marchers file by silently. We find Diann Kish, the wife of a retired miner, at the counter-protest. She has defended coal for more than a decade and feels strongly that coal has provided for her family and her community. We have met with Kish before and visited a mountaintop removal site with her. She told us she doesn't cry when she sees a mountain being dismantled because she sees ""a job in the making."" ""It's been wonderful to talk to the opposition with no violence,"" Kish said along the marchers' route. ""Peace -- it's all we want. From what I'm told, they're not allowed to say anything back. We just told them to go home or leave our state alone. That's what we want and that's from the heart."" The marchers arrive at their destination and host a large rally before climbing Blair Mountain. One of the speakers is Robert Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy. Standing nearby, listening to Kennedy, is Billy Smutko. He remembers when Robert Kennedy's father came through Logan in 1960 campaigning for John F. Kennedy during the presidential election. Smutko is the son of a miner. His grandfather died in a Logan County mine. He lives on the same land where he grew up, just behind where Diann Kish lives now. But his view of mountaintop removal is completely different from hers. He is touched when he hears Kennedy's speech, and tells us that it shows people beyond Logan County care about an issue so important to him. ""Having all these folks come in here gives me hope we can put an end to this type of mining and save our homelands,"" he said. The new ""March on Blair Mountain"" ends in song and celebration at the top of the mountain. Organizers erect a homemade monument to commemorate the original battle for Blair and congratulate the crowd for their long journey. In a final act of protest, about 100 marchers break off from the larger group as part of a planned act of civil disobedience. They climb over a gate that blocks a dirt road running along the ridge line. They attempt to walk out to the edge of a mountaintop removal site that has already encroached on the historic battlefield. State police officers pursue the protesters but only arrest one person for trespassing and littering on coal company property. March organizer Chuck Keeney sums up the march as a success for raising awareness, but wants to do more to make sure there is no mountaintop mining of Blair. ""If you can't save this mountain,"" he said, ""you can't save any mountain.""","Protesters marched to oppose mountain removal mining on West Virginia's Blair Mountain .

"(CNN) -- Betty Ford, the widow of late President Gerald Ford and a co-founder of an eponymous addiction center in California, has died at the age of 93, according to the director of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. Ford died Friday evening with family at her bedside, according to a family member. Elaine Didier, the director of the Grand Rapids, Michigan, museum, confirmed Ford's death to CNN. No other details were immediately available. The family is expected to release a statement later Friday or Saturday, Didier said. Condolences began pouring in soon after news broke about her death -- including from celebrities who sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center. ""As far as I'm concerned, Betty Ford saved my life,"" Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks said. Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler, who revealed in his recent autobiography that he was treated at the Betty Ford Center for drug addiction, also praised Ford's work. ""Betty Ford took a risk at one of the worst times of her life and came forward to share a message of recovery in order to serve others,"" Tyler said. ""Her vision, passion and amazing heart led to the Betty Ford Center, the gold standard of treatment facilities. She will be missed, but her work in recovery will live on."" President Barack Obama remembered the former first lady as a ""powerful advocate for women's health and women's rights"" and someone who ""helped reduce the social stigma surrounding addiction."" His predecessor, George W. Bush, added that ""because of her leadership, many lives were saved."" Some of the many others offering praise and sympathy included Nancy Reagan (calling Ford ""an inspiration""), and former presidents George H. W. Bush (describing her as a ""wonderful wife and mother, a great friend and a courageous first lady) and Jimmy Carter (saying she was ""a close personal friend"" and ""a remarkable political spouse."") Born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in Chicago, she grew up in Grand Rapids. At the age of 21, she moved to New York City to work as a dancer and model. She returned to the Midwest two years later. One year after divorcing William Warren after five years of marriage, she wed Gerald Ford -- a former star football player at the University of Michigan, decorated U.S. Navy veteran and budding Republican politician -- in 1948. That year, the woman now known as Betty Ford campaigned with her new husband on his successful venture to become a U.S. congressman from Michigan. She gave birth to three sons and a daughter over the course of their 58-year marriage. The family moved to Washington, where Gerald Ford served in the Capitol for 25 years before being tapped in 1973 as then-President Richard Nixon's vice president in place of Spiro T. Agnew. Just over 10 months later, Betty Ford became first lady when her husband was sworn in as the 38th president of the United States. Gerald Ford took office after Nixon resigned in the wake of his pending impeachment following the crisis and cover-up of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Betty Ford soon made headlines, holding press conferences and publicly discussing her diagnosis with breast cancer. The first lady talked about abortion, pre-marital sex and equal rights in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in 1975 -- the same year Newsweek named her its ""Woman of the Year."" According to the Ford library and museum's website, her candidness initially drew some criticism, but in a short time, 75% of Americans approved of her in public opinion polls. But in 1978, just over one year after leaving the White House after her husband lost his campaign to remain president, Ford made headlines of a different kind. She entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital to seek treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller abuse. That same year, she published the first of two autobiographies, entitled ""The Times of My Life."" Ford would go on to become a high-profile example of someone who battled substance abuse issues and was a tireless advocate for drug- and alcohol-abuse treatment. ""My addiction was a combination of alcohol and the prescription drugs that ... both were a part of my life, but they did not become a problem until they overrode my common sense,"" Ford told CNN's Larry King in 2003. ""I didn't know what was happening, I just knew that I felt great and the pain was gone."" Her work paid dividends in October 1982 when, along with Leonard Firestone, she opened the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California. To this day, the center remains one of the most well-known and respected places nationwide for treatment of alcoholism and other drug dependencies. Ford also fought to promote awareness and research on breast cancer, with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation eventually naming an award in her honor. She earned numerous honors over her life, including a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 and the Congressional Gold Medal eight years later. Gerald Ford died on December 26, 2006, at the couple's home in Rancho Mirage. He was 93.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bo the Portuguese water dog made his White House debut under cloudy skies Tuesday afternoon, spending several minutes taking his new family on a lively romp over the South Lawn with frequent stops for hearty sniffs at his new surroundings. Malia Obama practices walking Bo as her parents and sister, Sasha, wait their turn. Bo landed on all four feet at his fourth home in his six short months of life, fulfilling President Obama's campaign promise to get his daughters a dog in return for all the time he spent on the road during the long presidential fight. ""He's a star. He's got star quality,"" the president said of the black curly pup with white front feet and chest and a lion-cut tail. The Obamas ended up with a purebred dog, despite the president's preference for a mutt, largely because of 10-year-old Malia's allergies -- Portuguese water dogs don't shed -- and because of opportunity.  Watch Bo frolic on the White House lawn » . Bo didn't fit in well with his first owners and was returned to the breeder in March. That breeder happened to be the breeder of Sen. Ted Kennedy's Portuguese water dogs, and when Kennedy learned the puppy was available, he arranged to offer him to the Obamas. Bo spent a month with Kennedy's trainer before coming to the White House for an initial visit over the weekend and for his official welcome Tuesday. ""Dog Whisperer"" Cesar Millan said on Tuesday afternoon that Portuguese water dogs are an active breed and will need long walks and will need to understand quickly who is the ""pack leader."" ""Very important everybody plays the leadership role -- the girls, Ms. Michelle, obviously, the president,"" he said. ""Everybody has to learn to walk the dog, to master the walk."" The Obamas, Millan said, have an opportunity to model good behavior for dog owners. ""This is definitely the most popular dog in the world right now,"" he said. ""This is why it's very important for everybody -- all the Obama family -- to practice the exercise, the discipline and affection."" While out with his family and the dog Tuesday afternoon, Obama said Bo had ""a bunch of possibilities"" of where to sleep, but his own bed wasn't one of those. Bo will be allowed into the Oval Office, he said, and the family will take turns with walks. The president and his family also shared some of their newfound knowledge about Portuguese water dogs. ""The only concern we have is that apparently, Portuguese water dogs like tomatoes. Michelle's garden is in danger,"" he said. ""We don't have tomatoes,"" the first lady said. ""Not yet,"" Obama reminded. ""He doesn't know how to swim,"" chimed in 7-year-old Sasha. ""Apparently they have to be taught how to swim,"" the president said. ""They have webbed feet. And they herd fish for the fishermen in Portugal. That is what we've heard.""","Portuguese water dog cavorts on South Lawn with Obama family .

"(CNN) -- The American woman who sent her adopted son back to Russia must pay $150,000 in child support, a Tennessee judge reaffirmed Friday. Torry Hansen's attorney, Ed Yarbrough, told CNN he will file a motion within a few weeks asking the court to modify or terminate the support, which was first ordered earlier this year. The United States and Russia last year signed an agreement to strengthen procedural safeguards for adoptions following the 2010 incident. Grandmother: Adopted boy sent back to Russia was violent . Artyem Saveliev, adopted from a Russian orphanage, was put on a plane back to Moscow. The Shelbyville, Tennessee, family claimed they feared for their safety after a series of violent episodes from the boy, then 7. An investigation was launched after the child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry with a letter from his adoptive mother asking Russian authorities to annul the adoption. In the letter, Hansen said the boy was ""mentally unstable,"" and said she had been misled about his mental condition. The World Association for Children and Parents had coordinated the adoption. A lawsuit was filed against Hansen for breach of contract and child support. In May, the association said Artyem is still a U.S. citizen and under Tennessee law Hansen is legally considered to be his mother. The child has been living in a group care facility outside of Moscow. According to CNN Nashville affiliate WKRN, Hansen testified Friday in Lewisburg, Tennessee, that the boy wanted to kill her.

"(CNN) -- Official Washington, still stuck in the government shutdown of its own making, seems exceedingly short on wisdom these days. But maybe it is looking in the wrong places for answers. Maybe, for one example, there is an unexpected lesson of sorts to be found in the history of baseball. That sport, which is currently moving through its postseason and toward the World Series, is hardly without it own troubles; it has endured its share of shutdowns, strikes and lockouts. It was during one of those work stoppages -- the seven-week strike of 1981-- that an anguished fan pleaded publicly with the leaders of the sport, both the owners and the players, to come to their senses. The fan was Bart Giamatti, who at the time was the president of Yale University and who would go on to become the commissioner of Major League Baseball. Giamatti, frustrated by the posturing and excuses on both sides, wrote that the failure to open up the gates of the ballparks was ""utter foolishness. ... The people of America care about baseball, not about your squalid little squabbles. Reassume your dignity and remember that you are the temporary custodians of an enduring public trust."" Indeed. The squalid little squabbles that have gummed up the daily machinery of the federal government have laid bare a stark truth: the unwillingness of leaders of both parties to get past their desire to portray themselves solely as winners, and those on the other side solely as losers. That the majority of the public -- the employers of these officials -- want the government to open back up seems to have mattered little to those entrusted with the authority to open it. The politicians' belated nervous scrambling of the last few days, prompted by the citizens' disdain, has only highlighted how badly they overestimated the limits of the country's patience. During political campaign seasons, candidates, both Republicans and Democrats, love to proclaim: ""This election isn't about me. It's about you."" That thought tends to evaporate after the election is won. The Congress and the White House have been acting as if the wishes of the citizens to get the government operating again are an irritating distraction from what the political leaders are most focused on: stubbornly and frantically shifting the blame to the other guy. If Harry Truman proclaimed that ""the buck stops here,"" the people in charge in the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House seem resolved to continually bleat: ""The buck stops there."" It is all someone else's fault. And the public is supposed to accept that. If it were federal workers, instead of the elected leaders of the federal government, who had made the decision to close down buildings, parks, programs and services, they could expect to be in dire trouble. President Ronald Reagan, when federal air traffic controllers walked off their jobs in 1981, said: ""Government cannot close down the assembly line. It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government's reason for being."" But when it is the elected officials themselves who close down the assembly line, they expect the citizens to understand. Every moment the political leaders have spent preening before the cameras has been a moment they were not working to reopen the government. There is a stirring sentence in the creed of the Navy SEALs: ""I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions."" It is as if the men and women in charge in Washington have adopted the mirror opposite of that code. Baseball fan Giamatti wrote, in the midst of that 1981 strike: ""There is no general sympathy for either of your sides. Nor will there be."" The sooner that the leaders of government -- the ""temporary custodians of an enduring public trust"" -- fully comprehend that there is, and will be, no general sympathy heading their way, either, the sooner they may realize that it's time to step away from the television cameras and cease their futile search for that sympathy. And instead do the jobs they are being paid to do. How have you been affected by the shutdown? Share your story. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: D.C. pols should heed words of then-future MLB chief Giamatti during 1981 strike .

"(CNN) -- ""What we're talking about is not an open-ended intervention. This would not be another Iraq or Afghanistan,"" President Barack Obama said this weekend in an address to the American public about a possible U.S. military strike in Syria. That the president knows he must say what the strike in Syria is not says a great deal about the uphill battle he has faced in making a case for limited military intervention. The ghosts of the Iraq War hover over any Syria action that the United States potentially undertakes. But Iraq is not Syria. While Americans are exhausted after 12 years of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in which nearly 7,000 U.S. service members were killed, the differences between the two conflicts are worth noting if the case for Syria is to be judged on its merits. 1. Chemical weapons have been deployed. Unlike Iraq, where evidence supporting the case that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction turned out to be faulty, Syria's arsenal (in this case, chemical weapons, which are considered a form of weapons of mass destruction) is well-documented. The Obama administration has assembled an extensive collection of evidence, both crowd-sourced and from intelligence sources, that point convincingly to President Bashar al-Assad's forces having gassed innocent civilians. And U.N. investigators are scheduled to share their report soon. 2. The United States has not been alone in condemning the regime and pushing for action. Unlike in 2002 when France led the vocal opposition to the U.S. attack on Iraq, our NATO ally stands next to America in supporting action against Syria's dictator. British Prime Minister David Cameron is also in favor of action, though Parliament and the British public remain largely opposed. Leaders of both countries have argued that the Assad regime cannot be permitted to trample international norms. Also different from a decade ago -- regional powers such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Jordan have pushed for greater U.S. intervention on the diplomatic and military fronts for months. Without the international community stepping in, the Syria conflict could threaten to overrun the region. 3. Extremists have gained because of U.S. inaction. The aftermath of American military action saw Iraq become the flame to which extremist fighters from other countries flocked. Extremists seized the opportunity created by the chaos and slashed the country open further, taking advantage of the upheaval to foment a conflict that pierced the heart of Iraq's sectarian divide. In Syria, however, extremists have seized opportunities while a civil war rages. For months, supporters of greater U.S. intervention in Syria have warned that if the United States continues to stay out of Syria, jihadists would pile in to Syria. They have. Extremist elements have gained ground with help from coffers filled by supporters in Qatar and elsewhere. The number of extremists operating in Syria has grown in part because no credible, well-funded alternative exists. Inaction could lead to extremists' multiplication, not their neutralization. 4. There's a savage humanitarian crisis with no end in sight. Before the American invasion, Iraq was a functioning state and society, albeit one presided by a dictator who had used chemical weapons in the past and ruled with fear and terror. But it faced no epic humanitarian crisis. Syria today is not functioning; it is in fragments. More than 100,000 people -- the population of Cambridge, Massachusetts, or Burbank, California -- have been killed in the 2Â½-year war. Refugees number 2 million, a staggering figure, and half of those are children. Close to 800,000 of these displaced are under the age of 11. Neighbors Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon all face the specter of instability created by the mounting numbers of refugees flooding their borders. Jordan has said as much, warning that it is a strain to absorb the refugees arriving each day. America is skeptical after a conflict that many now feel was not worth fighting for based on premises that turned out to be untrue. Unlike in 2002, America is no longer ready to give its policymakers the benefit of doubt when it comes to entering battle. The past decade has left America exhausted, unwilling to pay another bill in treasured lives lost and dollars spent. America's commander in chief is aware of the reluctance. This is why he called for limited intervention. It seems that an endless war -- or even an extended one that includes ground troops -- is unlikely. Getting into another protracted conflict in faraway lands is the last thing that Americans want. ""I know that the American people are weary after a decade of war, even as the war in Iraq has ended, and the war in Afghanistan is winding down,"" the president said. ""But we are the United States of America. We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria."" As Congress and the American public debate just what to do in Syria, it is important to be clear-eyed about just what Syria is and what it is not. And it is not Iraq.

"(CNN) -- Elite sprinters Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell tested positive for banned substances on a day of shame for athletics. Gay, a former world champion from the U.S., said Sunday he was told by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that an A sample from an out of competition test taken in May came back positive. Later Sunday, Powell, a former world-record holder from Jamaica, said he was caught for using the banned stimulant oxilofrine that showed up in a test at last month's Jamaican trials. Jamaica's Sherone Simpson, too, revealed she was caught for doping. Gay didn't name the substance found in his system and added that he never knowingly took performance-enhancing drugs. He pulled out of next month's world championships in Russia. ""I don't have a sabotage story,"" Gay was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""I basically put my trust in someone and was let down. I made a mistake. ""I know exactly what went on, but I can't discuss it right now."" Gay and Powell, both 30, become the second and third high-profile track stars in a month to be embroiled in a doping scandal. Two-time Olympic 200-meter champion Veronica Campbell-Brown was provisionally suspended in June after she tested positive for a banned substance. The Jamaican sprinter reportedly had traces of a banned diuretic, which is used as a masking agent, in a sample she provided to testers at Jamaica's International Invitational World Challenge in May. British newspaper The Guardian reported the banned diuretic was from a cream she was using in an attempt to recover from a leg injury. Gay was one of the athletes shown on USADA's website as part of My Victory, ""an initiative in the fight to preserve clean sport."" In a statement Sunday, USADA said it ""appreciates"" Gay's handling of the affair. ""In response to Mr. Gay's statements, USADA appreciates his approach to handling this situation and his choice to voluntarily remove himself from competition while the full facts surrounding his test are evaluated,"" it said. ""The B sample will be processed shortly, and as in all cases all athletes are innocent unless or until proven otherwise through the established legal process, and any attempt to sensationalize or speculate is a disservice to due process, fair play, and to those who love clean sport."" USA Track and Field CEO Max Siegel said it was ""not the news anyone wanted to hear, at any time, about any athlete."" ""As we approach the world championships, we will remain focused on the competition at hand and winning the right way,"" he said in a statement. Gay posted the fastest time in the 100 meters this year when he clocked 9.75 seconds at last month's U.S. trials in Iowa. For an athlete who has struggled with injuries, it provided hope -- and a possible challenge to sprint king Usain Bolt of Jamaica -- ahead of the world championships in Moscow that begin August 10. Gay won gold in the 100 and 200 meters at the 2007 world championships in Osaka but suffered a hamstring injury a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. He didn't make the 100-meter final. Last summer at the 2012 Olympics in London, Gay finished fourth in the 100 meters, edged by fellow American Justin Gatlin -- Gatlin once served a four-year ban for doping -- by one-hundredth of a second for the bronze. Powell held the world record in the 100 meters for three years prior to Bolt beating it in 2008. He was part of Jamaica's victorious 4x100-meter relay team at the 2008 Olympics. ""I want to be clear in saying to my family, friends, and most of all my fans worldwide that I have never knowingly or willfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules,"" Powell said in a statement as reported by the online version of the Jamaica Gleaner. ""I am not now, nor have I ever been a cheat. ""This result has left me completely devastated in many respects."" Powell could have been picked to compete in the relay in Moscow but acknowledged that now wasn't a possibility. Simpson, in a statement also reported by the Gleaner, said she tested positive for oxilofrine. She won gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens in the 4x100-meter relay. ""As an athlete, I know I am responsible for whatever goes into my body,"" the 28-year-old said. ""I would not intentionally take an illegal substance of any form into my system.""","Sprinters Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell test positive for banned substances .

"TBILISI, Georgia (CNN)  -- A grim Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Friday that he signed a cease-fire agreement that requires the immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces from Georgian soil. Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili announces Friday he signed a cease-fire agreement with Russia. The agreement includes a provision for independent monitors and an eventual reconstruction plan for Georgia's economy, said U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who brought the documents to Tbilisi, Georgia's capital. The two met for almost five hours, the Georgian president said. Later Friday, the office of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who brokered the agreement, said Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had confirmed Russia's cooperation. ""His country will sign a cease-fire accord with Georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements, including a troop withdrawal,"" Sarkozy's office said. Fighting that started last week has died down in the region, but Russian forces remain. The warfare raged for several days until Sarkozy's diplomatic efforts helped lessen the violence. Sarkozy undertook the role because he holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. Saakashvili opened a news conference announcing the agreement with a bitter tirade against what he characterized as European nations' appeasement in advance of a Russian invasion last week. NATO's decision in April not to admit Georgia as a member encouraged Russia to build up forces and attack Georgia with impunity, he said. ""Who invited the trouble here?"" he asked. ""Who invited this arrogance here? Who invited the innocent deaths here? Not only those people who perpetrated this are responsible, but also those people who failed to stop it."" Rice emphasized that all Russian troops must return to the positions they held before the conflict began.  Watch as Rice says, ""This is no longer 1968"" » . Georgia last week launched a military incursion into South Ossetia to rout separatist rebels. Russia, which supports the separatists, responded the next day, sending tanks across the border into South Ossetia. The conflict quickly spread to other parts of Georgia and to Abkhazia, another breakaway region. ""We support Georgia's sovereignty; we support its independence; we support its territorial integrity; we support its democracy and its democratically elected government,"" Rice said. She said an independent monitoring force must be put in place as soon as possible and that talks were under way to assemble one. ""Never, ever will Georgia reconcile with the occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory,"" Saakashvili said. Saakashvili had hesitated Thursday evening when asked whether he was ready to sign the cease-fire papers Rice was carrying. ""We'll have to see what she has to bring,"" Saakashvili said on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""We are still in the negotiating process."" In Washington, President Bush chided Russia on Friday for Cold War-style behavior, saying, ""bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century."" Bush said the United States stands ""with the people of Georgia and their democratically elected government."" He said the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity ""must be respected."" ""We will not cast them aside,"" he said. Bush said Russia's invasion of Georgia has ""damaged its credibility."" ""Russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors,"" Bush said, calling Georgia a ""courageous democracy.""  Watch Bush explain why Georgia matters » . Bush said he has been receiving updates from his national security team about the situation. Bush said Rice would travel to his ranch near Crawford, Texas, where the two will confer. He said Defense Secretary Robert Gates is briefing him on humanitarian assistance and that he is working closely with ""our partners in Europe and other members of the G-7 to bring a resolution to this crisis."" Administration officials said this week the United States and its allies were considering kicking Russia out of the Group of Eight, the group of the world's most important international economies, as punishment for its actions in Georgia. ""Moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all Georgian territory,"" Bush said. He said Georgia has been part ""of an inspiring and hopeful new chapter in Europe's history,"" and he noted that Europe ""has moved beyond"" the world wars and the Cold War, the standoff between Soviet-style communism and the West. iReport.com: Did you experience the Cold War? ""Unfortunately, Russia has tended to view the expansion of freedom and democracy as a threat to its interests,"" Bush said. ""The opposite is true. Free and prosperous societies on Russia's borders will advance Russia's interests by serving as sources of stability and economic opportunity."" The United States is hopeful that Russia will embrace ""a future of cooperation and peace"" that would help all parties, he said. ""The Cold War is over,"" Bush said. ""The days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us. A contentious relationship with Russia is not in America's interest.

"(CNN) -- On the one-year anniversary of President Mohamed Morsy's inauguration, tens of thousands of Egyptians marched in the streets of Cairo in an effort to remove him from office. The Associated Press described the protesters as ""an array of secular and liberal Egyptians, moderate Muslims, Christians â€” and what the opposition says is a broad sector of the general public that has turned against the Islamists."" You would think these protesters represent an Egypt more favorable or in line with American interests. Unfortunately, our government supports the current regime of Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood. Earlier this year, we sent Egypt's government 20 F-16 fighter jets, Abrams tanks and other military aid. I introduced an amendment that would halt the transfer of advanced weapons to Egypt. I argued that the situation in that country was too volatile and that Morsy was not someone the United States should necessarily embrace. My amendment was defeated in the Senate, 79 to 19. Last week, President Obama deployed more than 400 Army soldiers to Egypt as part of a nine-month ""peacekeeping mission,"" which could include responding to protestsâ€”or even riotsâ€”led potentially by Egyptians seeking a more secular or moderate government. Our government insists on calling Morsy an ally. Morsy, on the other hand, has called Jews ""bloodsuckers"" and has said they are the ""descendants of apes and pigs."" The Obama administration announced in March that we no longer had enough money to continue giving White House tours because of the sequester. That same month, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Morsy and pledged $250 million in additional aid to Egypt. Before America supported the Muslim Brotherhood, we supported Morsy's predecessor, Hosni Mubarak. For decades, we aided the Mubarak regime to the tune of about $60 billion in total. When Egyptians protested Mubarak in January 2011, F-16 jets were used by Mubarak to intimidate protesters. Those jets were supplied to Egypt by the United States. When hundreds of thousands of Egyptians rallied in Tahir Square to protest three decades of martial law, Mubarak doused them with tear gas made in Pennsylvania and paid for with American taxpayer's money. Mubarak abused and tortured his people for decades, while we subsidized his government. As Egyptians marched in the streets to remove this dictator from power in early 2011, former Vice President Dick Cheney said we should stand by Mubarak and called him our ""good friend."" For many Egyptians, the United States was Mubarak. In their eyes, we were the same. To some, we are now undoubtedly Morsy. Indeed, the weapons that were once given to Mubarak or bought with U.S. dollars are now in the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt is just one example of our misguided foreign policy. There are multiple examples of our government aiding and abetting despotic regimes in ways that ultimately work against American interests. The same Washington leaders who were eager to aid Mubarak, and now Morsy, were also once the loudest voices for supporting Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. They are the same Democrat and Republican hawks who later insisted we back the Libyan rebels. They are the same people who now demand we fund the Syrian rebels, even though al-Nusra and others who belong to the resistance are also affiliated with al Qaeda. The problem with constantly intervening in these troubled parts of the world is that there are often no clear good guys or bad guys. Today's ally can quickly become tomorrow's enemy. This should be a paramount and obvious concern, but in Washington it is almost always treated as an afterthought. Also, what kind of message does funding despots send to the rest of the world? When Mubarak was our ""good friend,"" he was certainly no friend to the Egyptian people. Judging by the protests in Cairo on Sunday, the same can probably be said of Morsy's regime. You cannot give people liberty. They must fight for it themselves. People around the world seek to emulate and embrace our concept of freedom. America should continue to lead, something we often do best by example. But what kind of example do we set when we side with the enemies of freedom? How can we have influence in troubled parts of the world when we cuddle up to regimes responsible for much of the trouble? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rand Paul.","Rand Paul: Why is the U.S. supporting Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy?

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Four prominent neurologists say they cannot see how Sen. Pete Domenici can continue his work as a U.S. senator given his diagnosis with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a type of dementia. September tests showed Sen. Pete Domenici's brain disorder had progressed since an April checkup. The disease attacks the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which control judgment, complex decision-making, communication, mood and behavior. None of the four doctors is treating Domenici, nor is any familiar with his case, but all have treated patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or FTLD. Dr. David Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, says when his patients learn they have FTLD, he tells them it's best to stop working. ""They would be prone to have poor judgment and make mistakes,"" Knopman said. ""I would encourage them to leave their employment."" Domenici, a six-term New Mexico Republican, announced Thursday that he will not seek re-election after his current term expires in January 2009. It's not clear how long the senator has known of his condition. ""For at least two years, I have felt very little impact from this disease,"" he said in announcing his decision. But September tests showed the condition had progressed since a checkup in April, he said. ""While the progression was slight, I had to consider whether I could in good conscience run for re-election and serve you as well as you deserve for another six-year term,"" Domenici told an audience in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A source close to Domenici, 75, says his physician at Johns Hopkins University Hospital ""has a comfort level with his ability to finish out the term."" The source added, ""Those of us who work with him have not seen much deterioration."" Dr. Bruce Miller, a neurologist at the University of California-San Francisco, says that of the 500 patients he's treated for FTLD, very few have been able to keep working. ""At times they can shift to a different style of work that doesn't require making big judgments, like being a paper boy,"" he said. Dr. Murray Grossman, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, noted the difficulties the disease presents for people who make decisions on others' behalf. ""A lawyer wouldn't be able to best defend their clients. A stockbroker wouldn't be able to make the best investments for their clients,"" he said. Another neurologist, Dr. Daniel Brauner, said if an FTLD patient is making ""world-shaking decisions they should probably stop working."" He added some of his patients in less stressful jobs have been able to keep working but have had to scale back, leaving behind tasks that are too complex. In addition to problems with judgment, FTLD patients have behavior and language issues, because of the areas of the brain that are affected. ""They can be inappropriate with money. They believe every ad they see in the paper and buy everything,"" he said. The doctors said first signs of the disease are often very unusual behavior or a change in personality. An affectionate grandfather, for example, might push away a grandchild looking for a hug. Someone who's always been very polite might become very rude. ""Someone who's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments, like they might refer to someone who's overweight as 'fatty,'"" Knopman says. He added patients often don't want to leave work. ""One of the problems with this disorder is they often lack insight so they themselves don't perceive the problems,"" Knopman said. There's no cure for FTLD. Treatment consists of managing symptoms with medication and in some cases, speech therapy. E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that his decision to remove himself from the Justice Department investigation into a leak that led it to surreptitiously collect telephone records from the Associated Press leaves him unable to respond to questions about it. ""I don't know what happened there with the intersection between the AP and the Justice Department,"" Holder told the House Judiciary Committee. ""I was recused from the case."" The news agency revealed Monday that federal agents had secretly collected two months of telephone records for some of its reporters and editors. The AP said agents were apparently investigating the source of a story revealing that the CIA had thwarted an al Qaeda plot to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner in May 2012, around the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden. AP blasts feds for phone records search . Sources later told CNN that the operative who was supposed to have carried the bomb had been inserted into al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate by Saudi intelligence, and that the device had been handed over to U.S. analysts. Holder told the hearing that he had recused himself to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the case and had left the decision to subpoena the phone records to Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, who authorized the subpoena. ""I recused myself because I thought it would be inappropriate and have a bad appearance to be a person who was a fact witness in the case to actually lead the investigation given the fact, unlike Mr. Cole, that I have a greater interaction with members of the press than he does,"" Holder said. Asked what made him a fact witness, he said, ""I am a possessor of the information that was ultimately leaked. And the question then is who of those people who possessed that information, which was a relatively limited number of people within the Justice Department, who of those people, who of those possessors actually spoke in an inappropriate way to members of the Associated Press."" Asked who else had access to the information, Holder cited the ongoing nature of the investigation. ""I would not want to reveal what I know and I don't know if there are other people who have been developed as possible recipients or possessors of that information during the course of this investigation,"" he said. ""I don't know."" Answers like those prompted some sharp criticism of Holder and his deputy from Wisconsin Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a former Judiciary chairman. ""There doesn't seem to be any acceptance of responsibility in the Justice Department for things that have gone wrong,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""Now may I suggest that you and Mr. Cole and maybe a few other people go to the Truman Library and take a picture of the thing that he had on his desk that said 'The Buck Stops Here?' Because we don't know where the buck stops, and I think to do adequate oversight, we better find out and we better find out how this mess happened."" And a Democrat, New York's Hakeem Jeffries, said the subpoenas appeared to be ""overly broad in scope."" ""Hopefully that is something that the investigation that takes place will examine with close scrutiny,"" he said. ""And second, that I think, as many of my colleagues have expressed, I'm also troubled by the fact that the negotiation or consultation with the AP did not occur in advance of the decision to issue the subpoenas."" Holder said he recused himself because he had been questioned by FBI agents as part of the leak probe. He Tuesday that the leak, which he did not describe, had put Americans at risk and demanded ""very aggressive action."" But AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll said Tuesday that the records collected by the investigation cast a ""very broad net"" and involved AP operations ""that have, as far as I know, no particular connection to the story that they (federal authorities) seem to be investigating."" ""We've never seen anything along the size and scope of this particular investigation,"" she told CNN's Erin Burnett. In all, the AP says, federal agents collected records involving more than 20 phone lines -- including personal lines -- used by about 100 journalists in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington. The Justice Department on Tuesday defended its decision to subpoena the records, saying the requests were limited and necessary. ""We are required to negotiate with the media organization in advance of issuing the subpoenas unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,"" Cole wrote in a letter to the AP. ""We take this policy, and the interests that it is intended to protect, very seriously and followed it in this matter."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said White House officials were not involved in the investigation and knew nothing about the AP inquiry. The Obama administration has launched several high-profile leak probes, leading to the prosecution of two government employees accused of revealing classified information. Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency official, was sentenced to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service in 2011, while former CIA officer John Kiriakou was sentenced to 30 months in prison after admitting to identifying a covert intelligence officer. In 2002, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley criticized the Justice Department for its subpoenas of John Solomon, an AP writer who had written about an investigation into then-Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-New Jersey. The subpoena also spurred a protest from the journalism association Investigative Reporters and Editors. Documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald, whose movies have criticized the war in Iraq, Fox News and Walmart, called the administration's pursuit of leakers ""an effort to silence and scare whistleblowers, and to get the press to be quiet and do what it wants them to do."" ""This is a systemic, continuing problem,"" said Greenwald, whose latest film, ""War on Whistleblowers,"" focuses on the issue. ""It's not a one-off, and it's not an accident, sadly."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Monday that the subpoenas were likely legal, but they go further than previous administrations in pursuing private information of journalists. ""I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,"" Toobin said. CNN's Tom Cohen reported from Washington. Michael Pearson reported from Atlanta.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Late last week, the campaigns of President Obama and Mitt Romney released Web videos highlighting the mistakes their rivals have made on the campaign trail. Obama's statement that ""the private sector is doing fine"" was the highlight for a Romney video, while one of the president's videos featured a remark by the former Massachusetts governor that the nation does not need more firefighters, teachers or police officers. We can expect the gaffe wars to continue, since they are a staple of presidential campaigns. Even though such statements are far from a fair indication of a candidate's record or stance on the issues, and often they are accurate statements taken out of context, they can be devastating to a campaign. Some off-kilter comments are too slight to sink a candidacy, but when they play into preconceptions of a candidate, the remarks -- and even sometimes a gesture or sound -- can be potent. Obama's recent statement about the private sector plays perfectly into Republican arguments on multiple levels. Although Obama was referring to data showing that if not for cutbacks in government jobs, the recovery would be far more robust, the statement has been used to argue that the White House is out of touch with average Americans. It also tends to confirm the notion that Obama doesn't really know much about the private sector, Republicans say, in contrast to Romney. Finally, the statement can be used to support the criticism that Obama inhabits a world of celebrity, living in a bubble and unaware of the negative sentiment about his policies. Of course, Obama's opponent, though a disciplined campaigner, has used a number of poorly chosen words that have contributed to his image as a tone-deaf beneficiary of privilege, such as making a $10,000 wager during a debate or saying at the Daytona 500 that he has ""some great friends who are NASCAR owners."" His statement about public workers suggests that he doesn't care about the kinds of basic services many Americans depend on, Democrats contend. Both men join a long history of politicians who have been criticized for a wrongly chosen phrase or gesture. A quick look at history shows what can happen: . 1. Barry Goldwater, ""Merely another weapon"" (1964): President Lyndon B. Johnson used these words, one in a series of controversial statements that the senator made about how tactical nuclear weapons could be used in certain situations, to buttress the Democratic argument that Sen. Goldwater was hell-bent on nuclear war. This was the basis for the famous commercial where viewers saw a little girl picking the petals of a flower, with a mushroom cloud appearing in her eye. 2. George Romney, ""Just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to Vietnam"" (1967): Michigan Gov. Romney, Mitt's father, then seen as one the most promising Republicans in the party because of his ability to compete for moderate voters, said this upon returning from the war's front lines. He was becoming more critical of the war and the lack of accurate information about it from the Johnson administration. But Romney's comment was used by critics to question his mental stability. 3. Hubert Humphrey, ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" (1968): A song played throughout Vice President Humphrey's campaign. The juxtaposition of the song and the scenes of anti-war protests and social turmoil, including at the Democratic Convention in Chicago while the police clashed with protesters outside as the candidate spoke, served as evidence that he was out of touch with how volatile the country had become in the tumult of the 1960s. 4. Gerald Ford, ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe"" (1976): When President Ford said these words during a televised debate with Democrat Jimmy Carter, in an effort to counteract right-wing criticism about his policy of dÃ©tente with the Soviet Union, Democrats pounced on the statement to claim that the president was not competent on foreign policy. 5. John Kerry, ""I actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it"" (2004): The statement was prime fodder for GOP commercials to demonstrate Sen. Kerry's flip-flopping and the inability of the Democratic Party to take a tough stand on foreign policy. 6. John McCain, ""The fundamentals of our economy are strong"" (2008): The statement was used by Democrats to attack Republican economic policies, connecting McCain to the unpopular President George W. Bush. 7. Michael Dukakis, ""No, I don't, Bernard, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life"" (1988): When Democrat Michael Dukakis said this in response to CNN anchor Bernard Shaw's question about whether the Massachusetts governor would support the death penalty if his wife were killed, Dukakis' cold response suggested that he was detached and Democrats were unwilling to take a tough stand on crime. 8.

"Washington (CNN) -- Two hours before the House passed a short term spending bill that defunded Obamacare - something Senate Democrats said they will reject next week - House Republicans met to plan their next attack on President Barack Obama's signature health care law. House GOP launches shutdown battle . Congress: will it be a government shutdown or budget compromise? House Speaker John Boehner and other top leaders outlined a lengthy GOP wish list of items they plan to attach to legislation raising the nation's debt limit, including a delay of Obamacare. ""This increase will also contain a number of important pro-growth economic policies, health care and non-health care reforms in addition to a one year delay in Obamacare,"" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on the House floor. CNNMoney: The never-ending charade of debt ceiling fights . After a rough week that started out with messy GOP infighting about strategy to deal with the government funding bill, the goal is to look ahead to the debt ceiling fight and keep Republicans on the same page. ""We have a good strategy. I think we're on stride and we're going to keep this fight going throughout this entire episode. The fight to delay Obamacare doesn't end next week. It keeps rolling on until we get it,"" Rep Paul Ryan told reporters after the meeting. Cruz: Obamacare fight 'just beginning' Gingrich favors House Republican budget push on Obamacare . McCain on repealing Obamacare: 'Not rational' In order to avoid another internal fight, GOP leaders crafted a debt ceiling bill that essentially has something for everyone in the Republican conference. In addition to the delay of Obamacare, the measure will include provisions for major tax reforms, and changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. Ryan told reporters it will be modeled on a budget - it won't include specific changes to the tax code, but it will give instructions to both the House and Senate to pass tax reform by a specific deadline. GOP aides declined to say what specific changes to entitlement programs would be in the bill, but congressional Republicans have pushed to change the way Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, effectively lowering annual increases for Social Security recipients. The measure would also include approval of the Keystone pipeline, a measure the Obama administration has held up for five years due to possible environmental concerns. Obama wants limits on coal plants, says Keystone can't boost pollution . GOP members also want to approve more offshore energy production, arguing both these policies would boost job creation. House Republicans also plan to attach several provisions to roll back regulations on coal plants and other industries. These are bills the House has passed before, but have failed to move in the Democratic-led Senate. EPA limits carbon pollution from new power plants . President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats insist they will not negotiate on a measure to authorize additional borrowing authority for the Treasury Department, which is projected to run out sometime in October or early November. Obama on debt ceiling: 'We are not some banana republic' CNNMoney: Debt ceiling 'X date' could hit Oct. 18 . Bachmann: Obama 'used to being George III' They argue Congress should not risk the nation's credit limit with another down to the wire brawl over major policy issues like health care and taxes. Obama and Boehner spoke on Friday, an aide to the speaker said. ""The president called the speaker this evening to tell him he wouldn't negotiate with him on the debt limit. Given the long history of using debt limit increases to achieve bipartisan deficit reduction and economic reforms, the speaker was disappointed but told the president that the two chambers of Congress will chart the path ahead. It was a brief call,"" the aide said. But Boehner and other House Republicans say Obama himself agreed to add other measures to reduce the deficit in the last major negotiation over the debt limit. ""We're going to put a lot of things on the table. And one thing you'll see is six times since 1985 have the president and Congress negotiated the debt ceiling. The last time was August 2011, and that was Barack Obama. So, to say it can't happen or won't happen just simply isn't true. It's happened a number of times,"" Louisiana Republican Rep. John Fleming said. Georgia Republican Rep Tom Graves called the fight on the stopgap spending bill and Obamacare ""one step of many"" but was reluctant to endorse the GOP package unveiled on the debt ceiling, telling reporters ""I think we're moving in the right direction."" This strategy to allow House Republicans to pile on to the debt ceiling bill a host of major policy items is designed to keep the party unified -temporarily at least. But delaying Obamacare for a year and rolling back Obama administration regulations are non-starters with Senate Democrats, and not the debate they want to have on a must-pass bill that the credit markets are monitoring. On the heels of the spending fight House Republican leaders want to try to force the White House and Senate Democrats to come to the table on the debt ceiling. But adding a mix of controversial items to the bill only increases the threat of a default, and ensures Capitol Hill will be tied up for the next several weeks, if not months, with partisan fighting that could ripple through the financial markets.","Next fight with president will be over debt ceiling .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Being native-born means never having to think about citizenship. Those concerns are for immigrants, either those who are in the U.S. illegally and want a chance to get legal status or those who already have legal status and would like to upgrade to full citizenship and all the perks that come with it, including voting. The deeper your roots go, the less likely you are to think about citizenship. Both my parents, three of my four grandparents and half my great-grandparents were all born in the United States. So I've hardly given it a thought. Until now. I have written about immigration for nearly a quarter-century. I want an end to the deportation frenzy caused by the Obama administration and a chance for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants to have a shot at legal status. Solutions to these pressing problems pivot on citizenship and what it should cost. More than border security, temporary workers, employer sanctions or reforms to the process for admitting legal immigrants, citizenship has emerged as the linchpin of immigration reform. Key Republican: Undocumented immigrants 'not clamoring' for citizenship . If you pulled together 100 undocumented immigrants and asked them how they feel about citizenship, you'd probably get 100 different answers. Some value the chance to become citizens, while others couldn't care less and would settle for a driver's license and the right to travel freely across borders. Those diverse opinions make it difficult for reformers to know what they should demand in negotiations, what they should hold out for and what they should be willing to ditch if necessary for a deal. On Tuesday, some House Republicans signaled that they might be amenable to a middle-ground option in which millions of illegal immigrants get legal residency but not the path to citizenship that Democrats are pushing. And the signals were flashing all over town. They flashed at a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, its first on immigration this session, in which Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador told Democrats that -- if they put aside politics and forgo a pathway to citizenship -- they would find ""good will here in the House of Representatives for us to come together, actually pass a pragmatic solution to the current problem that we have, and solve and modernize the immigration system for years to come."" Legal immigrants: What about us? Another signal: House Majority Leader Eric Cantor delivered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, in which he endorsed comprehensive immigration overhaul, minus citizenship, as the ""right thing to do."" Cantor even changed his tune on the idea of offering a pathway to legal status and citizenship to illegal immigrant students who were brought here as children. He was against it before he was in favor of it. And House Speaker John Boehner also signaled a cooperative spirit. In talking to reporters before the hearing, he refused to back an earned pathway to citizenship, calling it ""a very difficult part"" of legislation, but encouraged bipartisan solutions. Immigration Q&A: Amnesty or path to citizenship? A middle-of-the-road solution is the way to go. Getting Republicans -- and, frankly, conservative and pro-labor Democrats -- to support an earned pathway to citizenship would be a heavy lift. But it would be a shame to leave this historic moment empty-handed. For Republicans, the politics of this is lose-lose. They'll encounter the wrath of voters either way. But they should hold the line and either push back against an earned pathway to citizenship or, as a last resort, do everything they can to make sure that any pathway is not a cake walk. Why not? Because U.S. citizenship has tremendous value, and we shouldn't give it away on the cheap. U.S.-born citizens don't need an earned pathway to citizenship. We get it without effort or sacrifice. I managed to be born -- 45 years ago -- at a hospital in Fresno, California. And the rest was easy. Immigrants in America: The second-generation story . Warren Buffet uses the phrase ""the lottery of the womb"" to describe the concept of inherited wealth. But it applies to citizenship as well. Citizenship is priceless. It's about a lot more than voting. It's about becoming a stitch in the American fabric and about joining the American community. It's about knowing U.S. history and being wise enough to learn from it. It's about knowing English, even as we strive to acquire new languages. It's about surrendering your allegiance to another country or another flag, and -- as President Kennedy said -- asking not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country. What's in Senate immigration plan? It's about accepting that with rights come responsibilities. It's about being proud to be part of a narrative that includes the likes of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Edison, Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall, Robert Kennedy and Robert Frost, Cesar Chavez and Sonia Sotomayor. Most of all, it's about recognizing and accepting that the greatness of this country makes us all look tiny by comparison. That's a lot to think about. So let's give the undocumented legal status as soon as possible so they can't be deported by an administration that has shown a knack for apprehensions and removals. And yet let's also make the path to citizenship long enough so those who travel it have time to process it all and difficult enough so that, if they eventually get citizenship, they'll treasure it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Citizenship for illegal immigrants is most difficult issue in reform .

Navarrette: Undocumented should have legal status ASAP to avoid more deportations .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- New York Gov. David Paterson met with Senate hopeful Caroline Kennedy Saturday afternoon, but the governor's spokesman said details of the meeting will be kept private. Caroline Kennedy hopes to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator. Erin Duggan, Paterson's spokesman, said the two met at the governor's Manhattan office about 2 p.m. ET. She would not disclose what the pair talked about, nor say how long the meeting lasted. Kennedy is one of the candidates hoping to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior senator if the Senate confirms Clinton as secretary of state. Paterson, who has the sole responsibility to replace Clinton, has been the target of intense lobbying efforts by would-be senators in recent weeks. Clinton has said she is staying out of the process of picking her successor and letting Paterson decide. Whoever the governor picks would serve for two years before running in a special election in 2010. If the candidate won that contest, that person would have to run again in 2012, when Clinton's current term ends. Paterson is a Democrat, so the seat is likely to remain in the party's hands. Kennedy, daughter of the late President John F. Kennedy and niece of longtime Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, has received the most media attention. However, critics are questioning whether she's ready to follow the political path taken by family members.  Watch Kennedy discuss political aspirations » . Kennedy, 51, has been involved in education reform and women's issues, but she has never held public office and has mostly stayed out of the public spotlight.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has signed off on a new package of nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels, U.S. officials tell CNN, signaling his administration is cautiously wading further into the conflict. Officials said the White House approved the package at a meeting of the National Security Council last week. The move reflects what officials describe as a ramped-up effort to change the military balance on the battlefield in Syria. It follows a decision by Obama last month to send food and medicine to the rebels, the first direct U.S. support for the armed opposition. Other agencies have not been briefed on the final elements of the package, which is expected to be detailed at a White House meeting this week. ""We have no new decisions on assistance to announce at this point and continue to review every possible option that could help end the violence and accelerate a political transition,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a National Security Council spokeswoman. Officials said it is expected to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is defensive in nature, but could be used to aid in combat by Syrian rebels battling forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The package being discussed, however, still falls short of the heavy weapons and high tech equipment sought by the rebels. Obama's national security team and members of Congress have repeatedly urged the president to increase the direct aid for the rebels. They argue such a step would strengthen the hand of moderate members of the opposition and make them less reliant on well-armed extremist elements within their ranks. Secretary of State John Kerry has pushed for more aggressive U.S. involvement in Syria since taking office in February. The move comes as Britain and France are leading efforts to lift a European Union arms embargo on Syria. Both have suggested they are prepared to join nations like Qatar is providing the rebels with weapons and are urging the United States to do the same. A push last summer from CIA, Pentagon and State Department leaders was rejected by the White House. At least for now, it remains opposed to arming the opposition, fearing that U.S.-provided weapons could wind up in the wrong hands. The Obama administration has funneled $385 million in humanitarian aid to Syria through international institutions and nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Washington has provided more than $100 million to the political opposition and has pressed them to establish a leadership structure. But the Syrian Opposition Council, the main Syrian opposition group, has roundly criticized the United States for refusing to provide badly-needed support to organize a transitional government and broaden its support inside Syria.","Move signals that the United States is wading further into the civil war .

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie scored the opener against his former club Arsenal as Manchester United went top of the English Premier League Saturday with a 2-1 home win over the Gunners. They replaced Chelsea who were held 1-1 by Swansea in a later kickoff. The Dutchman switched to United in the summer in a $39 million move and has now scored 10 goals in 13 games to underline his enduring quality. He was on the score sheet at Old Trafford after just three minutes when a Rafael cross was not cleared and the result rarely looked in doubt after his early strike. ""It was an ideal start for the Manchester United cause and it was good for Robin. I thought he was fantastic today. His movement, his penetration was fantastic,"" manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. United should have gone further ahead just before the break when Santi Cazorla handled an Ashley Young cross to concede a penalty. But Wayne Rooney sent the spot kick wide of Arsenal goalkeeper Vito Mannone's right post. United continued to dominate after half time and Patrice Evra headed home the second from a Rooney cross. The Frenchman was then fouled by Jack Wilshere, who was sent off for a second yellow card. Arsenal, beaten by Norwich in the EPL last weekend before their extraordinary 7-5 League Cup win over Reading in midweek, scored a late consolation through Carzola. But they trail United by nine points early in the season. Chelsea would have returned to the top with victory at the Liberty Stadium and Victor Moses gave the Blues a 61st minute lead as he scored following Gary Cahill's header from an Eden Hazard corner. But Swansea were worth their point as Pablo Hernandez equalized with a superb 88th-minute strike. Manchester City remained unbeaten but held to a goalless draw by West Ham in the last kick off. Kevin Nolan had the ball in the net early for the home side but his effort was ruled out for a marginal offside decision. Champions City dominated the second half possession but could not find the goal and stayed in third place, two points behind their city rivals. Tottenham Hotspur missed the chance to take closer order on the top three with a dismal 1-0 home defeat to Wigan. Manager Andre Villas-Boas was jeered by the Spurs supporters who had seen their side beaten by a second half goal from Ben Watson. Everton have moved above them into fourth, but they were held 2-2 at Fulham as Steve Sidwell grabbed a late equalizer for the home side. In other games, Gabriel Agbonlahor scored the only goal as Aston Villa secured a much needed 1-0 win at Sunderland, while fellow strugglers Norwich beat Stoke 1-0.","Robin van Persie scores as Manchester Utd beat Arsenal 2-1 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Shamita Naidoo said she often wonders whether anyone really ever sees her. She also wonders the same thing about the hundreds of people living around her, in tiny tin shacks perched underneath gum trees on a nearby hill. Around one million people live near Africa's largest slum, Kibera, located near Nairobi, Kenya. Sometimes, she said, it seems like they all are invisible. The shantytown where Naidoo lives is on the outskirts of Durban, South Africa, in an area known as Motala Heights. The squatter community has been there for a number of years, but it's increasingly being squeezed out by nearby factories and suburban neighborhoods. Some residents, according to Naidoo, have already been evicted. Others are afraid that they could soon be forced to move. And almost everyone fears that if they have to leave, there may be nowhere else to go. ""We are like a lost city,"" said Naidoo, who shares a home with her two children and 10 other families. ""We are not known."" United Nations Habitat estimates that roughly 1 billion people -- or 33 percent of the world's urban population -- live in conditions like those of Naidoo and her family. By 2030, according to the UN's human settlement program, that number is likely to double. The slum dwellers struggle to survive with little clean water and sometimes no electricity around metropolises like Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Mumbai, India; Lima, Peru; and Istanbul, Turkey. Their shantytowns are usually vast in expanse and dense in population. In Kibera, a slum near Nairobi, Kenya, for example, more than a million people live in an area about the size of New York's Central Park. Yet despite their overpowering nature and unavoidable presence, the world's informal cities are often overlooked -- partly, according to UN Habitat, because many aid efforts are still focused on helping the rural poor: ""Rural poverty has long been the world's most common face of destitution,"" U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a 2006 world city report. ""But urban poverty can be just as intense, dehumanizing and life-threatening."" The problem can also seem too big. The slums appear impenetrable to outsiders. And no one wants to take full responsibility. So walls are built, blinders are put on, and the shantytowns simply fade into the backdrop of urban life. ""We still don't know what to do,"" said Edesio Fernandes, a professor of urban planning at the University of London. ""A huge amount of money has been spent and very little has been achieved in terms of reversing the phenomenon."" Although slums, in and of themselves, are nothing new -- some Brazilian favelas are more than 100 years old, Fernandes said, and many modern cities, like New York and London, once had prolific slum-dwelling populations -- what is unprecedented is the rate at which they are growing. The UN estimates that almost 70 million people move into cities each year, many of them poor. Yet this, according to some experts, should not be seen as a problem but rather as a potential way to win the war against global poverty. The mindset must shift from ""city as problem to city as solution,"" said Stewart Brand, president of the Long Now Foundation, which aims to raise awareness on solving long-term problems. Historically, Brand said, squatter cities have always been areas of economic expansion; within them there is virtually no unemployment, and their inhabitants are constantly striving to lift themselves out of destitution, he said. ""[Slums] are generating wealth the way cities have always done,"" Brand said. In India, almost 20 percent of the GDP comes from Mumbai, where half the city's 12 million residents live in slums, Brand said. And even though many slum dwellers work in the informal economy, the official economy benefts as workers accumulate income and can afford to buy more goods and services outside their shadow neighborhoods. Urbanization also leads to lower birth rates, Brand said, which means as more people migrate to cities, the world's population could eventually level off at around 8 billion or 9 billion and then rapidly drop. But to both capture and capitalize upon the potentialities of slums, more must also be done to embrace the people who reside in them and understand how they live their lives, said Robert Neuwirth, a journalist who spent two years living in shantytowns around the world. Many employees working in Rio's high-end hotels and restaurants live in nearby favelas, Neuwirth said. And not all slum dwellers are necessarily poor -- a survey of more than 200 slums across India by Shelter Associates, which provides support to informal settlements, found residents with a variety of jobs, including government employees, small entrepreneurs and even doctors. ""Outsiders tend to view these as repositories of criminality, and they are not at all,"" he said. ""These are hardworking communities whose aspirations are the same as yours and mine, and the sooner we understand that, the sooner we can begin working with these communities."" Some progress has been made, especially in Latin America, around cities like Rio. There, despite the presence of drug gangs who largely control the communities, a handful of favelas are undergoing a sort of gentrification. Businesses like cable television companies and banks have moved in, and tourists are even making reservations to stay in new shantytown hotels, Neuwirth said. Yet in the Motala Heights slum in South Africa, along with many others around the world, the situation remains stagnant as governments continue to deny slum dwellers basic infrastructure and property rights and occasionally even demolish entire parts of shantytowns altogether, forcing their dwellers to move to another piece of land and try, once again, to build a new life. ""We have to recognize these people as people and not as statistics,"" Neuwirth said. ""The way forward is to engage with them."" .................................................................................. What do you think should be done to solve urban poverty?

"(CNN) -- A 39-year-old man in southern China died Saturday from what appears to be a contagious strain of avian flu, state media reported Saturday. The man -- identified by Xinhua as a bus driver with the surname Chen -- was hospitalized in Shenzhen on December 21 as he battled a fever. He tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus, the provincial health department said in a statement, according to the official news agency. The man had not traveled out of the city of Shenzhen, nor did he have direct contact with poultry in the month before he came down with the fever, according to the department. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong, where more than 17,000 chickens were ordered culled on the same day that Chen was hospitalized. That decision came after a chicken carcass tested positive for avian flu. The territory's director of Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation declared the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market an infected place, the government said then in a statement. Farmers were told they could not send chickens to the market for 21 days. The Hong Kong government said it was working to trace the origin of the chicken, which was infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. But, as of December 21, authorities did not know the source. Meanwhile, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine has since suspended supplies of live poultry to Hong Kong, according to Xinhua. As of mid-December, the World Health Organization calculated that 573 people had been infected -- and 336 had died -- after coming down with the H5N1 avian influenza virus since 2003. Twenty-six of those deaths had been in China, with the largest number of fatalities, 150, occurring in Indonesia. Vietnam and Egypt had more than 50 deaths each. This summer, the United Nations warned of a possible resurgence of the virus -- which peaked in 2006, at one point infecting people in 63 countries -- saying there are indications a mutant strain may be spreading in Asia. A variant strain of H5N1 -- which can apparently bypass the defenses of current vaccines -- had appeared as of late August in Vietnam and China, reported the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The group noted that the strain's movement around Vietnam threatened Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Japan and the Korean peninsula. By then, eight people in Cambodia alone had died this year after becoming infected this year, the agency added. In addition to the health impact, the avian flu outbreaks have also come at a steep economic cost -- with the United Nations estimating earlier this year that it had contributed to the killing of over 400 million poultry and caused losses estimated at $20 billion.","A 39-year-old bus driver was hospitalized last week in southern China .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Former first lady Laura Bush praised the performance of her husband's successor Monday, breaking with many Republicans in telling CNN that she thinks President Obama is doing a good job under tough circumstances. Former first lady Laura Bush defended President Obama's decision to address the nation's schoolchildren. She also criticized Washington's sharp political divide during an interview covering a range of topics including her thoughts on first lady Michelle Obama, former Vice President Dick Cheney, the situation in Afghanistan and Myanmar, and life after eight tumultuous years in the White House. Bush sat down with CNN on Monday during a United Nations meeting in Paris, France, where she was promoting global literacy, a cause she trumpeted during her husband's administration. The typically reserved former first lady defended Obama's decision to deliver a back-to-school speech to students, putting her at odds with many conservatives afraid that the president will use the opportunity to advance his political agenda. ""I think he is [doing a good job],"" Bush said when asked to assess Obama's job performance. ""I think he has got a lot on his plate, and he has tackled a lot to start with, and that has probably made it more difficult."" Michelle Obama is also ""doing great,"" she said, in part by turning the White House into a comfortable home for her family.  Watch more of the interview » . Referencing the uproar over Obama's address to schoolchildren, which will be aired nationwide Tuesday, Laura Bush said it's ""really important for everyone to respect the president of the United States."" Bush didn't completely dismiss the concerns of some conservatives but noted that controversial Education Department plans recommending that students draft letters discussing what they can do to help Obama had been changed. ""I think there is a place for the president ... to talk to schoolchildren and encourage"" them, she said. Parents should follow his example and ""encourage their own children to stay in school and to study hard and to try to achieve the dream that they have."" Bush indicated that she didn't think it was fair for Obama to be labeled a ""socialist"" by critics and expressed her disappointment with the intensely polarized nature of contemporary American politics. Part of the reason for the polarization, she said, was the increase in the number of congressional districts dominated by either strongly conservative or liberal voters. ""We've seen that for the last eight years, certainly, and we're still seeing it,"" she said. ""That's just a fact of life."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's speech . Bush conceded that after her husband was elected president, he was unable to replicate his success as governor of Texas in reaching across the aisle to Democrats. ""He was disappointed that that was not the way it worked out in Washington,"" she said. ""I'm sure President Obama didn't expect it to be that way [either]. ... All of us need to do what we can to come together on issues."" Despite her husband's disappointment, he is ""doing very well,"" she said. Both of them are now working on their memoirs, she noted. Though the former first lady criticized the excessive partisanship of Washington, she expressed gratitude for Cheney's decision to vocally defend her husband's performance. Cheney has been outspoken in his defense of the Bush administration's national security record, which has been sharply criticized on, among other things, questions relating to the detention and interrogation of terrorist suspects. ""I think that Vice President Cheney has every right to speak out, and I appreciate that he is defending"" the administration, Bush said. ""I think that is important. I think there is a place for that."" Bush also said it doesn't bother her husband that Cheney's ""out there being critical."" The former first lady said her husband still speaks with Cheney occasionally. Multiple sources have indicated that the two men parted ways on several issues in the last years of their administration, including Bush's refusal to offer a pardon for former top Cheney aide Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. Libby was convicted on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators looking into the leak that resulted in the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson. Though Bush expressed confidence that her husband will ultimately be remembered as ""somebody who stood for freedom and who stood for the security of our country,"" she admitted that she's worried about the current situation in Afghanistan. ""I'm very concerned, of course,"" she said. ""All of us are concerned, and everybody, as they look at Afghanistan from around the world, really hope and want to [do] whatever they can to help the government stabilize, to see that the elections were fair."" Bush said she hoped people ""will redouble their efforts"" to help the country fend off Taliban and al Qaeda extremists. She also repeated her outspoken criticism of the government of Myanmar, also known by its former name of Burma, which has come under fire for imprisoning pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi. ""She's always been held under house arrest [because] they're afraid of her popularity. They think that undermines their regime,"" Bush said. ""I hope that they'll see what she really wants. ... She wants [the nation to have] a peaceful transition to a democracy and to have the chance for Burma to really build itself [into] a very wealthy and educated nation."" After her husband's eight controversial years in the White House, what does Bush have to say to critics who believe he had a negative, destructive influence in the world? ""I would say that that's absolutely not right,"" Bush said.

"(CNN) -- Nick Price is not one to shy away from a battle. He is a hardened warrior -- a man who has fought on the golf course and on the soil of his beloved Zimbabwe. He lost his father when he was a child before watching his friends die during the Rhodesian war. And yet now, at the age of 56, he remains philosophical about his life -- one in which he emerged to become one of the greatest to have ever played the game of golf. ""I'm so grateful to my family for instilling values since an early age,"" Price told CNN's Living Golf. ""I've carried them through me throughout this time. ""I lost my father when I was 10 and sometimes that has an adverse effect on the family but for us it brought us closer together. ""It was a huge time in my life. I went to the military for a year-and-a-half and all those things shape you. ""You can't go through life without help and support. I've had a great time. ""When you think of how I started playing golf I still have to pinch myself every now and againt because this is my life."" Price, who will captain the international team at this week's Presidents Cup at Muirfield Village, Ohio, has taken the long road to the top. Born in South Africa and raised in Rhodesia, before it became Zimbabwe, Price spent his time as a child hitting plastic balls at tomato cans. It was only in 1974 at the age of 17 when he won the Optimist Junior World title at Torrey Pines in San Diego that he realized he could make a career in golf. From there he was catapulted to stardom -- winning three major titles and claiming 15 PGA wins during an illustrious career which saw him stay at No.1 in the world in 1994 for 43 consecutive weeks. But there is one victory away from all of his personal success which stands out -- the victory of the international team over the U.S. at the 1998 Presidents Cup at Melbourne. The tournament which pitches a U.S. team of 12 against a team of non-Europeans has been held every two years since 1994 and includes two rounds of foursomes, two rounds of four balls and a singles finale. For a man who has played in five of these tournaments, Price is only too aware of how glorious victory would be, especially following the 19-15 defeat two years ago. And yet the prospect of beating the U.S. brings up conflicting feelings for Price, who says he could ""never repay the country for what it has given me."" ""Our three kids were born here and I've just had the best time ever here,"" said Price, who lives in Florida. ""Honestly, I sometimes get recognized more often here than I do in my own home country, which is kind of sad. ""I had more awards and everything given to me in this country than I did in my own country, which hurts a lot. ""What has happened in the country in the last 33 years is not what we all expected."" History is not on Price's side -- the U.S. has dominated the competition, losing just once and being held once in the previous nine editions. The international team boasts an array of talent including Masters champion Adam Scott, four-time Major winner Ernie Els, Argentina's two-time Major winner Angel Cabrera and South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen. Price believes that victory for his side is vital if the competition is to recapture the imagination of the public with the dominance of the Americans leaving several golf fans disillusioned with the dual. But while he expects passions to run high, Price wants his men to keep their cool against Tiger Woods and co. ""I'm a big one for confrontations,"" said Price. ""I keep telling my guys, 'let's go out and win this cup.' ""I don't want to see them become enemies for one week -- what I want to see is great competition. ""I want to see them go out there and want to beat each other and look at each other in the eye after you've finished and say 'congratulations, you played better today.' ""I don't want people coming up with excuses and walking off the greens while the other player is putting. ""To me that brings the whole game into a very sad state."" The U.S. team boasts a wealth of talent and experience with the likes of Phil Mickelson, Brandt Snedeker, Jason Dufner lining up alongside world No.1 Woods. Price realizes his team faces a difficult challenge to triumph in Columbus, Ohio but says he will do all that he can as captain to inspire his men to a momentous victory. ""Being captain is a doubled edged sword -- it can hurt you and it can help you a lot,"" he said. ""I'm trying to be a captain that is going to be very supportive of my team but not over captain them and there's a very fine line between that. ""You want to give the guys advice. I'm certainly not in the Seve Ballesteros type -- running out over the course and saying 'hit here and do this' but that was Seve, that was the way guys expected when he was captain. ""I just want them to know I'm going to be there to support them in anything they need to know or need to use me as a sounding board. I'm going to be there.""","Nick Price will captain the international team int the Presidents Cup .

"(CNN) -- Sweden's tourist board decided to try to drum up interest in the country recently by handing control of the national Twitter account to a different Swedish citizen every week. They got what they wanted. In fact, this week, they may have gotten more than they wanted. The current curator of @Sweden is a foul-mouthed mother of two who has tweeted photos of herself breastfeeding and of a dish she called strawberries with milk and urine. She's also made a joke about Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury having AIDS, the disease that led to his death. Some followers of the account found her musing about why some people hate Jews particularly shocking. Sonja Abrahamsson's series of tweets on the subject Tuesday began: ""Whats the fuzz with jews. You can't even see if a person is a jew, unless you see their penises, and even if you do, you can't be sure!?"" She went on to point out that the Nazis made Jews wear stars so they could tell who was a Jew, mentioned that she grew up in a place with no Jews and concluded: ""Im sorry if some of you find the question offensive. Thats was not my purpose. I just don't get why some people hates jews so much. ""I thought it was a good idea to ask the question when so many well educated people all over the world can answer. But no. Bad idea."" Abrahamsson also ruminates in extremely crude terms about what would result from crossing the movie ""Snow White"" with the thriller ""Seven."" And she expresses a certain open-mindedness about fans of teen idol Justin Bieber: ""If someone likes Justin Bieber in Sweden, we dont care. We let them. We dont call him 'gay' if we mean 'he sucks'. We say 'he sucks.' "" Her tweets have prompted dozens of questions and some criticism. ""we've been to Sweden. And your behaviour is extremely unbecoming. They should take your passport away,"" one person tweeted at her. ""why not, i have never used it anyway,"" Abrahamsson responded. The self-described ""Holy mother of two"" took over the Twitter account Sunday and gets it for a week. ""This is exciting,"" her Twitter bio says. Her personal biography on the @Sweden website says she's ""a single and low educated mother, but at least I don't do drugs and prostitution."" She comes from ""a little itsy bitsy village called Latikberg"" where all the people ""are relatives and they all own tractors,"" it says. @Sweden is a joint project of Visit Sweden and the Swedish Institute, which describes itself as ""a public agency that promotes interest and confidence in Sweden around the world."" They knew what they were getting into when they handed over the keys to the account, Visit Sweden marketing director Marie Ziv said. ""She is a controversial and provocative person for sure,"" said Ziv, who said Abrahamsson tweets and blogs in Swedish in a similar vein. ""We haven't called her or told her to stop or back down. We want her to continue being herself,"" she said. ""It's our choice not to censor anyone because we want to keep it real."" ""We want to show the diverse and multifaceted country that we are,"" Ziv said. @Sweden aims to ""create interest and arouse curiosity for Sweden and the wide range the country has to offer,"" the project says online. It started on December 10 and has had 24 curators so far, Ziv said. The account had about 44,000 followers as of Wednesday afternoon and was adding about 1,000 new followers an hour. Abrahamsson did not immediately respond to a tweet from CNN.","NEW: ""We want her to continue being herself,"" Sweden marketing director says .

"(CNN) -- Once again, rumors of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's impending death have swept through social media in recent days, fueled by a report that the ailing leader had moved to a presidential residence to live his last days. The government's vagueness and secrecy regarding Chavez has created a hunger -- both in and outside of Venezuela -- for reliable information about the president's health. With no official updates, the void has been filled by a few who claim to have sources familiar with Chavez's health. Users of social media, as well as traditional media, amplify such information, which the government usually ends up trying to refute in one way or another. How should news consumers value the information from these unofficial sources? Here's a look at some of the reporting by three of the most closely followed sources: Emili Blasco, Washington correspondent for Spain's ABC newspaper; Jose Rafael Marquina, a widely-cited Venezuelan doctor practicing in Florida; and Nelson Bocaranda, a Venezuelan investigative journalist. Emili Blasco, ABC newspaper . Report: Chavez has been moved to a residence at a military base at La Orchila island to be surrounded by family, awaiting his fate; he is receiving only palliative care (March 1). Government response: Admits that Chavez is ""fighting for his life,"" but says Chavez is undergoing intense treatments, including chemotherapy, at military hospital in Caracas. Validity: Unconfirmed. Chavez has not spoken, nor have any photos or videos been released of him since he returned to Venezuela this month, that would prove whether he is in Caracas or La Orchila. --- . Report: Chavez's Cuban medical team was being pressured by their government to stabilize Chavez to the point he could be transported back to Venezuela in hopes that he can be sworn in for his new presidential term, which had already begun. His treatment would move from Cuba to the military hospital in Caracas. The same report claims that in early January, Chavez suffered ""minor"" cardiac arrest that left him in a coma for 15 minutes and unconscious for several days (January 18). Government response: No direct response to report, but around the date that Chavez allegedly suffered cardiac arrest, the government said Chavez suffered from respiratory insufficiency and was handling treatment well. After this report came out, Venezuela's foreign minister said Chavez was awake, joking and making decisions. Validity: One month after this report, on February 18, Chavez was indeed flown back to Venezuela, and taken to the military hospital there. Currently no way to confirm cardiac arrest and his state in the days following. --- . Report: Chavez was in an induced coma, and remained alive only through life support, which could be disconnected at any moment (January 2). Government response: While not addressing Blasco's story directly, on the same day it was published, Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Chavez remained in delicate condition. ""Sometimes, he has had slight improvements. Sometimes, he has remained stable,"" Maduro said. Validity: Obviously, no one pulled the plug on Chavez in early January. The government has confirmed that Chavez has received help breathing, but it is not known whether Chavez was ever in an induced coma. --- . Report: Chavez underwent a tracheotomy because of complications from a respiratory infection (December 22). Government response: Maduro, speaking to the media on the same day, says Chavez is getting stronger each day. ""President Chavez is resting and his recovery is progressing,"" he said. Validity: In February, Venezuelan officials changer their story, and confirmed that Chavez did have a tracheal tube. ------ . Jose Rafael Marquina, doctor . Report: Chavez's lungs continue to accumulate with fluid, which must be drained. At this point, there is no treatment except palliative treatment. His cancer had spread to the liver, lungs and back, so the surgery in December included removingsome vertebrae (February 24). Government response: No mention of such details, besides confirming Chavez had surgery in December and is having a complex recovery. Validity: Marquina always presents very specific information, but impossible for now to know with certainty what doctors in Cuba did during their operation. --- . Report: Chavez is paraplegic, and was transferred from Cuba back to Venezuela because doctors couldn't do anything more for him (February 21). Government response: Officials have not specifically addressed this claim, but have repeatedly accused Marquina and others of waging a disinformation campaign. Validity: The public hasn't seen evidence of Chavez walking in months. The only photos released of him recently show him laying down on a pillow. But it cannot be confirmed that he is paraplegic. Marquina first warned that paralysis was a possibility in December. --- . Report: Chavez is likely showing signs of renal failure and lung infection (January 3). Government reponse: That same day, National Assembly President Diosdado Cabello said, ""Don't fall victim to the opposition's rumors. ... They have bad intentions every time they talk."" The government had already said there was a lung infection, but only later spoke about respiratory insufficiency. Validity: The seriousness of the lung infection was confirmed as Chavez battled it for weeks, but little has been said that could confirm that he is having kidney problems, too. ------ . Nelson Bocaranda, investigative journalist . Report: Ever since returning from Venezuela, Chavez remains the same, tired and ailing from the trip, which was never recommended (February 21). Government response: Officials trumpeted Chavez's return to Venezuela, but have not given reasons behind the move. ""Thank God! Thank you dear people! Here we continue the treatment,"" a post on Chavez's Twitter account said that day. Validity: Bocaranda says the return was never recommended. Marquina says it was because doctors could do no more. Blasco says the Cuban government was pushing for the return. They can't all be right. --- . Report: Only a handful of people -- Chavez's family, the Castro brothers and medical staff -- could visit Chavez in Cuba. Even Maduro and Cabello were limited to short visits with their president. There were metal detectors, no cell phones allowed, and Chavez's medical information is under lock and key (February 7) Government response: In January, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas insisted that Chavez was still very much in charge of the country, meeting with leaders and making key decisions. Maduro and Cabello traveled to Cuba several times to visit Chavez. Validity: There is a contradiction here. If access Chavez was truly so limited, it makes it less plausible that Chavez was holding meetings and directing the country from his hospital room. If security was so tight, leaking information seems like a risky endeavor. --- . Report: Chavez has emphysema and has lost 70 pounds (February 6). Government response: The government has spoken at length about a ""respiratory insufficiency"" that Chavez suffers, but has not said exactly what is causing it. Validity: It is certain that Chavez has lung problems, but the details of what they are and how long they have affected him remains unknown. Only a few photos have been released of Chavez since his December surgery, and it is difficult to tell how much weight the president may have lost.","Rumors persist that Hugo Chavez is near death .
The government admits that Chavez is fighting for his life .
But valid information is hard to come by ."
"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- After battling for nearly two days with tear gas, water cannons and pepper spray, Turkish police retreated from Istanbul's central Taksim Square on Saturday afternoon, allowing tens of thousands of demonstrators to pour into the space. A peaceful sit-in on Friday against government plans to demolish a park was met with a police crackdown, igniting the biggest anti-government riots this city has seen in a decade. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan demanded an end to the violent protests, which have also spread to the capital city of Ankara and the port city of Izmir. ""The police were there yesterday, they are there today, and they will be there tomorrow. Taksim Square cannot be allowed to be a place where marginal groups can freely roam,"" he said in a televised speech. The clashes in Istanbul subsided Saturday afternoon, when police allowed protesters to flow into the square. The protesters pelted police vehicles with stones as they withdrew from the area. At least 79 people, including 26 members of the Turkish security forces, were injured in the clashes across the country, Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency on Saturday. Among the injured were 14 in Istanbul, including one who suffered brain trauma, the Istanbul governor's office said. Turkish authorities have detained 939 people in connection with the protests, Guler told Anadolu. In the Ankara, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters, with some chanting ""Tayyip resign,"" as they marched on the neighborhood of Kizilay, demonstrators told CNN. ""Police are everywhere, and helicopters are monitoring our movements,"" one protester said. ""Whenever police see us march, they come and gas us. ...We were gassed, we disbursed and then gathered again."" Erdogan conceded in his speech on Saturday that Turkish security forces had made excessive use of tear gas against demonstrators. ""There have been errors in the actions of the security forces, especially with regard to use of pepper gas. Right now that is being investigated, researched,"" he said. ""There is an error there, sure. When it is used excessively we are against it as well. And in fact there was such excess."" Earlier Saturday crowds gathered across central Istanbul and chanted ""government resign"" and ""shoulder to shoulder against fascism"" as phalanxes of helmeted riot police responded with volleys of tear gas canisters. Lost amid the explosion of anti-government anger in the streets of Istanbul and elsewhere was the original source of the protests. Earlier this week, several dozen activists tried to stage a sit-in in Gezi Park, the last bit of green space left in Taksim Square. The demonstrators were protesting government plans to level the park and replace it with a reconstruction of a replica Ottoman-era military barracks and a shopping mall. The protests have since devolved into a demonstration against Erdogan, the most powerful, popular and polarizing leader Turkey has seen in generations. This major transport hub and commercial district has become the main battleground between angry protesters who hurled stones and bottles at riot police. In some Istanbul neighborhoods, residents banged pots and pans in protest on the street during the prime minister's speech. Erdogan's chief adviser, Ibrahim Kalin, said police have been ordered to be judicious in how they confront the demonstrators. Addressing the original complaint, Kalin said that Istanbul's mayor said he is considering a number of projects at the park, and not necessarily a shopping mall. But the scope of the protests show there is a bigger issue about freedom of speech versus accusations of authoritative government. ""People are entitled to disagreement with the government, they can exercise their democratic rights, but they can do so within the context of a democratic society,"" Kalin said. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Greenpeace have denounced what they describe as excessive use of police force against peaceful protesters. Turkey has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of economic growth, since Erdogan's Justice and Development Party first swept to power after winning elections in 2002 on a campaign to institute pro-democratic reforms. In recent years, the Turkish government has come under fire from media watchdog groups for its prolonged detention of more journalists than any other country in the world. Turkish security forces have also made such frequent use of tear gas against opposition protesters that some critics have started referring to the prime minister as ""Chemical Tayyip."" But the protests this week appear to be ""much more than the government and authorities expected,"" Erdogan Yildirim, a sociology professor at Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told CNN. He said it was unclear whether the protest movement will sustain its momentum, but it has caught the government's attention. ""The reason for massive protest in Turkey is in fact trivial. (A construction in a park.) But this shows the cumulative reaction to Erdogan,"" wrote Mustafa Akyol, a Turkish newspaper columnist and outspoken champion of ""liberal Islam."" ""Erdogan needs to see that the country needs more 'participatory democracy.' People want to influence decisions in public matters ... it is ultimately none other than Erdogan who cultivated this anger and who needs to calm it down. ""Erdogan probably did not know thousands of people who voted for him were among those raising their voices as well,"" columnist Sule Kulu wrote Saturday in the English-language newspaper Today's Zaman. ""If he does not return to his pro-democracy stance, this would prepare his fall in Turkish politics. Ä°stanbul, his place of birth in politics, can bring him his political death."" CNN's Talia Kayali, Amir Ahmed and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Turkish authorities have arrested 939 people across Turkey, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Twitter turns 7 on Thursday, and in some ways, it's like a lot of 7-year-olds. The social-media platform can be bratty and combative. Its idea of a good conversation sometimes devolves into short bursts of shouting. It can have the attention span of a gnat, loving a shiny new plaything one day (ooh, Bronx Zoo's Cobra!) and then forsaking it for another without a second thought. But it can also make you smile with the things it says. It can keep you more aware, and alert, than you've ever been before. And it can make you look at the world around you in a different way. It's easy to take shots at the microblogging site, which debuted March 21, 2006, when founder Jack Dorsey typed the words ""just setting up my twttr."" (Creators had considered that abbreviated style for the company's name before settling on the full word.) Anything with more than 200 million users who send out 400 million posts every day is going to have highs and lows. There are the silly trending hashtags, the badly spelled diatribes and, yes, as the cliched insult goes, even a few people who really do tweet about what they had for breakfast. Twitter founder wants to be NYC mayor . But Twitter has also been a crucial tool for revolutionaries in Iran, Egypt and elsewhere. It's been used to mobilize relief efforts and raise millions for charitable causes. It's become a national water cooler for chatter about big televised events such as the Oscars and the Super Bowl. And while Twitter sometimes reveals the stupid side of celebrity culture, it's also brought fans closer to their favorite actors, musicians, writers and athletes than was ever possible before. Twitter has, in fact, changed lives. So, in honor of its 7th birthday, we look at both the upside and the downside of Twitter use through seven people whose lives were changed by the site. Gilbert Gottfried . If you don't know that Gilbert Gottfried sometimes tells inappropriate jokes, then you probably haven't heard of Gilbert Gottfried. After all, this is the guy who once performed the nearly impossible task of offending the crowd at a Friar's Club roast with a joke soon after 9/11. So, when a tsunami hit Japan in 2011, Gottfried did what he does: make jokes about it. This time on Twitter. ""I was talking to my Japanese real estate agent. I said 'is there a school in this area?' She said 'not now, but just wait,' "" went one. About an hour later, the comedian had lost his high-profile job as the grating voice of the Aflac duck. In an opinion piece for CNN last year (about another comedy controversy, no less), Gottfried wrote that it's a comedian's job to push boundaries and that Aflac shouldn't have been surprised at the tweets. ""I've been telling jokes like this for a very long time, so the reaction surprised me,"" he wrote. ""It's like eating Corn Flakes every day for years, and then one day you eat Corn Flakes and all hell breaks loose."" Kelly Oxford . Oxford was a suburban mom from Alberta, Canada, who took to Twitter as an outlet for her wry observations on life. More than 450,000 followers later, she can add author and screenwriter to her credits. Her sardonic humor, with topics ranging from family life (""How do you get a red wine stain off a baby?"") to random observations (""That ninja guy in the Black Eyed Peas has probably killed 64 people, right?""), gained her a following that includes Hollywood stars and other notables like talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel (now a friend) and film critic Roger Ebert. Now she's sold her first screenplay, ""Son of a Bitch,"" to Warner Bros.; her book of essays, ""Everything's Perfect When You're a Liar,"" is set to be released next month; and she's been hired to write a TV pilot. Justin Halpern . His dad says funny stuff. Or, more accurately, funny sh*t. (Sorry, that's as close as we can get). So he created the Twitter account ""Sh*t My Dad Says"" in 2009 to share it with the world. Two months later, he had millions of followers (the count now sits at 3.1 million) and a book deal with HarperCollins. That book hit No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list and led to a short-lived CBS sitcom, ""$#*! My Dad Says,"" starring William Shatner. Halpern still tweets out his dad's best moments. His second book, ""I Suck at Girls,"" was published last May. Sohaib Athar . Athar was a 33-year-old ""IT consultant taking a break from the rat race by hiding in the mountains with his laptops,"" according to his Twitter profile. That spot in the mountains was in Abbottabad, Pakistan, and on May 2, 2011, he tweeted about a curiosity. ""Helicopter hovering over Abbottabad at 1AM (is rare event),"" he wrote. Little did he know that, over the course of the next few hours, he'd become possibly the world's first person to unknowingly report on the death of terrorist Osama bin Laden at the hands of a U.S. Navy SEAL team. All of a sudden, news outlets from around the world were scrambling for interviews with him. His modest 750 Twitter followers ballooned to more than 105,000 (they've since settled back to about 64,000). He continues to tweet from Abbottabad but has traveled extensively, including accepting an invitation to tell his story at last year's South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas. Anthony Weiner . He claimed that he was hacked, and at first, some of us believed him. After all, could a U.S. congressman be so clueless? Turns out ... In June 2011, then-New York Rep. Weiner resigned after someone used his Twitter account to send suggestive photos to some of his female followers. At first, he lied, saying he'd been hacked. But after a couple of frantic days, Weiner fessed up that he had been having inappropriate online relationships with women he met through social networking sites. How early Twitter decisions led to Weiner's downfall . He, perhaps wisely, also quit Twitter for a while. His first post since the scandal was in November, when he tweeted about Hurricane Sandy. The potential New York mayoral candidate's most recent tweet, from February, suggests that he still may not have gotten the hang of the whole Twitter thing. ""Llp@,"" it reads. Paraskevi Papachristou . A Greek triple jumper, Papachristou was hours away from realizing her dream of becoming an Olympian. Then, on her way to last year's London Games, she tweeted a joke: . ""With so many Africans in Greece, the mosquitoes from the West Nile will at least be eating some homemade food."" Maybe it was supposed to be some kind of play on words. But it was quickly denounced as racially insensitive, or downright racist, by Twitter users. Greece's Olympic committee condemned the tweet and ruled that she would not be allowed to participate in the games. For what it's worth, Papachristou's last tweet, from July 25, expressed ""heartfelt apologies"" for the joke, saying she ""could never believe in discrimination between human beings and races."" Ashton Kutcher . Sure, Kutcher was already a TV and movie star when Twitter started up. But he became the first Twitter celebrity after joining in January 2009, when the site was getting ready to make the leap from tech-savvy coffeehouse to household name. He got tons of publicity for becoming the site's first user with 1 million followers -- a distinction he won after winning a race to seven figures with some news network called CNN. He also became a savvy investor in tech startups. But perhaps more importantly than sheer numbers -- he's now 23rd on the site's popularity list, with almost 14 million followers -- Kutcher seemed to be the first celebrity who understood the benefits of using Twitter to interact with fans.","On Twitter's seventh anniversary, a look at seven lives changed by the site .

"(CNN) -- On Friday night, Wired technology journalist Mat Honan was brutally hacked. In a chain of events that Honan would unravel in the following days, hackers took advantage of security holes at Amazon and Apple to gain access to his iCloud account. They then took over his Gmail account, remotely wiped all data from his MacBook Air, iPhone and iPad, and took over his Twitter account as well as the Twitter account of his former employer, Gizmodo. The incident might seem small on its surface -- just one person's information, not a huge data breach of credit card numbers. But this one very public incident, thoroughly documented by Honan in a Wired article, could be a wake-up call to many who store their information with cloud-based services, including Amazon, Apple and Google. ""My experience leads me to believe that cloud-based systems need fundamentally different security measures,"" said Honan. ""Password-based security mechanisms â€” which can be cracked, reset and socially engineered â€” no longer suffice in the era of cloud computing."" The hackers used fairly basic techniques to accomplish the hack. They found Honan's home address and e-mail address online, and after some back and forth with Amazon tech support, used it to get the last four digits of Honan's credit card number. They called Apple customer support pretending to be Honan and used those four numbers along with same billing address to verify his identity, gaining access to Honan's iCloud account and the associated .Me account. The .Me account was Honan's backup e-mail for his Gmail account. Once they were in his Gmail, the hackers could reset passwords for all the key accounts that used Gmail, including Twitter accounts. Once in, the hacker spammed Honan's Twitter followers and deleted all the data from his various devices. The remote wipe option is a security service offered by Apple as part of its Find My Mac/iPhone/iPad feature. If devices associated with the Apple ID are stolen, the owner can execute a remote wipe to prevent their data from falling into the wrong hands. The motivation for the crime seems to be rather banal. In conversations with Honan, one of the hackers responsible revealed he just wanted Honan's three-letter Twitter handle, @mat. ""I honestly didn't have any heat towards you before this. i just liked your username like I said before,"" he wrote Honan. Remotely wiping Honan's computers and mobile devices, permanently erasing data including a year-and-a-half of photos of his young daughter, was also done without any real reason. ""yea i really am a nice guy idk why i do some of the things i do,"" the hacker wrote. Apple responded with an official statement on Monday night, saying, ""Apple takes customer privacy seriously and requires multiple forms of verification before resetting an Apple ID password. In this particular case, the customer's data was compromised by a person who had acquired personal information about the customer. In addition, we found that our own internal policies were not followed completely. We are reviewing all of our processes for resetting account passwords to ensure our customers' data is protected."" However, while investigating the breach over the weekend, Honan said he confirmed twice with Apple tech support that only two pieces of information are required to get access to an iCloud account: a billing address and the last four digits of the credit card associated with the account. Wired reporters say they tested the hacker's approach by successfully trying it on another account themselves. Amazon has not yet commented on the report.","Hackers use possible Amazon and Apple security holes to delete tech writer's data .

"(CNN) -- The outrage over the IRS's conduct in targeting certain tax-exempt groups is based on a misunderstanding. Obviously, mistakes were made in how the IRS examined the groups, but what should not get lost amid the resulting hue and cry is that this is fundamentally about disclosure of donors, not tax-exempt status. First of all, the IRS is to a certain extent in the ""targeting"" business. The agency's job -- like it or not -- is as an enforcer. It is supposed to go after tax scofflaws. It has to look for clues in tax returns and other materials to find the cheaters and dodgers. In the current scandal, the method of the ""targeting"" -- searching returns for names like ""tea party"" as indicators of possible misfeasance -- was a mistake. But it does not follow that the IRS should not have been looking at these and other groups as a class, without regard to political affiliation. Second is the question of what the IRS is looking for. Because the IRS is the cop guarding tax-exempt status, we think that the IRS is supposed to be deciding whether a group should be granted the ""privilege"" of tax exemption. It follows that we would and should be outraged if the IRS grants or denies the ""privilege"" because of an organization's political beliefs. But this is wrong. This is not really what the IRS is doing when enforcing the tax laws in this context. To be clear: Tax exemption here is not much of a privilege and is not the main issue. Tax-exempt status is offered by many parts of the tax code and not primarily to bestow some special tax break on an organization because of its function. Here's a breakdown: . 501(c)(3) charity . Process for Exemption: Must apply to IRS. Scrutiny required because of other tax benefits charities receive. Reason for Exemption: Performs a public benefit, lessens burdens of government. 501(c)(4) social welfare, 501(c)(5) labor union, 501(c)(6) Process for Exemption: Not required to apply to IRS but can self-declare exempt status. Reason for Exemption: Administrative convenience. Not much taxable income. Generally for a nonprofit purpose. 527 political organization . Process for Exemption: Must notify IRS (but approval not required). Reason for Exemption: Historically always exempt on contributions -- seen as a pass-thru entity. The exception is for charitable organizations, i.e., 501(c)(3)s, which do have heightened standards for tax exemption. But the extra scrutiny here is less because of tax exemption and more because of other tax benefits that flow from tax-exempt status, such as the ability to receive tax-deductible contributions. Importantly, charitable organizations are not allowed to engage in any political activity, because Congress long ago decided that charity and politics are incompatible. For noncharitable groups like the tea party groups, organized on a not-for-profit basis, tax exemption flows almost as a matter of course. Tax exemption is not viewed primarily as a subsidy of the federal government but more as a matter of administrative convenience. Many nonprofit groups do not have much income, would not owe much tax, and so tax exemption is not that much of a ""benefit."" This is why such groups are not even required to apply for tax-exempt status but rather can just hold themselves out as tax exempt and simply start filing annual returns as an exempt group. If this is true, however, then why does the IRS care about any group applying for exemption as other than a charity? Well, the question for the IRS here is not really one of whether a group is tax exempt but under which part of the code the exemption will come from. Will a group be ""tax exempt"" under one part of the tax code, e.g., as a section 501(c)(4) ""social welfare"" organization, or under another part, e.g., as a section 527 political organization? Both sections offer a form of tax exemption. But the big difference between the two has nothing to do with taxes. Rather, it has to do with the disclosure of donors. For reasons of campaign finance law (not tax law), public disclosure of donors is required for political organizations but not for social welfare organizations. And this brings us to the current scandal. After the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, it became possible for a 501(c)(4) organization to engage in unlimited amounts of political spending. It thus also became possible for a political organization to use the tax law to hide the identity of donors. After Citizens United, the abuse the IRS is tasked with policing is whether an organization that claims to be a ""social welfare"" organization is in reality a political organization in disguise. So the IRS, when faced with a deluge of new applications for 501(c)(4) status, rightly had to decide whether some or many of these groups were actually political organizations, tax-exempt under section 527, and so subject to disclosure rules. Primarily for reasons of campaign finance law, the IRS has been put in the position of deciding whether a group is primarily political. This is not a job the IRS is good at or ever will be good at. And as we have seen, it is not a job that we want the IRS to have. The solution is disclosure. Congress has the power to level the playing field on disclosure and should take action to do so. This will allow legitimate nonpolitical social welfare organizations to enjoy their appropriate tax status and return section 501(c)(4) to the backwater of exempt law it once was. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roger Colinvaux.","Roger Colinvaux: The outrage over the IRS's conduct is based on a misunderstanding .

"(CNN) -- Africa is poor, corrupt and rural. Right? Think again. A team of young documentary makers is hoping to burst the myth of Africa as a dangerous backwater by shining a light on some inspiring projects taking place on the continent. When filmmaker Nosarieme Garrick hit the streets of New York to ask passersby: ""What do you know about Africa?"" the overwhelming response was ""not a lot."" ""It's very big, very hot. Most of Africa's impoverished. I'm pretty ignorant to Africa,"" admitted one man. ""I know about some human rights violations, some wars and genocides,"" was the bleak answer from another woman. It was a dismal reflection of many Western stereotypes surrounding Africa -- one that Nosarieme is determined to change. Watch: Fighting Hollywood stereotypes . My Africa is: hopeful . The 27-year-old hopes to launch an eight-part documentary series 'My Africa Is' -- showcasing the continent through the eyes of its insiders. ""The four things that come to mind when people think of Africa are population, problems, poverty, and promise unfulfilled -- headline media reports on the continent. But that's not the whole story,"" Nosarieme, originally from Nigeria and now living in Washington, said. The ambitious project would cover 13 cities across sub-Saharan Africa. Organizers are trying to crowdsource funds through the Kickstarter website and hope to start filming in October if they reach their target. ""Between the 1980s and now the image of famine and wars has been ingrained in people's minds. That's a narrative that's going to be hard to shift,"" Nosarieme said. ""That's not to discount the fact that this stuff does happen. But what I wasn't seeing was the solutions."" See also: South African ballet dancer confounds stereotypes . Nigeria the troubled oil giant . First up in the documentary series is Abuja in Nigeria -- a country that until the election of President Goodluck Jonathan last year had largely lurched from one military coup to the next. This is Africa's most populous country and its leading oil producer. Yet few in the country have benefited from the oil boom with more than half the population still living in poverty. See also: Congo's designer dandies . The President was recently forced to sack bosses from state-owned oil company NNPC amid corruption allegations . Then there's the ongoing violence between Muslim and Christian groups in the north, with even Pope Benedict XVI weighing in to call for an end to the brutality. Put simply, when it comes to Nigeria, the headlines aren't great. Getting on the Photowagon . But according to Nosereime, that's only half the story. ""Nigeria is going through a turbulent time,"" she admitted. ""But there's a rising youth who are trying to educate each other."" Indeed the trailer for the first My Africa Is show, the focus is on Photowagon -- a Nigerian photography collective ""on a mission to show the giant of Africa through the lens."" Launched in 2009, their powerful images paint a very different image of Africa. It's a well-rounded collection that captures the frivolity of everyday life, such as market scenes and football matches. But doesn't shy away from some of the more familiar and gruesome notions of Nigeria such as terrorist attacks and military clampdowns. The 'other' Nigeria . Photowagon co-founder Aisha Augie-Kuta says her mission is to ""conquer sports photography as a northern Nigerian female"" -- a bold statement for a ""very conservative"" country. But the gung-ho 33-year-old appears undeterred as she takes 'My Africa Is' to a Nigeria vs Argentina football match in the capital Abuja. Traditional dancers and hip-hop singers entertain the crowds during half-time, while ecstatic fans hug each other with each goal. It's an image of Nigeria that couldn't be further from the grim headlines. Aisha admitted that if you believed the Western media, you wouldn't step foot inside Africa. ""They see us as a continent without hope,"" the mother-of-three said. ""For Africans, we see hope on the street everyday. But on the news you don't see that. It's always about the negative stuff. ""Instead, what we see is a lot of poor children dying from malaria or polio. If you listened to the news everyday you'd have no hope from the bombings or corruption. Don't get me wrong, it is happening. But it's not a constant. It's not the Nigeria we in Lagos or Abuja are living in."" See also: South Africa's underground youth culture . The 33-year-old said the country had come a long way since she was growing up under a military regime in the northern state of Kebbi. Aisha remained optimistic about democratic change in the west African country, particularly for women, but was also realistic about its pace. ""There's a lot of opportunity and hope as to where we can be,"" she said. ""But at the same time there's a lot of uncertainty about how much change the government can bring in.""","Ambitious documentary hopes to dispel bleak stereotypes of Africa .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Ask Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow how his band, Anvil, overcame bad management, a dead colleague, cruddy jobs, unpaid tour bills, raging arguments and now mockery as a Spinal Tap clone, and he has one word: ""kismet."" Robb Reiner and Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow have never given up on playing rock 'n' roll. He may be right. When Sacha Gervasi, a former teenage Anvil fan-roadie turned Steven Spielberg scriptwriter (""The Terminal""), decided to pursue a documentary about his old heroes, guitarist Kudlow was working part-time in his native Toronto, Ontario, delivering meals to schools. Drummer Robb Reiner was doing demolition work nearby. Anvil still played, but it was a far cry from the mid-'80s, when the band did a Japanese show with Whitesnake, Bon Jovi and the Scorpions and became a model for groups such as Metallica and Anthrax -- bands that had far more success than Anvil. Gervasi followed the group on an ill-fated European tour, watched them make an album with a name producer, and saw Kudlow and Reiner fight and make up, fight and make up, as they have since they were 15 and swore they'd rock forever.  Watch Kudlow and Reiner talk about their passion » . The result is a documentary, ""Anvil! The Story of Anvil,"" that's earned rave reviews, is gradually rolling out across the country -- and has reawakened interest in Anvil. At times, ""Anvil"" invokes the spirit of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" -- besides Reiner's you-can't-make-this-up name, the guys even visit Stonehenge -- but, as Cinematical.com reviewer James Rocchi writes, the film's comedy is cut by an unflinching honesty. Watch ""American Morning"" host -- and former music reporter -- John Roberts talk to Anvil . ""It's better than most music documentaries. It's better than most documentaries, period,"" he wrote after seeing the film at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. ""I am about as metal as your aunt, and I was spellbound by 'Anvil! The Story of Anvil.' ... [It's] a hymn to the human spirit, played loud in power chords."" The enthusiastic Kudlow and laconic Reiner came by CNN Center to talk about the film, their inspirations and why they've always been successful. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: What was the reaction when Sacha came to you and said he wanted to do a documentary on Anvil? Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow: I started crying, because it seemed like kismet, as if it was all meant to be this way. And quite honestly, it is. My internal optimism told me this is going to be the most successful thing that's ever happened to me, and perhaps one of the greatest things that's happened to rock music -- the greatest rock documentary that's ever happened. CNN: Robb? Robb Reiner: My initial reaction was that this was going to be cool, but I wasn't really sure if anybody would care. After Sundance, I knew that this thing was going to be very successful. ... [It got] standing ovations. At that point, I knew something was coming. CNN: The film, fairly or unfairly, has been presented as a real-life ""Spinal Tap."" Is that fair? Kudlow: It was purposely done. Reiner: It's fair. What can you say? We're a heavy metal band. My name is Robb Reiner. [The director] is the other Rob Reiner, and Spinal Tap is the fake Anvil. But, outside of that ... it was a Trojan horse to lead people into this. Realistically, we're not like Spinal Tap, and the movie's nothing like it either. It's a spin that's been created by the media, and we've just been having fun with it. CNN: A lot of times when a director sets out to make a documentary, the people who are in the documentary say, ""You cut this out, you changed this."" It's like a reality show. Did Sacha do this, or is it pretty much what you see is what happened? Kudlow: It's pretty much what you see is what happened. Reiner: They shot 320 hours of footage. The whole movie is a one-take movie. They just filmed everything ... they could have made five different movies out of the footage they had. Kudlow: Sort of. Reiner: Well, maybe three and a half. Kudlow: It might have been five more-boring movies. CNN: What was the first record you heard that said, this is the direction I want to go? Kudlow: The Beatles and the Rolling Stones, obviously ... Reiner: For me it was Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Grand Funk, Cactus, bands like that. Jimi Hendrix ... CNN: There's that funny bit in the movie in which you [Lips] talk about meeting Reiner by observing, ""I heard this guy playing Cactus."" And then later you met [Cactus drummer] Carmine Appice. Reiner: It's like foreshadowing there. Kudlow: And how do you get foreshadowing in a documentary? You don't. It's just that's the way things played themselves out. That's what I mean by kismet. It's as if the screenwriting were done by God. The stuff fell into place by itself. CNN: It's easy to make fun of a band -- or make a tragedy out of a band -- that doesn't quite make it. But back in the '80s, you were playing in front of tens of thousands of people. Even if it had ended then, you say in the movie that you've had the kind of success you were always hoping for. Reiner: We've been successful a lot as far as we're concerned. Kudlow: We've recorded 13 albums. Reiner: We've been touring for 30 years. Kudlow: Most of the magic that's involved here is the fact that we've always kept our guns loaded. We've always been prepared. And it's always staying on top of it and being ready for the opportunity when it came. And when Sacha contacted us after not seeing us for a number of years, it's not like we'd thrown in the towel or done anything like that. ... Reiner: The music got us here. There would be no movie if the music didn't mean anything, or hadn't meant something. Kudlow: You wouldn't get testimonials from some of these people if the music didn't mean something. We did make a difference. We were an influence. And we've always known that. And part of that is the fuel. CNN: Are you tying in concerts with the movie? Reiner: It's called the Anvil Experience. We show the movie and we play right after, in the theater. We've been doing that for the last two months throughout America, and it's like metal Beatlemania. CNN: There was another album due ... Reiner: ""Juggernaut of Justice"" is our next album. It's written, and we're just going to record at the end of the year and release it next year. We were going to keep rocking whether this movie came along or not. This movie is a rocket launcher to the mainstream, and here we are.","""Anvil! The Story of Anvil"" is a documentary that has reawakened interest in band .
Anvil's Steve ""Lips"" Kudlow and Robb Reiner have been dedicated to music .

"(CNN) -- It has been a long time since a Hollywood movie actually seemed like it could help people suffering from mental illness, their families and those who treat them. That's why I'm so encouraged by the response to ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which has enjoyed wide critical support since its release last fall -- including eight Academy Award nominations -- and is attracting a large national audience. It is the first film I've seen in years that portrays mental illness in such natural and poignant terms. The entertainment industry has made a lucrative habit of exploiting deranged behavior for ostensibly artistic purposes, and has a long history of stereotyping ""crazy"" characters as killers, stalkers or perverts and misrepresenting mental health care. Nearly 40 years after the release of the single most stigmatizing film in history --""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" -- it is still invoked by people criticizing or trying to avoid care as if it is, or was, an accurate portrayal of mental illness and psychiatric medicine. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" has the power to be an antidote to ""Cuckoo's Nest."" And the timing of its general release is particularly welcome in light of the wanton killings in Newtown, Connecticut, and the president's initiative on gun control and violence. The president is right to seek legislation, but what is also needed is helping people with mental disorders get treatment, the first step in which is to reduce stigma. Hemingway family mental illness explored . In the aftermath of the senseless tragedies that just keep on coming and the stigmatizing hysteria that came with them, we desperately need a compassionate reality check against our exaggerated fears of people with mental illness. Because they are not ""the other,"" ""strange"" or ""foreign"" people. They are us. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" tells the story of a person, family and community in which individuals suffer from mental disorders much the same way as people do in the real world. It is not so much a story of mental illness as it is about two people who happen to struggle with mental illness -- among many other things -- and their relationships with family and community. The fact that the protagonist (Bradley Cooper) and his father (Robert De Niro) suffer from bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, respectively, and the love interest (Jennifer Lawrence) has engaged in reckless self-harmful behavior in her transition from youth to adulthood, are simply aspects of their characters. Opinion: Get serious about mental health care . Their illnesses don't define their identities -- nor are they even the main point of the story. In coming together, the characters find the mutual support that enables them to contend with their respective problems and redirect their lives presumably in a more positive direction. There have been comments that the film does not accurately portray mental illness and conveys negative messages about psychiatric treatment. I completely disagree. And I think these criticisms miss the main point. This is a story in which everyday characters (everyone can't have John Nash's beautiful mind) experience mental disorders as part of their lives and manage to cope with them and ultimately prevail. They overcome the emotional problems that affect them, as characters in other stories overcome different forms of adversity. Review: 'Silver Linings' will give audiences a lift . In portraying the characters in this story as affected by mental illness, the film communicates powerful and constructive messages that resonate with the public. It says that mental illness affects ordinary people in normal domestic settings. Many people regard mental illness as remote and rare, only affecting people to whom the average person (whoever that may be) could not relate. Yet epidemiologic studies tell us that one in four persons will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime. The film also shows us that treatment can work and people can overcome their disorders. All are not doomed to suffer. The main character in the film suffers from bipolar disorder, a condition for which there is a risk of violent behavior if symptoms become severe and go untreated. However, with the support of his family, the efforts of his psychiatrist and the love of a good woman, he avoids the tragic outcomes that we unfortunately have seen repeatedly in our society, and he achieves a new beginning. Of course, continued treatment and support will be required to keep things on track. By providing this touching every-person portrayal of mental illness in the tumultuous aftermath of the horrific events in Connecticut, this film, ever so slightly, helps to ease our collective pain and provides a silver lining to this national black cloud. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman.","Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman: Entertainment industry has long exploited deranged behavior .

"(CNET) -- More than 2 million Americans lost their jobs last year, the stock market fell by almost 45 percent from its peak, and comparisons with the Great Depression are becoming disturbingly commonplace. You'll find lots of places online to watch president-elect Barack Obama's inauguration on Tuesday. But that isn't stopping Washington from throwing a $160 million party, the most lavish ever, for Barack Obama's presidential inauguration on Tuesday. Technology companies are joining the festivities by hosting a number of inaugural parties, and a collection of news and other Web sites are aiming to let anyone who can't be in the nation's capital--or who doesn't want to brave probably-freezing temperatures--follow along online. Here's a partial list: . • The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which is in charge of all the inaugural activities at the Capitol, will stream the entire event at its Web site, complete with closed captioning. The site has a wealth of information about what happens on Inauguration Day, including a handful of inaugural videos dating back to President Dwight Eisenhower's 1957 swearing-in ceremony, as well as videos of presidential luncheons dating back to the inauguration of John Kennedy. (It also reveals, for those interested, the recipe for Obama's luncheon meal, which features a main course of pheasant and duck served with sour cherry chutney.) • Our sister site CBS News will have day-long live coverage January 20 on TV and the Web, starting at 7 a.m. EDT. Katie Couric will also host a special Webcast that night with reporters and punditry, for which viewers can submit questions. • CBS streaming coverage will also be Webcast on Joost's Everything Obama page, which also features interviews, campaign highlights, and satire clips. • MSNBC will be live streaming the event on its home page and politics section, and visitors can embed the video into their own sites. Its inauguration page also features videos of inaugurations from decades past. • Fox News will provide live streaming coverage via Hulu beginning at noon for about two hours. After the live stream, Hulu will provide on-demand access to the ceremony. The live stream is embeddable, as is an inauguration countdown from Hulu. The video site's Obama Presidency page also features related content like speeches, commentary, satire, and past inaugural speeches. • C-SPAN will debut its Inauguration Hub on January 20, featuring an online ""control room""--a multichannel grid designed by Mogulus with Webcasts of inauguration activities. Visitors will be able to choose from one of four live feeds featuring events like the swearing in at the Capitol, the parade, and a number of inaugural balls. • CNN is partnering with Facebook to provide live streaming of the swearing in and Obama's speech. Viewers can ""RSVP"" for the event on Facebook, and as they watch, they will be able to provide status updates with their thoughts on the events. A Facebook window on the CNN.com Live channel will show viewers their friends' relevant status updates. • Current TV and Twitter are teaming up, as they did during the election, to add real-time tweets to Current's broadcast and Webcast of the swearing in, which starts at 11:30 a.m. EDT and will be replayed throughout the day. • The New York Times, the AP's online video network, and the Online NewsHour will also live stream inauguration coverage. Once Obama is sworn in, he'll be party hopping through Washington that night. The Presidential Inauguration Committee has promised to Webcast some of the official inaugural balls--though there are plenty of unofficial parties, including some hosted by tech companies. The Recording Industry Association of America is hosting a charity ball featuring the recording artist Rihanna and the actors David Arquette and Courteney Cox. The ball benefits the nonprofit Feeding America and is co-sponsored by Yahoo, Comcast, Oracle, AT&T, SoundExchange, Time Warner, News Corp., and a number of other companies. Google is partnering with the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights to host ""a break from traditional inaugural balls."" Guests are encouraged to make donations--which Google will match--to organizations including the LCCR Education Fund, One Economy, the Sunlight Foundation, D.C. Central Kitchen, and Green For All. The Huffington Post, the news aggregation and commentary site, is hosting a pre-inaugural ball Monday night with the Atlantic Philanthropies and the Musk Foundation, which supports research on renewable energy, human space exploration, and pediatrics. The event is also receiving sponsorship from MySpace, Comcast, the wind power company Vestas, and the nonprofit Global Green USA, among others. The party, they say, is ""to celebrate change in Washington, the rise of new media, and a renewed commitment to service and the environment,"" and features a performance by Will.i.am. Plenty of other parties will be celebrating a renewed commitment to the environment, including the Green Inaugural Ball, chaired by Al Gore and hosted by a number of organizations like the American Council on Renewable Energy, the Energy Action Coalition, and the Vote Solar Initiative. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- In mid-July this year, a roar echoed around one of the most remote inlets of northern Greenland -- and an island was born. No ordinary island, but a huge chunk of ice, roughly twice the size of Manhattan, that had broken from the Petermann Glacier. Scientists gave it the romantic name of PII-2012 and watched it begin to drift slowly into the Nares Strait, which separates Greenland from Canada. Then it began to break up, spawning several smaller ice islands. The birth of PII-2012 was no isolated event. The Petermann Glacier had lost a much larger chunk in 2010. It also broke into fragments, though that may not be the right word. One of them alone was estimated to weigh 3.5 billion tonnes, or metric tons (3.86 billion short tons), according to E. Julie Halliday, a researcher at Memorial University in Canada. Canada's ice shelves are also retreating fast. And as the Arctic warms, both glaciers and ice-shelves are launching floating islands into the sea that may threaten shipping, the fishing industry and off-shore oil and gas platforms. The air around northern Greenland and Ellesmere Island has warmed by about 2.5 degrees Celsius in the past 25 years. Ocean temperatures in the Arctic are also thought to have risen, though there is less data on them. Halliday noted in a paper presented at the Arctic Technology Conference in Houston last week that while ""management of a 3.5 billion-tonne ice island away from offshore structures may theoretically be possible, putting it into practice would be logistically very challenging."" One option, she said, would be to cover the surface of the ice island with carbon, which would accelerate its melting, but ""the challenge then would become dealing with numerous smaller ice fragments as opposed to one large one."" And even a small one could be the size of a football stadium. Scientists are only now beginning to research these ice islands and the rate at which they melt and divide, especially as the Arctic waters warm and the restraining effect of sea ice disappears. They have been using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles -- the undersea equivalent of surveillance drones -- to map the underside of ice islands. Uncovering the secrets of Greenland's ice . After the 2010 ""calving"" from the Petermann, several fragments between them containing billions of tons of ice drifted south along the Labrador coast, interfering with shipping in the Strait of Belle Isle. One traveled 150 miles (240 kilometers) in just one week. Derek Mueller, a researcher at Carleton University in Ontario, has been following one 12 million-tonne fragment that was one of the progeny of the 2010 calving of Petermann Glacier. Nicknamed Berghaus, it was still wandering around a year later near Bylot Island in Baffin Bay before finally disintegrating in the fall of 2011. Mueller will be presenting his research at the ArcticNet conference in Vancouver next week. He says that in 2011 alone 3 billion tons of ice broke away from Canada's major ice shelves on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island. Mueller told CNN that that Canada's ice shelves have been diminishing for the past century. But the rate has accelerated dramatically in recent years, and today they are just half the size they were only seven years ago. As a graduate student, Mueller discovered a major crack in the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf in 2002. On a visit six years later he was surprised to see the shelf riven with fissures. Since then it has largely disintegrated. The Serson Ice Shelf measured some 120 square kilometers (46 square miles) until some 60% of it broke away in 2008. Now there's just 7 square kilometers left. ""The ice shelves are on their way out,"" he told CNN. ""In several decades they may be gone altogether."" Ice islands may pose a greater threat than icebergs because they have a relatively shallow draft, Mueller says, which is often about 40 meters (130 feet). ""This poses a significant risk to offshore platforms that are usually protected from massive icebergs by being situated in shallow waters,"" he said, especially as exploration for oil grows in areas such as offshore Greenland, and the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. The same warmer temperatures that are encouraging the collapse of ice shelves are melting icebergs and ice islands before they reach the north Atlantic, according to the International Ice Patrol, a program led by the U.S. Coast Guard to protect shipping from the sort of disaster that befell the Titanic. In recent years the number of icebergs surviving south of the 48th parallel has declined, according to the Ice Patrol. Along with the decline in sea ice, the disappearance of ice shelves that are thought to be thousands of years old is rapidly changing the Arctic landscape. Ice shelves harbor surprisingly diverse collections of organisms in pools of sediment, organisms that might have value as enzymes capable of functioning in extreme cold and harsh light, Mueller said. They have also acted as a sort of barrier, protecting huge glaciers from exposure to warming waters. Now that the ice shelves are disintegrating, these glaciers -- which are up to 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide -- are thought to be melting more rapidly, and contributing to rising sea levels. Warmer temperatures in Greenland have led to widespread flooding in the southwest of the island as the ice sheet melts at rates unprecedented in the modern era. In the Scientific American blog last July, researcher Ben Linhoff wrote: ""In the four years our camp has existed on this glacial river, more meltwater is spilling out from beneath Leverett Glacier than we've ever seen."" Were that process to continue or accelerate, many scientists say, the anticipated rise in sea levels over the next few decades may have to be revised upwards. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in its annual Arctic Report Card, published this week, said dramatic melting of the Greenland ice sheet had occurred in July, ""covering about 97 percent of the ice sheet on a single day."" Martin Jeffries, co-author of the report, said on the NOAA website: ""As the sea ice and snow cover retreat, we're losing bright, highly reflective surfaces, and increasing the area of darker surfaces -- both land and ocean -- exposed to sunlight. This increases the capacity to store heat within the Arctic system, which enables more melting -- a self-reinforcing cycle."" All the evidence says that what in effect is the world's source of air conditioning is getting weaker, with consequences that will be felt far below the 48th parallel.","Greenland's glaciers and Canada's ice shelves are diminishing fast, scientists say .
Giant ice islands are breaking off, sometimes floating into shipping lanes .
Yet the number of icebergs surviving south of the 48th parallel has declined .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil and Mexico summoned U.S. ambassadors Monday after media reports that the United States had spied on their countries' presidents. ""Without prejudging the veracity of the information presented in the media, the Mexican government rejects and categorically condemns any espionage work against Mexican citizens in violation of international law,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement. In Brazil, Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo called the situation ""an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty."" The statements were the latest sign of international fallout over documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. A Brazilian news report Sunday described the alleged espionage, citing Glenn Greenwald, a Brazil-based journalist who obtained documents from Snowden. CNN has not independently confirmed the report, and there was no immediate reaction from the White House. Source: U.S. seeks compromise on companies' NSA data requests . The report first appeared in Globo TV's Sunday night program ""Fantastico"" and is likely to heighten tensions between the United States and Latin America's two biggest economies. One of the alleged NSA documents leaked to Greenwald dates from June 2012, a month before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was elected. In it, the candidate talks about whom he would select for his Cabinet if elected. The documents did not reference any specific communications with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff but show the methods the NSA allegedly used to track e-mails and mobile phone communications with close advisers. ""It was very clear in the documents that they had already carried out the spying,"" Greenwald told ""Fantastico,"" speaking in Portuguese. ""They aren't talking about something they are planning, they are celebrating their spying successes."" Brazilian Justice Minister Eduardo Cardozo told CBN radio: ""If it's confirmed, it is very serious because a country cannot passively accept the violation of its sovereignty."" ""Any country that has its sovereignty violated has to react, take a position and use international law to put things in their place,"" he added. ""And that's what Brazil will do."" A spokesman for Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto declined to comment Monday morning. Data seized from Greenwald's partner Miranda risks security, UK says . Mexican lawmakers stressed that the Brazilian news report had not been confirmed but demanded further explanation from the U.S. government. ""This new revelation is extremely delicate because any kind of espionage is an irregular situation that is against the law. However, we have to be clear that this is speculation. This is a leak, and it must be treated like one,"" said Sen. Marcela Guerra. Guerra, a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and president of the Senate's North American foreign relations committee, said Mexico's foreign minister should meet with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico over the matter. ""There is a feeling of deep indignation,"" even though the report hasn't been proven, said Rep. Fernando Zarate, secretary of the Mexican house of representatives' foreign relations committee. ""If true, it seriously violates national sovereignty,"" said Zarate, of the Democratic Revolution Party. ""How is it possible that the telephone of a president is being monitored? What could an ordinary citizen in our country expect?"" In Brazil, bilateral relations were already strained by reports that the South American nation was one of the countries that had been most-targeted by the NSA spying program. Rousseff is scheduled to visit U.S. President Barrack Obama in Washington in October. Obama visited Mexico in May, stressing the importance of strengthening educational and economic ties between the two nations. NSA misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- In the middle of Siberia's Taiga forest, east of Abakan and down an unmarked dirt road stretching across the Kuraginsk district of Krasnoyarsk territory, there is a place where many have found salvation. It is known as Petropavlovka, the home of the Church of the Last Testament, which has attracted at least 5,000 followers since its establishment in 1990. Last summer, after years of unanswered emails to the church's press department, I was finally invited to visit. The church's leader is known as Vissarion, a.k.a. the Teacher. In another life he was Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop and served as a patrol officer in Minusinsk until the late 1980s. Then, on August 18, 1990, he experienced a revelation: His was the word of God. He began sermonizing in and around his hometown and soon, with a handful of newly converted followers by his side, he retreated to the ancient Taiga and began a new life -- and, some might say, founded an entirely new world. Just about everything Vissarion has ever said or thought has been recorded in the never-ending Last Testament, a follow-up of sorts to the New Testament that currently spans 10 volumes and thousands of pages. Inside is doctrine on the dual origins of the universe (one spawned nature, the other the human soul), something called the ""outer-space mind"" (aliens, basically), and the rapidly approaching end of the world. Or at least this is what I understand from the handful of scriptures that have been (somewhat poorly) translated into English. While Christian imagery abounds, the church's ideology is an all-encompassing amalgam of the world's major religions and includes aspects of Buddhism, Hinduism, Paganism and many other spiritual philosophies. See the rest of The Jesus of Siberia at VICE.COM . I first learned of Vissarion and his church from ""Bells from the Deep,"" Werner Herzog's 1993 documentary about Russian mysticism that explored the country's renewed interest in religion following the fall of the USSR and its official stance of gosateizm (state atheism). Back then, Petropavlovka was nothing more than a handful of simple structures on unfertile land in the middle of the forest. Today, I would discover, it is an almost completely self-sufficient community with solar power, satellite television, bountiful organic gardens and an overwhelming air of contentment. Once open to journalists, a few years back Vissarion claimed that he would never give an interview again. But somehow, some way, he granted me an audience and I was allowed to ask a man who many believe to be the reincarnation of Christ if he had any answers for our troubled world. I'm still not sure if his advice is applicable outside of his insular kingdom, but since my trip I have often thought of his blessed community and how everyone there seemed to be full of joy. It's enough to make you consider that they just may be onto something.","Russian patrol officer turned self-proclaimed Jesus has following of thousands .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's former military chief was behind bars Friday pending trial for his alleged role in a plot to overthrow the government. Gen. Ilker Basbug is the highest-ranking officer to be accused in a long-running tussle between the Islamic-backed government and Turkey's secular establishment, defended by the military. Basbug was arrested and taken to Silivri prison after testifying for seven hours Thursday in an Istanbul court, Basbug's lawyer Ilkay Sezer told reporters. He stands accused of involvement with the so-called Ergenekon network, a nationalist group that prosecutors say created dozens of websites disseminating propaganda aimed at bringing down the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""The 26th chief of general staff of the Turkish Republic is unfortunately arrested based on charges related to eliminating the government of Turkish Republic and establishing and leading a terrorist organization,"" Sezer said. Basbug retired as commander of the Turkish armed forces in 2010. He is the latest in a long line of military staff who stands accused of plotting against the government. A probe was launched in 2007, after the discovery of a stash of grenades and bomb-making materials in Istanbul. It led to waves of arrests and several court cases involving both civilians and former and active-duty officers. More than 300 people have been arrested in connection with Ergenekon. Among them are 97 journalists, according to the Turkish Press Union. The government's crackdown has polarized Turkish society, which has seen the military overthrow four governments in the past 50 years. Some view the government's actions in curbing military power as important steps to democratization in Turkey, a candidate for European Union membership. But critics say the investigation is a political witch hunt. They accuse Erdogan, an observant Muslim, of silencing his opponents and emasculating the secular establishment, including the military. Last July, Turkey's top four military officers resigned after a squabble with the government over the fate of officers jailed in the alleged plot against the Justice and Development Party. Friday, Turkish President Abdullah Gul told journalists that Basbug's arrest did not prove guilt. ""No one can be declared guilty before a decision of the court,"" Gul said. ""Everyone is equal in the court of law. This is a legal process."" CNN's Yesim Comert and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","Gen. Ilker Basbug is the highest-ranking officer to be accused .

"(CNN) -- Twelve-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal dropped just two games as he eased through his first singles match since losing in the opening round at Wimbledon. The former world No. 1 beat 132nd-ranked Canadian Jesse Levine 6-2 6-0 in just one hour and 12 minutes in the first round of the Rogers Cup in Montreal. The Spaniard suffered a major upset when he lost in straight sets to unseeded Steven Darcis at the All England Club in June but he was pleased to get back on track in his first singles match in six weeks. ""I didn't play a perfect match, I played well,"" the 27-year-old, who made a winning comeback in the doubles Tuesday, told the ATP Tour's official website. ""The conditions out there today were very difficult. I will say I did the right things to be in the next round."" Next up for Nadal, a two-time Rogers Cup champion, is Wimbledon semi-finalist Jerzy Janowicz after the Pole overcame Canadian wildcard Frank Dancevic in a match which lasted nearly two and a half hours. British world No. 2 Andy Murray, who beat Janowicz on his way to his first Wimbledon title, was also in action for the first time since his success at the All England Club. The two-time grand slam champion took his winning streak at the tournament to 13 with a 6-4 7-6 (7-2) win over Spain's Marcel Granollers. Murray, a winner in Montreal in 2009 and 2010, will face Latvia's Ernests Gulbis in round two. ""I was pretty nervous beforehand,"" said the 26-year-old. ""That was a good sign. I'm pretty ready to move forward and not think too much about Wimbledon and concentrate on the U.S. Open."" World No. 7 Juan Martin del Potro emerged victorious from a grueling encounter with Croatia's Ivan Dodig. Argentina's Del Potro, fresh from winning a title in Washington last weekend, took the first set before the 35th-ranked Dodig fought back to clinch the second. Del Potro fell a double break down in the third and deciding set before clawing his way back to secure a 6-4 4-6 7-5 triumph. In the women's event in Toronto, Serena Williams recovered from losing a service game in the opening set to beat Italy's 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-3 6-2. ""I felt good. I felt solid,"" the 16-time grand slam winner told the WTA Tour's official website. ""Obviously I made a few errors, but it's just my first match on hard in a really long time. ""I also played a really good player, so it was a good match. It took me a few games to adjust to her game, but it's good that she played like that because of my next opponent. ""Now I feel like I'm completely adjusted, and I feel good going into the next round."" Next up for Williams is a first encounter with Dutch ace Kirsten Flipkens, who beat her sister Venus Williams in the first round. Wimbledon winner Marion Bartoli eased past American qualifier Lauren Davis 6-0 6-3, while 2011 French Open champion Li Na defeated Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1 6-4.

"(CNN) -- Children were among the victims Monday when a car bomb blew up near a hospital in the Libyan city of Benghazi, a security official told state TV. ""Children with shredded bodies and wounds to the head,"" Benghazi Security Directorate spokesman Tareq Khraz told state TV Libya Al Ahrar. ""I cannot even describe the scene to you, but believe me, it was horrific."" The car bomb detonated near Al Jalaa hospital but not immediately in front of the building. Officials don't know at this point who or what was targeted. The blast destroyed eight cars and caused damage to nearby buildings, Khraz said. Khraz said that at least 13 people were killed and more than 40 wounded. The hospital director, speaking on Ahrar TV, had a lower toll: three dead and 15 wounded. Later Monday, state news agency LANA quoted Abdullah al-Fitouri, a health ministry official in eastern Libya, as saying that four people were killed, but three have not been identified because of the ""gruesomeness of the incident."" The fourth body was identified, LANA reported, as a 13-year-old boy. Libya's parliament condemned the bombings and suspended its Tuesday session to allow members to head to Benghazi to take part in the funerals. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, standing alongside General National Congress President Mohammed al-Magariaf and other members, said that Monday's explosion comes after a string of similar acts but that security forces have not been able to take strict measures against such attacks. According to a CNN journalist there, the bombing seems to have shaken Libyans fiercely because of its civilian victims. Over the past 18 months, Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya's revolution that toppled longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi, has been the scene of attacks that mainly targeted security forces, Western diplomats and international organizations. Gunmen attacked the U.S. diplomatic mission in the city on September 11, killing the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. The Obama administration's handling of that incident has come under much criticism and scrutiny. Doomed Libya ambassador: 'We're under attack' Most of the attacks in Benghazi have been blamed on extremist Islamist groups that have established a foothold in eastern Libya, according to Western intelligence officials who have spoken to CNN. More than two years after the start of the revolution, the country is awash in weapons and hundreds of militias. Libyans frustrated with the security situation have called on the government to bolster security forces. The government, in power since November, has been taking steps to curb militia groups and build a police and army force. Libyan officials, particularly Zeidan, have said that securing and stabilizing the country remains a top challenge and a priority. But the process of doing that will take time and began only a few months ago, Zeidan said. During the past two weeks, bombs have targeted a number of police stations in Benghazi. There were no casualties in these primarily overnight attacks. Those attacks followed a few weeks of relative calm in a city that has been plagued by a fragile peace since the fall of Gadhafi, according to residents. Benghazi residents said they felt that security had been improving before the most recent uptick in violence. In light of the car bombing Monday, the Libyan military ordered army and pro-military militias to help Interior Ministry forces preserve security, the military command told state news. And the U.N. Assistance Mission in Libya condemned the violence. It issued this statement: ""The Mission also underscores the need to support the legitimate authority of the State and enable it to shoulder its responsibilities in ensuring the safety and security of all citizens across Libya.""","NEW: Apparent targeting of civilians shakes Libyans .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Former Wyoming Sen. Al Simpson knows a thing or two about passing landmark immigration reform. My friend and former graduate school professor did it in 1986 with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which he co-authored with former Rep. Romano Mazzoli. Simpson knows that the endeavor is not for the faint of heart, or the thin-skinned or the easily disillusioned. It means navigating one of the wackiest and wickedest debates in our public discourse. The immigration debate, he likes to say, is filled with ""emotion, fear, guilt and racism."" It is no wonder that most lawmakers won't go anywhere near the immigration issue. For those who grab the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground, things can get frustrating. So began the education of Marco Rubio. The Florida senator is the de-facto leader of the Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group of senators pushing for immigration reform. Rubio has become the face of immigration reform. He is the most articulate advocate and the game's most valuable player in large part because he is charged with rounding up Republican votes. Meanwhile, if Rubio were to withdraw support for the bill, it wouldn't just be a game changer. It would be game over. He recently worried allies by characterizing the bill as not strong enough and said that more border security measures have to be added. While Rubio courts Republicans, the Democratic members of the gang (Charles Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois or Bob Menendez of New Jersey) need to arm-twist Democrats to make sure they're on board. Many of the Senate's Democrats don't seem enthusiastic about a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants. On my scorecard, I count at least 10 Democrats, from both red states and union-friendly rust belt states, who either outright oppose the legislation or whose support is shaky. Schumer predicted Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that a bill could pass by the Fourth of July and that he is shooting for 70 votes, which he thought he could get, including a majority of Republicans. Don't believe it. I've followed Schumer's approach to the immigration issue for many years, and most of what he says on the subject is a falsehood, a fraud or a fairy tale. A couple of weeks ago, Menendez went on Univision's Sunday show, ""Al Punto,"" and candidly told host Jorge Ramos that the Gang of Eight didn't have 60 votes. And now suddenly they have 70? This is Schumer's game: Set expectations high and put the burden of meeting them squarely on Republicans. Leave Democrats off the hook. Talk about how most Republicans will support the bill. So when the vote comes and it turns out -- surprise! -- a majority of Republicans vote against the thing, the GOP will catch all the blame. It's all part of Mr. Rubio's wild ride. Here you have a rising star in the GOP tasked with the thankless job of ginning up support among Republicans for a bill that many of them think would create millions of new Democratic voters, albeit, 13 years down the road, which is the amount of time that the legislation requires illegal immigrants to wait before becoming citizens and getting the right to vote. I can't decide which is more pathetic. That Republicans have such a guilty conscience -- for the hamhanded way in which they've handled immigration, and the acrimony they've stirred up against Latinos -- that they think legalized immigrants are going to hold a grudge for 13 years before finally getting even. Or that Republicans have so little confidence in their own party, message and ability to win over these voters in those same 13 years by coming up with policies that appeal to them. From the sounds of the debate, Rubio isn't making as many converts as he is making enemies in his own party. There are even some conservatives, in the conspiracy corner of the GOP, who suggest that this was the secret plan of Democrats all along: Rope Rubio into supporting immigration reform. Put him front and center. Ruin his reputation with conservatives. And effectively remove him from the top-tier of 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls. That is a little far-fetched. Besides, Rubio could emerge from all this with enough new supporters on the left to make up for whatever support he could be losing on the right. Either way, he seems intent on fighting one battle at a time and, assuming he has White House ambitions, letting the next presidential race take care of itself. As for the senator wavering on the immigration bill, I don't see it. Rubio supports the main principles, and he's simply thinking about the best way to pass it. He said during a television interview on Tuesday that he doesn't think the bill has the 60 votes needed to break a possible filibuster and that ""even the Democrats would concede that."" And he is worried that ""horse trading"" could water down the border security provisions. But he still backs the final product. Credit mom. In an interview with Time a few months ago, Rubio, whose middle name is Antonio, said that his mother, Oriales Garcia Rubio, left him a voice mail in December. She urged him to do right by illegal immigrants, whom she called ""los pobrecitos"" (the poor ones). The message went: ""Tony, some loving advice from the person who cares for you most in the world. Don't mess with the immigrants, my son. Please, don't mess with them. They're human beings just like us, and they came for the same reasons we came. To work. To improve their lives. So please, don't mess with them."" Rubio has said that his mother's plea reminded him that immigration has a ""human element."" Now everything I see and hear, including the senator appearing on a gauntlet of conservative radio shows to defend the bill, tells me that Rubio will keep the faith. That's not easy to do when, I have it on good authority, your Senate office is getting hate mail comically telling the Cuban-American lawmaker to ""Go back to Mexico!"" Normally, that sort of thing might seem strange. But in the immigration debate, it's madness as usual. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Immigration reform is not for the faint of heart or the thin-skinned .

"(CNN) -- Divers have found what they believe are human remains on the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship, the Italian Civil Protection agency announced Tuesday. The bodies of two people from the 2012 wreck have never been found: Russel Rebello of India and Maria Grazia Trecarichi of Sicily have been missing but presumed dead. Their bodies have long been believed to be either trapped beneath or inside the ship. Italian authorities also said two weeks ago that divers found what they thought were human remains on the ship's Deck 4. But they later determined that the remains were animal. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of 4,200 people on board. The toll includes Rebello and Trecarichi. Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship. Trecarichi was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. The new discovery of remains comes about three weeks after engineers managed to rotate the ship back to vertical. Before that, the ship rested 20 months on its side, hindering a full examination. Costa Concordia righted . Authorities say the ship struck the rocks off Giglio Island after the captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered the liner to veer more than four miles off course to salute a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio. Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. His trial, which began with preliminary hearings in March, resumed last month. The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated. Schettino argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. His defense is trying to prove, among other things, that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation. Schettino also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman turned it in the direction that Schettino told him to 13 seconds before impact. The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements. CNN's Hada Messia, Jason Hanna and Barbie Latza Nadeau contributed to this report.","Of 32 declared dead in the Costa Concordia accident, two bodies have yet to be recovered .

"(CNN) -- A photo posted online Monday shows George Zimmerman with blood on his nose and lips. His attorneys say it was taken the night unarmed teen Trayvon Martin was killed in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense. Martin's attorneys say he was shot and killed ""in cold blood."" Prosecutors have charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder for the February 26 killing. The picture, posted Monday on Zimmerman's defense website, was taken by a police officer, Zimmerman's attorneys wrote. The state had previously provided a black-and-white copy of the image, the attorneys wrote on the website. ""This high resolution digital file was finally provided to the defense on October 29."" A police report from the night of the incident said Zimmerman was ""bleeding from the nose and back of his head."" The 28-year-old volunteer neighborhood watchman was driving through his gated community when the incident occurred. Martin was walking through the neighborhood to his father's girlfriend's house. Zimmerman has claimed that after the two exchanged words, Martin charged at him, knocked him to the ground and banged his head repeatedly against a concrete sidewalk. Martin's family says Zimmerman attacked the teen, who had done nothing wrong. Martin's death sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control, as well as Florida's controversial ""stand your ground"" law, which allows the use of deadly force when a person perceives a threat to safety. In August, a new judge was named to oversee the case, after an appeals court agreed to a request from Zimmerman's defense team. The attorneys had argued the previous judge had made remarks putting Zimmerman in reasonable fear of an unfair trial.

"(CNN) -- In his weekly address, President Obama said that the Christmas Day airline bomber acted under orders from an al Qaeda branch in Yemen, which ""trained him, equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for America."" Vowing to hold accountable all those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on Christmas, Obama sent a letter to his Yemeni counterpart, Ali Abdullah Saleh, delivered by Gen. David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command, in which he pledged to double the $70 million in counterterrorism aid to the poverty-stricken country in 2009, a figure that does not include covert programs run by U.S. special forces and the CIA. With the increase in security assistance, Yemen now tops Pakistan, which receives about $112 million, a clear indication of the growing threat of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (known as AQAP Yemen-based) in U.S. eyes. American strategy is driven by assumptions that do not fully recognize the complexity and gravity of the situation in Yemen. The first premise is that with increased U.S. security assistance, the Yemen government will take the fight to al Qaeda and uproot it. Secondly, U.S. officials assume that confronting al Qaeda requires mainly counterterrorism measures. What is alarming about the resurgence of this al Qaeda branch is its linkage to Yemen's deepening social and political crises and failing state institutions. In the last three years, against all odds, the al Qaeda branch has revived the central organization's declining fortune in the Arabian Peninsula and emerged as a potentially potent force. AQAP numbers between 100 and 300 core operatives -- as many as those in Pakistan, though they are younger and lack the operational skills and sophistication of their Pakistani cohorts. Most are rookies with little combat experience, unlike the previous Afghanistan generation. The structure and composition of the Yemen branch appears to have changed because of the merger with militant elements from Saudi Arabia last January, forming AQAP and revitalizing the jihadist network there. Some fighters had returned from war zones in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan and have supplied military training and ideological motivation and leadership. In 2007 I interviewed several hardened Yemeni and Saudi returnees from Iraq who made it clear that they would target America and Britain if U.S. and U.K. troops do not withdraw from Muslim lands. These hard-liners were neither bluffing nor making empty threats. There are also some signs of cross-fertilization between AQAP and Somalia's al-Shabab, an al Qaeda like-minded group fighting for control of the war-torn country facilitated by the flow of thousands of Somali refugees to Yemen. That is not the whole story, however. The recent revival of al Qaeda in Yemen is a product of a structural socioeconomic crisis and political divisions and fault lines that have pushed the country to the brink of all-out war. Al Qaeda is a parasite feeding on lawlessness, social and political instability, and abject poverty and despair. Today Yemen is a fragile state with failing institutions and a collapsed economy. Forty percent of the country's 23 million people are unemployed. More than a third of the population is undernourished and almost 50 percent live in absolute poverty. Yemen, the poorest Arab country, has one of the highest fertility rates. A huge youth explosion (60 percent of the population is under the age of 20) faces a grim future -- and radicalization. With every visit to this stunningly beautiful country, I observe a deteriorating security situation and declining social conditions. It is now common to see many women of all ages clad in black from head to toe begging on the streets of major cities, an alarming sign of social breakdown in an ultraconservative Muslim society where women do not appear in public. The sound of Soviet-made fighter jets often shatters the peace of the early hours of the morning. The jets are on their way to bomb Houthi (Shia) rebels in the Sada'adah province and the Harf Sufian district of Amran province, a mini-civil war in the north that has raged on and off for four years and has claimed more than a thousand lives, most of whom are civilians. A secessionist movement in the south has gained momentum, with a sizable segment of southern public opinion demanding a divorce from the forced union imposed by the north in the early 1990s. What the al Qaeda branch has tried to do is to submerge and embed itself in these raging local conflicts and to position itself as the spearhead of opposition and resistance to the Saleh regime. For example, al Qaeda has allied itself with tribes in the separatist south in the fight against the central government, a radical move because many separatists are socialist and not religiously inclined. Ironically, in 1994 President Saleh relied greatly on jihadists and Islamists to subdue the socialist south and unify Yemen. From his base in Sudan, Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in Yemen, exhorted his men to fight the ""Godless Marxists"" in the south, who they massacred. The al Qaeda-Yemen connection goes back to the foundation of the jihadist organization. Yemen has always had powerful Islamist and jihadist movements. In the 1980s, thousands of Yemenis joined the Afghan jihad against occupying Soviet forces and most returned home emboldened and militarized. Unlike their Middle Eastern counterparts, Yemeni returnees were welcomed by the Saleh regime. In the early 1990s when bin Laden set up al Qaeda in Sudan and then in Afghanistan, he heavily and personally recruited Yemenis whom he trusted. Bin Laden, a Saudi, has often said he has a soft spot in his heart for Yemen because of its people's religiosity and tribal code of honor and hospitality and harsh, mountainous landscape. The Saudi-Yemeni contingent was the largest within the bin Laden organization, as well as in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Many of his bodyguards, personal secretaries, drivers and cooks were Yemenis. AQAP chief Nasir al-Wuhayshi (reportedly killed by a U.S.-directed airstrike on December 24), once served as bin Laden's personal secretary. Bin Laden entrusted the protection and transportation of his wives and children to his Yemeni men, a fact that speaks volumes about his mindset. U.S. officials appear to overestimate the capacity of the Yemen government to meet the multiple challenges and threats to its authority and integrity. Its security forces are spread thin. Four years after the outbreak of the Houthi rebellion, the state has failed to resolve it. More importantly, the government can no longer deliver the social goods and patronage, historically solid underpinnings of the Saleh rule. The country has been badly affected by falling oil revenues (Yemen is the smallest oil producer in the Middle East), pervasive corruption, and the international financial downturn. After more than three decades in power, President Saleh's ability to co-opt adversaries and maintain friends has shrunk considerably, plunging Yemen into an uncertain future. On its own, counterterrorism will most likely fail in expelling al Qaeda from Yemen's tribal areas and might trigger a backlash against the Saleh regime and its Western patrons. Of all Middle Easterners, Yemenis voice strong anti-American foreign policy sentiments and take pride in sacrificing blood and treasure in defense of Arab and Muslim causes. Any U.S. policy course that neglects the local context will help al Qaeda sell its narrative to a receptive audience. What Yemen desperately needs is a political and economic vision that tackles deteriorating security and social conditions and empowers state and society, not just the Saleh regime. This vision cannot be made in the USA. Yemen's neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, along with the League of Arab States, should take the lead in finding solutions to Yemen's political and tribal divisions and providing the means to prevent Yemen from becoming a failed state. More than any other country, Saudi Arabia has more to lose by the breakdown of its next-door neighbor. The United States and Great Britain should provide leadership and assistance in shepherding the reconstruction process through and ensuring that inclusive governance, transparency, and accountability are adhered to. A good start is British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's call for a high-level international meeting this month to discuss ways of combating al Qaeda influence in Yemen. But the most effective means to combat al Qaeda is to to tackle Yemen's structural social and political crisis and to fully involve Yemen's Arab neighbors in the talks.

"(CNN) -- While Sen. Barack Obama has campaigned on a message of hope, his wife, Michelle, has talked about the realities of American life -- the gaps between rich and poor, black and white. Sen. Barack Obama has spoken out against criticism of his wife, Michelle. She's publicly criticized the United States as ""guided by fear"" and ""just downright mean."" The woman known as ""the rock"" in the Obama family will now appear before the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on Monday  -- and before the world -- with a clear message: ""One Nation."" But will Michelle Obama -- who could be the nation's first African-American first lady -- carry a theme of unity in light of controversial comments she's made on the campaign trail that resulted in speculation about her patriotism? Aides in the Obama campaign say she's already honing her message for the fall. ""Michelle wrote her own stump [speech]. And you know, she's refining it now, I think, as we're going into the general election,"" said Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser. ""We have an opportunity for her to kind of step back and think about the message she wants to deliver. So she's really working on it as we speak."" Her new speeches will include more details about her family and humble upbringing on Chicago's South Side, aides say. Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, 44, was born in Chicago, Illinois. She attended Princeton University and then went on to Harvard Law School. She later became a vice president at the University of Chicago and landed a job as a health care executive making $275,000 a year. Barack, Michelle and their two daughters Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, live on the South Side of Chicago. But along with her success has come criticism. Robin Givhan, fashion editor with The Washington Post, told CNN that people see Michelle Obama in different ways. ""Some people will see confidence, and others might see cockiness. I think some people will see strength. Others might see arrogance,"" she said. ""She comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with."" Behind the scenes, she maintains that independence. But with the election just months away, the potential first lady is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level. In June, she made an appearance as a guest co-host on ABC's ""The View,"" and later, she and her husband graced the cover of Us Weekly. The magazine, headlined ""Michelle Obama: Why Barack Loves Her,"" included details about her love for Target, ""Sex and the City"" and her daughters' recitals. Asked on ""The View"" if she's going through a makeover, she said she realizes that ""I wear my heart on my sleeve"" and that ""it's a risk you have to take."" She said she thinks people will change their perception of her as they see her family more. Carl Sferrazza Anthony, a first ladies historian, told CNN that it's important for Michelle Obama to define herself before others define her. ""One comment made off-hand ... might be easily misinterpreted by the opposition,"" he said in June. Michelle Obama saw that in February when a Tennessee Republican ad used a snippet from a campaign event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There, while referring to record voter turnout in the Democratic primaries, she said, ""for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country."" The Obama campaign called the ad ""shameful,"" and it was condemned by the state's two Republican U.S. senators. But the ad's message caught on in conservative blogs -- and later forced Michelle Obama to clarify her remarks. ""What I was clearly talking about is that I am proud in how Americans are engaging in the political process,"" she responded. ""I mean, everyone has said what I said, in that we haven't seen these record numbers of turnouts, people who are paying attention, going to rallies, watching debates."" Cindy McCain, the wife of Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also took a shot at Michelle Obama at the time, saying, ""I am proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier. I am very proud of my country."" More recently, controversy erupted over a July 13 New Yorker magazine cover showing Barack Obama in the Oval Office dressed in traditional Muslim attire, and Michelle Obama with an Afro hairstyle and a machine gun slung over her back. An American flag can be seen burning in the fireplace, and a picture of Osama bin Laden hangs on the wall. Shortly after the magazine was published, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton called the cover ""tasteless and offensive."" John McCain later said it was ""totally inappropriate."" But the overall issue of Michelle Obama as a potential liability has made headlines on both coasts -- with articles in both The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times in early June. The newspapers pointed to relentless online rumor mills, criticism on conservative blogs and articles in conservative magazines, like the National Review, critical of Michelle Obama. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote in June that the backlash against Michelle Obama was a ""good preview of how Republicans will attack Michelle, suggesting that she does not share American values, mining a subtext of race."" Conservatives view the presumptive Democratic nominee's wife as a target of opportunity. But one Republican consultant has said attacks on candidates' wives often backfire. ""Considering there are so many issues -- legitimate issues -- that you can use on Barack Obama, to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidity of the highest level,"" Stephen Marks, a Republican strategist, told CNN in June. ""Mr. Obama is going to come to his wife's defense, and it's going to humanize both of them."" Republican strategists say the wife of the Democratic presidential nominee is fair game. ""There is less information about him to temper her comments against, so what she says represents something a lot more important than perhaps other candidates in the past who have had a longer track record,"" Rachel Marsden, a Republican strategist, also told CNN. The potential first lady, however, appears to be bracing for what may lie ahead. ""We're trusting that the American voters are ready to talk about the issues and not talking about things that have nothing to do with making people's lives better,"" Michelle Obama told ABC News during a joint interview in May. But Barack Obama quickly added, ""I also think these folks should lay off my wife."" CNN's Randi Kaye and Jonathan Mann contributed to this report.","Michelle Obama to deliver ""One Nation"" speech at Democratic convention Monday .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 1,000 people, mostly members of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, have died this year while in Nigerian custody, Amnesty International said in a report. Nigerian officials strongly denied the accusations in the report, which was released Tuesday. According to Amnesty, the human rights group has received credible information about deplorable conditions in detention centers, where prisoners are said to die daily. The report focuses on three detention centers where suspected militants are sent. Overcrowding results in suffocation and starvation, Amnesty said. Others have died after suffering beatings or being shot and left to bleed to death, according to former detainees interviewed by the group. Nigerian officials dismissed the report as a fabrication. ""There is no way our government officials will take the lives of others,"" Interior Minister Abba Moro told CNN. The facilities in question are run by Nigeria's Joint Task Force. ""These claims are false,"" said Eli Lazarus, spokesman for the task force. ""We will conduct a thorough investigation if necessary and release a statement."" Amnesty called on the government to conduct an investigation ""as a matter of urgency."" The two facilities were a majority of the deaths are said to have happened are the Giwa military barracks in Borno state and two centers known as Sector Alpha and Presidential Lodge in Yobe state. Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in the nation for years. The militant group has attacked various targets in the nation since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches.","Nearly 1,000 people have died in detention this year, Amnesty International says .

"(CNN) -- For some Republicans, 2016 is 1992: Hating Hillary Clinton is chic again. Only more so, since the former secretary of state is also the partner of and potential successor to the last two Democratic presidentsâ€”Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Some of us believe, with good reasons, that the Republicans are ""mad-dogging"" Hillary Clinton with the Benghazi hearing to damage not only her presidential prospects, but also to damage President Obama's credibility. Polls show Obama is trusted more than his Washington opponents, especially on the economy. So, to defeat his economic agenda and substitute their own, which has already lost on logic, they've decided to undermine Obama's credibility and authority. The Benghazi hearing, which House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, orchestrated and  planned for months, is a classic ""killing two birds with one stone"" scenario for Republicans. Or maybe three: They see an opportunity to smear Obama, sabotage Clinton and fundraise like giddy televangelists. Benghazi hearing chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said Clinton is not a target of his committee. That doesn't seem to jibe with statements by GOP Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among others. And further contradicting Issa's protestation, the National Republican Congressional Committee was boasting that its Clinton/Benghazi fundraising page was the most successful in its history. Benghazi is a rather unseemly subject to turn into a political weapon. It's one thing to try to drag the former secretary of state through the mud. But the Republicans are trying to drag her through blood -- blood that's tainted with partisan politics. The Republicans cut the funding for embassy security by $128 million in 2011 and $331 million in 2012. Clinton warned that doing so would be ""detrimental to national security."" Republicans scoffed then, scream now. Obama called the Benghazi hearing a circus. He's right. It's not a transparent, due process hearing. Democrats have complained they were excluded from much of the investigations, weren't allowed to call witnesses or to look at documents. As Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Wednesday after the White House's release of approximately 100 pages of e-mails relating to the attacks in Benghazi: ""These documents undercut the reckless accusations by Republicans that the White House scrubbed the Benghazi talking points for political reasons and in fact show just the oppositeâ€”that the primary goal was to protect the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation's intelligence operations."" Chaffetz: Obama has explaining to do on Benghazi . A transparent, due-process hearing would call the witnesses who would testify that the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli mistakenly believed Katibat Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi had claimed credit for the attack. The group didn't make the claim and later denied any role. But that was an on-the-ground, in-the-moment embassy mistake. (While no friend of the United States, the Benghazi al-Sharia organization has not, so far, been implicated in terrorist activity.) It came from mistaken identity: There were two distinct and unrelated Ansar al-Sharia militant groups in Libya. Even Fox News interviewed an expert, J. Peter Pham of the Atlantic Council, who said these groups have no formal affiliation with each other. They are grass-roots up organizations, whereas al Qaeda organizes from the top down. It is suspected that the Ansar al-Sharia in Derna was involved in the attack in Benghazi that killed four Americans. Its leader is a former prisoner at Guantanamo who was released under the Bush administration and deported to Libya for jail. Gadhafi later released him. In a transparent hearing we would learn that the Republicans' chief witness, Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory Hicks, was likely, even today, in error about which Ansar al-Sharia was involved. It is the difference between a local militant militia group and professional terrorists. Hicks clearly was referring to the Benghazi al Sharia when he testified about his concern that Ambassador Chris Stevens was taken to the hospital that the Benghazi group then guarded. But, this week the same hospital was bombed; the rival al-Shaira group in Derna, with al Qaeda links, is a reasonable suspect. Getting the facts right matters. Getting the truth matters. Posturing for propaganda points not only misleads us, it endangers us. For whatever the Benghazi hearings are about, they're not about learning the lessons from this tragedy and improving securities at American embassies and other facilities overseas. They are, in fact, a partisan campaign fundraiser for the Republican Party, and not a fact-finding inquiry to help the State Department and military correct their mistakes. Karl Rove's American Crossroads super PAC has already taken on Hillary Clinton, spending megabucks on a 2016 attack ad that savages her judgments. Some Republicans, to their credit, can't stomach any more from their fellow Republicans. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, a Republican, appeared on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" and said he would have handled Benghazi just as Obama handled it. He added a flat, ""No"" that he did not think Hillary Clinton would be involved in any kind of a cover-up. Bill Kristol, conservative editor and commentator, told Fox News Sunday, ""I wish the Republicans would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan Republican groups that are fundraising off this would be quiet ... for a while ... and let's find out what really happened."" Amen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Benghazi hearings aimed at hurting Clinton prospects for 2016 .
She says hearings cooked up by Boehner. GOP says not aimed at Clinton, but statements belie this .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama does not foresee a scenario of ""American boots on the ground in Syria,"" telling reporters Friday that it would not be good for the United States or for that county. ""As a general rule, I don't rule things out as commander-in-chief, because circumstances change,"" Obama said during a joint news conference with President Laura Chinchilla of Costa Rica, where the president stopped during a three-day visit to the region. ""Having said that, I do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in Syria, American boots on the ground in Syria, would be good for America or be good for Syria."" Obama said he has consulted with leaders in the region who want to see stability return to Syria, and ""they agree with that assessment."" Even so, the president said that if the United States confirms the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government against its people, ""that's a game changer for us."" He did not elaborate on what steps would be taken, repeating as he has said previously that the United States would wait until it has more details of evidence of chemical weapons use in Syria before making any decision on whether to alter strategy. ""We have evidence that chemical weapons have been used. We don't know when, where or how they were used,"" Obama said. Obama's assessment was supported by Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States. ""This was a military assessment of intelligence; like all intelligence assessments, there's no absolute certitude,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Friday. ""Our assessment was confirmed by British, French and American sources. But it's true that the usage of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime or anybody in Syria is being closely monitored by our intelligence agency and continues to be discussed at the highest levels between the Israeli and U.S. governments."" But in recent days, the Pentagon has stepped up planning for potential military intervention in Syria, which would most likely include the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles, two administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter told CNN. For now, Obama said, the United States is continuing its investigation, and working with its Middle East and European allies. The president's comments follow a number of claims in recent weeks that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against its people in a more than two-year civil war. The United Nations estimates some 70,000 people have died in the fighting. Syria had denied the use of chemical weapons, accusing the United States of manipulating evidence to pressure President Bashar al-Assad to step down. Obama has been under fire by some in the United States, including Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, for not taking a tougher stance with Syria. The president said the United States is ""not waiting."" ""We are not standing by,"" he said, adding that the United States has been the largest contributor of humanitarian aid and nonlethal aid to the opposition. ""We are actively engaged on a day-to-day basis to deal with this crisis to restore a Syria that is respectful of the rights and aspirations of the Syrian people."" In addition to Syria's possible use of chemical weapons against rebels, another concern is that parts of the government's stockpile of chemical weapons -- which analysts believe is one of the world's largest and includes sarin, mustard and VX gases -- could end up, if they haven't already, in others' hands. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","""As a general rule, I don't rule things out as commander-in-chief,"" president says .

"(EW.com ) -- On Saturday, the Internet lit up with the breathless all-caps news that Charlie Hunnam would no longer be playing the dashing if psychologically damaged billionaire Christian Grey in the big-screen adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Some of best-selling author E L James' readers were ecstatic, as it meant their dream casting for fan favorites like Matt Bomer or Ian Somerhalder might have life yet. But it was a gut punch to Universal/Focus, which is scrambling to recast a beloved role and still keep to their mid-November production start. In the official studio statement, blame was placed on Hunnam's ""immersive TV schedule, which is not allowing him time to adequately prepare."" This sounds dubious though, as his FX drama ""Sons of Anarchy"" was always scheduled to wrap production on its sixth season on Oct. 22. One source close to the actor says Hunnam had serious reservations about the script, a possibility made more interesting by the recent news that the studio had brought on Notes on a Scandal writer (and friend to director Sam Taylor-Johnson) Patrick Marbe to give the ""Fifty Shades"" script a polish. We're also hearing that Hunnam just second-guessed his willingness to bear the weight of such a popular franchise and accept the tidal wave of fame it would surely bring. (His reps didn't return requests for comment.) For now, the November production date stands, so an announcement must be imminent. Until then, the wait for fans is sweet torture.

"(CNN) -- A potential deal that would reopen the federal government and stave off the prospect of a U.S. debt default appears to barely touch the core of Obamacare, the health insurance program congressional Republicans set out to cripple. Although the terms of a deal that would end a two-week partial shutdown of federal offices and raise the government's legal borrowing limit weren't final Tuesday, Democratic sources told CNN one possible change being weighed by Senate leaders could delay a fee on employers, unions and other health-plan sponsors that compensate insurance companies for taking on high-risk customers in the first year of the program set up under the Affordable Care Act. Another could strengthen verification measures for people seeking federal subsidies to help them purchase health insurance required by the law. Both of those are far short of the target set by conservative Republicans in the House of Representatives, who hoped to wipe out funding for Obamacare, as the program has become known. ""This doesn't, frankly, do a whole lot to Obamacare,"" said Lawrence Jacobs, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for the Study of Politics and Governance. The computerized insurance exchanges at the heart of the program have had a rocky rollout since they went live on October 1, and there are some provisions that could stand to be fixed, Jacobs said. But he said those issues are being ""overwhelmed"" in the GOP push to eliminate it. How many have signed up for health care? Well, it depends . Getting rid of the $63 a head high-risk charge, known as the transitional reinsurance fee, is a proposal ""that would deserve serious attention"" in other circumstances, said Jacobs, co-author of a 2010 book on the politics of health care. States like Minnesota, which already has the largest catastrophic reinsurance program, are effectively double-taxed by the proposal. Getting rid of it would mean the costs would be passed along to insurers and consumers, he said. ""There are no states that are happy with it,"" he said. But he said the fee is ""more of a techie issue, to be honest. I'm surprised it's on people's radar."" Meanwhile, calling for tougher verification rules ""is a little confusing,"" Jacobs said. ""The IRS has been working pretty hard on this, and with all the problems that the federal exchanges had in launching, this was not one of them,"" he said. ""That part of the process seems to be working pretty well, so I think this is more of a political thing in adding another level of protection, or red tape. I think from a policy perspective, the question is, what needed fixing?"" In the House, a Republican counterproposal floated Tuesday morning would have suspended a tax on medical devices for two years and removed federal health care subsidies for legislators and top Obama administration officials. But the medical device tax provision had been dumped by Tuesday afternoon, House GOP sources said. That levy is projected to raise about $29 billion over 10 years to subsidize health insurance programs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Jacobs said getting rid of it would leave a ""crater"" in the program's finances and create ""a kind of avalanche"" as other health-care industries -- hospitals, drug manufacturers and insurers -- lined up for a similar reprieve. ""I don't think there are too many folks volunteering for that tour,"" he said. If there's a deal, what next? The latest developments come less than two days before the United States bumps up against its statutory debt ceiling, raising the risk that Washington would be short of funds to pay all of its bills in full and on time. And it comes on the 15th day of the partial government shutdown that has idled more than 800,000 federal workers and cost the economy an estimated $20 billion to date. The shutdown began after House Republicans passed a temporary spending bill that would have eliminated funding for Obamacare -- a bill swiftly rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate. President Barack Obama has insisted that Congress fund government operations and raise the debt ceiling without any ""ransom,"" and polls show public opinion turning sharply against the GOP as the standoff drags on. Republican leaders began to look for other concessions from Democrats and the administration last week, and some -- particularly in the Senate -- have begun to criticize the colleagues who led them into the impasse. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, told CNN's New Day that Republicans have now wasted weeks ""focused on something that was never going to happen."" ""To be candidly candid, it's an embarrassment to me that we have spent all this time on a rabbit trail, leading us to where we are,"" Corker said. But Rep. Ted Yoho, a tea party-backed Florida congressman, told CNN's The Lead that he and many of his fellow House Republicans would be letting down their constituents if they didn't keep battling the Affordable Care Act. ""I'm a member of the House. It's a house of the people. We're the voice of the people,"" said Yoho, who has also downplayed the potential impact of a government default. ""I ran on defunding, burying and getting rid of Obamacare ... a lot of the members of our house, of our conference, ran on the same thing. So for us not to speak up is not to speak up for the American people."" Hope for a smoother ride on Healthcare.gov .

"(CNN) -- A computer failure temporarily halted the processing of food stamp purchases in parts of the country Saturday. A system shutdown began at 11 a.m. ET Saturday and affected 17 states, said a spokeswoman for Xerox -- which is a contractor for the program. By Saturday night, the issue had been resolved. ""We realize that access to these benefits is important to families in the states we serve,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Wasmer. ""We continue to investigate the cause of the issue so we can take steps to ensure a similar interruption does not re-occur."" The food stamp program, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, allows many beneficiaries to present a payment card at grocery stores. Some of those transactions were being prevented Saturday in unspecified parts of the country. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture. The department's public affairs staff has been furloughed and its website was not being updated Saturday because of the partial government shutdown. A phone call to the office of the department's communication director was not answered. Officials in several states said the computer problem was unrelated to the government shutdown. CNN affiliate KJRH-TV in Tulsa, Oklahoma, quoted Wasmer as saying the shutdown happened during a test of the company's backup systems. She said the glitch also affected payments through the Women Infants and Children, or WIC, program.

It's the first book in the Harry Potter series and was published in the United States under the title ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" The auction had estimated that the 223-page book would sell for as much as $12,000. The winning bid of $19,120 bypassed expectations, but it was not the most expensive sale of Harry Potter-related items in an auction.

"(CNN) -- A man committed an error when he tried to carjack the mother of baseball Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr., Maryland authorities said Tuesday. Violet Ripken was at a bank parking lot in Aberdeen when the suspect, armed with a handgun, demanded her car. Ripken pressed the panic button on her key ring, setting off the car's alarm and scaring the man away, the Aberdeen Police said in a written statement. Ripken was not hurt, they said. Police got a picture of the man from an ATM and tracked him down two hours later. He has yet to be charged, authorities said. They didn't release his identity. It's not the first time Ripken has dealt with someone who threatened her with a handgun. She was abducted at gunpoint the morning of July 24, 2012, from her Aberdeen home. Her disappearance triggered a massive police manhunt and led to national media attention. Police said at the time that a man with a gun showed up at her home, forced her into her car and drove off. She was held captive for nearly 24 hours before being found the next morning in the back seat of her car near her home. Ripken's hands were bound, but she was otherwise unharmed, police said. A spokesman for the Aberdeen police said it appeared the attempted carjacking was random. Lt. Fred Budnick said there was no indication Tuesday's crime was related to the abduction. One of Ripken's sons is Cal Ripken Jr., who set the major league record for most consecutive games played with 2,632. He was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame in 2007. He has offered a $100,000 reward for the abduction case, which remains unsolved. He is now a broadcaster for TBS, which like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.

"(CNN) -- In the last 30-plus years, Bob Pittman has helped found MTV, became a successful producer, headed Time Warner's Six Flags theme parks division, ran the Century 21 real estate company, took over AOL in its formative years and was chief operating officer of the merged AOL Time Warner. Now he's getting back to his roots: radio. Three years after making an investment in the sometimes maligned Clear Channel, the largest radio company in the United States, he's the CEO. In a phone interview with CNN, his Mississippi twang contrasting with his rapid-fire delivery, Pittman talked about why he got back into radio, his responses to criticism of Clear Channel and lessons he's learned during his career, which started at a radio station in Brookhaven, Mississippi, when Pittman was 15. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview: . CNN: Why do this? Bob Pittman: As I began looking at the company a couple years ago, I was stunned to find the real facts. By reading the press, I thought that radio was somehow in trouble and was following the path of television and having all sorts of fragmentation problems, and nothing could be further from the truth. It's been remarkably stable. And when I looked at technology, I looked at it as an opportunity, not a risk. CNN: In recent years, with voice-tracking and consolidation of personnel, Clear Channel has seemed to become less local. Do you want to bring it back to its local base? Pittman: I think it is still local, and I think people have misinterpreted what we're doing if people think we're making things less local. We're still providing the news and the weather and the emergency services and local contests, local promotions, etc. What we're able to do now is we're able to tap into a lot of talent we've got nationally. We have the ability for the person from a remote studio to still talk about the town, and we have local people in the town who are directing the person as to what's important and developing those local relationships. Local is still paramount to us and very important to making a radio station a radio station. CNN: There were cutbacks over Thanksgiving. How does that fit in with the overall plan? Pittman: Actually, our head count has not gone down as a company. We're constantly rebalancing. Technology has changed the way we work and where we need our people. We've built an entire national advertising sales and marketing and partnership group. We've added technology groups, an entire digital group. The way we're doing business today is trying to reflect the way people are living. It's one of the problems with any company started after the Internet -- you really have to go in and adjust it to new technology. CNN: There are all kinds of other technologies jockeying with radio. How do you compete against them? Pittman: We don't compete with that. I think again you've got to go back and look at what radio is. Radio is very different from someone's music collection, and the two have always co-existed very well together. Your music collection is really where you curate music exactly for you at that moment you're living, and you don't want any interruptions. Radio is actually the exact opposite. Yes, we play music, (but) turning on the radio is like walking into your favorite bar where everybody knows you and you know them, and you say, ""What's up?"" So we tell you about new music, we play new music, we've got gossip, we've got call-ins, we've got listeners on the air, we've got contests, we've got jokes. You hit your favorite personality who is really like your best friend. People have always had music collections (and) always had radio. That hasn't changed. CNN: How does (Clear Channel's website) IHeartRadio fit in? Pittman: What we want is to find more listening occasions. About 30% of the listening to stations on IHeartRadio is done to stations outside their markets. If you're sitting in Brookhaven, Mississippi, and you want to find out what's going on in New York, you might tune in to Z100, the same way when I was a kid growing up in Brookhaven, Mississippi, I listened to WLS in Chicago because I was fascinated to listen to a slice of the big city. In addition to that, we do the custom radio stations, like a Pandora -- a playlist creator -- and Perfect Four, playlists created for certain activities. We also have Facebook deeply embedded in IHeartRadio, which allows people to share what they're doing, so it becomes a social experience as well. In terms of the digital revolution we're way behind, but we do think it's a terrific opportunity for us. CNN: What are the positives and negatives about being the 800-pound gorilla? Pittman: We're No. 1 in all media. Just our radio (stations) reach 239 million people a month. But when people call you an evil empire, what they're saying is, you're not doing anything new and exciting. And I think the opposite side of having a big platform to play with is you can do great stuff. We try to be very attuned to what's important to our listeners, and we have an obligation to help our listeners and help our communities. And we view part of our job is to connect the music to the fans. That's what radio does. CNN: What are some of the lessons you've learned in your career? Pittman: The good news is I've been in a lot of different industries. I spent many years in the Internet business, I was there at the birth of the national cable networks, I've been an advertiser. (The late Time Warner chief) Steve Ross taught me to take chances -- don't ever think you've arrived. (Entrepreneur) Henry Silverman gave me great lessons about controlling costs and making sure you're really getting a return on your money. We funded our digital growth and these great initiatives by getting rid of some things that were legacy that weren't applicable to operations today. It's constantly being in touch both with the consumer and being realistic as to where technology is today and where we need to be allocating our resources.","Bob Pittman is CEO of Clear Channel, nation's largest radio company .

"(CNN) -- The Washington Monument towers above the National Mall in Washington, directly between the U.S. Capitol to the east and the Lincoln Memorial to the west. But Apple seems to think it lies several hundred yards to the south, near the Potomac River. The mistake appears to be one of many in Apple's new mobile maps, which replaced Google Maps as the default map application in iOS 6, the new operating system for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches. Apple has faced a chorus of complaints since iOS 6 was made available for download Wednesday, and the griping will likely grow louder as people get their hands Friday on new iPhone 5s. 5 big changes in iOS 6 . ""What Apple has done with #iOS6 maps is like planning a mission to outer space and NOT TALKING TO NASA,"" tweeted tech-loving comedian Baratunde Thurston, a former digital director for The Onion. Apple announced earlier this year it was replacing its mobile map software from Google with a new Apple-designed system. All iPhone and iPad users are now forced to use the new map system when they update their software or buy the iPhone 5, which will come pre-loaded with the maps. But within minutes of the new software launch on Wednesday, iPhone users began to point out that a number of landmarks had been misplaced on Apple maps, incorrectly named and lost entirely. Screenshots posted online appear to show a museum located underneath a river, while the map service seems to deny the existence of the English town Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare was born. Other users say a search for London directed them to London, Ontario, in Canada, instead of the British capital. Many customers say they are upset that Apple has removed mentions of public transportation routes or stations from its new map service, a popular feature on the Google system which allowed users to see bus and train schedules at individual stations. Ireland's Minister for Justice expressed concern that the new Apple maps identify a working farm in a residential area of suburban Dublin as an airport, a potential hazard for pilots. The Apple's maps have already inspired a Tumblr feed, the ironically named ""The Amazing iOS 6 Maps,"" filled with examples of mangled mapping. And some Twitter users pointed out the irony in that the new map system was unable to pinpoint an Apple store in Sydney, Australia, which it placed on the wrong side of the road. Tech blogger and entrepreneur Anil Dash was especially critical of the new maps, which he called ""pretty but dumb,"" and of Apple for releasing what he said was a flawed product. ""Apple made this maps change despite its shortcomings because they put their own priorities for corporate strategy ahead of user experience,"" he wrote. ""That's a huge change for Apple in the post-iPod era, where they've built so much of their value by doing the hard work as a company so that things could be easy for users."" iPhone 5: The wait is over . Apple is preaching patience. Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told CNN, ""Customers around the world are upgrading to iOS 6 with over 200 new features including Apple Maps, our first map service. We are excited to offer this service with innovative new features like Flyover and Siri integration, and free turn by turn navigation. We launched this new map service knowing that it is a major initiative and we are just getting started with it. We are continuously improving it, and as Maps is a cloud-based solution, the more people use it, the better it will get. We're also working with developers to integrate some of the amazing transit apps in the App Store into iOS Maps. We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better."" Some tech bloggers on Thursday were advising owners of older iPhones not to upgrade to iOS 6 because of the maps. Meanwhile, Dutch satellite navigation company TomTom, which provided the data for the new map system, told CNN it is not responsible for the way the maps work. The poor reception for Apple's maps don't appear to have dented the popularity of the iPhone 5, however. Apple announced on Monday that pre-orders of the phone topped 2 million in just 24 hours and that its initial supply batch for the phone sold out in just an hour. iReport One-day mobile photo challenge .","Users complain about Apple's new maps feature for iPhones and iPads .

"(CNN) -- Ever wanted your own dinosaur? A rare Diplodocus longus perhaps? Answers to the name ""Misty?"" Well, here's your chance to add some prehistoric chic to your urban warehouse conversion. Forget feature wall, think feature fossil -- and a 17-meter long one, at that. Late Jurassic (150 million years ago, or so), is the new mid-century vintage, you know. ""Misty"" is the first complete skeleton of a large dinosaur to come up for sale at auction in Europe, but she hails from the U.S. state of Wyoming. The dinosaur appears alongside items including Dodo bones, a fossilized Ichthyosaurus (Ichthyosaurus communis) from southern England's Jurassic coast, and taxidermy and antique and modern artworks on a natural history theme in the ""Evolution"" sale at Summers Place Auctions in Billingshurst, southern England. Author and painter Errol Fuller, who is curating the exhibition and sale, says Misty was found in 2009 by the then 11 and 14-year-old sons of paleontologist Raimund Albersdoerfer. Dinosaur hunter Albersdoerfer had been excavating the fossil hotspot Dana Quarry in Wyoming, and sent his sons, Benjamin and Jacob, to a nearby area to dig around. ""He directed them to this area -- just very close to, but not actually in the quarry --where he thought there might be some very worthless fragments and they came back at the end of the day and said they'd found an enormous bone,"" Fuller said. ""They quickly realized that there was going to be many other bones... so they stopped work on the proper quarry."" It took Albersdoerfer's team nine weeks to dig out the female Diplodocus longus skeleton. She was named Misty, Fuller said, after the site itself was branded the ""mysterious quarry"" because it had gone from being an area of which not much had been expected to one of great potential. While restrictions are placed on fossils found on U.S. government land, Fuller said Misty had been discovered on private property. ""It's perfectly legal to bring it from America and legal to move it to any country in the world,"" he said. ""Museum workers will sometimes try to stop these things... but almost every great fossil discovery was made by fossil collectors or dealers."" Backhoe cuts into dinosaur's tail, revealing rare fossil find . Fuller estimated that there could be about half a dozen Diplodocus longus skeletons -- and several plaster casts of them -- in museums across the globe. Misty, he said ""looks just like the one in [London's] Natural History Museum -- except that one is a plaster cast."" So how would one display a dinosaur skeleton in one's warehouse, for example? Fuller said Misty's bones had been conserved and consolidated and she would be relatively robust as long as the skeleton was ""reasonably carefully handled and reasonably carefully housed."" It would take two or three people about a day to take it down and another to put it up again and Summers Place could arrange supervision of this, Fuller said. ""It's been specially designed so that it can be dissembled and assembled again,"" he said. ""There's no piece so heavy that two people couldn't lift it."" That said, Misty in her entirety is ""colossal,"" Fuller says. Her bones are secured to a metal armature, which can be taken apart and bolted together again. Designing it, he said, would have been ""a conceptual puzzle"" because the skeleton couldn't be arranged without the armature and it was hard to design the armature without knowing the exact size it needed to be. The result, Fuller said, is ""a feat of engineering. It's maybe 60ft long by 12ft high and a colossal weight. There are quite a lot of safety considerations because you don't want pieces falling off."" Summers Place has put an estimate of £400,000 to £600,000 ($640,000 to 960,000) on Misty. Fuller musingly compared the fossil to a Ferrari that sold for almost £18 million ($27 million) in August. Read more: Ferrari sells for record $27.5 million . ""If I was a rich man, I could actually have a fossil dinosaur... that would impress my friends much more than a Ferrari and it would cost me just a fraction of £18 million,"" he said. ""That is really incredibly cheap if you compare it with a collector's car and you've got a much more spectacular, gob-smacking exhibition."" Talk about overtaking the neighbors. Evolution will open for viewing on November 23, ahead of the November 27 auction.","Diplodocus longus dinosaurs are believed to have roamed Earth 150 million years ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lone individuals are the most likely to launch attacks in the United States following the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to a joint Department of Homeland Security/FBI bulletin sent to state and local law enforcement. The advisory says lone offenders who share al Qaeda's ideology are the greatest near-term threat because they are ""unburdened by organizational constraints that can slow operational decisions by established terrorist groups."" Individuals could try to attack low-security targets using simple improvised explosive devices or small arms, the message said. However, the May 9 advisory obtained by CNN notes that federal law enforcement officials have ""no credible information to suggest that a specifically targeted plot is underway."" The document cited the vow in the al Qaeda statement confirming the death of bin Laden which said ""the soldiers of Islam"" would continue to plan attacks. The advisory also says over the past year, Inspire magazine -- published in English by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- and various jihadi spokesmen have said attacks by individuals ""can have a significant impact."" The notice mentions several attacks involving a single perpetrator, including the November 2009 Fort Hood attack that left 13 people dead. Army Major Nidal Hasan is accused in that shooting. Law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned that plots by lone wolves are the most difficult to detect and disrupt. But the DHS/FBI bulletin urges state and local law enforcement officials to be on the lookout for suspicious activity.","Plots by 'lone wolves' are difficult to detect and disrupt, officials say .

"(EW.com) -- How do you make a movie that tackles pornography not just as an ''issue'' or a product but in terms of its psychological effects? Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the writer, director, and star of ""Don Jon,"" has done it. And he's pulled it off in a light, fun, unlaborious way: by crafting a high-spirited yet dirty-minded romantic comedy about a New Jersey bartender, Jon Martello (Gordon-Levitt), who goes out to clubs and gets laid every weekend, usually with the curvaceous babe of his choice. She can never be the woman of his dreams, though, because those dreams have already been lost to the hardcore photographs and videos that he masturbates to every day. It's not really the faces and bodies he's coveting, it's the behavior â€” the moaning, screaming, make me your nasty toy insatiability, which he thinks is what sex was meant to be. He doesn't realize that he's watching a bill of goods made flesh. As Jon, Gordon-Levitt sports a buffed-up chest and hair greased into a stylish oil slick, and he speaks in low, flat tones, giving a witty turn as a studly ''Guido'' who digs his life of anonymous sex and control; he's like The Situation without the fame or preening smarm. One night out at the club with his wingmen Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke), Jon spies Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), as gorgeous a woman as he's ever seen. He wants to get with her, and before long they're an item. But then the disappointment sets in. In his mind, his heart, she can't compete with the extreme libidos of the porn world. It doesn't help that she's an ''addict'' too, hooked on rom-coms and their fantasy of a man who'll cater to her every whim. Gordon-Levitt proves a natural filmmaker, nimbly staging Jon's highly amusing Catholic confessions, along with porn montages that mimic the dopamine-charged editing of ""Requiem for a Dream."" He also gets a terrific performance out of Tony Danza as Jon's hilariously blinkered brute of a dad. The bond between Jon and Esther (Julianne Moore), the troubled older woman he meets in an adult-ed class, isn't as deftly drawn. She's there to teach Jon lessons, and does. But Gordon-Levitt's intuitive performance makes even this part of the film work. Jon is a guy who needs to quit his porn addiction, but to do that, he must understand that what he's really been having is a dysfunctional relationship with porn. It's the mistress he's devoted to and has to break up with if he wants to start living. Grade: B+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Suzann Pettersen denied 16-year-old amateur Lydia Ko a fairtytale first major triumph as the Norwegian took the Evian Championship in France Sunday. The 32-year-old Norwegian carded a final round 68 to hold off Ko in the fifth and final major of the women's season. The tournament -- which was awarded major status for the first time this year -- had been reduced to 54 holes due to inclement weather conditions. Pettersen's 10-under-par total of 203 left her two shots clear of New Zealand's Ko, who was born in South Korea. Ko, a prodigious teenage talent, has already accumulated four wins on the professional LPGA Tour, but could not match her more experienced rival on the final day, carding a one-under 70. As overnight leader Mika Miyazato of Japan fell away to a 79, Ko hit the front with a birdie at the first hole. But Pettersen, one of the stars of Europe's Solheim Cup win last month, went ahead with a birdie at the eighth. She had a brief scare when finding the trees on the par four 17th but recovered to wrap up her second career major crown. ""It's great to win another major and this one has definitely been well worth waiting for,"" Pettersen said. Ko, who broke records when she won the Canadian Open last year at 15 years and four months, refused to be downhearted. ""It has been a great week,"" she said. ""I didn't take all my chances but Suzann played really well."" Another talented teen, American Lexi Thompson, carded a final round 68 to claim third place on six under. But World No.1 Park Inbee of South Korea, was never in serious contention as she strove to become the first player to win four majors in a season. Park, who won the first three majors of the season, finished tied 67th on eight over. On the men's European Tour, home player Joost Luiten captured the Dutch Open at Zandvoort after a playoff with evergreen Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez. It was Luiten's second win of the season and came after he tied with Jimenez on 12-under in regulation play. He only needed to two putt for a par at the first extra hole to seal an emotional triumph as 49-year-old Jimenez overhit his birdie attempt and missed the six-foot return. ""Winning your home Open is like winning a major and this is how this win feels,"" said the 27-year-old Luiten . ""I went close a few years ago in but to win now feels just unbelievable and I think it won't be later tonight when it all sinks in.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Politics is full of second chances. Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford -- now U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford -- is living proof. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption. And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list, as he embarks on a similar journey. In this age of lighting fast news cycles and fleeting memories, are disgraced politicians sitting in the penalty box for a shorter time before launching a comeback? A Republican political strategist thinks it reflects a lower opinion of politicians. ""The required waiting time has been greatly condensed in recent years, indicating present voters are holding elected officials to a much lower standard then previous generations,"" said John Brabender, a longtime top political adviser to 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum. Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, launched a petition campaign Monday to become New York City comptroller. ""I made significant errors. I stood up, accepted responsibility, resigned. It's now been five years, I hope the public will extend its forgiveness to me,"" the Democrat said Monday morning on radio's ""The Bill Press Show."" ""I think it is a land of forgiveness, of people in their natural goodness (who) understand the fact that...we sin, we pay a price and hopefully continue,"" added Spitzer, who served two terms as New York State attorney general before winning election as governor in 2006. Spitzer, who needs to gather the 3,750 signatures by Thursday to get into the September primary ballot, would be on the same Democratic ballot as Weiner, who is running for mayor and would have the quickest redemption. Opinion: Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace . Weiner would have the shortest time in time-out should he be elected. He was in his seventh term in Congress, representing parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, when he resigned from the House in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via Twitter. He talked about getting another chance in the video announcing his candidacy, saying, ""I made some big mistakes, and I know I let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons. I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."" Spitzer, who since stepping down has been a commentator for various news outlets including CNN, disagrees with the Weiner comparison, and said he's not on a quest for redemption, but instead stressed that he's motivated by what he said are personal pleas from New Yorkers urging him to get back into public service. ""If that's what I want, then I don't think this is the path to it. What I am seeking is service,"" he said on CBS ""This Morning."" Republican Sanford's political career appeared dead after he finished out his term amid repercussions of admitting to an extramarital affair in 2009. But he won redemption in a special election in May to fill a vacant congressional seat in the state's 1st Congressional District, which he represented before serving as governor. Opinion: New York's sex scandal candidates . The media loves a comeback story, if only because it allows them it an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place. And redemption stories resonate with the public. ""Voters love a good comeback story -- we identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves,"" said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""But voters also love justice. We want people to pay for their mistakes."" Share your views on Spitzer and Weiner . Brabender said votes have increasingly shown they are willing to forgive indiscretions. ""It all comes down to how well the scandal is handled, voters assessment of relevance to doing the job, and choosing the right time for re-entry into the political arena,"" he said. Spitzer to run against madam . Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala says faster news cycles and fleeting memories may be behind this year's trio of comeback bids, ""but it may also be a result of a very healthy American aversion to being too judgmental."" ""It used to be an iron law of politics that no divorced person could be president. Then Ronald Reagan proved that wrong,"" said Begala, who was a top political adviser to President Bill Clinton and a senior adviser last year to a super PAC that worked for President Barack Obama's re-election. ""Ultimately politics is about voters' lives, not politicians -- if voters think someone can make a difference in their life, they will overlook personal shortcomings,"" he added. ""But the key is not to make the campaign about the politician's need for redemption, but about voters' need for jobs."" CNN's Ashley Killough, Ed Payne and Adam Reiss contributed to this story .","Trio of disgraced politicians show that voters have gotten more forgiving .

"(CNN) -- One hot summer morning in Monrovia, Liberia, I came across a group of young men who had been snatched from their classrooms by paramilitary groups and turned into child soldiers. They had been drugged and forced to rape, torture and kill people. At the end of our talk, they said: ""We just want to go back to school."" The oldest was 16. Educating these youths meant more than imparting knowledge. Information alone wouldn't satisfy the thirst of these war victims-turned perpetrators. Their faith in education was immense. They thought it would bring meaning to their lives. They wanted to understand what humans are made of, they wanted ethics and wisdom and skills to master acceptance or apply compassion. In short, they wanted their dignity back. And besides crucial economic, peace and health factors, this is what education is all about. Education is the most efficient weapon with which to address the world's most pressing problems. And as a new analysis released by UNESCO's Education for All Global Monitoring Report Team demonstrates, education's transformative power knows no boundaries. Investing in education, especially for girls, result in substantial benefits for their health and productivity. It also increases democratic participation and empowers women, according to the UNESCO report, ""Education Transforms Lives."" The research reveals that if all women had a primary education, child marriages and child mortality could fall by a sixth and maternal deaths by two-thirds. With a visceral instinct to protect their children from harm, mothers work miracles every day to provide their children with education. One day in Uganda, a woman who was dying from AIDS because of an unfaithful husband, told her eldest daughter that she had made her choice. Rather than buy medicine to save her own life (this was before anti-retroviral drugs were widely available and affordable), she would spend her money to send her daughter to school. She asked her child to become a doctor and help save her people from this devastating disease. Julian Atim, whom I met after her mother had passed away, indeed became a doctor. She created the first alliance of Ugandan health workers to fight HIV in a country where professionals tend to leave in droves and practice abroad for economic reasons. Julian went on to study at Harvard University before returning to the war-torn rural area of northern Uganda, where for the longest time she was one of two doctors serving a population of 300,000. She didn't only study medicine; at 35, she's also an expert in advocacy and human rights. There are countless mothers like Julian's out there, and they are everywhere -- mothers for whom education doesn't merely prepare one for life, education is life. Yet 57 million children are out of school. This means we are yet to make free and compulsory education a priority. The world leaders who are about to meet at the U.N. General Assembly should do everything in their power to meet this goal now and look at this effort as the safest investment into our common future. Beyond all the conflicts tearing the world apart, it is the human aspiration to learn and grow that might hold us together. Education is our guiding hope. You can't change your life if you don't know how. Education saves lives, averts hunger, promotes tolerance and gives purpose. People overcome impossible odds thanks to education. For example, if all women had secondary school, they would know how to feed their children. They would know the hygiene rules that they should follow. And they would have a stronger voice in the home to ensure proper care. This change would save more than 12 million children from being stunted -- a sign of early childhood malnutrition. Learning gives us the means to lead meaningful lives and a proper education will awaken the desire to benefit others. The difference between a primary and secondary education can improve tolerance towards people of another race by 50%, according to the UNESCO report. Arguing that we should all get better educated to become better people doesn't mean that the need for basic education isn't dire. Recently, on Chime for Change, I published an astonishing story brought to me by journalist Veronique Mistiaen and her colleague, photographer Fjona Hill, about the practice of trokosi in rural Ghana. The trokosi practice calls for virgin girls to be sent to the shrines of fetish gods to pay for crimes committed by one of their relatives. They become living sacrifices, protecting their families from the gods' wrath. Some stay at the shrines for a few years; others for life. The young girls become slaves to the priest. They live with a rope tied around their neck, fighting hunger and working from dawn to dusk. The Ghanaian government outlawed the practice in 1998 and over the years about 3,000 of the trokosi slaves have been liberated, but many more have been brought to more remote shrines. A young woman named Millicent Thenkey tried to defend herself but learned the hard way that the law wasn't enough to protect her. She had been allowed to go to school while preparing to take her final initiation at Kilkor shrine in Ketu South district. There, she learned that the practice was a violation of human rights. She reported her initiation to the police and took her parents to court -- something no one had dared to do before. But her parents refused to attend the hearing and the police didn't force them, so the case was thrown out of court and Millicent became a slave. As she pursued her investigation, interviewing priests and families, Mistiaen met a priest who told her: ""We just heard that trokosi was against the law and that women were human beings and needed to be treated as equal. We hadn't ever heard before that women needed to be treated as equal."" This is how deep the need to educate is. But there is a school now in the area, and the priest admits that education will succeed in eradicating slavery even where the law has failed. ""The new generations are learning new things, reading about the world. I don't think they will be interested in sitting behind the shrine wearing this hat of mine,"" he said. Aristotle thought that an uneducated man was as good as dead. Julian's mother chose her daughter's education over her own life. Torgbi Abiaeu, the priest in Ghana, reluctantly admitted the defeat of tradition by education. In all these cases, the conclusion remains the same. It is education that makes life worth living and the best I can wish to anyone is to never stop learning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mariane Pearl.","UNESCO releases a report that shows education can radically transform people's lives .

"(CNN) -- The summer-long antagonism between the United States and Russia enters a new phase this week as the presidents of both countries participate in the Group of 20 nations summit. Will discord continue? Or will some concord emerge? Although U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have no formal meetings scheduled, they likely will have opportunities to chat in Russia, which is hosting the gathering. To say the two countries have been at odds this year is putting it mildly. Edward Snowden: fugitive or refugee? The Obama administration made former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden perhaps the most wanted man in the world. Snowden faces espionage charges after he admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs. The U.S.-Russia relationship became strained when Snowden was revealed to be hiding in a Moscow airport, where the Russian government allowed him to hole up in a transit zone for weeks. Putin declined to hand Snowden over to the United States and declared Snowden a ""free man"" biding time in the airport. After Snowden inquired about asylum in Latin American countries, Russia stunned Obama: it decided to grant temporary asylum to Snowden. Angered, Obama threatened to skip this week's G20 summit in St. Petersburg. He obviously changed his mind: Obama and Putin shook hands and exchanged words briefly during the summit's opening Thursday. It was a polite -- perhaps a tad forced -- moment, and it went no further than that. Gay rights . Obama has often been referred to as America's first ""gay president"" because of his aggressive advocacy of gay rights and same-sex marriage. Putin, however, signed a propaganda law passed by parliament that bans the public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it. Violators can be fined and, if they are foreigners, deported. Critics say the law is so vague that someone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex. Obama declared ""nobody's more offended than me"" by the Russian law. Syria: Is chemical warfare for real? The backdrop to the G20 economic summit is Obama's international campaign to begin limited bombing of Syria for the regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people in a civil war. Putin hasn't been quick to embrace U.S. assertions that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government is using chemical weapons. Putin wants high proof that Assad -- an ally of Russia -- has indeed engaged in such warfare. Putin called the chemical weapon allegations ""absurd"" because he said the Assad regime holds the upper hand over rebels. The skepticism is powerful because Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and, if the United States and its allies seek U.N. approval to bomb Syria, Russia can veto such a resolution. Russia has invoked that power repeatedly the past two years. On Wednesday, the eve of the G20 summit, Putin said he ""doesn't exclude"" supporting a U.N. resolution for military force against Syria -- but only if there's irrefutable proof of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government. What's one to make of all this? Look to history, one analyst said. ""I think Putin especially sees himself as a Cold War guy,"" said Julia Ioffe, senior editor of the New Republic, who was a Moscow correspondent for Foreign Policy. ""He's not shed that mentality. He sees himself as a foil and counterweight to America and the world.""","Presidents Obama and Putin have been at odds all year .

"(CNN) -- The parents of Trayvon Martin joined thousands of Americans at more than 100 scheduled vigils in cities nationwide demanding Saturday what they described as justice for their 17-year-old son, who was shot dead last year. ""It's overwhelming,"" Tracy Martin told CNN at a rally in Miami attended by hundreds of supporters, many of whom chanted, ""No Peace! No Justice!"" ""It sends a message to the nation that we're not going to sit back and let our children be killed and don't say anything about it."" Surveying the crowd, he said, ""This is what keeps us going -- all of these people that are out here to support us: white, black, brown. There's a mixture of people. Everybody is out to support not only Trayvon, but their children as well."" Last week, a jury in Sanford, Florida, found neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the 2012 killing outside Tracy Martin's house. Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, said he fired in self defense after Trayvon Martin attacked him. The unarmed teen was carrying a soda and a bag of candy. On Friday, President Barack Obama said Trayvon Martin ""could have been my son ... could have been me, 35 years ago."" He also encouraged more attention to racial profiling and ""stand your ground"" laws. Obama: 'Trayvon Martin could have been me' Tracy Martin said Saturday the president's remarks ""touched our heart."" ""We admire the president for stepping up and doing that because it sends a message to the world that this could have been anybody's child and there's no exceptions as to whose child it could have been,"" he said. ""We have to do something to corral the senseless violence."" Martin predicted he would never recover from the death, but said, ""We're moving forward now."" During his remarks to the crowd, Martin teared up, saying about his son, ""He did nothing wrong and we're not going to let them persecute him the way that they have."" In New York, Trayvon Martin's mother Sybrina Fulton was to be joined by her surviving son Jahvaris Fulton and the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""God is healing my heart this very moment,"" Sybrina Fulton said in a tweet. ""But as I watch so many people come together, he reminds me that we have a lot of work to do."" Sharpton and the National Action Network are urging the Justice Department to consider criminal civil rights charges against Zimmerman. In Los Angeles, where violence broke out after the verdict in Zimmerman's favor, the tone was upbeat and peaceful on Saturday. Hundreds of people had assembled by 9 a.m. outside the federal courthouse to underscore their message ""that, as a community, we need to come together and we need to support justice for Trayvon,"" said Donna Wade, one of the demonstrators. ""That we need to do it in a peaceful manner."" Are you at a rally? Share photos, video .

"Washington (CNN) -- As political turmoil engulfs Egypt, Americans are watching closely -- and they should be: What happens in Egypt will directly affect Americans in many ways. 1. Travel: See the pyramids along the Nile -- NOT . Egypt, with its 5,000-year history, the pyramids and pharaohs, was always a luxury travel destination for Americans but the political and social violence that has wracked the country for 2Â½ years has virtually destroyed Egypt's U.S. tourist business. Post-coup violence erupts in Egypt . Now, the State Department is warning citizens not to travel to Egypt and U.S. citizens living in Egypt to leave. It also ordered non-emergency personnel and families of Americans working at the U.S. Embassy and consulate to leave. Cordesman: U.S. must not fail Egypt . 2. Money . Egypt is America's closest ally in the Arab world and it gets $1.5 billion a year in U.S. taxpayer money for military and civilian programs. In fact, in the last 30 years, the United States has sent more foreign aid to Egypt than to any country except Israel. Now, that money hangs in the balance as the Obama administration decides whether to call the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy a ""coup."" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tells CNN: ""If this were to be seen as a coup then it would limit our ability to have the kind of relationship we think we need with the Egyptian armed forces."" 3. Mideast peace . The United States helps Egypt because it's one of only two Arab countries -- along with Jordan -- that made peace with Israel. If Washington pulls its aid, it could affect prospects for peace in the Middle East. ElBaradei: Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot 'fail' ""All of these things are tied together,"" says CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""The aid is tied to Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, so if our aid gets cut off what happens to the peace treaty with Israel? It's a hornets' nest and that's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much."" 4. Gas prices . Egypt controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route for more than 4% of the world's oil supply and 8% of seaborne trade. So far, the canal is running smoothly -- but increased violence could end up hitting Americans in the pocketbook. 5. The linchpin . With 83 million people, Egypt is a cultural heavyweight in the Arab world. ""The great trends that have affected the United States have come out of Egypt,"" says Zakaria: everything from pan-Arab nationalism of the 1950s, Islamic fundamentalism which began in Egypt in the 1970s -- even al Qaeda has its roots in Egypt and Islamic Jihad. ""Egypt is the source of all the pop music, the soap operas, the movies of the Arab world,"" he added, ""so what happens in Egypt tends to have a much wider resonance throughout the Arab world."" Until the Egyptian military ousted Morsy, Egypt also had a claim to fame politically: a democratically elected president and his Muslim Brotherhood party. It was a message to the Islamic world that democracy just might work. Now, there's a danger the military could violently repress the Muslim Brotherhood and it, in turn, could resort to violence. Will Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood survive? That would make the whole Mideast region more unstable -- a worrisome development for the United States.","Turmoil in Egypt over past two years has virtually halted travel by Americans .

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, senior producer Jim Polk talks about the upcoming documentary ""Eyewitness to Murder: The King Assassination."" CNN's Soledad O'Brien on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel where King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. MEMPHIS, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The Rev. Billy Kyles, the only person standing on the second-floor balcony of the Lorraine Motel with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., had started to walk away when he heard the shot. ""When I turned, I could see him lying on the balcony. One of his feet was sticking through the railing, and there was this huge hole in his face,"" Kyles told CNN correspondent Soledad O'Brien as they stood together in front of Room 306 where the civil rights leader was gunned down 40 years ago this April. In producing its two-hour documentary, ""Eyewitness to Murder: The King Assassination,"" CNN Presents turned to the people who were there that day and others personally involved in the movement to tell their first-hand stories of a tragedy that still resonates today.  Watch a preview » . Fireman George Loenneke had asked to take a look through a police surveillance peephole in his fire station across the street and saw King at the moment he was hit. ""It sounded like one-by-fours [boards], two of them -- just bam! -- went together,"" Loenneke said. ""He come up off that grating there about a foot."" King's closest aide, Andrew Young, told O'Brien, ""He probably never even heard the shot."" CNN sought out these critical witnesses and others with pained memories and personal knowledge to tell the story in their own words, rather than depend on official reconstructions of the murder case. Among those interviewed: five policemen on the scene or on duty that day, three men in the firehouse, two of the garbage workers whose city-wide strike brought the civil rights leader to Memphis, the medical examiner who plotted the trajectory of the fatal bullet, and the former Ku Klux Klan lawyer who became James Earl Ray's first attorney. Ray's younger brother, Jerry, shared his story of how he stayed in touch with James during the prison escapee's year on the run and was at his bedside when Ray died almost 30 years after his guilty plea in King's death. The documentary draws on James Earl Ray's personal hand-written account at the time, which describes how he purchased his white Mustang and the .30-06 rifle left at the murder scene, as well as his capture overseas while trying to join up with mercenary forces in white-ruled areas of Africa. The former Lorraine Motel is now the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, and its president, Beverly Robertson, allowed CNN unprecedented access not only to the second-floor balcony where King was killed, but also to the museum's remarkable display of the evidence, including Ray's rifle and his prison radio, both left behind as he drove away. CNN was able to obtain transcripts of original police interviews with many witnesses now deceased, including boarders in the rooming house where authorities believe the fatal shot was fired. The network also got access to FBI interviews with the owners of the gun store where Ray bought the rifle, and we talked face-to-face with each of them, although both declined to be interviewed on camera. Our team read the full report of the House Assassination Committee, which held extensive hearings in 1978, as well as two Justice Department reports defending the FBI findings, but we avoided using any of the official government accounts, other than original documents found in the British Archives on the U.S. request for Ray's extradition after his arrest. CNN's goal: to bring you as close to a first-hand eyewitness account of those turbulent times and that tragic ending as can be possible 40 years after the death of a leader many consider an American martyr.","Lt.

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund took a giant stride towards defending their Bundesliga title with a 1-0 win over Bayern Munich Wednesday in a top of the table clash. The priceless victory left Dortmund six points clear of their Bavarian rivals with only four games left of the German league season. Polish international striker Robert Lewandowski scored the vital goal, his 20th of a fine season, in the second half. He helped home Kevin Grosskreutz's shot on 77 minutes, but there was still drama to come. Only four minutes were left when Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller brought down Bayern's winger Arjen Robben in the penalty area. The Dutch star decided to take the penalty, but saw Borussia captain Weidenfeller save his effort to be mobbed by his teammates. Robben then compounded his error by shooting over from a great position and in a frantic finish Lewandowski hit the crossbar at the other end. ""That was thrilling at the end, the last few minutes were unbelievable,"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp told AFP. His side have gone 24 games without defeat to hold off a resurgent Bayern, who face Real Madrid next Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal. Bayern and Dortmund will also contest the German Cup final on May 12. Meanwhile, third placed Schalke suffered a shock 4-1 defeat at Nuremberg which leaves them six points behind Bayern ahead of their clash with Dortmund at the weekend. In Serie A, Juventus went back on top as Alessandro Del Piero scored the winner in a 2-1 win over Lazio in Turin. The victory lifted them one point clear of AC Milan, who had briefly gone top with a 1-0 win at Chievo Tuesday. Simone Pepe put Juve ahead before Stefano Mauri equalized in a rare Lazio attack. Juve continued to press but it needed a typical piece of magic from Del Piero to grab the clinching goal from a clever free-kick with eight minutes left. In other action, Inter Milan maintained new coach Andrea Stramaccioni's unbeaten start with a 2-1 win over Siena with Diego Milito scoring twice. Inter drew level on points with Napoli, who were beaten 3-1 at home to Atalanta, for the final Europa League spot.","Borussia Dortmund beat Bayern Munich 1-0 in Bundesliga .

"(TIME.com) -- Even if you're not a fan of broccoli, your joints may be. Nutritionists have rhapsodized about the various benefits of broccoli â€” the cruciferous vegetable is stuffed with vitamins A, B, K, C, as well as nutrients such as potassium, zinc and fiber â€” and arthritis sufferers may soon join them. Along with its cousins brussel sprouts, cauliflower and cabbage, broccoli contains sulfur compounds that can filter out carcinogens that promote tumor growth. The latest study, published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism, shows that those substances may also battle inflammation, which is at the root of osteoarthritis, a painful, degenerative joint disease in which cartilage that normally protects joints starts to wear away under the influence of the inflammatory factors. For the estimated 12.4 million people affected by arthritis in the United States, these results are certainly welcome news. TIME.com: Acupuncture may offer real relief for chronic pain . Starting with studies in mice, the researchers found that animals that ate a diet high in the sulforaphane found in broccoli had significantly less cartilage damage and signs of osteoarthritis compared to mice who did not consume sulforaphane. The team then moved to human and cow cartilage cells, and found that the sulforaphane was equally effective in protecting these cells from damage. The sulfur-based compound, they say, may be blocking enzymes that contribute to inflammation in cartilage, and the scientists are starting a trial to see if broccoli can protect a small group of arthritis patients getting knee replacement surgery. If that trial confirms these early results, that could help more people to avoid arthritis to begin with; although surgery can treat symptoms, protecting joints from irreversible damage would keep joints stronger for a longer period of time. ""Although surgery is very successful, it is not really an answer. Once you have osteoarthritis, being able to slow its progress and the progression to surgery is really important, study author Ian Clark, professor of musculoskeletal biology at the University of East Anglia said in a statement. ""Prevention would be preferable and changes to lifestyle, like diet, may be the only way to do that."" Not to mention that a broccoli-rich diet could lower risk of other chronic diseases like obesity, which prior studies have connected to... arthritis.

"New York (CNN) -- The alleged victim in the Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexual assault case has filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Post and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute, according to court filings. The woman, a native of Guinea who has not been identified publicly, accused the newspaper of publishing articles with false and defamatory information in the effort to bolster sales. Her attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, filed the claim Tuesday in New York's Bronx state Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for the New York Post, Suzi Halpin, responded to the lawsuit saying ""we stand by our reporting."" The Post -- which has earned a reputation for its sensationalist headlines and provocative reporting -- on July 2 published the headline ""Maid cleaning up as 'hooker,'"" citing anonymous sources. The article said the woman -- a maid at a Manhattan hotel -- was ""doing double duty as a prostitute, collecting cash on the side from male guests, The Post has learned."" On July 3, the newspaper reported that the alleged victim, which the newspaper did not name in its stories, has ""a regular fleet of gentlemen callers,"" ranging from ""wealthy clients she met at the Sofitel (hotel) to counterfeit-merchandise hawkers and livery-cab drivers, said sources close to the defense investigation."" The filing says The Post knew, or should have known, that the statements were false prior to publication. The newspaper's articles were then repeated by ""multiple news organizations around the world,"" the filing said. CNN did not carry the Post reports. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that so far, ""no evidence has been found that she is a prostitute."" The alleged victim, 32, accused the former head of the International Monetary Fund of criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse that allegedly occurred in May inside his Manhattan hotel suite. But the woman's credibility was largely undermined Friday when prosecutors announced publicly that she had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack. The announcement appears to have left the case on shaky ground, but Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said he is not ready to drop charges. ""Prosecutors said on Friday their investigation is continuing, and that remains the case,"" Vance spokeswoman Erin Duggan told CNN. ""No decisions have been made."" Meanwhile, Strauss-Kahn is facing separate accusations of attempted rape in France. A Strauss-Kahn lawyer in France said he had filed a counterclaim against Tristane Banon for ""false declarations."" French prosecutors are expected to review the complaint and determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge rejected AEG Live's request that she dismiss the Michael Jackson wrongful death lawsuit, but two executives were dropped as individual defendants on Monday, a ruling that had each side claiming a measure of victory. The trial, which is in its fifth month in a Los Angeles courtroom, is expected to conclude with closing arguments as soon as next week. But before AEG Live lawyers rest their defense case on September 16, they may call Michael Jackson's mother back to the witness stand, attorney Marvin Putnam said. A decision will be made on the need for more testimony from Katherine Jackson after the judge rules on several issues regarding possible damages on Wednesday, Putnam said. The Jackson family matriarch delivered two days of dramatic testimony in July, which included a heated cross examination by Putnam. ""She was trying to answer the questions the best she could,"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said after she left the stand. ""I think maybe she lost her temper a little bit and she tried to restrain herself in a very Christian-like way."" Jackson's 83-year-old mother and three children accuse AEG Live of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon's death. The company's executives missed several warning signs that Jackson's health was deteriorating under Murray's care, they contend. AEG Live argues that Jackson, not its executives, chose and controlled Murray. Judge: Jurors will decide the case . Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ruled on Monday that the case against AEG Live will be sent to the jury. The company had filed a ""nonsuit motion"" that argued the Jacksons failed to present enough evidence to warrant jury deliberations. ""Substantial evidence has been presented at trial from which a jury can reasonably infer that defendants (AEG Live) knew or should have known that Dr. Murray presented an undue risk of harm to decedent (Jackson),"" she said in her ruling. AEG Live lawyers contend that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous -- and ultimately fatal -- infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol the doctor was using to treat the singer's insomnia. The coroner ruled Jackson died of a propofol overdose on June 25, 2009 -- just days away from the premiere of his ""This It It"" tour in London. The judge also ruled that the Jacksons ""presented substantial evidence"" that AEG Live's ""conduct was a substantial factor in causing"" Jackson's death. Pain was real, doctor testifies . ""A jury may logically infer from the evidence that (Jackson) died because Dr. Murray, who was adversely affected by a conflict of interest created by his contractual arrangement with AEG, treated a deteriorating insomniac who was not ready to perform, causing Dr. Murray to make bad medical decisions that caused (Jackson's) death,"" the judge wrote. The Jackson case contends AEG Live created a medical conflict of interest by agreeing to pay the debt-ridden Murray $150,000 a month to serve as Jackson's personal physician. Murray's agreement said he could lose his job if the tour was postponed or canceled, leading him to make unsafe medical decisions, they argue. Murray told investigators he treated Jackson with propofol most nights for the last two months of his life. The Jacksons contend the treatments began once AEG Live co-CEO Paul Gongaware agreed in a phone call to Murray's demands for $150,000 a month. ""The timing of when Dr. Murray ordered propofol is a matter of factual dispute (as to whether that means Dr. Murray used it prior to AEG's retention of him),"" the judge wrote. ""The court finds that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that Dr. Murray's treatment of decedent was connected to Murray's employment by AEG. Therefore defendants' motion for nonsuit is denied."" AEG Live execs dropped from suit . AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips and co-CEO Paul Gongaware were dismissed as individual defendants in the case. The two executives in charge of producing and promoting Jackson's comeback concerts ""did not assume personal liability"" when dealing with the hiring of Murray, Palazuelos wrote. ""Rather, they acted solely as an agent of AEG Live."" A Jackson lawyer downplayed the significance of the dismissal of the two men as defendants, saying the plaintiffs previously offered to drop them from the case but AEG Live lawyers refused. Closing arguments could come as soon as September 19, after Jackson lawyers offer several witnesses next week in rebuttal to the AEG Live defense. Testimony was suspended for this week because a female juror traveled out of the state on an emergency trip to visit a seriously ill close relative, Palazuelos said Monday.","AEG Live lawyers say they may call Michael Jackson's mother back to the witness stand .

"(CNN) -- A Missouri woman was killed in the state's flash flooding Thursday as inclement weather hammers several states in what forecasters predict will be a particularly nasty storm season. As rescue teams were performing 18 ""swift water rescues"" in McDonald County, Missouri, Thursday morning, the woman -- thought to be in her 60s -- was driving over a bridge when she was caught up in ""rapidly rising waters,"" said Gregg Sweeten, the county's emergency management director. It was the second weather-related death in the state this week. Elijah Lee, 4, died Monday after 6 inches of rain fell on Pulaski County, about 140 miles southwest of St. Louis. The boy was found in a vehicle swept up in the floodwaters that caught the community along Mitchell Creek off guard, said Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman Sgt. Dan Crain. His mother, Jessica Lee, 23, of Waynesville is missing, and authorities and volunteers are using canine units in their search for her. Back in McDonald County, Sweeten said he was hopeful the Elk River, which runs through this county located on the Arkansas state line, about 80 miles southwest of Springfield, Missouri, would crest late Thursday night. South of the capital, Jefferson City, Interstate 44 was shut down because of high water. It's since been reopened. Forecasters warn that areas along the Gasconade River could see record water levels, and widespread flooding is expected to continue in Missouri and Kansas into the weekend. Southern Missouri has witnessed widespread flash flooding as parts of 12 Midwestern and Eastern states experienced some sort of flood watch or warning Thursday. Nashville, Tennessee, was one of the hardest hit, as parts of the city saw as many as 8 inches of rain overnight and in the morning. Another 1 to 3 inches were expected Thursday afternoon and evening, according to forecasters. A flash flood emergency had been issued for much of the city earlier Thursday, and a flash flood warning remains in place until the afternoon. Atlanta also is under a flash flood warning until Thursday evening, and flooding is possible across much of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The weather struck as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revised its preseason hurricane forecast to say there is a 70% chance of an ""above-normal"" Atlantic hurricane season. Where a normal season might bring six hurricanes, three of them above Category 3 or higher, this season could bring as many nine hurricanes, and five of them could be major, the NOAA says. The NOAA says the season, which runs through November, could yield as many as 19 named storms. CNN's Dave Hennen, Jennifer Feldman and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Official: Missouri woman killed in ""rapidly rising waters"" in McDonald County .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Henry Allingham, the world's oldest man and the oldest surviving British veteran from World War I, has died at the age of 113, his care home said Saturday. Henry Allingham was a founding member of the modern Royal Air Force. Allingham died in his sleep at St. Dunstan's care home in Ovingdean, England, the home said in a statement. Born on June 6, 1896, Allingham was active until his final days, having celebrated his 113th birthday last month on the HMS President with his family, the care home said. The Guinness Book of World Records Certified Allingham as the world's oldest man last month, St. Dunstan's said. Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Gordon Brown both paid their respects to Allingham on Saturday. ""The queen was saddened to hear of the death of Henry Allingham. He was one of the unique generation who sacrificed so much for us all. Our thoughts are with his family at this time,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. ""I had the privilege of meeting Henry many times,"" said Brown. ""He was a tremendous character, one of the last representatives of a generation of tremendous characters. My thoughts are with his family as they mourn his passing but celebrate his life."" Born in the East End of London during the reign of Queen Victoria, Allingham was brought up by his mother and grandparents. His father died when he was a baby. He joined the Royal Naval Air Service as an aircraft mechanic in 1915 after his mother died. Allingham was the last known survivor of the Battle of Jutland, considered the greatest battle of World War I. He was serving aboard the armed trawler HMT Kingfisher, which was sent to meet up with the British fleet as it fought the Germans off what is now mainland Denmark. The battle still holds the record for the most gun-armed battleships and battlecruisers engaged in a fight, according to Britain's Ministry of Defence. In 1917 Allingham was sent to France to support the Royal Flying Corps. His job as a mechanic was to service the aircraft and recover parts from downed planes, but pilots would often ask their mechanics to fly with them, so Allingham would sit behind the pilot and drop bombs or operate the machine gun. Allingham served in Flanders until that November, when he moved to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France. He stayed there until the end of the war. Allingham was a founding member of today's Royal Air Force, which was formed in 1918 when the Royal Naval Air Service merged with the Royal Flying Corps. He married his wife, Dorothy, in late 1918 and left the RAF a few months later, in April 1919. But Allingham remained a reservist, and during World War II he was called on to find a solution to the German magnetic mines that were bottling up the English harbor of Harwich, on the Essex coast. Allingham and his team devised an effective system to neutralize the mines, after which every ship was fitted with a neutralizing device using the system. His dedication to the military and the memory of fallen troops never wavered. In his later years especially, Allingham was often seen at memorial events, even though he could no longer walk and had to be transported in a wheelchair. ""Henry was always determined to ensure that today's generation does not forget the sacrifice of those who died on the Western Front,"" St. Dunstan's said in a statement after his death. ""Until recently, he regularly visited schools and attended war-based events as an ambassador for his generation."" Asked once at a memorial ceremony how he would like to be remembered, Allingham brushed off any thought of it, saying people should instead remember those who died in the wars. ""Remember them, not me,"" he said. He was made a chevalier in France's Legion of Honor in 2003 and was promoted to officer earlier this year. In awarding him the honor this year, the French ambassador to Britain thanked Allingham on behalf of French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his part in protecting France during both World Wars. The Royal Navy celebrated Allingham's birthday last month by throwing him a party aboard the HMS President. A birthday cake and card signed by the First Sea Lord was delivered by fast raiding craft of the Royal Marines, and he was given a decanter of Pussers Rum, his ""favorite tipple,"" on behalf of the Fleet Air Arm. Allingham's wife, Dorothy, died in 1970. Their two daughters both died in their 80s. He is survived by six grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren, 21 great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great grandchild, all of whom live in the United States, the care home said. Since 2006, Allingham had lived at St. Dunstan's, a care home for blind ex-servicemen and -women on the southern English coast. He had lost his sight as a result of age-related macular degeneration. ""Everybody at St. Dunstan's is saddened by Henry's loss and our sympathy goes out to his family,"" said Robert Leader, chief executive at the care home. ""As well as possessing a great spirit of fun, he represented the last of a generation who gave a very great deal for us. Henry made many friends among the residents and staff at St Dunstan's. He was a great character and will be missed.""","Henry Allingham died in his sleep at a care home in Ovingdean, England .

"(CNN) -- To call myself a true ginger is rather an insult to all the legitimate redheads of the world. You know, the super shiny ones you carefully hide from your children. ""Mommy, what is that?"" ""Nothing, dear. Just a horrible genetic mutation."" ""Can we keep it?"" But, alas, I am one of them. I am a ginger. To be fair, my hair (what's left of it) is really more of a light brown with gentle hints of crimson. However, in a pinch, my beard can definitely be used as a warning beacon for low-flying aircraft. ""Jim, shouldn't that bright red light be wearing pants?"" Thus, while they'll never elect me King Ginger of the Pale, I'm definitely one among the people. Which is why I felt a certain amount of solidarity as I kept reading about the more than 100 redheads who recently marched in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the city's annual Fringe Festival. The UK's first Ginger Pride Walk was actually orchestrated by a Canadian comedian named Shawn Hitchins, who said, ""Although it isn't a real word, 'gingerism' exists, and bullying exists. ... Kids are being subjected to taunts or being bullied in schools just for having red hair."" So they marched through the streets of Scotland's capital, stretching out like a soulless, human laser pointer. Despite the serious tone set by Hitchins, the event was, of course, organized to be fun. After all, if anyone knows how to have a good time, it's someone who can't go out in direct sunlight. ""Woo! Party over here! In the gazebo! C'mon, guys! Woo! Wear long sleeves! Woo!"" As the red-haired masses marched down the street, some held positive signs saying ""IT GETS REDDER"" and ""GINGER AND PROUD."" Though, one little girl warned, ""DON'T MAKE ME MAD OR I WILL GINGER SNAP."" I see what she did there. Of course, Edinburgh was the perfect place to hold such an event. While the worldwide percentage of natural redheads is only about 1% to 2%, in Scotland, it's somewhere closer to 13%. Which is still pretty low. And some people think those numbers may get even lower. In 2007, National Geographic suggested that, eventually, gingers might actually become extinct. Perhaps as soon as 2060. While many disagreed with this prediction, it certainly didn't help that, in 2011, the world's largest sperm bank stopped accepting donations from gingers for lack of demand. Aaaaaaand there goes my retirement plan. Nevertheless, Hitchins has been encouraged by all the support he's received in his efforts to raise ginger awareness. Especially online. Naturally, then, I was curious what kind of resources were out there on the Web for my people. So, I did a little researching ... and mostly came up with links for fetish porn. Though, in retrospect, perhaps I shouldn't have Googled ""dirty redheads."" But two hours later I finally got back on track and discovered a couple legitimate support sites such as Redhead-World.net and RedheadandProud.com. I even found several dating options like HotForGinger.com. ""I really like your profile. What's your SPF?"" So there's plenty of love and support out there for us pale-skinned, red-headed folks who need a little extra encouragement. Still, it's kind of a bummer that some kids get teased just for being ginger. I was never THAT red, so I really don't know what it's like. But I'm sure it sucks, and hopefully these bullies will grow out of it and come to realize that freckles are awesome! But, until then, if any gingers in the world need an extra boost of confidence, just remember this: Axl Rose is a redhead. And so are Conan O'Brien and Bonnie Raitt, and Willie Nelson and, apparently, Genghis Khan. (But Carrot Top doesn't count. Because I said so.) I applaud Hitchins and his Ginger Pride Walk. And maybe next year I'll be there in person to cheer them on. From a shaded, safe distance. I'll be in the gazebo.

"(CNN) -- Here's a look at the timeline of events in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, and the ensuing uproar. February 26 . About 7 p.m.: George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain, calls 911 to report ""a suspicious person"" in the gated community called the Retreat at Twin Lakes. Zimmerman says he is following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursues Martin anyway, but then says he lost sight of him. About 7:10 p.m.: Phone records show Martin was on the phone with his girlfriend around the time he saw Zimmerman while returning on foot from a convenience store to his father's fiancee's home. At a March 20 news conference, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump says the girl heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and Martin asking why the person was following him. The girl gets the impression that there is an altercation, during which the earpiece falls from Martin's ear and the connection goes dead, according to Crump. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman tells authorities that, after Zimmerman briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman says, he reaches for his cell phone, and then Martin punches him in the nose. Zimmerman says Martin pins him to the ground and begins slamming his head into the sidewalk. About 7:25 p.m.: Martin is shot and killed. It is raining. At the time of his death, the teenager is unarmed and carrying a small amount of cash, a bag of Skittles candy and a can of iced tea. Several neighbors of the gated community call 911 to report the incident, with authorities eventually releasing the contents of seven such calls. In one, a man whispers, ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside. There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" Another neighbor says, ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot. Hurry up. They are right outside my house."" In another call, a woman begs dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" About 7:30 p.m.: Zimmerman tells police he shot Martin in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith writes that Zimmerman is bleeding from the nose and back of the head. March 8: Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy Martin, family members and attorneys hold a news conference calling attention to the case. March 12: Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee says Zimmerman has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of the events. March 14: CNN's David Mattingly reports that police have concluded their investigation and turned the file over to the state attorney, who will decide whether to file charges. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, create a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it is the second most-popular petition in the website's history, with 877,110 signatures. The NAACP asks the Justice Department to get involved in the investigation. March 15: In a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, George Zimmerman's father writes that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Robert Zimmerman writes that his son is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family. March 16: Authorities release seven calls to police from the night of the shooting. In one of the 911 recordings, Zimmerman says he is following Martin. Also in one of the recordings, a voice can be heard in the background screaming ""Help, help!"" followed by the sound of a gunshot. March 19: The Justice Department announces that it has launched an investigation into Martin's death. Florida Gov. Rick Scott asks state officials to assist in the investigation. March 20: Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, says nothing in it allows people to ""pursue and confront."" The law allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The Justice Department sends representation to Sanford to investigate and ""to address tension in the community."" March 21: CNN analyzes one of the tapes of Zimmerman's call to dispatch, in which he is purported to have used a racial slur. The results are inconclusive. March 22: Police Chief Lee announces that he is stepping down temporarily as head of the department, which has been criticized for its handling of the shooting. Scott announces that he is appointing State's Attorney Angela Corey of the 4th Judicial Circuit as special prosecutor, replacing Norman Wolfinger. As the petition calling for Zimmerman's arrest reaches 1 million signatures, according to Change.org, civil rights activists, politicians, family and supporters converge on Fort Mellon Park in Sanford to rally for swift judicial action, including Zimmerman's arrest. March 23: President Barack Obama speaks publicly for the first time on the growing controversy, saying the incident requires national ""soul-searching."" March 24: A handful of members from the New Black Panther Party offer a $10,000 reward for the ""capture"" of George Zimmerman. March 26: One month after Martin was killed, demonstrators rally across the country calling for Zimmerman's arrest. In Sanford, the City Commission holds a town hall meeting on the incident and its aftermath. March 28: Zimmerman's father, Robert, appears on television and says Martin threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly, Zimmerman was forced to shoot. March 29: Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., appears on CNN and says medical records will prove that his brother was attacked and his nose was broken by Martin before he fatally shot the teen. March 29: A witness, who asks not to be identified, tells CNN of having heard voices, ""opening a window and then seeing -- with two men or two people on the ground, one on top of each other"" on the night Martin was shot dead. March 31: Civil rights leaders join throngs of protesters carrying ""Justice for Trayvon"" signs on Saturday, marching to the Sanford, Florida, police headquarters to demand the arrest of Zimmerman. April 2: Audio experts tell CNN that they don't believe it's Zimmerman who can be heard yelling ""Help!"" in the background of a 911 call. They compare those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a ""suspicious"" black male, who ended up being Martin. April 5: Zimmerman says he whispered ""punks,"" not a racial slur, in the moments before he shot Martin, his attorneys tell CNN. CNN's editorial staffers repeatedly review the tape but can reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. April 9: Special prosecutor Angela Corey decides against using a grand jury in the case. ""We believed, from day one, that they had enough evidence to arrest the killer of Trayvon Martin and now, as the evidence has continued to unfold, we think there has been a plethora of evidence to simply effect probable cause to do an arrest -- not for a conviction, but for an arrest,"" says family attorney Benjamin Crump. April 10: Attorneys for Zimmerman say they have lost contact with their client and no longer represent him. Lawyer Hal Uhrig says Zimmerman has, on his own, called Sean Hannity of Fox News and the office of the special prosecutor appointed to lead the investigation. Uhrig also suggests that Zimmerman has left Florida. Zimmerman's now-former lawyers and friend Frank Taaffe confirm the authenticity of a website as having been launched by the neighborhood watch volunteer to warn supporters about groups falsely claiming to be raising funds for his defense and to solicit donations for himself. April 11: Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin, says special prosecutor Angela Corey. ""This is a very, very major charge,"" says CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It carries the potential of life in prison. The jury instructions that the jury will receive is he can only be convicted if he showed a depraved attitude toward Trayvon Martin's life. That's a tough burden for a prosecutor to meet. But she has access to facts that we don't."" April 12: An affidavit of probable cause in Florida's case against Zimmerman says he ""profiled"" Martin, and disregarded a police dispatcher's request that he await the arrival of police. Zimmerman's relatives say that he did not profile Martin and that he shot him in self-defense. They say Zimmerman killed Martin after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk. April 18: A Florida judge approves a motion to disqualify herself from the case, according to the court. Zimmerman's defense team had requested that Seminole Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler, who was assigned to the case, be removed after she revealed that her husband works with a CNN legal analyst. Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. is appointed to take her place. April 20: Speaking during a court hearing, Zimmerman apologizes to Martin's family. Moments later, a Florida judge sets bond at $150,000, allowing Zimmerman the chance to get out of jail while he awaits trial.","On February 26, George Zimmerman shot, killed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida .

"DEATH VALLEY, California (CNN) -- Today, you get a call from a friend. They need a favor. Runners chase each other during the first 20 miles of Badwater. Would you mind spending your vacation time this summer in Death Valley, a desert where temperatures hover around 130 degrees? Would you be OK with sleeping in a van, if you get to sleep at all, for three days, because you'll be working your tail off spraying runners down with water, dunking them in ice and keeping track of everything that goes in (and -- yes -- out) of their body every 15 minutes so they don't die running 135 miles in the hardest footrace on the planet? ""Yeah, man, it's Badwater. You don't turn down a chance to be at Badwater,"" Mark Paterson said, adjusting his visor as sweat soaked his face. He pulls at his shirt, trying to create some air, pointlessly. It was 4 p.m. and 126 degrees in a Death Valley village called Furnace Creek, what whoever coined the phrase, 'Hell on earth' had in mind. ""You get that call and you do what's right,"" Paterson said. ""You make sure your runner gets the ultimate bragging right, maybe the biggest big deal of all, the event that makes everyone else go, 'Badwater? Oh, no, man, you did not just do that!' "" Paterson was right. The Adventurecorps Badwater Ultramarathon is infamous in endurance sports circles. It is the running equivalent of summiting Everest, the ultimate test of mental fortitude, a hippy communion with the desert of epic highs and lows (literally -- the race starts at 280 feet below sea level, the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere, covers three mountain ranges for descents and ascents totaling 9,000 feet and ends halfway up Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States). For all the nonsweaters out there -- consider how long it takes to drive from Baltimore to New York. Now imagine running that distance...without sleep...with 10,000 blow dryers pointed at you the entire time.  Watch what it takes to battle Badwater »  All that for a belt buckle? You apply to Badwater the way you apply to Harvard. Runners from across the world try to wow a finicky race jury by submitting awesome scores (provable race finishing times from at least two 100-mile events) and an essay conveying they have the stamina to tackle such a gnarly challenge. Gnarly meaning blisters that turn feet into pizza; dehydration that can lead to organ and brain damage, heat stroke and hyponatremia; a salt imbalance that makes extremities swell like sausages. For good measure, let's throw in heat and sleep-deprivation induced hallucinations. The entry fee is $795 (steep, sure, but an eight-person medical team, insurance, supplies and logistics to stage a monster event in the middle of nowhere ain't cheap). Crews aren't paid. The prize at the race often called Satan's Fun Run, should one finish in less than 48 hours, is a thick silver belt buckle.  See the runners, the finish and the buckle » . ""To talk about the buckle is to miss the point,"" said Marshall Ulrich, a 58-year-old endurance sensei who has done Badwater more than a dozen times and has summited Everest. Notorious for having his toenails surgically removed -- toenails fall off anyway when you're an endurance runner -- Marshall is, contrary to what most people assume, not a machine. He started running when he was 28, after his doctor told him to get off his butt and lower his blood pressure or expect an early grave.  See interactive map of route, distance, elevation » . ""You run Badwater because there's something in you that wants to get out there, in the middle of nowhere, and think about something. It's a way of freeing yourself, getting back to what I really believe people are supposed to be doing instead of relying so much on a bunch of material crap that only makes us weaker. We are built to run, to cover great distance, for survival sake."" Slightly less extreme, the women's winner of Badwater, two years in a row, is Jamie Donaldson, a middle school math teacher from Colorado. A lawyer, politician, small business owner, real estate agent and a college student ran Badwater this year, and its overall winner, coming in at 23:39:18, was Marcos Farinazzo, a 40-year-old hospital worker from Brazil. The oldest runner this year was 67-year-old Arthur Webb, who has finished 10 consecutive Badwaters. Race officials using walkie-talkies (there's no cell service in Death Valley) counted him out at mile 17 where he cramped and jumped in a pool to cool down. Time, ice and a few massages later, Webb was on the course again, not stopping until he crossed the finish line more than 40 hours later. Good crew, good race -- probably . ""First, you gotta have your hydration log. How much has your runner had to drink, how much do they need,"" Paterson said. ""Endurolytes, quarters of peanut butter sandwiches, something fizzy for when they start having digestion issues -- 'cause they're gonna have 'em -- your various tapes and bandages for the feet, Neosporin, Preparation H, animal cookies,"" he said. ""We jump out of that van every quarter mile with two buckets. I got my bucket of water and ice with a straight block of ice and a bucket of ice and sports drink. The runner gets every other one, you rotate."" The grossest but most necessary job? ""You have to check if their urine is clear, so you better be looking at that, and they better be going often,"" Paterson said. As the race wore on, its 60-hour course limit blurring the days, plastic cups labeled with runners' names who'd suffered serious dehydration began dotting a hotel room that served as Badwater's medical center. They looked filled with varying concentrations of apple juice, one redder than the next. Paterson's runner Tim Kjenstad, a 51-year-old California firefighter, has run Badwater before, but this year, sacked by severe dehydration and bodily functions that don't need to be mentioned, he had to DNF (the dreaded initials for Did Not Finish) at mile 44. ""Nobody can say that running 135 miles in the desert is healthy,"" said Dr. Lisa Stranc Bliss, the head of the medical staff, who herself has run Badwater. ""But I'm not going to say it isn't one of the most incredible experiences of your life."" Beyond the physical, there's an emotional bond forged between crew members and runners that military types call ""embracing the suck."" The wife of a Brazilian runner, Cas Camara, who came in dead last far past the 60-hour mark, screamed and cried and begged her husband, who had fallen to the ground, his body seemingly wasted, to get up, get up and finish. Members of a Navajo tribe and an entire family, tiny kids included, packed into a van to follow one runner. When Arnold Begay reached his breaking point, two of the men lifted him to his feet and a woman cupped his face and sang to him. He went on. Some crewers ran 80 kilometers, completely anonymously, just to keep their runner on a specific pace. Many were exhausted from running their own ultramarathons only weeks before. Badwater's past champ, Hungarian Akos Konya crewed for 19-year-old Arizona college student Nick Hollon who made history as the event's youngest ever competitor. ""Nick emailed me and said how would you like to help me,"" explained Konya, hovering over his runner Nick Hollon at mile 72. Hollon was in pain. The teen's feet were chewed and he was about to take a needle to his blisters. Konya, skinny and fast as a Greyhound, put his hand on Hollon's shoulder. He seemed shocked by the question -- Why would you go through Badwater to help out a kid you barely know? ""Why would I not help him do this? He asked me. I don't understand why you would say no.""","Badwater Ultramarathon is 135 miles through one of the hottest deserts in the world .

"(CNN) -- A $5 million prize for excellence in African leadership was awarded to former Cape Verde President Pedro Verona Pires in London on Monday. Pires was recognized for helping transform the government and economy of Cape Verde, according to the Mo Ibrahim Prize Committee. ""The Prize Committee has been greatly impressed by President Pedro Pires's vision in transforming Cape Verde into a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity,"" said committee chairman Salim Ahmed Salim. Under Pires' presidency, Cape Verde became the second African country to graduate from the United Nations' list of least developed countries. Launched in 2007, the Mo Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership is awarded to candidates who demonstrate ""good governance and great leadership"" during their time in office, according to a statement from the Mo Ibrahim Foundation. Democratically elected African presidents and prime ministers who have left office within the last three years are eligible for the prize. In the last two years, the London-based foundation has decided not to award the prize because the committee could not select a winner. The $5 million prize is distributed over 10 years. Winners also receive an additional $200,000 a year for life. The seven-member Ibrahim Prize Committee is chaired by Salim, the former Prime Minister of Tanzania, and includes global figures such as Graca Machel, wife of Nelson Mandela, and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former U.N. high commissioner for human rights. Previous winners of the award include Botswana ex-President Festus Mogae in 2008 and Mozambique ex-President Joaquim Chissano in 2007. Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications businessman and billionaire, created the foundation bearing his name in 2006. The foundation uses 88 criteria to rate the governing of African countries. According to the 2011 index, the top-governed African nations are Mauritius, Cape Verde, Botswana, Seychelles and South Africa.","Mo Ibrahim Prize winners receive $5 million and $200,000 a year for life .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to rebooting Marvel's tale of an adolescent web crawler, Sony seems more than happy to sing the same old song with today's release of ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Only 10 years have passed since Tobey Maguire started swinging through the urban jungle in ""Spider-Man,"" and now Andrew Garfield is stepping into his flight path in what often feels like a straight-up remake. Considering how important the idea of evolution is to this story, is it unreasonable to expect something more inventive than the same origin tale? Note to Sony: The entire planet saw Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man,"" and you guys know this better than anyone! Copping iconic scenes from ""Superman,"" ""Batman"" and ""King Kong"" only makes matters worse. Yes, there are variations; ""Amazing"" isn't a carbon copy. And, to some extent, there are improvements. The biggest plus point has to be Garfield, the Anglo-American actor who played Mark Zuckerberg's former friend and ally in ""The Social Network."" At 28, Garfield's slightly older than Maguire was when he played Peter Parker in 2002, but his combination of fresh-faced innocence, nervous agitation and wry humor is immediately appealing. Garfield's Peter is still very much a boy -- the prologue introduces him as a child, searching for the father he's about to lose. He's a good-hearted, curious kid who isn't prepared for the hormonal surges that sweep his body shortly after he's been bitten by a genetically modified spider in the research laboratory of one Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). The next thing Peter knows, he's climbing the walls. He's stronger, stickier and getting a good deal further than he ever thought possible with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Not surprisingly, director Marc Webb -- whose last film was the sleeper rom-com ""(500) Days of Summer"" -- employs a deft hand with the relationship scenes, and Garfield and Stone have a nice, frisky rapport. The dialogue scenes are light and ""on point."" But none of this can dispel the whiff of déjà vu. At least we get a new bad guy. When the semi-sympathetic Dr. Connors rashly doses himself into a poor man's Godzilla -- a Middle-aged Mutant Ninja Lizard -- Webb dutifully strings together three or four wham-bang set pieces, including a novel interlude in the sewers, where Spidey spins his own advance warning system, a welcome breath of presumably foul air after all his usual zip-lining antics. The action is mostly coherent and the CGI is a notch or four up from the first Sam Raimi movie, but not a significant advance on the last of them unless you're crazy for 3-D. (A couple of dizzying subjective close-ups do make the case for it -- but they're the exceptions.) This is yet another blockbuster sprinkled with numerous continuity errors, ridiculous coincidences, contrivances and gaping lapses in logic. To take just one minor example: An 8-foot reptile rampages across the Williamsburg bridge during rush hour, and no one gets a photograph? And just because it runs two-and-a-quarter hours doesn't mean you should expect the filmmakers to tie up loose ends. The sinister billionaire who is bankrolling Connors' work, some chap by the name of Osborne, remains ominously off-screen, and we never do find out what happened to Peter's parents. But I suppose that's not carelessness as much as it's confidence. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slick and entertaining and artfully packaged, and Andrew Garfield is utterly engaging, so yes, you can count on seeing more of the same. Prepare to be unamazed.","""The Amazing Spider-Man"" sings the same old song as its predecessors .
There are some improvements, with the best being Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker .

"(CNN) -- David Frum's recent op-ed on CNN.com exemplifies why Americans are becoming deaf to the critics of pot legalization. Their hyperbolic claims about the dangers of pot -- along with the realistic ones -- are being dismissed by a justifiably cynical public. Anti-marijuana propaganda isn't stopping the march toward national legalization, but the opposition is losing its voice as it screams about the falling sky. A majority of Americans favor full legalization, and they understand that recreational cannabis is not now and will never be legal for minors. They know better than to believe Frum's prediction that ""half the states may soon allow the sale of marijuana to almost anybody determined to buy it"" -- an assertion so broad as to imply that even children would be permitted to buy pot legally. This is simply not so. Americans are also informed enough to realize that medical marijuana is not a ""laughable fiction."" This week, I saw a longstanding patient with a rare, ultimately fatal neurological disorder that causes chronic, painful muscle spasms. For years, this patient has smoked marijuana to counteract this terrible symptom, and it works. With medicinal marijuana now legal in New Jersey, this patient is not convinced that she will be safe from federal prosecution if she goes through the state's one operational dispensary, so she continues to purchase illegal, untaxed and potentially adulterated cannabis. While she is technically a criminal, she is neither laughable nor fictional. Those opposed to marijuana do raise important concerns that are often neglected in the movement toward legalization. Cannabis is indeed associated with low motivation and poor performance in minors. It may have subtle but long-term negative effects on young users and worsen the condition of some individuals vulnerable to psychosis. Smoking marijuana may be harmful to users' lungs, although vaporizers have long been available as a safer alternative. Cannabis is habit forming in a small percentage of users. Marijuana intoxication impairs driving, though the risk is similar to that of drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.05%, which is well below the federally mandated legal limit of 0.08%. So why can't the opposition discuss these problems realistically? It's simple: Because the only rational conclusion is that the dangers of pot are not sufficient to warrant its prohibition. Yet those who have an ideological opposition to legalization appear immune to reason. Interestingly, Frum is a moderate in the opposition camp, in that he favors reducing the penalties for marijuana use through decriminalization. But by maintaining pot's nominal illegality, decriminalization denies our government the power to regulate and tax cannabis while removing obstacles to its consumption. Those who would limit the cannabis trade must make a choice between two Americas -- one that crushes the marijuana trade by any means necessary (as nothing less has worked) or one that regulates and taxes a ""soft"" drug that millions of consenting American adults already consume medicinally as well as recreationally. Frum warns of the coming of ""Big Marijuana,"" a term he quoted from legalization opponent Kevin Sabet. Frum and Sabet compare this hypothetical Leviathan to the alcohol and tobacco industries, both of which have been accused of marketing to minors and encouraging destructive consumption of their products by adults. I share this concern, which is why several of the 15 steps I proposed for the federal regulation of cannabis are designed to limit the power of the cannabis industry. Frum predicts that Big Marijuana will target ""young people and racial minorities"" because ""secure and contented people don't tend to be heavy consumers of psychoactive substances."" Setting aside the odd assumptions about who are insecure and discontent, minors and minorities could both benefit from legalization. It is our government, not Big Marijuana, that disproportionately targets racial minorities for prosecution of marijuana crimes, causing much more harm to those communities than cannabis itself ever could. And our prosecution of healthy adults for their relatively benign use of marijuana prevents the justice system from focusing on the diversion of pot to the young people we all want to protect. But in reality, we already have ""Big Marijuana"" in the form of violent Mexican drug cartels and an underground economy in the 48 states where pot remains illegal. We currently live in a nation that does not regulate the ubiquitous, thriving cannabis trade. I want to raise my children in an America that does.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq has signed its first major oil deal with a foreign company since the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, a spokesman for the Iraqi Oil Ministry said Saturday. Iraq's oil fields currently produce about 2.5 million barrels a day. It was the first time in more than 35 years that Iraq has allowed foreign oil companies to do business inside its borders. The contract with the China National Petroleum Corporation could be worth up to $3 billion. It would allow the CNPC to develop an oil field in southern Iraq's Wasit province for about 20 years, Oil Ministry spokesman Assim Jihad said. Iraq's Cabinet must still approve the contract, but Jihad said that would happen soon and work could start within a few months. The Chinese company will provide technical advisers, oil workers and equipment to develop al-Ahdab oil field, providing fuel for al-Zubaidiya power plant in Wasit, southeast of Baghdad, bordering Iran, Jihad said. Once development begins, the field is expected to start producing a preliminary amount of 25,000 barrels of oil a day and an estimated constant daily amount of 125,000 barrels after three years, he said. Iraq currently produces about 2.5 million barrels a day, 2 million of which are exported daily, Jihad said. That is close to its status before the U.S.-led war that toppled Saddam in 2003, but below its levels prior to the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Iraqi Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani said in July that he is confident Iraq will be able to double its production in the next five years. As it did with other international companies, the Saddam regime had a partnership contract with CNPC signed at the end of the 1990s that entitled the company to share profits. The current contract, however, will be only a ""service contract"" under which CNPC is simply paid for its services, Jihad said. He said Iraq has provided ""security guarantees"" for CNPC, as it would for any other foreign company that will work in Iraq's oil fields. Jihad called it a major and significant move for Iraq. Iraq sparked a scramble for lucrative oil contracts in June, when Shahrastani opened bidding to 35 international companies for long-term contracts to redevelop six oil fields. The Oil Ministry continues to negotiate short-term, no-bid contracts with several U.S. and European oil companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Chevron Corp. and BP. Iraq has among the largest oil reserves in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels, tying Iran for the No. 2 status behind Saudi Arabia's 264 billion barrels, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Iraq signs $3 billion oil deal with Chinese national oil company .

"(CNN) -- As a child, Ranjan Avasthi was once bitten by the family's German shepherd. His parents responded quickly by separating the two, bandaging his wounds and gradually reintroducing healthy interaction with the dog. Fast-forward a few decades. Avasthi, now a doctor, has a wife, child and his very own German shepherd mix. His toddler may be a bit young for cautionary tales, but Avasthi fully understands the risks and rewards of kids and pets sharing a household. As a doctor who specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, he has seen kids transform in the presence of pets. He also knows that kids will be kids. They love to grab ears, pull tails and simply rub pets the wrong way. While cats and dogs reside in roughly 84 million U.S. households without incident, accidents happen. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly half of the 800,000 medically treated dog bites each year involve children, mostly between the ages of 5 and 9 years old. Even with the most well-behaved fur kids, it's best to avoid leaving children and pets unsupervised. ""Kids naturally do things that upset cats and dogs — hugging, staring, petting on the head,"" says animal behaviorist Kristen Collins of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA.org). ""These can stress animals, and any stressed animal is more dangerous."" MNN: Rescue dogs sniff out endangered species . We all know that kids and pets can peacefully coexist. But it also helps to have an action plan, just in case your child is bitten by a pet (yes, cats bite, too). Take measures to help prevent emotional scars after a pet bites or scratches your child. Collins and Avasthi offer expert advice: . Take swift action: Remove the pet immediately, then discuss why pets may have reacted negatively. ""A lot of it is talking about what happened and asking, 'Why do you think this happened?'"" Avasthi says. ""Allow children to discuss what can be done to prevent the situation from recurring."" Teach kids to read a pet's body language: Collins strongly encourages parents to discuss body language while watching pets. ASPCA.org provides guidelines, photos and safety tips to help kids and parents recognize signs — such as flattened ears or wrinkled forehead — that indicate distress. Reinforce healthy interaction: Help kids understand how to safely approach a cat or dog. Start by asking human handlers if you can approach, then extend a closed hand for the cat or dog to smell. ""It's best if you let the pet come to you,"" Collins says. ""It can prevent a lot of bad situations."" She also recommends that kids and parents practice the proper way to pet a cat or dog using stuffed animals. Focus on areas where animals like to be petted, such as their chest or side. ""We sit with kids and talk about things dogs don't like and cats don't like,"" Collins says. ""It's equally important to explain what they do like."" MNN: Why do cats purr? Reintroduce pets slowly: Each situation differs, but psychiatrists often use exposure therapy to help patients deal with phobias, Avasthi says. The process resembles slow and deliberate steps that his parents took many years ago. Therapy may begin with kids seeing photos of puppies, then pint-sized pups and, eventually, larger dogs. During subsequent sessions, kids watch videos of pets and gradually interact with an adult cat or dog. The goal is to help kids overcome a fearful response when they think about the pet. Try a training class: Avasthi and Collins recommend training to build confidence — for kids and pets. Many dog trainers encourage kids to participate in group classes, setting the foundation for safe interaction at an early age. ""Then the child is not afraid and doesn't learn the wrong behaviors,"" Avasthi says. Collins also encourages games such as fetch, along with obedience and teaching trick training. These activities help kids learn positive interaction, and dogs learn that kids are great treat dispensers, she says. Encourage a healthy respect for Mother Nature: ""Educate kids that our house pets — even though domesticated and pets — they are animals,"" Avasthi says. ""Sometimes they may not mean to hurt us; they may be playing, irritated or even frightened."" Respecting pets also means giving them space when they show signs of being distressed, overstimulated or tired.

"(CNN) -- With her doe eyes, razor-sharp cheek bones, flowing jet black locks and the most talked-about rump in the business, it's no wonder she's on the cover of arguably the world's most prestigious fashion magazine. But in an unusual twist, the beguiling female bearing all on the front of this month's Vogue isn't a model, actress, or musician. She's not even human. Instead, the beautiful creature gracing the landmark Australian edition of the magazine is a six-year-old horse called Black Caviar. Not just any horse, but perhaps the greatest race horse of all time, unbeaten in a staggering 22 consecutive competitions across the globe and worth more than $7 million in prize money. Vogue Australia has featured Oscar-winning actresses, princesses and supermodels on its front covers, but now for the first time in the magazine's 53-year history it will be a four-legged beauty looking out from the publication's most important page. ""She's beautiful. And Vogue is about celebrating the beautiful,"" Vogue Australia editor, Edwina McCann, told CNN. ""What goes on Vogue's cover can create news in itself. It wasn't just that Black Caviar was on the cover of any women's magazine. The endorsement of the Vogue brand is a very big statement."" Since demolishing the field in her first win in the 2009 Danehill Stakes, an air of mystique has followed the world champion sprinter. Her unblemished 22-win record is the second highest of all time, only trailing behind Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Queen Elizabeth personally congratulated the magnificent mare after her nailbiting win at the prestigious Diamond Jubilee Stakes in July. It was later revealed the thoroughbred had won the esteemed title with a leg injury -- only adding to her mythical invincibility. Unsurprisingly, horse racing-mad Australians have taken the champion thoroughbred to their hearts, with diehard Black Caviar fans even traveling to the other side of the world to cheer her on at Britain's Royal Ascot. ""Her allegiance level is phenomenal,"" Colin Madden, one of Black Caviar's eight owners, said. ""She's a powerful horse who just fronts up every time and people really like that consistency."" ""I don't know if she'll replace Phar Lap -- the gelding who dominated the Australian racing scene during the Great Depression of the 1930s -- but in the pantheon of equine greats she will stand very tall."" Vogue had wanted to ""celebrate all things Australian"" for their December issue, believing Black Caviar vividly embodied the country's unique ""fighting spirit."" ""Australians are passionate about horse racing. We're the only country in the world that literally stops for a horse race -- the Melbourne Cup,"" McCann said. ""We love a champion and Black Caviar strives to win even when the chips are down -- those principles are very dear to us."" The photo shoot took place in a secret location in the Dandenong Ranges, just outside of Melbourne. Australian photographer Benny Horne captured the thoroughbred alongside compatriot model Julia Nobis in a purpose-built outdoor studio. ""Black Caviar definitely realizes when the camera is on her. Her ears go up, she sticks her head out, it's almost like she's posing,"" McCann said. ""She's such a magnificent-looking animal. Her coat is this extraordinary pitch black, almost like velvet, with this handsomely structured face and that awesome rump that propels her so fast."" Black Caviar's owners have gone to great lengths to ensure her persona is aligned with sophistication and style. Everything from her name, to her salmon-colored silks and even her own line of grooming products are modeled on classy femininity. ""Vogue is synonymous with style, glamor, celebrity and exclusivity. That a horse has appeared on the front cover says something about both horse racing and the horse itself,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University, said. ""I think the sports market has now gone beyond simple endorsement,"" he added. ""It's now more a form of strategic collaboration where brands with convergent interests associate themselves with one another."" It is a momentous cover for the magazine which has largely steered cleared of controversial models. Among its more historic front pages was the September 1993 issue featuring Elaine George, the magazine's first aboriginal model. However, ""This is definitely our most unusual cover,"" said McCann. For many aspiring models, gracing the cover of Vogue would be the ultimate elevation to 'It Girl' status. Galling then, that Black Caviar seems to have beaten them to the post yet again.","Vogue Australia features horse on front cover for first time .

"(Time.com) -- With Tuesday's unveiling of the iPad Mini and a fourth-generation full-sized iPad, this has been a major week for the iPad. On Friday, Windows 8 went on sale — making it an even bigger week for Windows PCs. But this newsiest of tech news weeks also turns out to be a reasonably significant one for the Mac. Much of Apple's Tuesday event was devoted to new models, including a substantial overhaul of the 13″ MacBook Pro with a Retina display, two absurdly thin new iMacs and an updated Mac Mini. The profusion of new models was good news for Mac fans who have been known to fret that the Mac is being neglected as the iPhone and iPad become ever more important to Apple's bottom line and future. As usual, Apple teed off its announcements with happy recent stats. I was aware that the Mac has outpaced the rest of the PC industry in sales growth for years, but I didn't know that the MacBook is the best-selling notebook line in the U.S., and the iMac is the best-selling desktop. Those achievements are more evidence that Apple's Mac strategy — build premium machines, sell them profitably and don't obsess over market share — doesn't mean that it can't end up with impressive market share anyhow. After the Tuesday presentation, I sat down with Apple Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, who did the presenting of new models on Tuesday, and chatted with him about today's Macs, and how they got that way. I began by asking him about the streamlining of Mac hardware that's been going on for years now. Apple has put its computers into unibody cases, sealed in the batteries, removed the optical drives, dumped hard disks when possible and either shrunk or eliminated many once-standard connectors. Rather than adding new features with abandon, as tech companies usually do, it's whittled the Mac down to its elegant essence. Many of these changes have been controversial, at least briefly, at least among some observers. But they don't seem to have hurt Mac sales. What was the overarching strategy, I asked? ""This is what Apple has always been about, and the Mac has been about, from the first Mac and first iMac,"" Schiller said. ""It's always been about making the best Mac we know how. Among the many benefits are making it easy to use and affordable, with great features. This high level of integration is part of delivering on that."" Schiller pointed out some of the downsides of the technologies it's removed or downplayed: rotating hard disks, for instance, use more power and are more likely to have reliability issues than solid-state storage. ""These old technologies are holding us back,"" he said. ""They're anchors on where we want to go."" ""We find the things that have outlived their useful purpose. Our competitors are afraid to remove them. We try to find better solutions — our customers have given us a lot of trust."" Apple began removing DVD burners from portable computers, where weight and thinness are paramount — at least to Apple — years ago. But the new iMacs are the first ones without optical drives. I asked Schiller if that was a more difficult decision. ""It actually comes from similar thinking as with the portables,"" Schiller said. ""In general, it's a good idea to remove these rotating medias from our computers and other devices. They have inherent issues — they're mechanical and sometimes break, they use power and are large. We can create products that are smaller, lighter and consume less power."" Schiller pointed out that one major application for optical drives, software distribution, has gone largely digital. As for video, he said that ""Blu-ray has come with issues unrelated to the actual quality of the movie that make [it] a complex and not-great technology...So for a whole plethora of reasons, it makes a lot of sense to get rid of optical discs in desktops and notebooks."" His preferred Blu-ray alternative? iTunes, of course, which lets you buy a movie and then watch it on all your Apple devices. Once upon a time, people assumed that Macs' lack of Blu-ray was a delay, not a permanent decision to fast-forward past it. I told Schiller that I imagined folks don't ask about it much these days. ""Correct,"" he said. I noted that for years, pundits thought Apple would, or at least should, start making much cheaper Macs. I said that drumbeat seems to have come and gone, and asked Schiller if everyone finally understood that Apple was content with its strategy of sticking with the high end of the market. ""Our approach at Apple has always been to make products we're proud to own and use ourselves,"" he told me. ""...We wouldn't make something cheap or low quality. When the economy is difficult, people care a great deal about the things they spend their money on. Customers have come to understand that Apple's products aren't priced high — they're priced on the value of what we build into them."" ""There's something that happened in the industry...that made that topic meaningless. There were these products being created called netbooks. People said they were the future. We rejected them because we thought they were poor. Even if the market was going there, we weren't going to chase everybody downhill."" Netbooks eventually turned out to be a fad. And of course, Apple was working on a lower-cost computing device. ""The iPad became our answer to the $500 computer. Time has proved us right on that point. And now 100 million people agree that the iPad is a great computer."" Oh yeah: I wouldn't be an inquiring reporter if I hadn't asked Schiller for his take on Windows 8 and Microsoft's strategy of building one operating system for both conventional PCs and tablets. He politely declined comment: ""Primarily, we think about what we're doing, not what others do."" At least I tried. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc. TIME is a registered trademark of Time Inc.

"(CNN) -- A Beijing court has sentenced a wheelchair-bound man, who set off a homemade explosive inside Beijing Capital International Airport in July, to six years in prison. Ji Zhongxing, 34, from Shandong province, was found guilty of setting off an explosive device in a public place, according to a statement released by Beijing Chaoyang District People's Court. It said that an investigation had found that Ji, who claimed he had been paralyzed after being beaten by security guards, was dissatisfied with how he had been treated by authorities. The court said the explosive device was contained inside a green canvas bag with the Chinese characters for revenge written on it and Ji hid the device inside his pants to evade airport security checks. At around 6pm local time on July 20, Ji handed out leaflets detailing his grievances outside the exit of terminal 3, the statement said. He then passed the explosive from hand to hand while police officers tried to persuade him not to detonate the device. Ji's arm was seriously injured during the explosion and a policeman also sustained injuries. On his personal blog in 2006, Ji had said he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation. The attack took place while Ji was working in Dongguan, a factory town in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Guangdong provincial authorities said in July that they would look into the alleged unjust treatment, The China Daily reported. However, the newspaper also reported that Dongguan police said Ji was not attacked and was instead injured when he fell off his motorcycle. Police in Ji's home county said Dongguan authorities gave him 100,000 yuan (US$16,290) in compensation in 2010. In China, people often petition local and national authorities about their grievances. CNN's Feng Ke reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong.","Beijing court has sentenced a wheelchair-bound man to six years in prison .

"Joliet, Illinois (CNN) -- The trial of former Chicago-area police Sgt. Drew Peterson, accused of killing his ex-wife, focused Wednesday on an incident in which he allegedly had threatened to kill her with a knife. Defense attorneys sought to discredit Kathleen Savio's account of the July 2002 incident, in which she had said Peterson pushed her down the stairs of her home, upset about their divorce proceedings, and told her to turn her head so he could kill her. Peterson, 58, is on trial, charged with the murder of Savio, his third wife, who was found dead in her dry, clean bathtub March 1, 2004. A classic case of domestic violence? The case did not arise until after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, went missing in October 2007. It was during the search for Stacy Peterson, who has never been found, that investigators said they would look again at Savio's death, which was initially ruled a drowning. Savio's death was ruled a homicide in February 2008, and Peterson was later arrested and indicted on first-degree murder. The court heard Wednesday afternoon from the forensic pathologist who conducted the second autopsy that led to the homicide ruling. Peterson has been called a suspect in Stacy Peterson's disappearance, though he has never been charged in that case. Wednesday morning's testimony began with the cross-examination of Bolingbrook, Illinois, Police Lt. Teresa Kernc, who took a police report from Savio about the alleged knife incident in 2002. Prosecutors examined Kernc on Tuesday. Savio had written in the police report that Peterson pushed her down the stairs and told her not to get up, then told her how ""awful and bitchy"" she was and that she should stop being so terrible to him. Savio had written that she grew tired of his rant, so she told him, ""'Go ahead, just kill me.' He said, 'Where do you want it?' and I said, 'In the head.' He said, 'OK, then turn your head,' and I did it. And then he said that he would never be able to hurt me. And then he left."" Kernc testified that Savio told her verbally that Peterson threatened her with a knife, but that she didn't include it when she wrote her statement. ""I told her to put in the report what happened. I said, 'The knife part isn't in here. You need to put in here what actually happened,'"" Kernc testified. ""Then she wrote it in there, and a short time later she crossed the knife part out. She expressed concern about him being arrested and losing his job."" Defense attorney Steve Greenberg noted the incident is alleged to have happened July 5, 2002, but that Savio didn't call Kernc to make the report until July 18. He also pointed out that Peterson had served Savio with a criminal complaint just ""10 or 15 minutes"" before she filed the police report, but that she never mentioned that to Kernc. Is the defense team too confident? Savio had told Kernc that after Peterson left she immediately called several people, including friend and neighbor Mary Pontarelli, and told them about the knife incident. But according to Greenberg, Pontarelli said Savio described only a ""nice conversation"" with her husband. That description was ""consistent"" with what Peterson told Kernc when she interviewed him about the incident, Greenberg said. Kernc ended her testimony by saying she wasn't sure whether Savio was telling the truth about Peterson wielding a knife. ""You had some concerns about whether that actually happened?"" Greenberg asked. ""Yes,"" Kernc replied. ""And that was based on your complete investigation?"" he asked. ""Yes,"" Kernc said. The afternoon session of the trial was expected to include testimony by the doctor who performed Savio's second autopsy, and by Scott Rossetto, Stacy Peterson's friend. In the afternoon, the court heard from Dr. Larry Blum, who performed the autopsy on Salvio's body after she was exhumed in 2007. Blum testified that Savio suffered a laceration to the back of her scalp, which led to dried blood on her face and around the drain when she was found. He said it would have been ""impossible"" for the blood to have dried like that had there been water in the tub. He also testified that Salvio had a number of fresh bruises -- less than an hour old -- on the front of her body, including to her hip bones, thigh, shins, and hands. Blum said he also found a fresh abrasion on her buttocks that ""would not be consistent with someone's slip and fall."" He did not testify about why the first autopsy would have ruled her death accidental. The Peterson trial began July 31 and is expected to last about four weeks. Repeated missteps by the prosecution are angering Judge Edward Burmila and the defense. At least four times since the trial began, prosecutors have allowed witnesses to testify to details Burmila has told them not to go into -- such as whether Savio had a protective order against her husband or allowing Blum to demonstrate climbing into the bathtub. In some cases the defense has sought a mistrial and in others they have asked the judge to strike entire testimony. Burmila has instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders. ""The disrespect to the court is shocking,"" Burmila told the prosecution Wednesday. Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, whom he would later marry. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. Savio's order of protection . On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home, spending the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed Savio. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. The defense contends Savio fell accidentally, hit her head, and drowned.

"(CNN) -- Throughout history, the greatest artists have relied on their muses to inspire, enchant and satisfy them. Pablo Picasso immortalized mistress Dora Maar in his 1937 painting Weeping Woman, Andy Warhol catapulted model Edie Sedgwick to ""It Girl"" status in his 1960s avant-garde films, while Leonardo da Vinci made the woman behind his ""Mona Lisa"" perhaps the most famous muse of all time. But the elusive figure of the muse doesn't always have to be that of a beautiful woman. The dark beauty with flowing locks and sinewy limbs depicted in artist Michael Kirkbride's latest painting isn't a luscious lady -- it's a horse. Not just any horse, but arguably the greatest race horse of all time. Since demolishing the field in his first major win at the Royal Lodge Stakes in 2010, an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred Frankel. The superstar colt, who even has its own twitter handle, has not just won all 14 of his races -- he has won them by staggering margins, destroying world-class fields,becoming by a distance the top-rated race horse on the planet. In his last race, the thoroughbred won the Champion Stakes at Ascot, with a sell-out crowd of 32,000 catching a final glimpse of the now-celebrity horse as as he powered to a dramatic victory. Writer Blaine Ward's personal ""Frankel moment"" came earlier in the horse's stellar career, an experience which later paved the way for artist Kirkbride to paint his unusual surrealist work. ""I had been watching last year's 2000 Guineas race on TV when Frankel just pounded the other horses into the ground,"" said Ward. ""He easily won by a good six lengths -- none of the others even came close. ""In my mind's eye I saw Frankel smashing through the screen into my living room; this powerful, beautiful, almost mythical beast."" A 51-year-old former solicitor from Sunderland in north-east England, Blaine was so moved by Frankel's win he wrote a poem about the centaur-like creature bursting into his suburban home in a blaze of glory. It read in part: . ""Then a smell of burnt air mixed with horse-flesh . when the telly exploded in his face . as the Frankel centaur burst in . green and pink silk, fluid powerful grace."" It was a special sporting moment and had a profound effect on Ward, who described Frankel's win as akin to watching boxer Muhammad Ali or footballer Lionel Messi in action. ""It was one of those rare times when you get a sense you've just witnessed somebody or something at the very pinnacle of sporting prowess,"" he said. ""Mere words are never good enough to do it justice."" And so Ward enlisted Kirkbride, a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (RADA) to paint the champion horse powering into a suburban living room, knocking Ward and his wife from their chairs and spilling their afternoon gin and tonics to the floor. ""The result is a surreal cocktail of his words and my interpretation in art form,"" Kirkbride said. ""The modern domestic scene is shattered by the magisterial beast that is Frankel."" Kirkbride painted the work, called ""Armchair Ride,"" in egg tempura; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the 1st Century. The method, which gives a luminous quality, was later superseded by oil painting around the 15th Century. ""It has a kind of stained glass quality to it, like shining a light from behind,"" said Kirkbride. ""The pinks and blues of Frankel's silks are quite strong and I thought they really lent themselves to the medium."" Kirkbride is perhaps best known for his paintings of English football scenes, such as ""Chech Mates,"" which captures the unusual tradition of Chelsea fans throwing celery, or ""Bar Kick,"" which portrays sporting revelry in a pub. After Saturday though, and Kirkbride will be painting fabulous Frankel smashing not just a TV screen, but the record books all over again.","From Picasso's Dora Maar to Andy Warhol's Edie Sedgwick, muses inspire great artists .

"(CNN) -- With construction cranes and steel skyscrapers dominating the skyline of Luanda, the capital of Angola, it is hard to overlook how far the southwestern African country has come since the end of its brutal civil war in 2002. Over the last decade, the oil-rich nation has emerged from the wreckage of a 27-year vicious conflict to become today one of the major economic players in the continent. As the country, sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy, heads to the polls Friday for its second peacetime elections, a new generation of post-war youth, many of whom have no direct memories of conflict, will cast their ballots for the first time. ""There's a new generation coming, emerging in the scene,"" says Markus Weimer, coordinator of the Angola Forum at Chatham House. ""New generation, new ideas and new demands on the government which is very interesting and that is one of the reasons why these elections are so important."" New constitution . Friday's elections will only be Angola's third poll since the lusophone country gained independence from Portugal in 1975 -- elections in 1992 were abandoned midway and led to an outbreak of further violence, while the 2008 parliamentary vote was won by the ruling MPLA party with a landslide 82%. Under the terms of a new constitution approved in 2010, the leader of the party that wins Friday's parliamentary vote will automatically become Angola's president. ""This is the first time since 1992 that the President will have a democratic mandate,"" says Weimer. Watch: Angola's growth . Nine political parties and coalitions, including MPLA's civil war enemy UNITA, are running on Friday's elections, when more than nine million voters will go to the polls to elect the 220 members of the National Assembly. Analysts expect MPLA to win again with a sizeable majority, allowing incumbent President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who's been in power since 1979, to have five more years in office. Opinion: Is oil-rich Angola a development success? They note, however, that the ruling party's margin of victory will be smaller than in 2008. ""I think that the last elections where MPLA won the 82% of the vote is unlikely to be repeated,"" says Weimer. ""That was a 'freak' sort of result that had many historical and social reasons -- the war, demographics, etc. -- but I think this is now going to drop."" Electoral process . In 2008, UNITA accused MPLA of rigging the elections after gaining 10% of the vote. The opposition party has also been complaining about irregularities since the start of the current election campaign, arguing that the MPLA controls the state media and undermines the electoral process. While both the Southern African Development Community and the African Union have sent a team of election observers in Angola, the European Union has decided not to deploy a mission in the country -- in contrast to the 2008 poll. ""That could be a serious deficit,"" says Weimer, adding that ""legitimacy is the most crucial issue"" of Friday's vote. He notes that the ruling party has the most to lose if the poll is seen as illegitimate, both within the country and abroad. ""If these elections are fine and everything goes smoothly, then it will send a signal to the world that Angola is not just a country that is run by one person, but actually institutions than can provide stability,"" says Weimer. Economic boom . The long-serving Dos Santos, who turned 70 on Tuesday, has maintained peace and political stability in the country since 2002, presiding over Angola's post-war economic growth and rebuilding efforts. Greased by growing oil revenues and China's credit lines of billions of dollars, Angola's economy rocketed by an average annual growth of 17% from 2004 to 2008 before falling to single-digit figures after the 2008 crisis. Watch: Angola's economic potential . Angola is the second-biggest oil producer in Africa, turning out more than 1.9 million barrels per day, and boasts an expanding investment portfolio in its former colonial master, Portugal, and other parts of Africa. Tasked with rebuilding the country after decades of fighting, the government has pumped vast sums in recent years to repair a shattered infrastructure as well as build hospitals, universities and sports centers. Currently, it also allocates over 30% of its budget to social spending. Sharing the oil wealth? But despite the heady financial data and the progress made since 2002, Angola still remains one of the most unequal societies in the world. The country, which has a population of some 18 million people, ranks 148th out of 187 countries in the U.N.'s Human Development Index. This year the economy is expected to expand by 8.2% but critics say the billions of dollars from oil revenues have failed to close the stark gap between a tiny wealthy elite and the millions of poor living without access to electricity, water supply and sanitation. Next to the sleek skyscrapers and luxury apartments in Luanda, which was last year named as the world's most expensive city for expats, ramshackle shantytowns and crowded slums spread for miles toward every direction, housing millions of people living on less than $2 a day. ""The MPLA and this government has not developed the country. It's made lots of projects and has pulled in a lot of investments but nothing has actually trickled down,"" says Paula Cristina Roque, an Angola expert at Oxford University. ""We haven't seen peace dividends of the nature that we need to see to actually cut back the poverty levels in the country,"" she adds. Corruption further exacerbates discontent among the population, with Angola ranked 168th out of 183 countries on Transparency International's 2011 Corruption Perceptions Index. Calls for economy diversification . Last year, Angola's mining sector, dominated by oil, accounted for nearly half of the country's GDP. But, with the petroleum sector providing jobs for 1% of the population, many have long been calling for the country to take more bold steps to diversify its economy to create jobs and help people lift out of poverty -- unemployment has been averaging an estimated 26% in the last five years. ""Whatever the Angolan economy does, it needs to create jobs, it needs to sustain itself beyond oil,"" says Roque. ""They absolutely need to diversify and very quickly."" New generation . Amid such a background, a number of small but consistent demonstrations have taken place in Angola since last year, revealing a growing frustration over the economic hardship still experienced by many in the country. Over the last few months, civil war veterans have taken to the streets to demand overdue subsidy payments while parts of disgruntled youth and civil rights activists have also staged rallies to voice their concerns over the lack of jobs and opportunities. Roque says the injection of a dynamic post-war youth into Angolan politics could shape the country's politics on Friday and beyond. ""People are no longer willing to give them [the government] a blind mandate,"" she says. ""They're actually now wanting more accountability and we've started seeing that in every way...The fear barrier has been lifted in Angola.""","Angola is heading to the polls Friday for its second peacetime elections .

"(CNN) -- ""Jamaica, we have a bobsled team,"" cried the Hollywood film that immortalized an unlikely quartet of Winter Olympians who became the story of the 1988 Games. The novelty of four Jamaicans swapping their tropical Caribbean homeland for the freezing slopes of Canada to become the first team from their country to compete in the bobsleigh was a story that resonated around the world. It also planted a seed in the brain of another Jamaican who, 22 years later, began his quest to ski at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Now 42, Michael Williams is hoping he'll be the next pioneer from the Great Antilles to blaze a trail in sport -- though perhaps not quite to the same extent as the world's fastest man Usain Bolt. ""I actually watched 'Cool Runnings' and the bobsleigh team from 1988 and was inspired,"" Williams, who refers to himself as ""The Dream Chaser,"" told CNN's Alpine Edge show. ""I just thought it was the coolest thing -- Jamaica in the Winter Olympics and they did well. ""I watched a lot of skiing during those Olympics, Alberto Tomba (Italian who won two golds in Calgary) was the king of the Games and I thought, 'Wow, it's incredible what these guys can do.' ""I thought I'd love to combine the two, represent Jamaica and ski for Jamaica some time in my life. Jamaica is really proud there's another guy trying to do what the bobsleigh guys did in 1988."" But it wasn't until the 2010 installment of the Games in Vancouver that Williams, who was born and raised by his West Indian mother in Canada, was spurred on to transform his pipe dream into a reality, as another pair of underdogs took on the establishment. Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, known as the ""Snow Leopard,"" was the first person from Ghana to qualify for the Winter Olympics. He skied in the slalom and made quite an impression with his eccentric outfits. Jamaican Errol Kerr also made an impact, securing ninth place in the skicross event -- the highest finish ever by a Caribbean athlete at the Winter Games. Williams was now a man on a mission. ""I saw a report on CNN with the Snow Leopard who qualified from Ghana for the Winter Olympics in 2010,"" he explained. ""I was on my couch and when I saw that, that just put a click in my head and I said, 'If this guy can do it, I can do it.' ""I knew we had a Jamaican Ski Federation because I heard about Errol Kerr, but the Snow Leopard really inspired me to get off my butt and call them."" There was just one problem: Williams had no idea how to ski. He drove straight to an indoor ski slope near his home in Frankfurt, Germany, and threw himself at the mercy of its resident coach, who quickly realized the scale of his task. ""I met one of my instructors, Andre, and he took me skiing a couple of times in the indoor hall and said 'You can't ski at all, but I like your attitude and I'll definitely work with you.' ""I actually picked up the phone and called Errol Kerr's mum and said, 'Listen, I know your son skis for Jamaica, how did he get in the team?' She gave me some tips and the rest is history."" The task facing Williams is a tough one. He needs to bring his points average down to 140 by January 2014 to have a shot at qualifying for Sochi -- it is currently 763. His best finish this season is 43rd out of 45 finishers at an event in Schladming in Austria back in February. In the actual world championships event the following day he was 63rd, but did not qualify for the final race. Williams has had many obstacles to overcome, not just in sporting terms, but also with the image of him held by the seasoned professionals on the skiing circuit, who offered him a somewhat frosty reception to begin with. ""In the beginning I went to a race, my first race, in a blue ski jacket, black pants, a helmet that wasn't regulation, I borrowed the boots from the actual hill where we had the race. I just wanted to try it and I looked like a vacationer going skiing!"" he said. ""These guys were just looking at me at the top of the hill going 'What are you doing here?' but I didn't care, I just sort of went about my ways, closed my eyes and air planed down the hill and managed to make it."" Williams has dedicated his life to fulfilling his dream, training for eight hours a day -- four on the slopes and the rest taken up with work on technique and conditioning. His mum beams with pride whenever he competes on the international stage under the Jamaican flag, so what would it be like if he realized his dream and made it to Sochi? ""It would be incredible,"" he said. ""I think the moment you walk into the stadium with all the other athletes and you're holding up your flag ... to me, it's incredible. ""I've played a lot of sports in my life -- I've played professional American Football, and I know what it's like to achieve something in sports, but I think the Olympics, summer or winter, is the pinnacle of any sporting achievement. ""I'd be really proud, it would be awesome.""","Michael Williams aiming to qualify for 2014 Winter Olympics with Jamaica .

"(CNN) -- A leading anti-racism group has applauded UEFA's decision to appeal against sanctions handed out to the Serbian Football Association for ""improper conduct"" following allegations of racist chanting. The European governing body has confirmed it will appeal against all punishments following the under-21 qualifying game between Serbia and England in Krusevac on October 16. While UEFA president Michel Platini had hinted at seeking tougher sanctions, the news of an appeal came following a statement in which ""the UEFA disciplinary inspector felt it necessary to immediately confirm his intention to appeal on UEFA's behalf."" FARE -- a network of anti-discrimination and inclusion groups which tackles racism, xenophobia and homophobia across European football, says the latest developments are hugely encouraging . ""UEFA's decision to appeal is very welcome,"" executive director Piara Powar told the English Press Association. ""We had been lobbying for it and like a lot of other people within UEFA felt this was the right thing to do."" Serbia was ordered to play one under-21 match behind closed doors was fined $105,000. The team's assistant coach Predrag Katic and fitness coach Andreja Milunovic were also banned from football for two years. In addition, four Serbia players were suspended with Goran Causic banned for four games, Ognjen Mudrinski and Filip Malbasic for three and Nikola Ninkovic for two. UEFA will also challenge the decision to hand England duo Steven Caulker and Tom Ince two and one-match bans. The pair were caught up in a brawl during the playoff game, which was sparked following allegations of racist abuse directed at England's Danny Rose. UEFA's Serbia fine heavily criticized . Critics of UEFA have accused accusing the organization of failing to find a suitable punishment. During the 2012 European Championship finals, Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner was fined $125,800 for exposing boxer shorts with the logo of an online betting company . Earlier this year, Manchester City officials were infuriated after the club was fined $40,000 by UEFA for taking to the pitch late for a Europa League game -- which was $13,000 more than FC Porto's sanction for fans' racist abuse during a game against the English team. Powar added: ""UEFA now have an opportunity to send out a message and it takes a lot of honesty and self-reflection to admit that one arm of the organisation got it wrong. ""It's a good lead for other national associations to follow if they issue a sanction that on reflection doesn't get the right message across, such as the (English) FA in a certain case earlier this year."" Racism row shines light on Serbian football . Tottenham's Rose, who is currently on loan at Sunderland, was shown a red card after the final whistle for kicking the ball away in anger after complaining he had been subjected to monkey chants throughout the contest. ""As per the UEFA disciplinary regulations, the UEFA disciplinary inspector has the right to open disciplinary investigations and to lodge appeals against decisions taken by the control and disciplinary body,"" read a statement on UEFA's website. ""Having reviewed the motivated decisions for the sanctions imposed in this specific case, which have also been provided to all parties, the UEFA disciplinary inspector felt it necessary to immediately confirm his intention to appeal on UEFA's behalf.""","UEFA has appealed against decision of its own disciplinary body .

"(CNN) -- If you think television is like junk food, then binging on it is not for you. But there are many people not like you who love pixelated brain candy and think binge-viewing is the only way to devour a season (or more) of TV programming properly -- and networks are slowly beginning to take note. More and more viewers are turning on to elaborately scripted shows, tuning in via digitized devices and not dropping out: They're watching marathons of their own making. Instead of watching live each week by ""appointment,"" viewers are taking a full day (or weekend or even week) to watch a show's entire season or a series from beginning to end. This may sound gluttonous and monotonous, but bingers see it differently -- a richer and more contemplative form of TV watching in which every nuance is savored and analyzed. Providers are adapting to this craving for deeper, heartier, 22-course meals. Netflix recently premiered, all at once, the entire first season of its new political thriller ""House of Cards,"" and the TV streaming apps HBOGo and HuluPlus have salad-bar layouts that make it easier than ever for viewers to immerse themselves fully in an entire series. The commercial reasons that once encouraged channels to sacrifice narrative quality for episodic quantity are fading, especially as many viewers turn away from monthly subscriptions in favor of the per-episode (or per-season) prix fixe to be found, say, at Amazon.com, which dabbles both in online streaming and DVD sales. My friends who binge-watch don't collapse into their couches, they commit to them, and this makes them demand a little more from programmers. Shows such as ""Mad Men,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Arrested Development"" are richer in lengthy doses: The more time spent in those worlds, the deeper your appreciation for the changing times in the offices of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, the intricate history and tenuous alliances between the Baratheons and Starks, and the subtle, recurring jokes of the Bluth family. Watching, reading or listening to anything creative requires a suspension of disbelief, an investment of our reality in theirs. Every commercial break erodes that thin and personal connection a little; weeklong gaps between episodes stretch us closer and closer to the point at which our attention snaps and moves elsewhere. Viewership declines, sometimes before a show has an opportunity to catch on, as with the often-discussed ""Firefly"" or the more recent ""Last Resort,"" which struggled to find the hook that would keep audiences coming back. The pacing of some shows hardly even works on an individual level: Though he wouldn't dare to tell you how to watch it, creator David Simon would probably agree that binging on the entirety of ""The Wire"" at once, letting the bigger picture wash over you, would bring you closer to his vision for the show. Binge-watching can make for good TV. The actors on any number of indistinguishable cop shows are entertaining, affable, gruff or quirky, but I'd turn to ""The Good Wife's"" long-term development any day ... and the only reason I got hooked on it is because I spent a flu-ridden week catching up on the first two seasons. And that's just network television: Several of the friends whom I introduced to ""Breaking Bad"" chose not to watch the first half of the final season, preferring to get it later in one high-intensity dose. These friends picked up on subtle cues I hadn't noticed late in that fourth season, were better able to get inside Walter White's head, and became more a part of the series than I ever had: They'd fully fallen down that serialized rabbit hole, and now I was the one who seemed like the dilettante, merely putting in an hour each week, scraping the icing off the top of the seven-layered cake. More critically, when another friend recently took a one-week safari through ""Lost,"" he could clearly distinguish its shark-jumping moment, whereas those of us who had watched live were suckered in, fond memories of the past overshadowing the tainted present. The more we change our viewing habits, the more the networks will adapt to fit them, and the higher the level of long-term programming networks will have to provide, no longer spider-webbing up plots on the fly in an attempt to deceptively tangle us into tuning in next week. The shift from casual couch-surfing to brisk binging also encourages television to be bolder in its storytelling, to develop characters and settings as opposed to just plots: the difference between literature and pulp, not that you can't have both. Producing for the binger might also ease the stress of syndication, in which characters so often reset to the status quo that they might as well be contortionists on ""The Simpsons."" And wouldn't advertising targeted at the people who would raptly sit through 10 hours of ""Battlestar Galactica"" be more effective than scatter-shot rounds of the generic stuff? Appointment television is dying, supplanted by On Demand features that allow viewers to set the schedules. As each generation grows older and decides it is not writing the Great American Novel, perhaps we'll choose to watch the Great American Television Show, and realize it's better when we don't have to break the illusion and set down the book for a week after every chapter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Riccio.","Aaron Riccio: Many people are binge-watching TV series, devouring seasons in a sitting .

"(CNN) -- England footballer Rio Ferdinand accused European football's governing body of not taking racism seriously enough after the Serbian FA was fined US$105,000 following an Under-21 match where opposing England players said they were racially abused. ""UEFA are not serious at all on racism. Fines do not work at all. They have zero impact on federations/clubs/fans/players,"" Ferdinand wrote on Twitter. On Thursday, UEFA issued various punishments to both Serbia and England following incidents that broke out after their Under-21 teams met in a 2013 European Championship qualifier in October. In addition to banning two Serbian coaches as well as a total of six players from both sides, UEFA also ordered the eastern Europeans to play their next competitive Under-21 match behind closed doors. In chaotic scenes at the end of the match in the Serb city Krusevac, England defender Danny Rose was sent off for kicking the ball away in response to what he said was racist and physical abuse -- while fans, coaches and other players also clashed. Ferdinand -- whose brother was at the center of a racism row involving Chelsea defender John Terry -- suggested that UEFA should contact the current generation of footballers to discuss ways to eradicate racism within European football. ""UEFA need to talk to this generation.....they don't seem to be up to date on this issue?? Harsh punishments needed as a deterrent,"" said the 34-year-old Manchester United player. UEFA's punishment of the Serbian FA falls short of the $125,800 fine it handed to Denmark international Niklas Bendtner for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company during the 2012 European Championships. The English FA, which banned Terry for four matches in September following his racial abuse of QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in a match last year, backed the elder Ferdinand's viewpoint, agreeing that the punishment should have been tougher. ""We are disappointed with the sanctions levied by UEFA with regards to the racist behavior displayed towards England's players,"" FA General Secretary Alex Horne said in a statement. ""Let's be clear, racism is unacceptable in any form, and should play no part in football. The scenes were deplorable and we do not believe the sanction sends a strong enough message."" Horne added that the FA is set to appeal the two-year and one-year bans handed out to Steven Caulker and Thomas Ince respectively, with both players set to miss the opening matches of next year's European Under-21 Championship. Serbia's assistant coach Predrag Katić and fitness coach Andreja Milunović received two-year suspensions from football, with both able to return to the game sooner if they avoid similar incidents during their bans. Following the scuffles that broke out after England had booked their qualification for the 2013 European Championships with a 2-0 aggregate wins, the Serbian players to be banned are Goran Caušić, Ognjen Mudrinski, Filip Malbašić and Nikola Ninković. Earlier this year, Manchester City were infuriated after being fined $40,000 by UEFA for taking to the pitch late for a Europa League game - which was $13,000 more than FC Porto's sanction for fans' racist abuse during a game against the English club.","Serbian FA fined US$105,000 for incidents following Under-21 clash with England in October .

WHEREAS, the respective Parties, the Apple Fanboys (also known as ""Apple Fanbois,"" ""Fanb0yz,"" ""iPhoners"" or simply ""The Mac Faithful,"" among many other names) and the Samsung Fanboys (also known as ""Apple H4terz,"" ""Galaxians"" or ""Androiders"") seek a lasting peace, both online and off, and... WHEREAS, online forums, queues for new products and technology blogs have become polluted with smack talk, useless feature comparisons and Photoshopped ads meant to deride and belittle each other's device preference, and... WHEREAS both sets of Parties recognize that a competitive market is both critical and necessary for continued technological innovation to benefit all, especially early adopters... NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree to abide by the agreements herein, enumerated in the terms of the articles set forth below: . ARTICLE 1 . Apple Fanboys agree not to keep bringing up the August 2012 $1 billion patent verdict against Samsung as a way of trying to squelch any disagreement over who may have copied what, recognizing that the case covered a limited scope of features. Samsung Fanboys will similarly cease efforts to end all arguments by discussing ""Open"" versus ""Closed"" platforms, accepting that there are numerous advantages and disadvantages to each. ARTICLE 2 . Apple Fanboys won't list how many apps are available for iOS (more than 700,000, since the treaty brought it up) on every message board about app development while Samsung Fanboys will minimize cross-Party discussion of expandable SD-card memory, replaceable batteries, screen size, NFC technology or how Android's notifications are still way better than Apple's, even after Notification Center was added to iOS and Mac OS X. ARTICLE 3 . Both Parties will agree that Widgets, often touted as a selling point by Samsung Fanboys, are actually kinda dumb, but then so is Apple's ""Podcast"" app, which is just absolutely the worst.

"(CNN) -- As air crash investigators pick over the wreckage of flight QV301 -- the Lao Airlines plane that crashed in bad weather on Tuesday with 50 people on board -- concerns over air safety are growing as the number of flights in South East Asia increases. A steep rise in air traffic in countries like Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia -- fueled by a boom in tourism -- means domestic air regulators are having to contend with creaking infrastructure and a lack of experience in maintaining internationally recognized standards. Laos has a patchy record on air safety, logging 30 fatal air accidents since the 1950s according to the Aviation Safety Network, though data shows things have started to improve in the past decade. The story in other emerging markets in South East Asia tells a similar story. Both the U.S. State Department and Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office have issued travel warnings directly related to the aviation industry in Myanmar -- also known as Burma -- following an incident in 2012, when an Air Bagan plane carrying more than 60 passengers crashed on Christmas Day. The State Department has warned travelers to keep in mind Myanmar's sometimes shadowy record regarding its civil aviation report card. ""The safety records of Burma's domestic airlines are not open to the public, nor is public information available concerning the Burma government's oversight of domestic airlines,"" it says on its website. But Myanmar aims to change that by setting its sights on the release of a national civil aviation policy to prepare for the traffic boom that threatens to overwhelm its inadequate air transport infrastructure. Government forecasts predict annual visitors to rise to six million in 2017 from its current 1.5 million annually, and its fast growing airline industry has received applications from four airlines owned by Burmese nationals, adding to the seven domestic carriers currently. Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst with ratings agency Standard and Poor's, said standards differed dramatically across the South East Asian region. ""It varies from country to country and airline to airline. In first world countries, Singapore Hong Kong and Malaysia, there are few concerns about the safety of aviation because they've had a long track record,"" Yusof told CNN. ""But then you have developing markets in Indonesia and Indochina -- and Myanmar is another country which is up and coming -- where it's really up to the operators to keep abreast with different maintenance and training requirements. ""Increasingly with the growth of low-cost airlines in the region, there will be issues surrounding safety especially in countries that are well known for safety."" He said infrastructure in Myanmar would be under strain if it didn't keep pace with the growth of the market. Overcrowding is already an issue in Myanmar where of the 600,000 people who visited Myanmar by air last year, 500,000 arrived in Yangon, its former capital. according to industry reports. In August this year, Myanmar's Department of Civil Aviation announced plans to improve and expand Yangon International Airport and Mandalay International Airport, as well to develop the new Hanthawaddy International Airport 50 miles (80 km) north of Yangon. ""The equipment and facilities in Myanmar are quite old and with the rise of tourism they really need to get up to speed and get foreign experts to come in and help develop that market as quickly as they can,"" Yusof said. ""We are not seeing that happen as swiftly as we'd like to."" He said Indonesia was the real emerging market in the South East Asian aviation industry, but it also needed to catch up with respect to infrastructure requirements. ""The growth of discount carriers in Indonesia is phenomenal -- they are actually driving the market in the whole region but investment in infrastructure and airports and technology is not keeping pace with the growth of aviation economics in that country. ""The story is the same all over Indochina excluding Thailand, of course. In places like Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, they need to do more than simply open the doors to tourism. ""Safety is fundamental if you want a functioning aviation industry.""","Concerns grow over safety amid South East Asia budget carrier boom .

"(CNN) -- Bradford City will have one final chapter to write in its fairytale story after defying all the odds to realize its dream of playing in a major final at the iconic Wembley Stadium. Bradford, which plays in the fourth tier of English football, was beaten 2-1 at Premier League Aston Villa Tuesday, but prevailed 4-3 on aggregate to become the first team from its division to reach the final of the League Cup since 1962 . Facing a team worth millions of dollars, it was a collection of players assembled for less than $12,000, which drew on its bravery, courage and no shortage of skill to do the unthinkable. 'Giant-killers' Bradford stun Aston Villa in League Cup . Not since 1911 when it won the FA Cup has Bradford appeared in a major cup final and now it will compete for the previously unimaginable prospect of playing in European competition next season. Either Chelsea or Swansea will provide the opposition on February 24, but thoughts of that can wait while City bask in the glory of a wonderful tale. It is an incredible story for a club which dropped out of the Premier League 12 years ago and disappeared from the higher echelons of the game in frightening fashion. Financial woes and three relegations in six years followed, but the Yorkshire club has now awoken from its slumber and breathed romance into the English game. French minnows triumph . Leading 3-1 against Premier League Aston Villa, a club owned by American businessman Randy Lerner, the visitor fell behind in the 24th minute when Belgian striker Christian Benteke flicked home. But Bradford, which had already defeated Premier League teams Wigan and Arsenal in earlier rounds, refused to be denied. And with 10 minutes of the second half gone, James Hanson headed home a dramatic equalizer to restore his side's overall advantage. Villa, which sits 17th out of 20 in the Premier League, has endured a disappointing season under manager Paul Lambert. It has been thrashed 8-0 by Chelsea, while also suffering home defeats by Tottenham, Wigan and Southampton. Manager Lambert has been under increasing pressure with the threat of relegation continuing to loom on the horizon. But the 1982 European champion was still expected to defeat a Bradford side which is 10th in its own league. Arsenal stunned by fourth tier Bradford . Instead it was City which looked the more likely to win the game outright with Garry Thompson smashing his effort against the crossbar, while Hanson failed to hit the target when well placed. Villa did eventually move back in front in the 89th minute when Andreas Weimann nipped in to fire home, but it was too little, too late, for the home side. Dreamland . ""Coming here two goals up we had a great chance,"" Bradford manager Phil Parkinson told Sky Sports. ""In the first half Villa were excellent, but in the second I thought we were excellent and deserved it. ""We felt in the first half we didn't pass the ball and in the second we got hold of the ball and had a period of possession. We knew Villa are an attacking team that would leave space for us. ""It's dreamland. We said we had a chance to make history and it's absolutely tremendous."" Italy . Meanwhile, in Italy, Lazio scored a late goal to claim a 1-1 draw at Juventus in the first leg of its Coppa Italia semifinal. Captain Stefano Mauri scored an 86th minute equalizer to cancel out Federico Peluso's earlier strike. Juventus wasted a whole host of chances with Arturo Vidal hitting a post and Federico Marchetti making a vital clearance off the line. The two teams will meet again in the second leg on January 29.","Minnow Bradford City progresses to League Cup Final .

"(CNN)  -- Improper wiring by military contractor KBR at U.S. bases in Iraq led to electrical shocks about once every three days for nearly two years, according to Defense Department documents obtained by CNN. Sgt. Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008. Houston, Texas-based KBR, the military contractor responsible for maintaining and providing services at most of U.S. bases across Iraq, had ""systemic failures"" in its electrical work that threatened the life, health and safety of people inside the bases, according to the documents, from a violation report obtained by CNN. There were 231 electrical shocks of personnel in Iraq from September 2006 through July 2008 in facilities maintained by KBR, the documents state. KBR has been at the center of controversy surrounding the electrocution of soldiers on bases in Iraq. Much of the controversy has surrounded the electrocution of Sgt. Ryan Maseth, a highly decorated 24-year old Green Beret from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Maseth was electrocuted in a shower on a U.S. base in Baghdad, Iraq, on January 2, 2008. At least 18 troops have been electrocuted in Iraq since 2003, and many of the electrocutions have been attributed to shoddy electrical work done on U.S. bases -- work managed by U.S. contractors -- according to Pentagon sources. Each of the electrocutions has occurred in different locations and under various circumstances. The violation report shows that electrical shocks and problems with wiring and grounding continued for much of last year, long after Maseth's electrocution. Heather Browne, a KBR spokesperson, said the company could not comment on the specific language in the document obtained by CNN because KBR had not seen it. But the company has previously said that ""KBR found no link between work it's been asked to perform and the reported electrocutions"" and that ""KBR remains committed to the safety and security of all employees and those the company serves. We have fully cooperated with the government when issues have been raised about work in Iraq and we will continue to do so."" On the death of Maseth, the company has said, ""KBR's investigation has produced no evidence that KBR was responsible for Sgt. Maseth's death. We have cooperated fully with all government agencies investigating this matter and will do so in the future."" Last week, CNN obtained other documents that show the Army investigator assigned to look into Maseth's electrocution blamed KBR for the death, stating that she believed the cause was ""negligent homicide"" and that there is ""credible information that KBR's negligence led to Maseth's death."" The revelations about the frequency of shocks on bases are found in the complete and detailed report that led to KBR's citation for being in serious violation of its contract several months ago. At that time, the Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency gave KBR what is known as a ""Level III Corrective Action Request."" That is issued only when a contractor is found in ""serious non-compliance"" and is just one step below the possibility of suspending or terminating a contract, Pentagon officials said. While that violation citation was previously known, the report's precise language and details of KBR's alleged ""failures"" were not known until now. The 45-page report alleges KBR had improper electrical wiring, grounding and overall electrical problems across Iraq. ""The government found systemic KBR failures to properly ground and bond facilities -- failures that contributed to theater personnel receiving shocks in KBR maintained facilities on average once every three days"" between September 2006 and July 31, 2008, the detailed report says. That information, the report says, came from KBR's own statistical records. ""The conditions of these facilities created Life, Health, Safety (LHS) conditions for the occupants. The lack of grounding and bonding, among other electrical deficiencies"" were ""identified and confirmed by three separate independent inspection teams"" from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Army Combat Safety Center and a multinational force working with fire and electricity, the report states. ""Most facilities inspected had electrical deficiencies because KBR failed to consistently follow contract standards every time it constructed or emplaced a facility, inspected a facility, responded to a service order request, or performed maintenance and/or repairs on facilities, generators and utilities,"" the report says. Also, the report says, ""the Government is unaware of any efforts undertaken by KBR to independently identify, assess, and implement corrective actions to its electrical support services or quality control inspection program as a result of the extensive number of electrical shock incidents. ... "" Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pennsylvania, said his office has received numerous anecdotal reports of U.S. military personnel continuing to receive electric shocks. ""While KBR continues to assure the American people that it has completed its own investigations and has found no evidence of corporate wrongdoing, the emerging facts prove otherwise,"" Casey said. ""According to an internal investigation led by the Pentagon's contract auditors, we now know that KBR failed to comply with basic contractual requirements even while being rewarded with billions of dollars by U.S. taxpayers."" Casey called on the Pentagon ""to treat this issue for the danger it represents."" The Defense Department, he said, ""has taken some encouraging actions [but] it needs to do much more."" ""And it is high time that KBR begin to suffer real consequences for what I consider to be blatant contractual noncompliance,"" Casey said.","More than 230 shocks reported at U.S. bases in Iraq in 23 months, report says .

"Editor's note: Bishop T.D. Jakes is founder and senior pastor of The Potter's House of Dallas, Texas, a multiracial, nondenominational church with more than 50 outreach ministries. Bishop T.D. Jakes says the church must sound the alarm to wake America from its slumber. (CNN) -- The blood-washed church for which Jesus died is not relegated to one group or another, nor is it held hostage by politics or ethnicity. It is a breathing, living testament to God's love and grace. It serves its community where it is located and is aware of the needs and nuances of that community. However, its relevance and vision must go beyond its community and reach the world for which Christ died. Today as the church moves from its introspective posture to a broader role in politics, business, media and impacting societal ills, it has the dubious and daunting task of doing so without losing its core function. Like all such organizations that cease to be intrinsically focused, it runs the risk of being totally misunderstood and misaligned. I have listened and watched the events of the last few days with great disappointment as the church and the so-called African-American church, in particular, has been painted rather negatively with a broad, wide-ranging brush. I personally wish the distinctions of the church by ethnicity would one day become an antiquated idea. But this will require more people moving from a segregated worship experience. Until then, the church is becoming increasingly bruised by those who seek to move it from its core principles and make it an instrument of division rather than a catalyst for unity! To say the current picture in the media of the institution that I have loved all of my life is less than flattering would be an understatement. And because I know that many Americans unfortunately do not venture outside of the comfort of their own groups for worship, the only understanding some will have of who we are is based largely on sound bites and media portrayals. I want to set the record straight! I am afraid that once again our churches will be victimized by stereotypical ideas and opinions that are based in whole or in part by the extreme and not the norm. The church I have read about in the media -- a church filled with divisiveness, a lack of tolerance for other ethnic groups, a church not focused on helping the downtrodden and less fortunate, a church filled with hostility -- does not remotely resemble the churches that I grew up around and have loved for more than 50 years. Most, if not all, predominantly African-American church doors are open to all, not just to blacks, but to anyone who is seeking a spiritual home, guidance, support, direction, faith and a feeding of the soul in the purest sense. Many of us have worked with other organizations, different cultures and denominations believing that there is more to unite us than there is to divide us. The African-American church I know is filled with programs designed to address the many ills that inflict our society: HIV/AIDS, homelessness, reducing the rate of recidivism, assisting with employment and job training, economic development and financial management classes, home buying seminars, food banks to feed the hungry, schools to educate and an active plan to guide our youth. Those outreaches have been colorblind, passionate depictions of Christ's love for all humanity! The predominantly African-American church may be founded by an African American, it may be led on Sunday by an African American, but as you look through the crowd of these beacons of hope and faith, you will see an increasing audience that is much more reflective of our world than many would have you to believe. White, black, Hispanic, Asian -- nationalities from all across the world come together -- some to visit our churches, to enjoy our music and ministers and still others are gradually starting to join our churches. Gradually race fades into the fabric of faith and becomes less central to the overarching core of human needs in general. Is it a perfect union? Of course not. Is there work to do? Absolutely! But the core message is not one that enrages, but one that encourages people to change and grow, and any other depiction is distorted and inaccurate. The Potter's House, though largely African-American, is composed of 20 different nationalities and growing in diversity. It is designed much the same way Sen. BarackObama has built his campaign: on a strong commitment to reconciliation, the admonition for unity and strong desire for the continuation of diversity instead of exclusion. While I have not endorsed any candidate, who can ignore the hunger of Americans for change? No matter who your political choice may be, it is hard to remain ambivalent to the tone that Obama sounded, igniting a national response from people of all walks of life, crowding into stadiums openly weeping -- like they were in church -- at the very idea of a nation that reflects the best of our ideals; not the divisive ranting and bickering that may drive up ratings but threaten the cannibalization of our dreams and the demolition of our hopes. As a child, I grew up in a neighborhood back in West Virginia where blacks and whites helped each other in times of need and despair. Now that I am in Dallas, Texas, I have seen our city struggle to its feet in times of dire desperation. I was there when the buses came in to the Reunion Arena in Dallas loaded with mostly people of color who were hungry, weak and tired, and needing human dignity. They were unloaded -- covered with the stench of the atrocities of the superdome in New Orleans. I saw blacks, whites and Hispanics driving up with bags of clothes and food and crying together, trying to accommodate whomever they could, wherever they could. This is the America I want my grandson to grow up in. I am wondering who will get the message that our nation's citizens are by and large looking for a voice that will unite us, clothe our naked, feed the poor and help our diminishing middle class before we self-destruct like many great empires of the past. Who cares what color they are, what banner they fly, what gender they are, or how they pronounce their names? This is a defining moment in our history, and we are about to destroy greatness with petty self- aggrandizing egotism! I implore you to not take the words of a few and depict the thoughts, hearts and motives of many. At the end of the day, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. proved with his nonviolent approach that hate-filled words will not liberate anyone. To be sure, there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all. We continue to need someone who will hold us accountable to our best practices and not our worst. But there is no liberation without love, no prosperity without philanthropy and no hope if the church becomes immersed in the quagmire of pettiness. As an American I plead with you that we are running out of time. It is critical that we dislodge ourselves from political distractions. We must return to the task of looking for the right man or woman who can answer the bloodcurdling cry of a nation that is in search of a leader with a courageous effective plan for the war in Iraq, and the medical, moral, economic and security issues that are being ignored by these distractions. If we do not, we will have done a terrible disservice to our coming generations. The Bible said that while good men slept, evil ones came and planted tare, a noxious weed, among the wheat! The tare of a hate-filled church image is a tactical distraction planted to divert our attention from choosing our next president. Let's get back to listening for leadership strategies from our best and brightest before there is no country left to lead. My hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process, sounding the alarm that warns: America, please wake up out of our sleep! E-mail to a friend .","Bishop T.D.

"(CNN) -- ""Plastics deliver bountiful benefits to you and your world,"" exclaims the SPI web site, the online home of the U.S. plastics industry trade association. If it seems a bit over the top, imagine your life and ""your world"" without plastics. Even die-hard steampunk fans might have second thoughts about a plastic-free existence. As just one small example, imagine what a take-away meal would be like: Served on a real plate with cutlery, carried in a wooden box hammered together with nails. Perhaps that's a bit extreme, but you can be sure without plastics a ""spork"" would never have made the impact it has in your life. The SPI then are right to gush; plastics have done much to improve our lot, but plastics also have a dark side. They have become the scourge of the environment with plastics bags and bottles filling up landfills, littering streets and the manufacture of plastics polluting the environment with hazardous chemicals and endangering health. Some plastics are worse than others when it comes to leaving a mark on the environment, but an increasing number of them can be recycled. One common misconception when it comes to plastics is that the number displayed in a little triangle of arrows means it can be recycled. It actually denotes what type of plastic the material is made of. Most countries have recycling schemes that can easily recycle plastics with the numbers 1, 2, 5 and 6. Plastics with number 3, 4 and 7 are much harder to recycle. Som experts believe there are also some health concerns about chemicals leaking from plastic containers with the numbers 3, 6 and 7. The chemicals could leach into food or drink if used for a long time or heated. Plastics with numbers 1, 2 4 and 5 are safe to contain food and drink. One chemical that has expert worries and can be present in plastics with the number 7 is bisphenol A (BPA). Some scientists have claimed BPA can be a hormone disruptor and lead to illnesses such as cancer and impaired childhood development. Last year Canada became the first country to ban baby bottles that contain BPA.

"(CNN) -- With his city still trying to bounce back from the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said New York must rebuild ""smarter and stronger and more sustainably."" Bloomberg told reporters New York will prepare for natural disasters better by revising building codes, changing zoning requirements in some low-lying areas and making sure infrastructure can withstand a Category 2 hurricane or a heat wave. ""Whether or not one storm is related to climate change or is not, we have to manage for risks, and we have to be able to better defend ourselves against extreme weather and natural disasters,"" he said. Global Public Square: Cities key to beating climate change . Bloomberg said that New York, which has more than 500 miles of shoreline, will consider building berms, dunes, jetties and levees to protect against surging seawater during bad storms. Such a system could be expensive. Improvements to the New Orleans' flood protection system, which is 130 miles long and includes sea gates and flood walls, cost $14 billion. New York doesn't have unlimited funds, the mayor said. ""We have to live in the real world and make tough decisions based on the costs and benefits of risk-avoidance investments,"" he said. ""Saying we're going to spend whatever it takes just is not realistic."" The mayor compared post-Sandy New York to the one that faced security challenges after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The city quickly built the largest counterterrorism operation of any city in the world, he said. Drought-stressed trees face race to adapt . The Economic Development Corporation of New York will take the lead on drawing up ""concrete recovery plans for the communities Sandy hit hardest as well as a specific and comprehensive action plan to prepare our city for the climate risks we face,"" Bloomberg said. The mayor said the city has already strengthened building codes and will have to do so again. At the same time, he wants residents who rebuild to do so without being penalized if they build homes higher than current height restrictions. He said the city also needs to look at communications and energy infrastructure. The city should replace copper wiring for phones with fiber optics, he said, and cell phone towers need to have more than eight hours of backup power. Uncovering the secrets of Greenland's ice . Deputy Mayors Linda Gibbs and Cas Holloway will look at how well the city was prepared logistically and how it reacted after Sandy hit, he said.

"(CNN) -- People have used animal imagery in their decorating since they were painting ancient beasts on cave walls. There's nothing new about the look, Elle Decor interiors editor Robert Rufino said, but there is a modern approach trotting through homes. The current way to use animal prints, figurines, imagery, hides and bones in home decor is full of whimsy, he said. It takes the old-world tradition of stately trophies to a very fun place. ""People have learned to pare down,"" he said. ""More people are spending more time at home, and there's a freedom,"" in the way modern homebodies are decorating. ""It looks like someone lives there. It has personality."" He keeps two antique, mounted deer heads in his country home in New York. ""I think they are absolutely beautiful. I love their antlers,"" he said. And when he's greeted at the door by one of those handsome stags, Rufino said, ""it's like, 'Hi! How are you?' "" Personality is what Walton and Chatham Creel's Birmingham, Alabama, loft exudes. They're charmed by deer, birds and other woodland creatures, and they've displayed a taxidermy peacock and fox as well as some of Walton Creel's original artwork -- deer, owl and opossum figures shaped from bullet holes. ""The opossum is the most divisive of all the animals,"" Walton Creel said of the animal decor in their home. ""Some people are thrilled by it, but others can't stand it."" And that's where use of animals in decorating gets controversial, Rufino said. Taxidermy animals, deer antlers and animal skin rugs, although considered high style, are not necessarily as accepted today as they were a century ago, Rufino said. In the same way that people choose not to wear a fur coat, he said, people might choose not to decorate with organic animal parts. ""Everyone has their phobias,"" he said. That's partially why reproductions and abstract versions -- animal print textiles, ceramic sculpture and ""fauxidermy,"" for example -- are in vogue, Rufino said. ""I think the problem that people have with taxidermy is when it does not make sense,"" Creel said. ""When you see a random animal head on a wall it usually looks out of place, but when you go to a museum of natural history, the animals are presented in a scene. We have tried to do that,"" he said of his loft's menagerie. One of the focal points in the Creels' living room is their collection of antique deer antlers. ""We started buying antlers at flea markets and antique stores,"" Creel said. ""We thought about placing them on a wall in a hunting lodge presentation, but then we found an antique baby wash tub and thought they would make a great centerpiece."" ""Everyone has liked them,"" he said, ""or they have been too nice to say otherwise."" So how can you take advantage of modern animal trends in home decor? Here are some lessons from this week's Open House contributors: . Animal prints are the new beige . ""I've used animal prints in pretty much every room. I feel like animal prints are a neutral and I tend to use them in their natural color or off-white."" -- Laurie Jones . ""I love animal prints such as leopard and zebra because they act as a neutral and go with virtually any color scheme and style. It brings a global feel to a room while somehow managing to add whimsy and sophistication at the same time."" -- Krista Byers . Take animals seriously, but play with decor . ""I love animals and I love having them in my home. Of course it's all faux decor because I don't want any animals to get hurt to be in my home. It's the perfect addition of quirkiness and I need it in every room."" -- Julia Konya . ""Foxes are very much the new owl. The woodlands is a great decor trend to follow because it can vary from super sweet and playful to a more dark and mysterious side of the spectrum."" -- Walton Creel . Remember that a little goes a long way . ""I think it's important when designing a space with animal prints, just as in fashion, to pair the piece with more subdued patterns or solid colors. You want the print to pop and not compete with other decor elements."" -- Jana Bek . ""My updated-cottage style living room needed a new chair and I wanted something unique. The chair already had cool ball and claw feet, which inspired my choice for animal print upholstery."" -- Sarah Macklem . Enjoy rugs for their durability and unique shape . ""I specifically wanted to use a cowhide rug for its durability. It doesn't stain! You can spill red wine and not worry about it! That makes it an ideal choice for a room where eating is the primary purpose."" -- Jae Vinson . ""I often recommend animal hide rugs -- Jonathan Adler has gorgeous faux ones if you wanta cruelty-free option -- because the organic shape can bring interest to any space. Real hide rugs are completely stain repellent so are perfect for high traffic areas or city living."" -- Jana Bek . Consider sentiment and stories . ""I purchased the white ceramic dog because it looks just like my dog, Jack. The ceramic dog is sitting on top of my late grandparents' 1920s buffet in our dining room. Since the buffet has a very antique look to it, I wanted to use more modern looking accessories."" -- Chelsea McDonnough . ""One morning while searching my usual favorite categories on (Craigslist), I typed in 'antlers' thinking fall was on the way and some loose antlers would be nice accessories. To my surprise, this huge mounted pair was listed, 'free to a good home.' After I rushed over to pick them up, the man told me that the family story was that his grandfather had acquired the antlers in Alaska in 1910."" -- Jennifer Griffin .","Animal hides and bones have been a part of decor since ancient times .

"(CNN) -- Those pesky drug testers. Andy Murray received his OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) from Prince William for his services to tennis but the man who ended Britain's 77-year men's singles drought at Wimbledon in July was in danger of being late at Buckingham Palace because drug testers came calling. Under tennis' stringent 'whereabouts' rule, elite players have to tell testers where they'll be for an hour every day in case they want a sample. And wouldn't you know, they showed up at Murray's door Thursday as the grand slam champion readied for his trip to one of the homes of British royalty. ""They turned up at my door at 8.20 a.m. and I had a taxi booked for half past eight,"" Murray, recovering from back surgery, told reporters. ""I was a bit worried I was going to be late but the taxi did a great job in getting us here. ""It's part of the job but when you have a day like today you are looking forward to, it's the last thing you need."" Murray's moment of panic ended, he traded in his shorts and t-shirt for a smart, dark suit. He was allowed to bring three guests and chose -- not surprisingly -- his parents Judy and William and longtime girlfriend Kim Sears. ""I think they were quite proud,"" Murray told CNN. ""My girlfriend is massively into anything royal. She was so excited about coming to Buckingham Palace for the first time. ""It was a great day for us."" Whereas Murray made history at Wimbledon and at the U.S. Open a year ago, it was the first investiture for new dad Prince William, who filled in for the 87-year-old Queen. According to reports, Prince William chatted to Murray for nearly a minute -- one of the longest chats of the day. ""He asked me about my back surgery ... and how I was feeling after Wimbledon, when there was a lot of pressure on me,"" Murray told reporters. ""I teased him a bit as he had sent a note to me before Wimbledon wishing me luck and his wife had written me a letter afterward. Her handwriting was beautiful and I told him how fantastic it was compared to his. ""I have met him a few times before and he has always been very easy going. He seemed very relaxed today."" The decision to give Murray an OBE was actually made at the end of 2012. He won gold at the London Olympics and a month later ended Britain's 77-year grand slam men's singles drought in New York. Murray won't play again this season following his surgery, thus missing out on the year-end championships in London in November.","Scotsman Andy Murray received an OBE on Thursday for his services to tennis .

"(CNN) -- Cpl. Michael Boucher will never forget June 12, 2011. He was on his second deployment with the Marines in Afghanistan. Another squad had been hit by two improvised explosive devices, and he was helping to clear the landing zone so a helicopter could pick up the casualties. ""An IED was set off, and at first I didn't realize it was me that was hit,"" he said. ""I was in the air and looked down and realized both my feet were missing."" Lying inside the crater from the blast, Boucher began to tie a tourniquet around what was left of his right leg. ""Before I finished putting the tourniquet on, the doc got to me. He placed his hand on my shoulder and said, 'Don't worry brother. I got you,' "" he recalled. ""It was a blessing that I stayed conscious because I didn't have to wake up later and realize that both of my legs were missing."" At 22, Boucher was a double-leg amputee. ""The first two weeks were pretty hard. I struggled in my own head to try and picture the future of my life, and it was hard to see anything good out if it,"" he said. Before the accident, Boucher loved to hunt and fish. But he questioned whether it would even be possible to do so without his legs. ""I was trying to figure out in my mind what I was going to be able to do and what I wasn't,"" he said. Thanks to an all-terrain wheelchair, Boucher is one of a growing number of injured veterans and people with disabilities who are getting back to doing what they love outdoors. Designed like a mini-tank, this wheelchair can go almost anywhere off road -- through mud, sand, snow and in up to a foot of water. It can even go up and down hills. Tim Swenson created the Action Trackchair about 10 years after his son was paralyzed in a car accident. ""You don't ever want to get that phone call, but it happened,"" Swenson said. ""But I always thought about how can I get Jeff back outdoors and off the hard surface?"" With 30 years' experience in the motorsports business, Swenson designed an off-road electric chair that could help more than just his son. ""We just started using some of the things I knew about snowmobiles and ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) ... along with electric wheelchair components. And we started building,"" he said. ""The tracks we use are similar in design and quality to snowmobile tracks."" The chair is controlled by a joystick and can travel up to 4 mph. It can be tilted to maintain balance on uneven terrain. ""One of the biggest fears people in wheelchairs have is falling out of their chair,"" Swenson said. ""The chairs all come with a tilt so if you're going up and down hills ... you can maintain your chair being level."" The size of the chair can be adjusted to fit both children and adults. Accessories such as trays, toolboxes and gun racks can also be mounted to them. Swenson sold his first chair in 2009 from his factory in Marshall, Minnesota. About a year later, he began designing a second model -- one that allows paralyzed people to stand up.

"(CNN) -- The political culture in Arizona, my home state, is often coarse, racialized and divisive. President Barack Obama's visit there Tuesday gave the world another opportunity to see it. At times it seems as though the most bigoted individuals in America's 48th state save their most raucous and prejudiced behavior for the 44th president. The Arizona Republic reported that hundreds of dissenters chose to model their insulting and extremist behavior before some of Phoenix's youngest residents. Assembled outside Desert Vista High School, they mocked Obama's race, singing ""Bye Bye Black Sheep"" in spirited synchronization. One ""patriot"" went so far as to deprecate our commander in chief by pronouncing him ""47 percent Negro,"" while another, Deanne Bartram, held a sign that read, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!"" Obama chose Desert Vista, home to some of Phoenix's best and brightest students, to present his ideas for repairing America's ailing mortgage finance apparatus. Some activists assembled to plead with the president to take more aggressive steps to combat climate change, such as renouncing the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Nevertheless, the overwhelming disposition of the angry horde was openly reminiscent of the Jim Crow South. One of the most disturbing aspects of the anti-Obama protest was the inclination of some participants to fault the president for increased racial tensions. ""We have gone back so many years,"" Judy Burris told the Republic, insisting that Obama's presence and policies have engendered a racist backlash. ""He's divided all the races. I hate him for that."" This mind-bending perspective has become one of the leitmotifs of the racialized anti-Obama movement, which laments regressive race relations, but which attributes increased racial tensions in Obama's ""disruptive"" and ""exotic"" presence, rather than their own racial stereotypes, hateful rhetoric and divisive behavior. Despite myriad efforts to foster civil dialogue in Arizona, the state has proven to be fertile ground for the kind of chauvinistic crusading that greeted Obama this week. The idea that Obama has divided the races is farcical. As I wrote in a Republic essay in March, Time magazine announced the selection of Obama as its Person of the 2012 Year (for a second time) because, as Richard Stengel argued in his editorial preface, ""We are in the midst of historic cultural and demographic changes, and Obama is both the symbol and in some ways the architect of this new America."" Obama deserved credit, he wrote, ""for finding and forging a new majority, for turning weakness into opportunity and for seeking, amid great adversity, to create a more perfect union."" However, nearly five years into Obama's presidency, the politics of hope, optimism and racial equality that his campaign and election inspired have bumped into a new political reality marked by economic challenges, political acrimony and disillusionment. The resulting political backlash has triggered rancorous and racially charged clashes. The rowdy gathering outside Desert Vista underscored the nature of race relations in the Obama age -- evolving but oddly static in some ways -- and the particularly bigoted shades of anti-Obama emotion in Arizona. If the age of Obama prophesied a more progressive, multifaceted and refined dialogue about American race relations, the vision has not been realized. Rather, many Americans, particularly xenophobic cliques such as the ones on display in my state, have recoiled back to a pre-civil rights-era temperament and increasingly overt racist outbursts. As brazen as those in the Desert Vista crowd were, they are merely the most belligerent and public face of a legion of racist anti-Obama persons. These more discreet individuals are smart enough to cloak their racialized opposition in obstructionist maneuvering and public policy that does more damage to the lives of people of color than prejudiced banter. Still, the Desert Vista protest should give everyone pause and put us on high alert. The racist rhetoric heard there reflects inner beliefs and fears that have tremendous potential to do great harm. Arizona leaders would be remiss in dismissing it as ""fringe."" As civil rights activist Pauli Murray once cautioned, ""Racism is like a deadly snake coiled and ready to strike, and one only avoids its dangers by never-ending watchfulness."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Whitaker.","Matthew C. Whitaker: Obama's appearance at Arizona school brought out racist protesters .

"(CNN) -- Louise White, an 81 year-old Rhode Island resident, came forward Tuesday as the winner of a $336.4 million Powerball lottery, the third largest prize in the game's history. ""I'm very happy and I'm very proud,"" she said. ""We are truly blessed. Thank you."" White bought the winning ticket last month in Newport, Rhode Island, after a family member had a craving for rainbow sherbet and brought her to a store where she purchased the ticket. ""We're very excited to be a part of this little bit of history; the winner is a lovely woman and valued customer,"" said store employee Suzi Robinson. ""We are very happy for her."" After realizing she had won, White tucked the winning ticket into her Bible and went to sleep holding the Bible, bringing it with her to breakfast the next day until she could eventually store it in a safe deposit box. White then sought legal counsel and established a trust for the funds, according to her attorney, Gregory Fater. It's called the Rainbow Sherbert Trust, named for the snack that prompted her visit to the store, even though the correct spelling is sherbet. Fater described White as ""extremely grounded,"" and approached her newfound wealth with ""extreme poise and level headedness."" White elected to take the cash option and will receive a lump sum payment of $210 million, the highest cash option payout ever for Powerball, according to lottery officials. The state of Rhode Island will collect $14.7 million, while the federal government also tallies up to $52.5 million in revenue.","An 81 year-old Rhode Island resident comes forward as the winner of the Powerball lottery .

"(CNN) -- Just under two years before hosting the World Cup, Brazil sacked coach Mano Menezes as the South American country signaled a change of direction in its quest for unprecedented sixth title. Menezes had hoped to lead Brazil to victory on home soil but his failure to win over his critics with his muscular type of play appears to have cost him. The 50-year-old, who replaced the legendary Dunga following the 2010 World Cup, had come under heavy scrutiny following his side's failure to win a historic first Olympic gold at London 2012 -- losing in the final to Mexico despite fielding a star-studded line-up. The news was greeted with joy by former Brazil striker and World Cup winner Romario,. ""Today is a historic day, Brazil needs to celebrate,'' Romario said on his Facebook page. ""Finally the federation did something good for Brazilian football. It took a while to happen, but it did.'' Brazil also failed to deliver at the 2011 Copa America, bowing out at the quarterfinal stage. ""As it has been announced, I'm not the national coach anymore,"" Menezes wrote on Twitter. ""My thanks to all the people who worked with me on this project, specially the players that were called up during this period and all those who believed in our work."" Brazil name little-known Menezes as replacement for Dunga . Menezes was often criticized for his side's style of play with fans yearning to a return to the ""joga bonito"" ('beautiful game"") style for which Brazil teams are so well known. Whereas past sides, most notably that of 1970, were known for their flair and skill, Menezes' side was more functional than entertaining. Although his team won six of its eight matches since the Olympics, with 26 goals coming in the process, Menezes struggled to justify his switch away from the freeflowing, samba-style football associated with Brazil. But the decision came as a surprise with Brazil slowly beginning to look more impressive with several key players returning to form. The attacking trio of Oscar, Neymar and Hulk provided a real threat, while Ramires and Paulinho had recently shone in the center of midfield. The form of Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva and the return to the side of Real Madrid's Kaka had looked to have given Brazil a new found lease of life. But after a difficult reign, Menezes was relieved of his duties following talks with CBF president Jose Maria Marin. ""I gave him the news myself,"" Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) national squad director Andres Sanches told reporters. ""Nobody likes to receive news of these kind of things in any circumstances, but everyone in football knows that these things happen. ""A new coach will be announced in January."" New man . Former Palmeiras manager Luis Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to World Cup glory back in 2002, is the current favorite with Corinthians coach Tite and Santos boss Muricy Ramalho also in contention. Brazil will host the Confederations Cup in six months' time before taking center stage for the World Cup a year later. The new manager's first game in charge will be against England at Wembley on February 6.","Brazil has fired coach Mano Menezes with immediate effect .

"(CNN) -- Most outrageous fish tales begin with an arching arm gesture and ""a fish this big"" -- but this one starts with ""fish that traveled this far."" Just over two years after the Japan earthquake and tsunami, researchers made a startling discovery in a 20-foot-long Japanese fishing vessel that washed ashore last month near Long Beach, Washington: five tropical fish, alive and well. They are called striped beakfish, and they are native to warmer waters near Japan, China and the Korean Peninsula. The five stowaways, roughly the size of your palm, lived in a cozy spot at the back of the boat. A 20- to 30-gallon containment hold in the boat's stern lost its cover, and that part of the boat was submerged as the vessel drifted in the ocean, said Allen Pleus, a scientist with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. That ""created like a cave they could go in and out of,"" Pleus said. Japanese tsunami debris makes its way into Hawaiian birds . Pleus said most debris out in the ocean attracts fish, so it's not surprising these fish found a home in the debris. But it is surprising they survived the nearly 5,000-mile journey. ""It's very rare that you'd see something like this,"" Pleus said. ""Obviously, fish are very robust and we are learning this on all of the species that come across."" When researchers first explored the boat, they saw just one of the fish in the holding tank. They collected it in a bucket and took it to Long Beach City Hall. Someone at City Hall called the Seaside Aquarium in Seaside, Oregon, to come and get it. Fish and Wildlife personnel found three more in the tank's murky water. Finally the boat was towed to a state yard, where the fifth fish came swimming up to Pleus. The one that went to the aquarium will live out its life there. General Manager Keith Chandler says it'll go on display Saturday. ""He is a pretty cool fish, and I just wonder if there are more out there,"" he said. The other four had the honor of contributing to research at Oregon State University, where researchers will dissect them learn their ages and what they've been eating. Sea anemones, scallops, crabs, worms and sea cucumbers that hitched a ride on the same boat also will be studied.

"(CNN) -- Forty-four years ago, an Australian man stood on the Olympic podium in Mexico alongside two American athletes who, with their heads bowed, punched the air with gloved hands in a black power salute. The peaceful yet potent political protest at the 1968 Olympics by 200-meter medalists Tommie Smith and John Carlos became a symbol of the struggle for civil rights in America. To their left in the photo stood silver medalist, Australian Peter Norman, who stared straight ahead, his hands by his side, but who expressed his support for the pair by wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge. Yet, on the list of famous Australian athletes, Norman barely rates a mention. Far from elevating Norman to the status of hero in his home country, his family say he was shunned on his return to Australia and unfairly denied the opportunity to contest another Olympics -- claims the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) denies. ""In the States he's hugely well known. But here in Australia, a lot of people are shocked when they find out that the white guy in the black power protest is an Aussie,"" his nephew, Matt Norman, told CNN. Norman, a filmmaker who describes himself a civil rights activist, turned his uncle's Olympic story into a film ""Salute"" which was released in Australia four years ago and had a short run in cinemas during the 2012 Olympics in the U.S. and UK. Peter Norman: The forgotten Black Power hero . He has turned the story into a film script called ""1968"" that aims to set the record straight using big name stars including Ewan McGregor, Will Smith and Jamie Fox, Norman said. It is hoped filming will begin next year. It was not ""Salute,"" but a magazine article that alerted Australian Federal lawmaker Andrew Leigh to Norman's story and motivated him on Monday to urge the country's Federal Parliament to formally acknowledge Norman's achievements and extend him a posthumous national apology. The athlete suffered a heart attack and died in 2006 at the age of 64, but his 91-year-old mother, Thelma Norman, was in Parliament to hear seven MPs, including Leigh, deliver impassioned speeches as to why Norman deserves a greater presence in modern Australian history. ""It's just one of those tales that I think ought to be better known,"" Labor MP Leigh told CNN. ""What really struck me about it, was that I, as an Aussie, should have been brought up on Peter Norman, but I wasn't."" Bronze medalist Carlos told the ABC Tuesday that there was ""no one in the nation of Australia that should be honored, recognized, appreciated more than Peter Norman for his humanitarian concerns, his character, his strength and his willingness to be a sacrificial lamb for justice."" During his speech, Leigh told Parliament: ""After Carlos forgot his gloves, Norman came up with the idea that the two Americans should share the one pair of gloves. A protest like this, on a global stage, had never been done before. ""At the time, it was electrifying. Racist slurs were hurled at Smith and Carlos. IOC President Avery Brundage -- a man who'd had no difficulty with the Nazi salute being used in the 1936 Olympics -- insisted the two be expelled In that moment Norman advanced international awareness for racial equality."" However, what happened after Norman returned home to Australia is less clear. More than 40 years after that ""electrifying"" event, divergent accounts have emerged about whether Norman's political stance denied him future Olympic glory. Norman's family insists he was deliberately excluded from the Australian Olympic team sent to the Munich Games in 1972, despite repeatedly qualifying. ""He qualified for both the 100 and 200 meters for the Munich Games but just wasn't selected. I guess that could be considered as a ban but he was pretty disappointed by that,"" Norman's brother, Laurie, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The AOC says Norman failed to qualify for the Munich Games after finishing third in the 200-meter sprint at the Australian Championships in March 1972. The body's media director also denied any suggestions that Norman was ""blacklisted"" for supporting Smith and Carlos' podium protest. ""There was no punishment dealt out to Peter Norman following the 1968 incident with black power salute. He was not punished. He was not ostracized. He was not blacklisted. He wasn't even reprimanded by the Australian Olympic Committee at the time,"" Mike Tancred told CNN. ""He was given, what has been written in a book by historians, as a gentle caution and then he was given some tickets to a hockey game so he could go and watch his teammates play hockey and that was the sum total of his punishment,"" he added. Asked whether the AOC would support a formal apology to Norman from the Federal Parliament, Tancred said: ""We're a little bit baffled by this debate. We never had an issue with Peter Norman. He never had an issue with us. ""There was never any suggestion that he was ostracized or not happy with the AOC. We've got nothing to apologize for because we've never wronged Peter Norman."" Norman's family says that the Olympian was also snubbed during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney by not being invited to be part of the official opening or closing ceremonies. The AOC said no former athletes were invited and that Norman was offered tickets to buy to attend, like any other former Australian Olympian, as the cost ""would have been astronomical"" to host them all. ""The AOC is certainly right that they treated him like every other former Olympian,"" Leigh said. ""He was given the opportunity to purchase tickets. They could have done so for hundreds of people who have ever competed for Australia in the Olympics. But I do think he's pretty special. Not just because he's pretty much the only white guy to win a sprint medal in the last generation. But just that amazing stance that he took in 1968, being on the right side of history when so many others were on the wrong side."" Aside from his political statement, Norman has for 44 years retained the Australian record set for the 200-meter sprint during the 1968 Games. Asked whether, aside from the apology, the AOC would support Norman's recognition for his achievements on the track, Tancred evoked another great and arguably better-known Australian Olympian, distance runner Herb Elliott. ""There's people like Herb Elliot who won gold medals in 1960. We're not acknowledging Herb Elliot... so why do we have to acknowledge that Peter Norman might hold a 200-meter record? There are lots of champions out there who have done equally as well or better than Peter Norman."" Tancred also said that the debate in Federal Parliament was ""irrelevant"" given the progress made in civil rights since the 1968 Games. ""The politicians from both sides need to look and check on who is the American President, at present. He's black. And I think the whole world has moved on since 1968. So on that score, really, their debate is irrelevant,"" he said. The Australian parliament has yet to issue a formal apology or recognition for Norman. While the motion was debated, an official vote still needs to be scheduled for a later date.

"Washington (CNN) -- At his request, President Barack Obama is ending his inaugural oath with: ""So help me God."" Those four words are not legally or constitutionally required, unlike other federal oaths that invoke them as standard procedure. Historians have wrangled over whether George Washington established precedent by adding the phrase on his own during his first Inaugural acceptance, but the Library of Congress website states he did. Abraham Lincoln was reported to have said it spontaneously in 1861 and other presidents over the years have followed suit. A Bible is traditionally used in administering the oath. Opinion: Presidents should not swear in on a Bible . Obama took the official oath on Sunday at the White House with his left hand on the family Bible of his wife, Michelle. At Monday's ceremonial swearing-in at the Capitol, he will use Bibles from Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. Obama took the oath with the same Lincoln Bible in 2009 when he made history as the first African-American president. The Constitution lays out the exact language to be used in the oath: ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Four years ago, a California atheist, Michael Newdow, objected and went to federal court to prevent Chief Justice John Roberts from prompting the president-elect to repeat the ""so help me God phrase."" Newdow, along with several non-religious groups, argued the words violate the constitutional ban on government ""endorsement"" of religion. The high court ultimately rejected the lawsuit two years ago, and no such legal challenges are expected this time. Lyndon Johnson's 1965 swearing-in marked a change from tradition. His wife Claudia, known better as Lady Bird, held the Bible, a job previously managed by the high court's clerk. Spouses have since had the honor. 13 reasons to follow the inauguration on CNN's platforms and nowhere else .

"(CNN) -- When my parents bought their first mobile phones about 10 years ago, I didn't think they'd ever get the hang of using them. Mom would answer my call from the front of the line at Starbucks and say, ""Hello darling, yes I'll take the tall thanks, what is it, James do you have any cash?"" all in one breath. My favorite were the random, cryptic one-word text messages like ""I"" or ""soon"" or ""shirtt."" But things have changed. These days mom sends texts saying: ""Video chat in 5?"" (insert smiley face). Of course it's not me she wants to see in the chat window on her computer screen. It's my 2-year-old daughter, Kylie. Video chats have become routine when my parents are at their home in Maryland. Dad will pick up colorful objects -- a Buzz Lightyear figurine, a sombrero, a bird feeder -- and move them toward his laptop's tiny camera lens, making Kylie squeal or say, ""What's that funny thing, Granddad?"" And mom will hold up an outfit she bought for her granddaughter to see if it meets our approval (it usually does). My in-laws are slowly getting into it, too. Unable to attend Kylie's first birthday party, they watched us from laptops we set up on top of bookshelves. From their homes in Victoria, British Columbia, and the remote Pender Island, they watched Kylie slap her teeny hand into her cake's white frosting as everyone sang happy birthday. Every now and then, we'd look up and wave or raise a glass of champagne. Becoming grandparents isn't the sole reason my parents have become technically savvy -- mom had a Kindle before Kylie came along -- but it has likely sped things up. They were quick to take on Google+ Hangouts when my husband (who, full disclosure, works for Google) suggested it as an easier option for us to chat face to face online. They now school their fellow baby boomer pals in London and Australia on how to use it, to varying degrees of success. And mom is now more adept at navigating Apple TV than I am -- when she's babysitting Kylie and a request (read: demand) comes down for the YouTube rendition of ""Twinkle Twinkle"" featuring the little owl, mom will bring it up on the TV screen quicker than you can say, ""Holy diaper rash."" (Mind you, Kylie is figuring all this out just as quickly. She knows that slamming a laptop shut concludes a chat she deems to be getting dull -- adorable when you're in the room with her, not so funny if you've been hung up on.) For grandparents who are online -- and a recent Pew study suggests 53% of American adults over 65 are, with one in three of those seniors using social networks -- living apart from grandkids doesn't mean never seeing them. Margie Tucker, 62, of Voorhees, New Jersey, says she feared she and her husband, Steven, would be strangers to their 4-year-old grandson because he lives in Denver. So she got into Skype. ""My family would laugh at me, because when (my grandson) was just beginning to move around, I was happy just to sit and watch him without any dialogue going on,"" Tucker says. ""We've watched him learn to ride his bike, play ball, learn to write his name, play with his trucks. ... We often eat together, although they are two hours behind us."" And let's not forget the wonders of virtual babysitting. ""My daughter is a single mom, so I have even kept (my grandson) 'occupied' for a few minutes while she got dinner started or put a load of laundry in,"" Tucker says. ""I like my iPad because it's so portable and easy to use. I have shown him an interesting bug on our deck, what the new carpet looks like, and how high the snow is at our house. My own kids were raised with long-distance grandparents, and there is little comparison to the advantages we have now."" Kathryn Barker, 65, from Redding, California, is active on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and has her own blogging website. And in spite of her initial reluctance, she's taken to texting as a way to stay in touch with two of her out-of-town grandchildren, who are 8 and 10. ""I cannot quite get the hang of abbreviating words, and incorrect punctuation is difficult for me to ignore,"" she says. ""But I am giving in to not capitalizing words. My thumb dexterity is still lacking."" Barker has also tried Facetime for video calls and notes that her grandchildren never comment on her tech willingness. Likely, she says, they expect everyone to know as much as they do or more. ""I think I'm just your average grandma in awe of the ease with which these kids have transcended a world I came to know later in life."" I sometimes wonder if it's odd for my parents to see their granddaughter expertly scroll through photos on my iPhone with her miniature finger. After all, it freaks me out. While the Internet has held my hand through my adult life, my childhood was devoid of doodads (unless you count the portable Pac-Man console my brother and I used to fight over). Lance Ulanoff, editor-in-chief at Mashable.com, refers to the key generation in technological proliferation as ""digital natives."" ""These are the people who over the next five years will enter adulthood, who know nothing but the digital experience,"" he says. ""It's completely natural for them to share everything. It's natural for them to expect whatever they can see on a big screen they can see on a small screen, to have access to every bit of information they need in the palm of their hands. They don't even imagine anything other than that. Those are the people that are going to transform society."" For now then, grandkids and parents would do well to take advantage of something the baby boomers still seem to hold dear -- balance. While they might embrace technology to stay in the mix and because they enjoy it, they're also big fans of powering down. Tucker says she still occasionally writes letters on paper to post to her grandson in Denver and visits whenever she and her husband can. And when my parents are spending time in New York, they bring Kylie Play-Doh, crayons and books. Granddad takes her to the park and pushes her on the swing, her hair blowing in 10 different directions. You know ... stuff that doesn't require an on-off switch.

"(CNN) -- The remarkable recovery of an abducted 8-year-old girl in Fresno, California -- which combined solid police work with the efforts of good Samaritans -- turned bittersweet Tuesday when authorities said the victim had been sexually assaulted. Still, the fact that the girl was back home after the harrowing ordeal brought thanks from her parents during a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Speaking through an interpreter, the girl's father said he was ""very happy that his daughter is home."" Police praised citizens, the media and good Samaritans as ""heroes"" on Tuesday, saying their efforts led to recovery and the arrest of the man, a suspected gang member, accused of taking her. ""It is truly a miracle of God that she is with us today,"" Police Chief Jerry Dyer said. The girl was recovered Tuesday, hours after authorities said she was forced into a pickup truck at a Fresno apartment complex by a man who had approached a group of children playing. She was taken to a hospital for an examination, Dyer told reporters, initially saying the girl was ""frightened"" and ""traumatized"" but in good condition. Police indicated later she was the victim of sexual assault in a wooded area, perhaps out of town, before the motorist drove back to Fresno. CNN does not identify possible victims of sexual assaults. Watching the girl and her mother reunite, Dyer said, was ""the highlight of my career."" Police identified the suspect as Gregorio Gonzalez, 24, of Fresno. Charges against him will include kidnapping, false imprisonment and sexual assault. Gonzalez, who lives with his grandparents, is a member of the Bulldog gang, has been arrested for possession of a sawed-off shotgun and was on probation for felony domestic violence, Dyer said. About 7 a.m. (10 a.m. ET), a person described by Dyer as a good Samaritan told police he was driving when he saw a truck similar to a description of the suspect's vehicle given by authorities. The person, who had watched the news and was familiar with the case, began to follow the truck, Dyer said. The driver initially said he only saw a man in the truck and no one else, but within a few minutes saw a child stick her head up. ""He realized right then and there he had the suspect vehicle,"" Dyer said. The man pulled in front of the truck and cut it off, and the young girl ""took the moment of opportunity, opened up the passenger door, and jumped out and ran,"" he said. A second good Samaritan stayed with the girl, Dyer said. The driver pursued the pickup truck and was able to obtain a partial license plate number, which he gave to dispatchers, the chief said. CNN affiliate KFSN later spoke with Victor Perez, who said he was the motorist who followed the suspect's truck. ""I thank God that he put me here to help out that little girl."" About 40 minutes later, the California Highway Patrol received a report of a truck matching the vehicle description parked behind a church, Dyer said. Responding officers were not able to find the truck at the location and contacted the tipster, who advised them it had been driven away. It was later found parked nearby, behind an apartment complex. The officer initially thought the truck was not occupied, but a man raised up as the officer exited his car, Dyer said. The unarmed man was taken into custody without incident, he said. A witness has identified the man as the person at the abduction scene, the chief said. ""We beat the odds today,"" Dyer said, adding that often abduction victims aren't found until it is too late. Of those killed in an abduction, 74 percent are killed in the first three hours, he said. ""I want to say thank you to the citizens of Fresno and the good Samaritans,"" he said. ""They are heroes."" He also thanked the media for their assistance. Authorities were notified of the incident about 8:30 p.m. Monday, Dyer had said earlier. A man reportedly drove up to an apartment complex where a group of children were playing, approached two girls and attempted to lure them into his truck. A younger girl, 6, walked away, Dyer said, but the victim began walking with the man. Two witnesses nearby, a man and a woman, saw what was going on and yelled at the children to get away from the vehicle and the man, Dyer said. But before the girl had time to react, he said, the man grabbed the girl, pushed her into the driver's side of the pickup and sped off with the truck's headlights off. The girl's mother got into a car and tried to chase the truck down, but was unsuccessful, Dyer said. Police had received a report shortly before the incident of a man with a similar description and vehicle exposing himself to young girls nearby, the chief said. The man got into a pickup and drove away with his lights out, Dyer said. The mother of one girl chased him on foot but did not catch him. The vehicle was described as being a late 1970s or early 1980s model Ford or Chevy pickup, either dark brown or reddish-brown in color, Dyer said earlier. The two-door pickup reportedly had a 6-inch-wide white stripe on the side, and was spotted on policing cameras from the area, he said. The police chief said the man attempted to entice the girls into the truck by promising them something, but would not say what. CNN affiliate KFSN reported the man spoke in Spanish and told the children that he would take them to the Dollar Store and buy them toys if they got into the truck. A man who was detained earlier Tuesday after a witness tip was questioned and released; authorities believed he was not involved.

"New York (CNN) -- Six British soldiers who have been charged with assaulting an off-duty New York City police officer are expected to appear in court this week, according to a police spokesman. The six soldiers were arrested early Friday morning after the 30-year-old police officer was injured outside a bar in Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood, said New York Police Department spokesman Sgt. Thomas Antonetti. A verbal altercation quickly escalated into a physical fight, he said. The cause is still unclear, he added. All of the soldiers are Fiji nationals who serve in the 1st Scots Guard of the British Army, according to Antonetti. The group was visiting New York City for a battalion rugby match. The men are identified as Iosefo Yavala, Iliakini Raderua, Thomas Shute, Felite Vunisarati, Mosese Kuruala, and Joeli Raduva according to NYPD. The NYPD officer, 30, and a friend, 26, suffered lacerations and bruising to the face and head. They were taken to a hospital where they were treated and released, Antonetti said. All six British soldiers were charged with third-degree assault, Antonetti said. One of the men was also charged with robbery, accused of trying to steal the NYPD officer's cell phone, he said. The British Ministry of Defence released a statement to CNN saying it is ""aware of an incident in New York involving some British Army soldiers. This is a matter for the NYPD and it would be inappropriate to comment while there is an ongoing investigation. All those who are found to fall short of the Army's high standards will face disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, if appropriate."" Three of the men will appear in a New York District Court on Tuesday, according to public records from the New York Criminal Court.","Six British soldiers were arrested after a fight outside a Manhattan bar .

"(CNN) -- Two days after the ferry they were on sank after colliding with a cargo ship, 82 people remained unaccounted for Sunday in waters between southern Philippine islands, a Coast Guard official said. Authorities have found the bodies of 38 people and rescued another 750, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Dawn Baterbonia. The incident occurred around 9 p.m. Friday in the Mactan Channel about 2 miles northwest of Cebu City, the capital of Cebu province. The passenger ship -- MV St. Thomas Aquinas -- was coming from nearby Butuan City and the cargo ship -- the Sulpicio, which had about 20 people aboard -- was leaving Cebu for the province of Davao in Mindanao. The passenger ferry sank, but not before sending out a distress call heard by Coast Guard officials. The cargo vessel involved in the crash -- along with Navy, Coast Guard and commercial vessels -- was helping in the rescue efforts. The incident recalls one of the worst maritime disasters in world history dating to December 20, 1987, also off the Philippines. Between 1,700 and more than 4,000 people were killed when the ferry Dona Paz collided with the tanker MT Victor. The number of casualties has varied; many claim the Dona Paz was extremely overcrowded. Philippines arrest Chinese 'poachers' after reef collision . Ships collide in North Sea .

"(CNN) -- Parents of young children who get the flu may have a hard time finding an antiviral drug to help treat them. Genentech, which makes the antiviral known as Tamiflu Oral Suppression (Tamiflu OS), the liquid version of the drug, says there have been temporary delays in new shipments. Read More: 5 ways to protect your child in flu season . ""We experienced an increase in demand due to a higher prevalence of influenza Type B in the season,"" Genentech spokeswoman Tara Iannuccillo said in an e-mail. ""We are working to expedite new shipments of Tamiflu OS to distributors as new supplies become available."" Tamilflu OS is typically prescribed for children younger than 13 or for people who have trouble swallowing pills. It is the only flu drug for infants approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA granted that approval for infant use in December. Some 30 million children worldwide -- 6.9 million in the United States -- have received a prescription for it since Tamiflu was first approved in the United States over 13 years ago, according to Genentech. Given within the first couple of days of infection, it can ease flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness. Read More: Flu leads to teen's death . There have been some shortages of the drug at pharmacies, said Mike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS Caremark Corp. However, there is an alternative for children, he said. ""Patients can speak to their pharmacist about the option of having the pharmacy compound Tamiflu capsules into a liquid,"" DeAngelis said in an e-mail. Walgreens spokesman Jim Cohn said it, too, has experienced some shortages. But pharmacists can ""compound as needed to continue filling prescriptions for the liquid Tamiflu to meet the needs of patients during this flu season,"" he said. A pharmacist, for instance, would be able to take the capsule version of the drug and suspend it in Ora-Sweet to make a liquid version of the drug. Ora-Sweet is a sweet and thick syrup that is the base of many liquid versions of children's medicine. There is an adequate supply of the capsule form of Tamiflu, according to the manufacturer. There have been shortages of the capsule in the past, particularly during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, and another shortage in 2011. ""The FDA is continuing to monitor this closely and will post information on our website. We are also working with the company to increase supplies,"" said Sarah Clark-Lynn, a spokewoman from the FDA Office of Public Affairs. Map of state-by-state flu numbers .
