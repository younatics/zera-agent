"Led Zeppelin could be sued over claims they stole the opening riff of Stairway To Heaven, their most famous song. A band called Spirit are attempting to block the track's re-release after claiming their late guitarist Randy California should be given a writing credit on the 1971 track. They and others say Stairway's famous picked guitar riff, written by Jimmy Page, closely resembles the guitar part on their 1968 song Taurus. Who really wrote it? Jimmy Page, left, of Led Zeppelin laid down the guitar parts for Stairway To Heaven, but it is now claimed that the notes in the song's opening bars were in fact written by Randy California, right . Spirit bassist Mark Andes reckons Led Zeppelin would have heard the song when the two bands were on tour together in the late 1960s - which they then copied for their smash hit song. He told Bloomberg Businessweek: 'It would typically come after a big forceful number and always got a good response. They would have seen it in that context. 'It is fairly blatant, and note for note. It would just be nice if the Led Zeppelin guys gave Randy a little nod. That would be lovely.' It's not the first time that Led Zeppelin have been taken to court over their music. Guitarist Jimmy Page has previously admitted taking inspiration from blues and folk musicians in crafting the band's hits, although he claimed he 'always tried to bring something fresh'. Nevertheless, songwriters have over the decades brought successful legal challenges to the group and its label, forcing them to pay royalties and add credits to songs they claimed as their own. Album listings for Whole Lotta Love, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, The Lemon Song and Dazed And Confused have all had to be amended to include names of artists which courts ruled were the true originators of the music. Rocking: Page plucks one of his famous solos on stage with Led Zeppelin in Sydney, Australia, one year after the release of Stairway To Heaven on their album Led Zeppelin IV . Randy California's old band Spirit on stage in 1969, around the time they say that Led Zeppelin would have heard them playing their song Taurus, which it is claimed that Page took the guitar riff from . But the row over Stairway To Heaven, the song which arguably propelled them to rock megastardom, could be the biggest yet. In 2008, Conde Nast Portfolio magazine estimated that the song had earned at least $525million dollars in royalties and record sales. It appears on America's third biggest-selling album of all time, Led Zeppelin IV. Randy California's family said the reason they waited so long to take legal action was because they could never afford it. They are seeking an injunction to block the re-release of Led Zepellin IV in deluxe, remastered vinyl and CD editions, planned for this June, while they file a copyright infringement lawsuit. Led Zeppelin IV album sleeve: The litigants are seeking an injunction to block the album's re-release of in deluxe, remastered vinyl and CD editions this June, while they file a copyright infringement lawsuit. U.S. lawyer Francis Alexander Molofiy, who is handling the case, said: 'The idea behind this is to make sure that Randy California is given a writing credit on Stairway to Heaven. It's been a long time coming.' And, of course, there's the money. California drowned in 1997 while rescuing his son from a rip current while on holiday in Hawaii and the royalties from his music career are now collected by a trust. The beneficiary of that trust is the Randy California Project in Ventura County, California, which teachers youngsters music. Led Zeppelin would not comment on the case.","U.S. band Spirit claim Stairway's opening riff was taken from their song .

"A 19-year-old could serve a life sentence in prison because he made pot brownies with hash oil instead of solid marijuana. Texas teen Jacob Lavoro may be charged with a first degree felony because he decided to use hash oil in a brownie recipe. The state is permitted to use the entire weight of the brownies including the butter, milk, sugar and cocoa to calculate the weight of the drugs. Round Rock, Texas officials confiscated 1.5 pounds of brownies and Lavoro, who would have been charged with a misdemeanor had he used solid weed instead of hash oil, could serve anywhere from 5 years to life in prison. Jacob Lavoro, 19, may face life in prison because he made pot brownies using hash oil instead of solid marijuana which would have warranted a mere misdemeanor . Jacob Lavoro (pictured left and right) has no prior criminal record and his family and his lawyer is ready to fight to grant him a lesser charge . Lavoro's lawyer Jack Holmes told KUTV.com that Lavoro's punishment isoo harsh and is 'higher than the punishment range for sexual assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It's kind of crazy.' 'I’ve been doing this 22 years as a lawyer and I’ve got 10 years as a police officer and I’ve never seen anything like this before,' he said. 'They’ve weighed baked goods in this case. It ought to be a misdemeanor.' Jacob's father Joe Lavoro told reporters that his son did something illegal and should absolutely be punished but that his punishment should equal the crime. 'Five years to life? I'm sorry, I'm a law abiding citizen. I'm a conservative. I love my country. I'm a Vietnam veteran, but I'll be damned ... this is wrong, this is damn wrong!' he told KEYE-TV. 'If [Jacob] did something wrong he should be punished but to the extent that makes sense. This is illogical. I'm really upset, and I'm frightened, I'm frightened for my son.' Jacob, a former high school football player has an entirely clean record prior to his current charge. Homes pointed out to reporters that Lavoro is in the same county that 'withheld evidence in the Morton case, where a man spent 25 years in prison and he was completely innocent ... so you have to keep that in mind too.' Holmes says he will fight for Jacob to get a more lenient sentence. Since Lavoro used hash oil (left) officials were able to weigh the brownies, including the cooking ingredients, to determine the weight of his drug possession .

"So the Americans have finally done . what the British intelligence services, police, courts and successive . governments failed to do in 15 years — they’ve incarcerated Abu Hamza . for good. You can draw a . direct line from Britain’s failure to act in the late Nineties, when he . first came to the attention of the authorities, through to 52 deaths and . more than 700 injuries in the London bombings in 2005. In . addition, hundreds of young British Muslims have been lured to their . deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria by the warped, poisonous . rhetoric of Hamza and others, who used London as a safe haven in which . to preach, recruit and raise money. Scroll down for video . Guilty verdict: Hate preacher Abu Hamza, 56, who was extradited from the UK in 2012, was found guilty of terrorism offences in New York . It’s a shameful catalogue of . inefficient policing, political blindness, legal weakness and limited . intelligence — in every sense of that phrase. Our security services appeared neither sharp enough to see what was going on nor willing to share what little they did glean. Why . on earth didn’t the police and intelligence agents simply open their . ears and eyes to what was happening all over this country? They . could have attended Hamza’s public meetings, bought his audio cassettes . from Islamic bookshops, spoken to worried families of his followers and . listened to the warnings of intelligence services in Europe and . America. How do I know? Because that’s what I did. As an investigative reporter, I’ve tracked Hamza’s ‘career’ since the late Nineties. Yesterday, . political and legal figures were defending their failure to get an . earlier result. For example, Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General from 2001 . to 2007, said it didn’t matter whether Hamza had been convicted in New . York or London. Finally: The hook-handed father-of-eight, formerly the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque in London, fought extradition to the U.S. for eight years . But how many lives would have been saved — how many families spared the anguish of bereavement — if our Government had acted more decisively? It will remain a damning indictment of the police, politicians and the judicial authorities that they did not react sooner. Even as far back as 1998, when I filmed Hamza spouting his rhetoric at an ‘Islamic Revival Meeting’ in London, it was clear this man was radicalising potential terrorists and should have been arrested or deported. That meeting took place, ironically, in the Friends Meeting House owned by the Quaker movement, which is committed to peace and inclusive faith. However, not much of either was on show that night. The extremist cleric felt secure enough to unveil a plan ‘to make the skies very high risk for anyone who flies’. His bizarre scheme — three years before terrorists hijacked planes on 9/11 — involved giant floating nets, mined with explosives, which, somehow, would entangle passing planes. The 500-strong audience cheered wildly and shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ — (God is Great). David Cameron welcomed the fact that the hate-preacher had finally been brought to justice . Then he urged his followers to devise other similar schemes, before showing gruesome videos of rebel ‘martyrs’ in Chechnya, Palestine and Bosnia. The same torrent of hatred came through in his speeches, which were available on cassette from bookshops in towns such as Burnley and Blackburn. In one inflammatory speech, the audience was told: ‘Get training, it’s so you can get the infidel and crush his head in your arms, wring his throat, whip his intestines out. ‘Forget wasting a bullet on them, cut them in half. If you can put a balaclava on your face and walk down the road and stick one in someone, then do it. As long as you’re going to get away with it.’ For several years, intelligence contacts in Europe told me they were furious at the British Government’s lack of action against Hamza. Although they knew that our security services had paid informers inside Finsbury Park mosque, in North London, which Hamza had turned into his own personal fiefdom, the information gathered wasn’t passed to Special Branch, let alone shared with other countries’ intelligence services. This was a crucial failure, because by the late-Nineties, extremist Islam had become a global phenomenon. Cities such as London, Paris and New York were all at risk from terrorism. Controversial: Hamza delivered sermons outside Finsbury Park mosque during the 1990s . Yet London was allowed to become a base for international terrorism — with Al Qaeda followers living in suburbs right across the capital. Among these was a Saudi who was Osama Bin Laden’s ‘representative’ and the leader of an Algerian terror group that was responsible for horrific atrocities in that country but which was allowed to operate in Britain unhindered. Radical cleric Omar Bakri’s extremist Al-Muhajiroun movement, which was banned in several Arab countries and which stirred up violence on many British campuses, was also based in London until eventually outlawed in 2010. Meanwhile, firebrand Abu Qatada was allowed to remain in Britain — despite ten years of protracted legal hearings — until finally being deported back to his native Jordan last summer. In the official report into the London bombings of July 2005, the police admitted ‘they’d been working to the wrong script’, unaware of the dangers of home-grown terrorism. Shortly after those attacks, I interviewed Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, who had been political director at the Foreign Office in the mid-Nineties. She said that an increasing number of other countries’ governments had complained to Britain about people they considered dangerous who had been allowed to live in London. She said: ‘We’d say to the Home Office: “This is becoming a bit bumpy.” I think the Home Office view was: “Well, they’re not breaking the law and we can’t send them home because they’d be in jeopardy.” In effect, they weren’t willing to act to curb them.’ Not surprisingly, the American government was furious. Three years earlier, I met FBI officials, desperate to prosecute Hamza in the U.S. They couldn’t understand why our Government hadn’t done so, despite clear links between him and British citizens who had been killed in terrorist attacks. Specifically, this referred to an incident in 1999, when a group of Hamza’s followers, including his son and stepson, were arrested in Yemen. Their Yemeni associates took a group of 16 foreign tourists in reprisal. The gang leader’s official spokesman was Hamza. He was aware of what was happening — the result of which was a botched Yemeni rescue operation which led to a shoot-out in which three British tourists died. Ranter: Abu Hamza's bile-filled sermons in the 1990s went unpunished . ‘Why is Hamza still walking your streets?’ an FBI agent asked me. On his suggestion, I looked at court files in Seattle which revealed how utterly inept the British police operation had been. There, I found a memo from Special Branch officers at Heathrow Airport. Although not public knowledge in the UK, it was freely available in America. It described how, in 2001, just before 9/11, a known associate of Hamza’s called Ujaama was stopped while attempting to travel to Afghanistan with cash and computer equipment. Ujaama claimed it was for a girls’ educational charity. Could this really be true at a time when Afghanistan was controlled by the Taliban, who refused to allow girls to be educated? The FBI agent later testified that British security contacts told him they were convinced that the money and equipment came from Hamza and was being sent to fund the Taliban. So, why was Hamza’s courier not arrested — and Hamza himself questioned? Instead, the memo in Seattle reveals that ‘all efforts’ were made to help Ujaama continue his journey. It was only the following year when Hamza’s courier made another trip, this time to the U.S. — but again on the radical cleric’s behalf — where he hoped to find a suitably remote site for a training camp, that he was arrested. Of course, this arrest was made by the now very impatient Americans. In return for a reduced jail sentence, Ujaama testified against Hamza. Another of Hamza’s British followers, Saajid Badat, who was arrested and admitted plotting to blow up a passenger plane in mid-air with a bomb hidden in his shoe, also gave evidence against him. Along with emotional testimony from a survivor of the Yemeni shoot-out, it was enough to convict Hamza.  Now, the cleric is facing life imprisonment. And it was all the result of evidence that could have been available to the UK authorities. The U.S. prosecutor referred to Hamza as ‘hiding in plain sight’ in London. It is said that ‘justice is blind’ — a metaphor meaning the law is impartial, oblivious to race or religion. But from what I’ve seen, it’s a literal description of Britain’s response to Abu Hamza.

"Mother Nature will test even the most committed voter today, with violent storms expected to lash much of Britain. Forecasters say those voting in the European and local elections are likely to be battered by thunder and torrential rain on their way to the polling stations. A severe weather warning is in place across the South where up to 1.5 inches of rain could fall within a matter of hours. After the hottest day of the year on Monday, there will be thundery showers across the country tomorrow . The Environment agency has eight flood warnings in place across the same region, including in areas still at risk as a result of the winter storms. After the weekend’s scorching weather and the hottest day of the year on Monday, the unpredictable British weather will see dark, oppressive clouds move up from the south this morning. Heavy downpours are expected almost everywhere, with most parts of the country at risk of thunderstorms later today. Met Office forecaster Emma Sharples said: ‘Heavy rain has moved up from the south overnight and by 9am it will be over the north of England and Wales – though there will still be thundery showers over the south as well. ‘It has been caused by weather fronts that have started to move in from the south and the west, which have combined with low pressure and the warm temperatures over the continent. ‘The the rest of the week will remain fairly unsettled. This means there will continue to be some heavy showers, and we could still see some thunder during the weekend.’ Downpours come after spectacular lightning lit up the skies off the cost of the Isle of Wight yesterday . The rain comes after Britons basked in  the hottest day of the year on Monday  with a high of 26.3C (79.3F) recorded at  Heathrow Airport. The Environment Agency has warned the stormy weather could lead to localised flooding with the potential to disrupt travel. Eight flood alerts were in place across the South-East last night, with the public body warning of a further low-level risk of flooding across the midlands and southern parts of England and Wales today. A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said last night: ‘The UK weather is notoriously unpredictable and election staff will have plans in place to keep the polling stations open for voters. ‘So if you want to vote, make sure a little thing like the weather doesn’t stop you – but pack a brolly just in case.’","Voters will have to make their way to the polls through showers today .

"They are a popular feature on cars across the country - bumper stickers ordered online that feature stick figure representations of family members and even pets. They seem like harmless decal fun. But authorities are now warning that 'My Family' stickers can give away too much personal information, and may make you a target for creative criminals looking for their next hit. With around 75 per cent of burglaries occurring in residential areas, police say some stickers, such as ones saying 'army dad' or showing children playing sports, make your home life and movements vulnerable to thieves. Too much information? Authorities have sent out a warning to family's who may be - unwittingly - sharing key details about their home life and movements on their bumper stickers to thieves who are looking at new ways of picking their targets . Backlash: The creators of My Family stickers, Monica Liebenow and husband Phil Barham, pictured, have defended their product after U.S. police issued a safety warning about revealing private information . Similarly, a rear-vision mirror parking permit may tell someone where you live or work. Florida resident Kathleen Wiggins said the warnings have made her realize she has a sticker showing her husband is a marine. A clever crook may interpret that as knowing she is often home alone. The sticker also shows she has young children and a small dog. 'That does really worry me,' she told News West 9. Police say having bumper stickers about where your kid goes to school is another way to inform people of where you'll be dropping your child off. If your kids are involved in sports, it will tell them you're probably not home in the afternoons. However, the creator of the 'My Family' sticker series, Australian Monica Liebenow, has rubbished the warnings. 'They are harmless stickers and they are put on cars with a great intention by people who want to express their family pride,' she said. 'I really don't think that is how any would-be robber is going to figure out their next victim,' she said. 'I’m sure they would have more sophisticated ways of doing that.' Ms Liebenow and her husband Phil Barham started the company in 2009 and the mother-of-four said the ongoing success of the stickers proved they posed no dangers. Urging critics to lighten up in their stance, Ms Liebenow said the stickers were a fun gesture that allowed people to express their family pride and some of their hobbies. The range has been a huge success and Ms Ms Liebenow said the continued popularity was proof the stickers did not pose any danger . For those concerned about any possible threat the stickers may pose, the entrepreneur's advice is simple. 'If you're worried about it, don't put it on your car (and) if we're going to make assumptions about things, why can’t we just assume the best,' she said. Ms Liebenow also added that the stickers were never intended to be taken seriously. Bond University criminologist and former police officer Terry Goldsworthy said the stickers were similar to sharing information on social media and that there was some risk to sharing private information publicly. Local law enforcement agencies are warning motorists about the dangers of their bumper stickers . Mr Golsworthy said there was always the possibility that someone could use the for ulterior motives. He . gave the example of a young attractive girl being seen getting into a . car with a sticker of her and a dog. In the absence of a male sticker, . it could be assumed there is no man in her life, making her a target for . someone to follow. 'Then . they know your family structure, your car and where you live so while . by themselves the stickers may not be of importance, together it can all . add up,' he said. The FBI reported that in 2012 there were over two million burglaries in the US , almost 75 percent were residential burglaries.

"At 24 he reportedly negotiated a $1 million salary from the man who inspired Michael Douglas' Wall Street character Gordon Gekko. Last year he took home $250 million. And earlier this month he splashed $147 million for a vacation home, which happened to be the costliest private residence ever sold in the United States.

A portrait of the hedge funder has been painted in House Of Outrageous Fortune, a book about 15 Central Park West by Michael Gross. From above-average beginnings in West Orange, Rosenstein is the middle child of a tax accountant and was suspended from high school for spray painting the basketball coach's garage, according to The New York Post. Rosenstein is the middle child of a tax accountant from West Orange, NJ. He was suspended from high school for spray-painting the basketball coach's garage. After studying accounting at Lehigh University, Rosenstein got an MBA at Wharton and went to work for Merrill Lynch where, as legend has it, he talked his way into $1 million a year from Asher Edelman, the man who supposedly inspired Gordon Gekko. Edelman has said that the figure was closer to $100,000. In 1986, Rosenstein married his wife, Lizanne, at The Plaza, and are still together today. In 1992 he was seriously injured a wind surfing accident. Ignoring advice by doctors to have surgery, Rosenstein turned to yoga to fix his injuries, and now starts every day with a long session. Rosenstein has four children with his wife and, in 2001, when Rosenstein decided to start his own hedge fund, he used their initials in naming it JANA. In 2004, when JANA's assets hit $2 billion, the head of a data-processing company accused it of spreading lies about the firm. The next year, Kerr-McGee, an Oklahoma oil company, sued Rosenstein as well as Carl Icahn, who had joined JANA in a proxy fight. Kerr-McGee accused them of violating a federal law requiring disclosure of an investment. Between 2003 and 2006, JANA earned annual returns of more than 30 percent. With the proceeds of these deals, Rosenstein bought a $29 million duplex apartment in one of the city's most exclusive addresses, 15 Central Park West, then spent millions on rennovations, including a yoga studio with a heated wooden floor.

Jerry Seinfeld and many other power brokers are among the financier’s newest neighbors, and the property features an elaborate garden and a pond with bridges. The massive estate was the dream home of Christopher H. Browne, the former managing director of the Tweedy, Browne Company investment firm – he died December 2009 at age 62 from a heart attack. Browne left the home to architect Andrew Gordon, his partner of 10 years, sources said. The will was contested by a dozen of the deceased investment guru’s relatives, but Gordon remained in the home after reaching a settlement three years after Browne’s death.

It was sold to an unidentified person in a direct transaction that avoided paying hefty broker commissions. ‘Somehow, someone got the inside track. All the brokers are crestfallen,’ said another person.

"The Government’s controversial £50billion high-speed rail project has been given a damning ‘amber-red’ warning - meaning it is at serious risk of failure. Spending watchdogs say successful delivery of the flagship 330-mile HS2 line, which will run from London to Birmingham and then onwards to the North, remains ‘in doubt’ They claim there are ‘major risks in a number of areas’ which require ‘urgent action’ if the scheme is to be saved. At risk: The Government's £50billion high-speed rail project has been given an 'amber-red' warning - meaning it is at serious risk of failure. Above, the HS2 line will run from London to Birmingham, and then on to the North . The alarming assessment by the . watchdog Major Projects Authority (MPA) appeared in its second annual . report published by the Cabinet Office. The report covers 199 projects across Whitehall departments - totalling what ministers admit is an ‘eye-watering’ £400billion of taxpayers’ money over their lifetimes. It rates the projects on a five tier traffic light system from red for ‘unachievable’ to ‘green’ for success being ‘highly likely.’ The delivery of two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers was rated as 'red' for a second year in a row, while the controversial Universal . Credit scheme was excluded from the review after it was 'reset' by Work . and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. HS2's 'amber-red' rating follows an earlier row over the Government’s refusal to publish documents relating to an earlier damning assessment on the scheme. Controversial: Spending watchdogs claim there are 'major risks in a number of areas' which require 'urgent action' if the scheme is to be saved. Above, the Birmingham and Fazeley viaduct, part of the planned HS2 route . Angry: The alarming assessment by the watchdog Major Projects Authority (MPA) appeared in its second annual report published by the Cabinet Office. Above, a protest sign is pictured in Middleton, Staffordshire . The Information Commission is currently taking legal action to force the disclosure of those documents. The new MPA assessment - covering the period from July to September last year - was welcomed by opponents of HS2, who have condemned the project as a ‘white elephant’ and an expensive ‘vanity project.’ But they also criticised the timing of the report’s release – the day after the local government and European elections as votes were still being counted – as ‘a good day to bury bad news’ and another example of Government ‘spin’. In the foreword to the report, Francis Maude said the Government must identify and address problems early on before they become an issue . The 'amber-red' grading, the second worst of the five possible levels, means: ’Successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. Urgent action is needed to ensure these are addressed, and whether resolution is feasible.’ The MPA report states: ‘The amber/red delivery confidence assessment on HS2, like other projects with a similar assessment, indicates that the focused attention that is being applied to addressing the remaining issues must continue.’ It adds: ‘High Speed Rail (HS2) is a high-profile example of a project that displays many of these challenges. It is not unusual for projects of this scale to have a lower delivery confidence assessment early in their project life, highlighting the substantial issues that inevitably remain to be resolved. ‘Significant progress has been made in the last year on HS2, for example in depositing the High Speed Rail Bill in Parliament and securing successful second reading in the Commons.’ But Penny Gaines who chairs campaign group Stop HS2 said: ‘The MPA have kept giving HS2 amber/red ratings. The Department for Transport may claim that it is a project in excellent shape, but the evidence says otherwise.’ And Richard Houghton of HS2Action Alliance said: ‘It’s no surprise the report concludes HS2 is at risk of failure. This project is running out of control.’ The Bill for HS2 recently survived its second reading - despite fury and a backbench rebellion by dozens of Tory backbenchers. But a Department for Transport spokesman . said: ‘As the MPA itself makes clear, HS2 has made significant progress . in the eight months since the evidence for this report was gathered, . most recently with MPs voting 452 to 41 in favour of the Second Reading . of the hybrid Bill. ‘We have met all major milestones and are on track to have spades in the ground in 2017 as planned. Protest: The new MPA assessment - covering the period from July to September last year - was welcomed by opponents of HS2, who have condemned the project as a 'white elephant' and an expensive 'vanity project' 'HS2 is a vital part of the Government’s long term economic plan and we are determined to ensure Britain will benefit from the jobs, skills and extra capacity it will provide.’ In the foreword to the MPA report, Cabinet Office Secretary Francis Maude admits the budgets are ‘eyewatering’, but insists: ’Delivering projects will never be easy – they are some of the biggest and most complex things the Government will do. 'But we must not pretend problems don’t exist. Instead, we must identify and address them early on before they become an issue.’ And Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, wrote: ‘The Treasury remains committed to the  important work that this Government is undertaking to improve the  delivery of our most important projects.’ Speaking out: Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said the Treasury 'remains committed to the  important work that this Government is undertaking to improve the  delivery of our most important projects' The report's publication comes as . campaigners have been fighting for months to have details of earlier . internal correspondence between ministers and HS2 Ltd made public. In . April, Britain’s freedom of information tsar announced he was to launch . an ‘unprecedented’ High Court challenge against the Government after . ministers used a wartime veto to censor embarrassing details about the . controversial HS2 high speed rail project. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said he was seeking a judicial review of Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin’s decision to block publication of secret internal report highlighting official fears that the proposed £50billion project could fail – saying such censorship was ‘unlawful’. The Government's controversial Universal Credit scheme was excluded from the MPA report after it was 'reset' by  Iain Duncan Smith . Mr Graham said he had 'not taken the decision lightly’, but that a fundamental point of principle is at stake. He added that ministers have acted unfairly and unreasonably in banning publication, despite there being ‘no demonstrable flaw in fact or law.’ The furious confrontation began in January when Transport Secretary Mr McLoughlin invoked rare emergency veto powers to ban publication of a damning Whitehall Project Assessment Report into the Government’s controversial HS2 high speed rail. The banned report is also believed to have put an ‘amber-red’ rating on the scheme, suggesting it was in danger of failing. Six months earlier, the Information Commissioner had already ruled that the Government had to disclose the controversial HS2 report. But the Government refused to comply. And after first appealing against the decision. Ministers subsequently withdrew their appeal and in January, imposed a blanket veto of the kind issued in wartime. Ministers argued the report into the Y-shaped line from London to Birmingham and beyond to the North, was private and confidential advice from civil servants to them, so shouldn’t be published. The veto aimed to  ensure that. New figures revealed last week that taxpayer spending on consultants  for the controversial high speed HS2 project is accelerating 86per cent and £87million over budget. Expert analysis of the Department for Transport’s spending to the end of February 2014 by construction magazine Building reveals that the Whitehall-run firm set up to manage the project - HS2 Ltd - has overshot its allocated £101m budget by £87million for four lots of professional services contracts. That takes total spending on consultants to £188m – or 86per cent over budget. Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016, ahead of building work in 2017. The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year. The full route to Manchester and Leeds is expected to be completed by 2030.","Spending watchdogs say successful delivery of HS2 remains 'in doubt'

"Dowsed in foam, dodging eggs and swigging from bottles of champagne… this is the best of young  British academia. Final year students at Oxford University poured out of an exam hall at midday yesterday to celebrate with friends. And following an annual tradition known as ‘trashing’, they were sprayed with foam and flour as bottles of wine and champagne were cracked open. One isn't enough: A foam-covered student drinks from two bottles . Getting trashed: Final year students sprayed one another with foam confetti and flour after their exams . Floreat: The students were in high spirits after the last exams of their degrees, covering one another with flour and alcohol . Elation: One happy student, still in academic dress, frolics through the streets of the ancient university city . But just as the party kicked off, Westminster was unveiling plans to reign in the university drinking culture. The Home Office has told students not to go on pub crawls or take part in Twitter and Facebook drinking games and is spending £90,000 trying to combat the problem of excessive drinking. In future, student union bars – notorious for selling cheap alcohol – will be asked to compete for accredited safe drinking status and encourage a ‘café culture’. To pass, they must show they are taking action to deter binge-drinking, which will include telling young people not to participate in ‘alcohol-related initiation ceremonies’, social media games or pub crawls organised by private firms. There has been huge controversy over ‘Carnage UK’ events held in university towns which encourage students to go on pub crawls, often during Fresher weeks. Rejoicing: The student jumps into the arms of her waiting friends . Silly string: The students covered themselves in brightly-coloured decoration and carried balloons . Alarm has also been raised over the drinking game Neknominate, which involves people filming themselves downing alcohol. The trend, fuelled by videos shared on Facebook and Twitter, has been linked to several deaths. Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said he wants to make universities ‘more productive places to study and live’. He said that being accredited safe drinking status should become a ‘badge of honour’. He added that some students are ‘encouraged to participate in alcohol-fuelled activities which can damage health and in some cases spill over into disorder and anti-social behaviour’. Student union bars must ensure soft . drinks are available at the same price or lower and refuse to serve . ‘intoxicated customers’. Universities must also develop ‘a café culture . that runs into the evening, providing a social alternative to alcoholic . spaces’. Warned: Student celebrations in Oxford were branded a 'disgrace' by university proctors last year . After final year exams in Oxford last year, the celebrations were described by university proctors as ‘a disgrace’ because students left behind rotten food, vomit and broken glass. National Union of Students vice-president Colum McGuire said cutting down on misuse of alcohol could help both student welfare and community relations. So far the universities that have joined the scheme are Loughborough, Nottingham, Manchester Met, Liverpool John Moores, Swansea, Brighton and Royal Holloway.","'Trashing' ceremony sees students covered in foam, flour and confetti .

"The ‘Peru Two’ drug mules are facing a fresh setback to their hopes of a transfer back to the UK after being unexpectedly moved to a remote prison hours outside of Lima in the middle of the desert. Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, who are serving a seven-year jail term after being caught smuggling £1.5 million worth of cocaine, have been clinging to hopes that they might be sent home to serve the remainder of their sentences. But the pair, who until now have been housed in Lima’s all-female Virgen de Fatima prison, were bussed out to Ancon 2, where prostitution and drug-taking is rife, on Thursday. Melissa Reid (left) and Michaella McCollum Connolly (right), who are serving a seven-year jail term in Peru after being caught smuggling £1.5m worth of cocaine, have been unexpectedly transferred to a prison in the middle of the desert . The pair, who until now have been housed in Lima's all-female Virgen de Fatima prison, were bussed out to Ancon 2, where prostitution and drug-taking is rife, on Thursday . In another blow, the women also face the prospect of being separated for the first time since their arrest and kept in different cells. The move will dampen hopes that the drug mules, both 20, will be transferred back to the UK anytime in the near future, with authorities making no official comment on the ongoing negotiations. Last night Melissa Reid’s father, Billy, 54, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This has come as a real shock. It’s a really worrying time for the family, we’re still waiting to hear something from Melissa. ‘Even if you were moved, you’d still think you’d be allowed a phone call back home to your family to tell them you’re OK. We haven’t heard anything since Wednesday. ‘I got the feeling that the girls had integrated quite well at Virgen de Fatima but the situation they’re in now they’ll have to do that all again. Until we hear from them it’s difficult now how they’re doing. I just hope they’re OK.’ The Scottish Prison Service confirmed last month that they have received ‘a repatriation application’ from Peru for Melissa and it is understood Belfast-born Michaella has made a similar application. But Melissa’s family, from Lenzies, near Glasgow, have yet to receive any update on the application and are now coming to terms with the fact that it may be a lengthy wait. The move will dampen hopes that the drug mules, both 20, will be transferred back to the UK anytime in the near future, with authorities making no official comment on the ongoing negotiations . ‘We were a bit swept up in a wave of emotion thinking the transfer might happen fairly quickly but I think I’m back to reality in realising that it won’t happen as soon as we hoped. It’s like a rollercoaster at the moment – really up and down,’ Mr Reid said. Ancon is a mixed prison complex housing almost 3,000 inmates, of which around 325 are foreign, more than 100 of them women and most of whom are there on drug charges. It can take almost three hours from the capital to reach its remote location north of Lima. Janet, a British woman who visited her partner in Ancon last year, gave a first-hand insight into the harsh conditions at the prison in the Prisoners Abroad newsletter. She wrote: ‘There is a tension within the walls, almost a vacuum, and a timeless void. The nature of the design is to segregate and wear down the spirit. ‘Every surface inside is a seamless shade of grey, even the food served to them is a cold grey mush. 'It feels like the monotony and boredom sucks the life out of the men. You can feel their shame as they hang their heads and shuffle by chain by their hands and feet.’ Chloé Constant, a French academic specialising in female prisons in Peru who has interviewed more than 100 inmates, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s a modern purpose-built prison in the middle of the desert and they seem to be shipping all the foreign prisoners out there. ‘There are no trees or grass. The biggest problem is that it’s in the middle of the desert, so the water sometimes doesn’t work and phone lines cut out. Last time I visited there, the women were complaining that there were insects in the food - it’s not very nice.’ The women were each jailed for six years and eight months in December after trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru in their suitcases at Lima International Airport last August. This month The Mail on Sunday revealed how One Direction’s tour manager paid the drug mules a surprise visit, bringing them KFC and chocolate Easter eggs.","Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum .

"Britain has seen a surge in the number of people living in large households because of the so-called ‘sandwich generation’, a report revealed yesterday. More than three million of us now live in a household with at least five other individuals. The Office for National Statistics said this reflects the increase in adults nicknamed the ‘sandwich generation’ because they are not only caring for their children but also their ageing parents. Ladder: The difficulty of getting on to the housing ladder is one reason for the squeeze on space . With young people struggling to get on to the housing ladder, more and more are having to live with their parents because they cannot afford a home of their own. There were 543,000 households with at least six residents, according to the analysis of Census data from England and Wales. This has made it the fastest-growing category of housing, with a 25 per cent jump in ten years. The rise was seen in every region of England and Wales, apart from the North East. The ONS report said: ‘All of these areas have been identified as having high proportions of concealed families [such as inter-generational families], high levels of overcrowding and also have high proportions of the population identifying with Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi ethnic groups.’ More than one in ten households in the East London borough of Newham had at least six people living in. Outside London, the areas with the highest proportion of ‘six or more’ were Luton, Slough, Bradford, Birmingham and Leicester. The data also revealed a decrease in the number of traditional one family households with children – shrinking to 41 per cent of the household population from 43 per cent a decade earlier. In 2013, more than 3.3million adults in the UK aged between 20 and 34 were living with a parent or parents – which was 26 per cent of the age group. This is an increase of 25 per cent from 1996, according to the ONS. In 2013, 49 per cent of 20 to  24-year-olds lived with their parents, compared with 21 per cent of 25 to 29-year-olds and 8 per cent of 30 to 34-year-olds. By the age of 20, 65 per cent of men and 52 per cent of women were living with their parents in 2013. This decreases steadily until around the age of 30, after which the percentages remain more stable. By the age of 34, just 8 per cent of men and 3 per cent of women were living with their parents. The ONS said: ‘A couple of factors may help explain this pattern. First, average earnings of young people increase during their twenties and level off in their mid-thirties. ‘Second, the likelihood of  living with a partner (either cohabiting or married) is higher at older ages.’","More than three million people now live in households of at least six .

"The mother of a teenager travelling on a false passport on missing flight MH370 has spoken for the first time of her son's innocence in the fate of the aircraft. Niloufar Vaezi Tehrani said her son Pouria Nourmohammadi was 'just an ordinary kid' fleeing from his native Iran because of religious persecution. Speaking from Germany, Ms Vaezi said she had been waiting for her son to land in Frankfurt three months ago - but he never arrived because the flight he had taken off from in Kuala Lumpur vanished after a little over an hour. Niloufar Vaezi Tehrani has explained why her son Pouria Nourmohammadi was travelling on MH370 with a stolen passport . 'Just an ordinary kid': Pouria's mother said he was fleeing Iran because of religious persecution . She admitted she knew he was travelling on a passport that was not his but said he was 'desperate' to leave Iran because people had found out he was Christian, not Muslim, and he had started to get into major problems. 'He was planning to go to Germany to be a good person, to study, work and eat,' she told Sydney's Daily Telegraph through an interpreter. 'He was just looking for happiness. He was looking to be able to speak his opinion and he was looking for freedom - he just wanted to be able to live without fear and being anxious.' She said Pouria had also been planning to marry his girlfriend, who remains in Iran and who is very stressed because he is now missing. Pouria, right, pictured with his mother and younger brother Ilia Nourmohammadi . According to his mother, Pouria was planning to go to Germany to be a good person, study, work and eat . Ms Vaezi said she last spoke to Pouria on March 7, some 10 minutes before he headed to Kuala Lumpur International Airport to catch the flight which would take him on the first leg of his journey to Frankfurt. 'We thought initially that the passport was just a made-up passport. We didn't even know that the passport was stolen from somebody else,' said Ms Vaezi. It has already been reported that the passport Pouria was using had been stolen from a tourist in Thailand. His mother said the family were anxious about his use of the passport. 'We talked a lot about this and I said they may realise the age difference between Pouria and the person on the passport. Ms Vaezi last spoke to Pouria on March 7, about 10 minutes before he headed to Kuala Lumpur International Airport . 'We were basically very nervous. However, despite his fear, Pouiria was very excited and very happy that he was coming to see me.' But it was on the morning of March 9 that his mother received a call from her brother who told her a Malaysian Airlines flight was missing. Now she says that until the plane is found she won't give up hope that she will see her son again and she even baked a cake for his 19th birthday on April 30 in case he was found alive. Malaysian Airlines, she said, has not contacted her or passed any information to her. She said she does not want the search to be abandoned. 'It is the pain of 239 families. I don't want the aeroplane forgot because of politics or lies or anything,' she said. It is reported that Pouria was using a passport that had been stolen from a tourist in Thailand . Her comments come as other families reveal their pain at news the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft is not in the Indian Ocean search zone based on pings detected in early April. A complete blow is how the New Zealand wife of a passenger on board the missing plane described the update. Danica Week's mechanical engineer husband Paul was on board the ill-fated flight, bound for Mongolia where he was set to start a new job. Mrs Weeks said the she was trying to comes to terms with the devastating news that MH370 is not located in the search area of the West Australian Coast, but she is still holding hope. Broken: Danica Weeks, pictured with sons Jack, 13 months old and Lincoln, 3, is struggling with news searchers have given up on the area where pings were detected . The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is not in the southern Indian Ocean search zone where pings were detected in early April . 'I don't know where to go from here,' she told Fairfax radio on Friday. 'I'm just a wife trying to find her husband ... 77 days on, I still don't know where he is.' On Thursday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said that the search in the zone where acoustic pings were detected was finished completed and the area could be ruled out as the resting place of MH370. Based on authorities confidence that the pings were the best lead in the search for the missing plane, Ms Weeks said she felt like she had been given false. Mrs Weeks, pictured with husband Paul, who was on MH370, is still waiting for the truth and said she has some small hope left . Anticipating the discovery of the wreckage, Mrs Weeks was organising a memorial for her husband as the search was taking place. 'To completely disregard it entirely was just like ripping my heart out,' the mother-of-two said. The Weeks have two sons together, Lincoln, 3, and 13-month-old Jack, and since the disappearance of the flight, Ms Weeks has been told by people to tell the young boys the truth. 'I'm telling Lincoln the truth that dad isn't coming back and it wasn't his choice,' she said. 'He's obviously emotional about that.' But without being able to process with the truth herself, Mrs Weeks said it was difficult trying to her her children. Mrs Weeks has found it difficult to tell her children what happened to their father, while she is still waiting to find out . 'I still have the slight piece of hope,' she said. 'I know logically it sounds ridiculous, but how can you not when you have nothing to go on?' As she is still coming to terms with the loss of her husband, who was also her best friend, Mrs Weeks said she has not been able to think about taking legal action against Malaysia Airlines. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre has now expanded the search for MH370 to a much wider zone using an arc defined by British company Inmarsat based on the final handshakes between the Boeing 777 and satellites. A new, potentially deeper underwater search will begin in August and could take up to a year. MH370 went missing on March 8 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The search for the missing plane will move to a wider zone and will start from August . Australian Transportation Safety Board chief commissioner Martin Dolan said he was confident that search teams were targeting the right area. 'We still don't have anything that confirms that it's the wrong place, but we will do our analysis and we will determine the best search area for the next phase,' he told AFP. Mr Dolan said it was likely that the linear arc represented the plane's flight path. 'The thing that we're absolutely confident of is somewhere on that long arc we will find the aircraft,' he said. 'But, because it's so long, we have to be able to find a much smaller segment of the arc to concentrate our search and that's what our analysis is looking at defining.' Mr Dolan said authorities were re-analysing satellite data and aircraft performance information to define an area of up to 60,000 square kilometres to search further.","The mother of a teenager travelling on a false passport on missing flight MH370 has spoken out .

"It took a New York jury less than two hours to return a guilty verdict against a 22-year-old man charged with the beating death of his girlfriend inside her college door room. Clayton Whittemore could now be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for the 2012 slaying of Alexandra Kogut, who was found dead at Brockport in upstate New York with 'extensive trauma to the upper body'. As the decision was read aloud, the victim's mother, Becky Kogut, Tweeted: 'Justice for my sweet baby.' Jurors rejected a defense plea to convict the former high school hockey star on a lesser first-degree manslaughter charge, determining Whittemore's childhood of severe abuse at the hands of his father was not a mitigating factor in the murder, according to USA Today. Clayton Whittemore has been found guilty of second degree murder for the beating death of Alexandra Kogut. The jury turned in a unanimous verdict on Friday, taking just just hours to deliberate . The defense argued that Whittemore lost control of his temper the night he killed Kogut because he was 'in the throes of an emotional disturbance' Over three weeks of testimony, with 35 witnesses questioned and hundreds of individual, often graphic photographs and pieces of evidence introduced, District Attorney Sandra Doorley built her case that the early morning Sept. 29, 2012, slaying inside 17-year-old Kogut's dorm was a domestic violence killing fueled by Whittemore's rage and anger. Doorley established that Whittemore had a volatile temper and a pattern of rough, aggressive behavior with his ex-girlfriends. 'This was one of the most brutal and violent murders I have seen in my career,' she said. 'You know, the more I do this, the more personal these cases become for me. 'I really felt connected to the victim. 'I needed to be her voice in the courtroom and I needed to fight for Alex. And, I did.' Whittemore will be sentenced at a hearing July 16. Brutal death: Alexandra Kogut was murdered by her boyfriend Clayton Whittemore in her NY college dorm room, a court has found . Young life: Kogut was found in her dorm room after having suffered extensive trauma . Caught: Clayton Whittemore (left) pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, but was found guilty . Press Connects reported at the time of the murder that Whittemore was not a student at the school, which is a part of the State University of New York system, but his girlfriend was. Her body was found in her room inside McLean Hall on campus. The Utica Observer Dispatch says that the young woman's time of death is being placed between 1.30am and 2am and police only found her body after her mother called the university concerned about her daughter's well-being shortly after the alleged murder. The mother said that she became concerned when her daughter would not pick up her phone. Whittemore was found by state patrols at 4am at a highway rest stop over 100 miles away in Dewitt, New York outside of Rochester. Dewitt is about halfway between the College at Brockport and the American-Canadian border at Niagara Falls. Kogut’s heartbroken family described the young student as 'a bright, beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college education'. The school sent an email to students informing them of the death early Saturday and updated their website as the case unfolded. Happiness: Miss Kogut (bottom left) was found in her dorm room after the brutal attack at the school in upstate New York . On the run: Though he apparently confessed to police when they found him, that happened at a highway rest stop more than 100 miles away from the dorm room where the young woman's body was found . School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school . While they wrote that the victim's death occurred 'under suspicious circumstances', they wrote that 'there is no reason to believe that any other members of the campus community are endangered in any way.' Whittemore lives in neighboring New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010. He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail. 'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM. 'When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community.'","Clayton Whittemore had pleaded not guilty murder to the 2012 slaying of his girlfriend, Alexandra Kogut .

"Wearing a helmet when cycling is a waste of time, a leading neurosurgeon has claimed. Henry Marsh – a keen cyclist himself – argued that the ‘flimsy little helmets’ had done little to help many of his patients who had been involved in crashes. The eminent doctor cited academic research that showed motorists drove closer to cyclists with helmets on because they perceived them as safer. Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh said 'flimsy little helmets' had done little to help many of his patients who had been involved in crashes (stock pic) Cycling helmets are not compulsory in the UK. However, the Government encourages cyclists to wear them and a recent petition demanding they become a legal requirement attracted some 12,000 signatures. So Mr Marsh risked a backlash when he told an audience at the Hay Festival yesterday: ‘I ride a bike and I never wear a helmet. In the countries where bike  helmets are compulsory there has been no reduction in bike injuries whatsoever. ‘I see lots of people in bike accidents and these flimsy little helmets don’t help.’ He added: ‘I have been cycling for 40 years and have only been knocked off once. I wear a cowboy hat and cowboy boots. I look completely mad.’ The doctor, who is based at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, made the controversial comments during a discussion with Ian McEwan, whose most recent novel, Saturday, is about a neurosurgeon.","Neurosurgeon Henry Marsh described them as 'flimsy little helmets'

"The private jet that crashed outside Boston Saturday reached 190mph, but never lifted off the ground, according to data from the plane's black box. The flight data recorder also indicates that the pilot tried to brake and reverse the thrusters before the fiery accident that killed billionaire Lewis Katz and six others. Tire skid marks were also found on the runway leading up to the crash site. Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board said it's not yet clear why the pilot tried to slow the Gulfstream IV before takeoff at Hanscom Field. Information retrieved from the Gulfstream IV's cockpit voice recorder picked up a conversation between the pilot and co-pilot of the about an aircraft control issue, Schiada said, but he would not elaborate and stressed that investigators had not yet determined the cause of the crash. This is the flight data recorder recovered from the jet that crashed Saturday near Boston, killing eight people. Investigators are currently examining it for clues about what went wrong . This is the cockpit voice recorder from the doomed flight. Investigators said it picked up discussion among the pilot and co-pilot about trouble with air traffic control . Chilling: An image taken on Monday shows the charred wreckage of the Gulfstream IV that erupted into flames near Boston on Saturday, killing seven . Terror: An image shows the plane crash at the bottom of the runway at Hanscom Field. The aircraft was heading to Atlantic City on Saturday . Chilling images have revealed . the charred wreckage of the private jet that crashed near Boston on . Saturday, killing seven people including billionaire Lewis Katz. The photographs show the shell of the burned-out aircraft splayed across the banks of the Shawsheen River after leaving a trail of debris across the field in Bedford, Massachusetts where it erupted in flames following a takeoff attempt at Hanscom Field. Investigators have now revealed that the crash was so quick that the pilots had no time to issue a mayday as the plane, a Gulfstream IV owned by Katz, hurtled 2,000 feet off the runway. It then plowed through a fence and across the river banks - killing everyone on board - before coming to a stop. 'It's our understanding from a witness . the aircraft never became airborne,' Luke Schiada, senior air safety . investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board, told the . Boston Herald. 'My . understanding is there wasn’t any abnormal communication... We haven’t . ruled out anything, but there’s no reason to suggest it was anything but . an accident.' The plane, . which was bound for Atlantic City, was carrying seven people, and six . have now been identified by the District Attorney's Office. Katz, 72, perished just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer following a bitter legal battle. Marcella .

The . plane was headed to Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey . when it apparently went off the runway and crashed at 9:40pm then caught . fire, authorities said. Jeff Patterson told The Boston Globe he saw a fireball about 60 feet in the air. 'I . heard a big boom, and I thought at the time that someone was trying to . break into my house because it shook it,' said Patterson's son, . 14-year-old Jared Patterson. 'I thought someone was like banging on the . door trying to get in.' The air field has been closed for further investigation.

'Gerry' Lenfest only recently became the controlling owners of the Inquirer, The . Daily News and Philly.com after buying out the other partners for . $88million in a Tuesday private auction. 'We . all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in . ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,' Lenfest said. 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that . Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on the board of our new . company.' Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 'My father was my best friend. He . taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he . worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were . seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement. 'He loved his native . city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia. He believed in . strengthening education through his founding of charter schools, his . support of the Boys & Girls Clubs and his generosity to his alma . maters, Temple University and Dickinson Law School. 'But his greatest . accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and . me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.' Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife, Anne, had been invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon. Killed: Lewis Katz, 72, was among the 7 people who perished in the crash - which occurred just four days after he won control of the Philadelphia Inquirer . Loss: Marcella Dalsey (left), executive director of the Drew A Katz foundation, and Anne Leeds (right), wife of Longport, New Jersey commissioner James Leeds, died . Victim: Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey was also killed. She is pictured with her husband Sam, a former Camden County prosecutor . The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin. Mr . Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the . Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of . interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher. Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash. Ms . Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ . Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012. Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim. Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake. The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years. 'We know more than anybody how difficult this business is,' Katz told employees Tuesday afternoon at the company's headquarters. 'We're going to give it our best. We're going to try to bring in the best. And, hopefully, we'll have a wonderful result.' His tragic death 'won't derail the sale of the Inquirer, Daily News & Philly.com' the newspaper said on its Twitter feed. Lenfest . told the newspaper he has owned for less than a week, 'It is a severe . loss, but I am pleased to announce that Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will . replace his father on board of our new company.' However, . Lenfest did admit that there would be a delay in the finalizing of the . deal, but that it was expected to close after June 12.

"A dog that nearly chewed her legs off after a cruel owner strung her up by her hindquarters for three days is recovering with new owners in Britain. Irina, a collie-German Shepherd cross, was gagged, hung upside down by her back legs and left for dead by her previous owner in Romania. Her rear legs were so tightly bound the rope had cut through her flesh, and she had desperately gnawed her own legs to the bone in an attempt to free herself. After being strung up by her hind legs, Irina is now expected to make a full recovery from her horrific injuries . How she was found: The two-year-old had been strung up with rope and left upside down for three days . Safe Rescue, a British animal charity, heard of the two-year-old’s plight from local contacts and sent a team to save her. Vets told them her injuries suggested she had been left hanging by her hind legs upside down for three days before being dumped in a garden, where she was found. Irina then had three leg operations in Romania as well as treatment for a uterus infection. She was then fostered by Kevin and Claire Quinn from Norfolk. She has since been given a permanent home in Reading and is expected to make a full recovery. Offshore engineer Mr Quinn, 39, said: 'We were warned she may have been traumatised by her experiences and could have emotional issues, but nothing could be further from the truth. 'Irina is living proof of the resilience and forgiving nature of dogs - her only scars are physical and those are healing very well. 'One upsetting aspect of this is that knowing Irina as we do now, it is very likely that her tail was still wagging when those people were doing those terrible things to her. 'I don’t think she is capable of seeing the bad in people.' Post-op: The dog was saved by British animal charity, Safe Rescue, and brought to start a new life in the UK .

"Federal police were watching over murdered student Jamie Gao for a staggering three years before his death, it has emerged. Friends' claims that he was just a social and naturally smart pupil have been shattered by revelations that he has long been a suspected drug importer. Suggesting that he was far from simply a straight-A student at the University of Technology Sydney, federal officers have provided a 20-page document about his dealings to NSW authorities, who say Mr Gao had been a 'person of interest' since as far back as 2011. Police say that on the day of his murder the 20-year-old was carrying 3kg worth of methamphetamine. Scroll down for video . Watched: Federal police were reportedly monitoring Jamie Gao for three years before his death . 'He was not some lowly delivery boy,' one senior detective told The Daily Telegraph. 'No syndicate is going to trust some underling with 3kg of gear and you don't get trusted with that much for your first deal.' It is believed Mr Gao was caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, at the same time as living an active social life and being loved-up with his new girlfriend. He still lived at home with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. Police have alleged that before he was killed on Tuesday May 20, he got inside a car with  former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby. Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm. CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow. Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure . Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed details of an incident in January where Mr Gao abducted and bashed a teenager  on behalf of a scorned friend in a terrifying 90-minute ordeal. Jaiwei Yu, 19, said he was kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest by Mr Gao and two accomplices. Mr Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault. But when Mr Gao arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Mr Yu instead. Abducted:  The flat (left) at Carlton in Sydney's south that Jaiwei Yu (right) was kidnapped from by Jamie Gao . Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong . 'It was because Alex and his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs. '[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.' During the terrifying 90-minute ordeal Mr Yu was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met. 'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li said. Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm. Jamie Gao's girlfriend (pictured right kissing him) is in shock over his death . 'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said. 'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.' Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. Mr Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm. The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure. 'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said. 'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.' 'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said. 'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.' Mr Gao (left) and his girlfriend (right) started dating at the beginning of the year . The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend. At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'. Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing. Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD. Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her . His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day. 'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.' Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'. 'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said. The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart. 'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said. Mr Gao's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning. The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home. McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night. A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon .

"Hospitals are being put under unprecedented pressure as record numbers of people live to 100 or more, experts warned last night. Care homes and the NHS will struggle to cope as Britain’s centenarian population soars, with 35,000 people living to see their 100th birthday in England in the past ten years. But the number is expected to reach half a million in Britain by 2066, according to a ten-year study at King’s College London. Rise: Care homes and the NHS will struggle to cope as Britain's centenarian population soars, experts have warned. Around 35,000 people have lived to see their 100th birthday in England in the past ten years (file image) Many who die at this age are frail, suffering from pneumonia and need tailored end-of-life care, it says. Palliative care researchers are calling for more care home beds and better planning of health services so fewer very old people need to go into hospital in the last weeks of their life. Admitting patients to hospital at this time also pushes up the cost to the NHS significantly. Dr Catherine Evans, clinical lecturer in palliative care at the Cicely Saunders Institute, King’s College London, said: ‘Centenarians have outlived death from chronic illness, but they are a group living with increasing frailty and vulnerability to pneumonia. The number of centenarians has risen by 73 per cent in the last decade alone. Just before the First World War, there were only 100 centenarians in the whole of Britain. Reaching such a ripe age was rare enough for there to only be 24 recipients of the first congratulatory telegrams sent out by King George in 1917. But now Buckingham Palace sends out around 10,000 hundredth birthday cards a year. When the latest figures were collected in 2012, there were some 13,350 people over 100 in the UK, up from 7,740 in 2002. And the trend for an ageing population is set to continue, with the number of people of retirement age expected to rise by more than a fifth in the next decade, according to the Office for National Statistics. Even in London, which has  the youngest demographic in England, 22 per cent of the population is predicted to be over the age of 65 by 2022. ‘We need to plan for healthcare services that meet the hidden needs of this group, who may decline rapidly if they succumb to an infection or pneumonia. ‘We need to boost high quality care home capacity and responsive primary and community health services to enable people to remain in a comfortable, familiar environment in their last months of life.’ The King’s study, published in the journal PLOS Medicine, found that more centenarians die in  NHS hospitals in England than in other European countries, which provide better care at home or in care homes. The number of those aged more than 100 dying each year increased by 56 per cent in ten years, from 2,823 in 2001 to 4,393 in 2010. There are already half a million people in Britain aged 90 or more, and life expectancy for the next generation is also rising, the Office for National Statistics says. The latest study shows centenarians are more likely to die of pneumonia and frailty and less likely to succumb to the chronic conditions often associated with old age, such as cancer or heart disease, compared to those under 100. Although 61 per cent die in a care home, a significant 27 per cent die in hospital. Only a tenth die in their own home and just 0.2 per cent die in hospice care. The research included 35,867 people with an average age of 101 years at time of death, of whom 87 per cent were women. Hospital admission in the last weeks of life pushes up healthcare costs disproportionately, said Dr Evans, but surveys show most older people would prefer to die at home or in their care home. Older people are now the biggest users of NHS and social services. All-time high: The number of centenarians in Britain is expected to reach half a million by 2066, according to a ten-year study at King's College London. Above, Muriel Noyce celebrated her 100th birthday in March 2010 . The Department of Health estimates the cost of providing hospital and community health services for someone aged 85 or more is three times greater than for those aged 65 to 74. The number of centenarians in the UK has doubled every ten years since 1956. The number worldwide is projected to hit 3,224,000 by 2050. Dr Evans said: ‘Compared to other European countries, the proportion of people aged 90 years and over dying in hospital in England is high, and the number dying in care homes is low. ‘For example, in the Netherlands and Finland more than three-quarters of people aged over 90 die in long-term care such as a nursing home. Far fewer die in hospital. ‘Hospital admission in the last weeks of life accounts for a third of the total cost of end-of-life care per patient. 'Increasing the number of care home beds could reduce the reliance on hospital care, but we need to ensure high-calibre services are provided to enable people to remain in their usual residence at the end of life if they choose.’","Hospitals are put under pressure as more people live to 100, experts warn .

"A breakthrough international trial of a new cancer drug has given researchers renewed hope in the fight against leukaemia, with one Australian doctor suggesting it could end traditional chemotherapy treatments for good. The results of a trial on 391 patients showed the drug Ibrutinib gave patients fighting a type of slow growing blood cancer called Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) a 90 per cent chance of survival, eight higher than the 81 per cent who survive on chemotherapy treatment. What's more, the drug is less invasive than traditional forms of radiation, and is an alternative for patients whose cancer cells have built up a resistance to chemotherapy. Results from the trial also showed that four out of every 10 patients entered remission within a year, compared to four in 100 on a traditional course of radiation. ibrutinib works by killing cells in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and could be the perfect alternative to traditional chemotherapy treatments . The trial has Dr Con Tam of Melbourne's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre confident that  Ibrutinib will eventually replace chemotherapy as the main treatment for leukaemia patients. He told AAP: 'We might not need chemotherapy at all.' Dr Tam said patients on the international trial responded quicker to the drug than chemotherapy and showed fewer side effects. What was also particularly encouraging was that patients who do not respond to, or have a resistance to chemotherapy treatments, now have an alternative. Dr Con Tam, left, is hopeful that  Ibrutinib is the alternative answer to invasive chemotherapy treatments . 'These resistant patients have no other treatment option,' the co-author of a New England Journal of Medicine report said. 'This pill works extremely well when chemotherapy stops working.' The drug, which works by by disabling an enzyme crucial for leukaemia's survival, is currently being fast tracked for approval in the US and it could be just a year before Australians have access to it. Although one of the rarest forms of cancer, CCL is the most common type of leukaemia and the older you are the higher the chance you have of developing it. Almost 80 per cent of all new cases are diagnosed in people over the age of 60. It occurs more frequently in men than women, and because it develops slowly, many people don't show symptoms in its early stages. Dr Tam said hundreds of Australians a year will benefit from the US-developed drug when it comes to Australia next year, but it's unlikely most will be able to afford it until it is listed on Australia's pharmaceutical benefits scheme in two to three years.","Ibrutinib drug trial showed better rates of survival than chemotherapy .

"A teenager pleaded guilty to reckless homicide on Tuesday after she allegedly killed a five-year-old girl with her car while high on a cleaning product. Carly Rousso, 19, from Highland Park, Illinois, also faces an aggravated DUI charge for the crash in 2012 which killed Jaclyn Santos-Sacramento and injured her mother and two baby brothers. Rousso is accused of 'huffing' computer dust cleaner in a Walgreens parking lot to get high before getting into her family's car and losing consciousness. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Carly Rousso, 19, has been convicted of aggravated drunken driving in the death of five-year-old Jaclyn Santos-Sacramento . Support: Carly Rousso enters the Illinois courtroom on Tuesday with her parents holding her hands . Graphic surveillance video shows Rousso rolling up on a curb and running over the young family several times. 911 calls were also heard as part of testimony. According to NBC, the child's mother testified on Tuesday. She said: 'She ran over my daughter's legs, then came forward, and went over her again.' Rousso sobbed when a prosecutor placed a picture of the little girl in front of the courtroom. During a taped video statement from her hospital bed with police in 2012, Rousso said that she made the 'impulse decision' to buy a canned cleaner that day and huffed three times before the crash. Inhaling volatile substances because of their intoxicating effect is called huffing. She said that she was 'depressed' and 'under a lot of pressure'. Five-year-old Jaclyn Santos-Sacramento died after she was rolled over several times by a car in 2012. Her mother and young brothers were also injured . The mother with her young daughter and two sons can be seen crossing the parking lot in September 2012 . The horrifying surveillance tape moments later shows a car jumping the curb and rolling over the family as bystanders run to help . Rousso reportedly had spent time in rehab for suicide, drugs and alcohol but told police that it was the first time she had 'huffed'. The teen's attorney has argued that the chemical found in computer cleaner isn't illegal in Illinois. Prosecutors say the chemical Difluoroethane was found in Rousso's blood shortly after the crash. Rousso has been free on $500,000 bond. The trial will conclude in a Lake County courtroom on Thursday. In a videotaped police statement from her hospital bed, Rousso told police that she 'huffed' because she was under pressure and suffered from depression .","Carly Rousso, 19, from Highland Park, .

"If you’re a woman looking for love then your best bet is to head to the City of London, because it has more single men than anywhere else in England and Wales. The capital’s financial hub has 155 single men per 100 single women. If you’re a man searching for romance your best chance of success may be in Knowsley, Merseyside, because it boasts the most single women, according to a new survey, with 120 per 100 single men. Singleton hotspot: The capital¿s financial hub has 155 single men per 100 single women . 1 City of London 155 single men for 100 single women . 2 Newham 126 . 3 Isles of Scilly 119 . 4 Cambridge 117 . 5 Forest Heath 117 . 6 Stafford 116 . 7 Southampton 116 . 8 Copeland 115 . 9 Tower Hamlets 115 . 10 Eden 114 . Online dating website eHarmony, which has mapped out Britain’s singleton hotspots, claims the capital, however, is rife with single women with six boroughs in the top ten, while three boroughs are in the top ten for single men. Enfield, taking the No2 spot, has 116 single females for 100 single men, Wandsworth 114, Barking and Dagenham 113, Bromley 113, Croydon 111 and Hammersmith and Fulham 111. Meanwhile, the London borough of Newham comes in second for the most amount of single men, with 126 per 100 single females – and Tower Hamlets has the ninth-most, with 115. Other areas with more men than women are Cambridge, Forest Heath, Stafford, Southampton, Copeland and Eden. But overall single men tend to congregate in the countryside while single women are to be found in the town and cities. The report also reveals that overall young single women aged between 18 and 34 are in shorter supply than young single men, primarily because women enter relationships younger than men on average. This means much of the pool of young women are living with men in the older age group, 35-64, and are therefore not ‘single.’ Young men have the best chance of finding young single women in the city, where there are 88 young single women for every 100 young men as opposed to 81 in rural areas. Romance research: Online dating website eHarmony, which has mapped out Britain¿s singleton hotspots, claims the capital is rife with single women . 1 Knowsley 120 single women for 100 single men . 2 Enfield 116 . 3 Wandsworth 114 . 4 Barking and Dagenham 113 . 5 Chichester 113 . 6 Bromley 113 . 7 South Hams 112 . 8 Hertsmere 111 . 9 Croydon 111 . 10 Hammersmith and Fulham 111 . The figures also reveal a ‘doughnut effect’ around London specifically, with a higher ratio of single women living in the outer boroughs such as Enfield, Bromley, Barking and Dagenham, and Croydon but a higher ratio of single men in the middle. The report forecasts that the singles gap in rural areas could widen over the next decade, as increasing numbers of country-based women pursue urban careers and higher earnings. It was based on estimating the number of single men and women aged between 18 and 64 in different local area districts. Crucially, the analysis does not include couples who do not live together, previously recorded as 'single' in data published by the Office for National Statistics. EHarmony's Romain Bertrand said: ‘Meeting that special someone can be tough. ‘With busier lives than ever it can be hard to find the time to get out there and meet people, and sometimes it's a case of simply not being in the right place at the right time. ‘That's where online dating can really make a difference. We know it can be hard for some people to meet a special someone and we wanted to explore the reasons behind this, including location. ‘Regardless of where you live, eHarmony delivers its members quality matches within a distance they feel comfortable with. Britain's singleton hotspots . ‘As the pay-gap between men and women shrinks over the next decade, driving a higher number of females to pursue careers in cities, we expect the 'singles gap' to get even bigger - with even more single women in urban areas, and conversely less in rural communities. ‘As a result, single men in rural areas and single women in urban areas will increase proportionally and we believe many will solve this issue through online dating. ‘As the 'singles gap' grows, the odds will become increasingly stacked against single men and women who live in certain areas, who simply have less people to choose from than those living elsewhere. ‘This combined with increasingly hectic work and social lives mean that online relationship sites, such as eHarmony, become an increasingly important means to find a partner. ‘In fact, our research shows that more than half of all couples will meet online by 2031.’","The capital’s financial hub has 155 single men per 100 single women .

"A police station in South Australia has been given the all clear after testing revealed no toxic substances were contained in a letter opened by an officer. Two police officers reportedly felt unwell and Victor Harbor police station was locked down after a feared biohazard attack in Adelaide. The station has now reopened. But Chief Inspector Ashley Gordon later said only one officer was involved and it might have been a coincidence that she felt nauseated. Scroll down for video . Victor Harbor police station in Adelaide has been locked down following a suspected biohazard attack . The letter had been tested and did not contain anything toxic or any threats, he said. In the past day or so, a couple of letters had been sent, apparently by the same person, to police around the state, but they also did not contain threats or anything toxic. 'We have advised our officers to keep a lookout for these letters,' Insp Gordon told AAP. A suspicious letter was sent to the Victor Harbor police station on Wednesday morning and the officer-in-charge, a 42-year-old female, began to feel unwell after opening the letter. Ambulance and fire service crews were called to the police station just before noon. A witness told advertiser.com.au that the letter was from China and was believed to have contained biohazardous chemicals. A spokesperson for SA Ambulance told MailOnline that the two officers complained of ‘feeling generally unwell’ but were both conscious. One had complained of feeling dizzy. Two police officers reported feeling ill after opening a 'suspicious' letter that had been delivered to the station that morning . The 42-year-old woman was treated for dizziness and one officer was transferred to Victor Harbor Hospital. The spokesperson said the officer was hospitalised as a 'precautionary measure' and the illnesses were 'nothing serious'. The police station has been locked down and MFS firefighters entered the building wearing hazmat equipment. They removed the letter, which was wrapped in yellow plastic, before decontaminating the police station. A spokesperson for South Australian police confirmed that the station had been evacuated due to the letter, but they could not confirm where the letter came from or what it contained.","A 'suspicious letter' was received at the Victor Harbor station on Wednesday morning .

"The sight of a dazzling blue kingfisher plunging into the clear waters of a rural river, emerging moments later with a fish in its beak, is one of the greatest of all British wildlife spectacles. So what is this shyest of birds doing slumming it among discarded shopping trolleys on a concrete-sided river in South London? It has chosen this unlikely spot because it provides everything it needs to raise young birds. Out on a limb: For years, South London's River Wandle was an open sewer, but conservation work has encouraged wildlife like the kingfisher to return and fish stocks are healthy . Rusty perch: Brightly coloured kingfishers rarely live longer than two years . There’s a place to nest (inside a . disused metal pipe), plenty of small fish to feed to the growing chicks . and, most important, fresh water. These kingfishers, captured by photographer Tomos Brangwyn in the bustling heart of our capital, are a tribute to the amazing turn-around in the fortunes of Britain’s urban rivers over the past 50 years. Within living memory, rivers such as the Wandle in South London were open sewers where it was impossible for wildlife to survive. Today, thanks to a concerted clean-up, urban rivers teem with life. The most vulnerable of all Britain’s . birds, kingfishers live fast and die young: few survive beyond their . second birthday. They are especially hard hit by changes in the weather, . especially flash floods, which wash away nests in an instant. Urban flight: Cities offer warmth and abundant food - if not scenic beauty - for the birds . Pole position: The kingfishers on the Wandle have raised six healthy chicks . Snow and ice are bad news, too, and kingfishers are also in danger from predators such as the North American mink, introduced to Britain in 1929. However, by nesting alongside urban rivers and canals, the birds are safe from the mink, which are kept away by the constant footpath traffic of cyclists, dog walkers and joggers. Moreover, cities are several degrees warmer than the countryside, with the temperature raised by heat from vehicles and the sun’s rays reflected from buildings. In winter, this keeps rivers and streams ice free — ideal for kingfishers. According to the British Trust For Ornithology, there are fewer than 5,000 pairs breeding in Britain, so city-based animal welfare organisations have installed ‘kingfisher banks’ - artificial nest holes - where they can safely breed. The good news is that these  particular kingfishers raised six healthy chicks, and they’ve started on a second brood. Hopefully next spring this new generation will be here raising a family of their own.

"A new reality show announced by Lifetime on Wednesday will follow young parents who forego not only hospitals during the birthing process, but also any shelter at all. Born in the Wild will portray the men and women who decide that giving birth surrounded by only the beauty and serenity of nature and away from any doctors or modern interventions is the way to go. Inspired by the huge popularity of a YouTube video that shows a woman giving birth in a tropical creek, some critics say such a show could kick off a dangerous trend that will endanger mothers and their babies alike. Born in the Wild: Lifetime has announced they'll air a show that follows parents who decide to give birth in nature with no doctors . 'What happens when the craziest experience of a woman’s life becomes truly wild, and soon-to-be parents decide to take on an unassisted birth in the outdoors?' wonders the press release. Producers hope the answer is ratings gold as Americans accustomed to hyper sterile hospital births and who are only starting to learn of the rising trend in home births watch with rapt attention. Lifetime says the show's subjects may not be first-time parents and will be closely watched by crews. 'We’re taking extreme precautions to make sure the mothers and the babies are safe,' Eli Lehrer, Lifetime’s senior VP and head of nonfiction programming, told Entertainment Weekly. 'Our presence at these births is going to make them far safer than if they were doing it on their own.' Inspiring: The show was inspired by this woman's video, which showed her giving birth in a creek bed and has racked up 20 million views since February . However, critics saw the people who may feel compelled to 'try this at home,' as it were, won't have the luxury of a TV crew. That means these impressionable souls could be in even greater danger, the position some would say the inspiration for the show was in when she documented for YouTube her own birth in nature. YouTube user Birthinnature has just one video associated with her account, but that single offering has racked up an incredible 20 million views since it was posted in February. It shows the slow process of a woman giving birth from start to finish, while surrounded by her family, in a creek bed. 'It has had a profound effect on my mothering and for my children especially,' the mother in the video said of the nature birth. The subjects of Born in the Wild who are after that same motherly high have yet to be revealed, but Lehrer says there aren't all that many of them. 'I truly don’t think this is something people would enter into lightly,' he says. 'This is a very specific subset of people doing this.' Dangerous: Critics fear the show will encourage parents to endanger their children but producers say only a small subset of people would ever choose to participate in such a birth .","Born in the Wild will follow young parents who take home birth to the next level by leaving even shelter behind .

"British passengers told of their terror today after their flight home was forced to make an emergency landing due to loss of cabin pressure. The Jet 2 flight LS516 started to rapidly descend just an hour after departing from Paphos, Cyprus, to Newcastle last night. The plane dropped thousands of feet in minutes, while oxygen masks were deployed for passengers. Terror: Jet 2 flight LS516 started to rapidly descend just an hour after departing from Paphos, Cyprus, to Newcastle last night. Above, the plane drops thousands of feet in minutes, while oxygen masks are deployed . The aircraft was forced to divert to Sofia Airport in Bulgaria, where emergency crews were waiting on the tarmac. Passengers then had to spend the night in the Bulgarian capital, before boarding an early replacement flight to Newcastle this morning. Today, Vicki Standing, who was travelling home after a two week holiday in Paphos, said the experience had left her 'shaken up'. “It was really scary, I was shaking and I felt sick,' said Ms Standing, who was joined on the flight by her parents Jan, 60, and Neil, 67, and her two sons, Thomas, 14, and three-year-old James. Response: The aircraft was forced to divert to Sofia Airport in Bulgaria, where emergency crews were waiting . Flight: The Jet 2 plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to loss of cabin pressure (file picture) 'I said to my my oldest son ""there is something wrong here"". My ears were popping and we were losing altitude. 'Then the seat belt signs came on, but there was no turbulence. The next thing I remember is hearing the word emergency and that made me panic. 'I thought we were crash landing. Everyone’s mask deployed apart from mine. I clawed at it until it came down. 'It was about five minutes of not knowing what was happening. I spent the five minutes cuddling my youngest son and holding the mask to his face. If he didn’t have it on he may have gone unconscious. Diversion: Passengers were forced to spend the night at Sofia Airport (above) following the emergency landing . 'After five minutes were up, we must have reached 10,000 feet. It is like something you see in movies, I didn’t think it would happen to us. 'It kind of spoiled my holiday a little bit, but it gave us something to talk about.' Ms Standing, from Darlington, said she and the other passengers had been forced to wait at Sofia Airport for around seven-and-a-half hours before boarding the replacement flight. 'We got to the airport at half past seven, their time, and did not leave until three o’clock in the morning,' she said. 'My dad is scared of flying and he was getting chest pains just thinking about getting back on the flight home. We had to get a different flight which was sent from Manchester. 'Everyone was chatting a lot about it. People were saying there was a man on board in his twenties who had to be hypnotised and take medication to fly. 'They were saying he refused to get back on a flight again and they had to get him back to Newcastle by not flying. 'A lot of people were shaken up.' Maxine Reed, who was also travelling on the Jet 2 flight, said: 'They lost cabin pressure. The oxygen masks fell down for us and we landed in Sofia for safety measures. 'The plane’s altitude dropped. The plane was nearly full and there was kids on board. Home: The traumatised travellers then boarded a replacement flight to Newcastle Airport (above) this morning . 'I had a flashing thought of ""this is it"". They let us know what was happening as soon as it was stabilised. 'We were taken in to terminal and separated from other passengers so we didn’t need to clear security again. We got back to Newcastle at about 5am this morning.' A Jet 2 spokesman said today: 'Flight LS516 from Paphos to Newcastle diverted to Sofia Airport yesterday afternoon as a precautionary measure due to a technical issue.

"A lawmaker from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party has described rape as a social crime, saying 'sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.' The latest controversial remarks by an Indian politician about rape came as political leaders of Uttar Pradesh, the state where two cousins aged 12 and 14 were raped and hanged last week, have faced criticism for failing to visit the scene and for accusing the media of hyping the story. A regional politician from Modi's own party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Thursday that the crime of rape can only be considered to have been committed if it is reported to police. Sadness: Indian police bring one victim's mother to the scene of the rape and murder where two girls were hanged . Brutal: Women activists of Bharatiya Janata Party, flag seen top, face police water cannons as they demonstrate outside the office of Uttar Pradesh state chief minister . Babulal Gaur the home minister responsible for law and order in the BJP-run central state of Madhya Pradesh said: 'This is a social crime which depends on men and women. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong.' He added: 'Until there's a complaint, nothing can happen.' Gaur also expressed sympathy with Mulayam Singh Yadav, head of the regional Samajwadi Party that runs Uttar Pradesh. In the recent election, Mulayam criticised legal changes that foresee the death penalty for gang rape, saying: 'Boys commit mistakes: Will they be hanged for rape?' The BJP dismissed Gaur's comments as an expression of his personal views, and not the party's. Modi, who was sworn in as prime minister last week after a landslide election victory, has so far remained silent over the double killing in the village of Katra Shahadatganj, around half a day's drive east of New Delhi. The father and uncle of one of the victims said they tried to report the crime to local police but had been turned away. Three men have been arrested over the killings. Two policemen were held on suspicion of trying to cover up the crime. Although a rape is reported in India every 21 minutes on average, law enforcement failures mean that such crimes - a symptom of pervasive sexual and caste oppression - are often not reported or properly investigated, human rights groups say. More sex crimes have come to light in recent days. A woman in a nearby district of Uttar Pradesh was gang-raped, forced to drink acid and strangled to death. Another was shot dead in northeast India while resisting attackers, media reports said. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he was 'especially appalled' by the rape and murder of the two girls. 'We say no to the dismissive, destructive attitude of, 'Boys will be boys',' he said in a statement this week that made clear his contempt for the language used by Mulayam Singh Yadav.

"An unemployed man won a £53,000 Porsche and £10,000 in cash after spending £250 of his benefits money on a spot-the-ball contest. Andrew Boyce, 52, bought 50 £5 tickets when he saw the competition in his local shopping centre. But he was criticised last night for using his benefits on a frivolous competition instead of essentials. One neighbour said last night: ‘It’s sickening that I have to work two jobs to feed my family and that prat is spending my taxes spotting balls.’ Another resident added: ‘Welcome to benefits Britain. Will he declare his good fortune to the benefits office? It makes me wonder how much else he has spent trying to win something.’ Mr Boyce, from Leyton, East London, receives disability benefits after breaking his back in a car crash in 2004. Scroll down for video . Andrew Boyce enjoys his champagne after winning a Porsche Boxster and £10,000 in cash in a competition . The former driver for Waltham Forest council said last night: ‘It’s difficult to get a job when you’ve got a broken back. 'I’ve . not been well and it’s got me down. But this has cheered me up. I . wasn’t going to put all my benefits on – it was controlled. I’m not an . addicted gambler.’ The bachelor, who was driving a 15-year-old Ford Escort before winning the Porsche Boxster GTS, said the new car’s leather interior ‘should cushion my back’. Mr Boyce said he would tell welfare officals of his win and intended to continue claiming benefits. Mr Boyce has shrugged off criticism of his win, insisting he can spend his benefits money on whatever he likes . He also insisted his critics were merely envious, adding: ‘I won and I was so happy – but it’s frustrating now because people are complaining that I spent benefits on it. What has it got to do with anyone? ‘It’s ridiculous. I got a bit of good fortune and it’s no one’s business how that happened. It’s giving people with benefits bad publicity because it looks like we’ve got money to throw around. I don’t gamble, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t have meals out. 'I just sit at home and watch telly. I’ve gone from rags to riches – it’s like Only Fools And Horses. 'People are just negative and jealous and want to bring others down. I’ve been unwell and that’s why I’m on benefits. 'I’ve been unemployed for a while. There’s not a lot of work around at the moment.’ He said his bad back and 6ft 3in frame made getting in and out of the Escort a challenge, adding: ‘The Porsche will be a lovely change.’ However, Mr Boyce, who has already sold his purple Ford to a local garage for £400, said he would probably have to sell the Porsche eventually because he cannot afford to run it. He is planning to spend some of the £10,000 on a holiday to ‘somewhere nice and hot’, and said he may also give some to charity. He discovered he had won when William Hindmarch, whose company Best Of The Best runs the competition, surprised him at his terraced home on Tuesday. After being shown the car, which had a briefcase with £10,000 in cash in the boot, Mr Boyce sprayed champagne in the street, saying: ‘It’s absolutely brilliant. I think I could get used to this.’ Mr Hindmarch said: ‘He was pretty speechless. No one expects to be swapping from a Ford Escort to a Porsche on the same day.’ Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘People can spend their benefits on whatever they want. 'But taxpayers’ anger that their cash has been used to win a swanky Porsche is understandable. ‘There’s nothing to stop Mr Boyce giving some of the cash back to the Government, and plenty of people will expect he’ll do just that.’","Jobless Andrew Boyce says he cannot work because of a bad back .

"A group of soldiers who served with Sgt Bowe Bergdahl all agreed that he was a deserter, before angrily spelling out how they would have 'died for someone who then simply left'. Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2009. He was freed in exchange for five Taliban mujahideen being held in Guantanamo Bay. Scroll down for video . In June the six soldiers appeared on Fox News and all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter . The six say they are angered by White House attempts to paint Bergdahl as a 'war hero', such as when his parents appeared with Obama in the White House Rose Garden . But six soldiers interviewed on Fox News all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter. One, Cody Full, said: ‘[Bergdahl] did not serve with distinction. That’s a spit in the face to everyone who joined the Army and anyone who died looking for him.’ He added: ‘Here is the thing. When you’re in combat doesn’t matter, left, right, Independent, Jedi, whatever you want to be. He’s my brother, he’s my brother, he’s my brother. We’ll all ride together, we’ll all die together. I don’t know how he felt about us but we would all die for him and he left.’ The soldiers are demanding that Bergdahl tells his side of the story, saying that he owes it to them and the American people. Six of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's former platoon mates are shopping proposals for a book and movie manuscript that are fiercely critical of the former prisoner of war . Team leader Evan Buetow said Bergdahl had asked him a number of questions a short time before his disappearance that, in retrospect, make it apparent that Bergdahl had been planning to leave. Bergdahl asked him, for example, how much of a cash advance he could get and how to go about mailing home his personal computer and other belongings. He also asked what would happen if his weapon and other sensitive items such as night vision goggles went missing. He said he told Bergdahl that, as any soldier would know, that would be 'a big deal'. 'At the time ... it wasn't really alarming' to hear Bergdahl ask about those things, Buetow said. 'Yes, it was a kind of off-the-wall question,' but the notion of a fellow soldier running off during the night seemed so far-fetched as to not be possible, he said. Buetow said that crucial missions were cancelled while the platoon searched for him. Demanding answers: Bergdahl's team leader Evan Buetow said the American people are owed an explanation about the exchange . In this image taken from video obtained from Voice Of Jihad Website, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, right, stands with a Taliban fighter in eastern Afghanistan . In enemy territory: A Taliban fighter speaks to Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in eastern Afghanistan . He said he feels strongly that Bergdahl should face trial for desertion, but he said it is less clear that he should be blamed for the deaths of all soldiers killed during months of trying to find him. He said he knows of at least one death on an intelligence-directed infantry patrol to a village in search of Bergdahl. More broadly, the mission of his entire unit changed after Bergdahl's disappearance because it began to incorporate efforts to pursue clues to his whereabouts. 'Those soldiers who died on those missions, they would not have been where they were ... if Bergdahl had never walked away,' he said. 'At the same time I do believe it is somewhat unfair for people to say, ""It is Bergdahl's fault that these people are dead."" I think that's a little harsh.' The exchange has become a toxic issue for President Barack Obama with Republicans saying the swap is 'putting a price' on American soldiers and will lead to more kidnappings. Sgt Bergdahl, who is now aged 28, is being treated at a US military hospital in Germany before he flies back home to a growing row and many unanswered questions about what actually happened to him. On Monday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Buck McKeon said that he planned to hold hearings on the matter and get to the bottom of what happened. He added that he felt the President ‘broke the law’ because he did not consult Congress about the release of inmates of Guantanamo Bay, as he is obliged to do so under the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, Texas, also said: ‘Now we make deals with terrorists. And the question going forward is, have we just put a price on other US soldiers? ‘What does this tell terrorists, that if you capture a US soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorists we’ve gone after?’","Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban in Afghanistan in June 2009 .

"Rabbi Hyman Steinberg, 82, was fatally injured by driver Simon Martins, 24, who later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at Manchester Crown Court . Relatives of a grandfather killed by a speeding motorist have criticised celebrity lawyer Nick Freeman – better known as Mr Loophole – for saying the victim ought to have been wearing more brightly coloured clothes. The 82-year-old Rabbi Hyman Steinberg was killed by motorist Simon Martins who had just sent a text message and had been doing 42mph in a 30mph zone. But Martins escaped a prison sentence for killing the rabbi after Mr Freeman argued that the victim should ‘assume some responsibility’ because he was not wearing highly visible clothing. Last night Rabbi Steinberg’s disgusted family said that it wouldn’t have made any difference if had been festooned in ‘pink, white and blue flashing lights’ because he was practically on the pavement when he was mown down. Mr Freeman, a high-profile solicitor known as ‘Mr Loophole’, has won acquittals for celebrity clients including Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham, Jeremy Clarkson and Colin Montgomerie. But he has been criticised for his ‘sharp practice’ by a High Court judge while other critics accuse him of exploiting gaps in the rules to help offenders escape justice. Mr Freeman told the court Rabbi Steinberg would have been been ‘invisible’ on the rainy winter’s night due to his traditional all-black orthodox Jewish clothing. He added that pedestrians like him would be safer if they wore ‘something reflective that would give them a visible presence, such as a vest, armbands or belt’. Mr Loophole Nick Freeman (left) and his client Simon Martins (right) who mowed down an 82-year-old rabbi . Mr Freeman said: ‘Pedestrians along with motorists and cyclists all share road space, and in my view therefore must assume some responsibility to ensure their visibility. ‘Sadly, because he was “invisible”, Mr Steinberg has lost his life.’ However his comments were yesterday labelled ‘nonsense’ by the rabbi’s son-in-law, 63-year-old Cyril Rose, who added he had been shocked driver Simon Martins hadn’t been jailed. ‘What Mr Freeman has said is ridiculous and insensitive,’ said Mr Rose, who is himself a solicitor and witnessed the collision. ‘Had my father-in-law been wearing pink, white and blue flashing lights, it would not have made the slightest bit of difference because he was practically on the pavement and he still got hit. The driver was just driving carelessly. ‘I’m sure when Mr Freeman goes to court each day he wears a blue or black suit. Does he wear reflective clothing?’ Rabbi Steinberg had been walking to his local synagogue in Whitefield, Greater Manchester in December 2012 and had ‘almost got to the pavement’ when he was hit and flung into the air, Manchester Crown Court was told this week. Martins, 24, had been doing up to 42mph on a 30mph road and had sent a text message from behind the wheel just minutes before he hit the rabbi, who had 54 grandchildren. He claimed he had not seen Rabbi Steinberg in his black hat, black suit and black overcoat until it was too late, and was said to be ‘haunted’ by his death. Rabbi Steinberg was well respected in Broughton¿s large orthodox Jewish community. Here he is with his wife, children and some of his 54 grandchildren . Martins – who had been blessed by Rabbi Steinberg’s brother as a baby - was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete 300 hours’ community service, with a 15-month driving ban, after admitting causing death by careless driving. Afterwards Mr Freeman said he wasn’t suggesting ‘everyone must wear a hi-viz jacket’ but that pedestrians could do more to protect themselves at night.Mr Rose added: ‘I expected the driver to go down for a few years as a deterrent for others, I am surprised by this sentence.’ Tributes have been paid to Rabbi Steinberg of Broughton by the area’s large Jewish community. Lib Dem transport spokesman John Leech – MP for the Manchester constituency of Withington – is now calling for the sentence to be reviewed, saying it set a ‘dangerous precedent’. And he criticised Mr Freeman’s comments, saying: ‘As well as being culturally insensitive, the incident was clearly the fault of the speeding driver.’ But the solicitor hit back, accusing the politician of political point-scoring and saying ministers should do more to encourage pedestrians to make themselves visible at night. ‘My comments are pertinent to men and women of all colours and creeds, and in case he is not aware I too am Jewish, so I’m hardly likely to denigrate my own culture,’ Mr Freeman added.","Rabbi Hyman Steinberg, 82, was going to local synagogue in Whitefield, Greater Manchester .

"In a moving tribute to her 'beautiful dad' one of fugitive Rodney Clavell's daughters has posted a haunting message on Facebook saying, 'you must have felt so alone at the end, I can't imagine'. The daughter, one of Rodney Clavell's ten surviving children, posted the message on the day her father was found dead after a 12-hour siege in the Adelaide CBD. In two posts on her Facebook page following her father's death, the Adelaide girl said, 'I hope you are peaceful now and never have to run again'. In the first message, she said, I love you daddy! No one will understand the hard life you have had and the decisions you have made. Rodney Clavell (centre) is survived by ten children, nine pictured here in an old family photo . 'I love you and forgive you for everything. You will be close to my heart til the day I see you again. R.I.P Rodney Clavell'. In a later post on the same day, she wrote, 'You were taken too soon! I never got to say goodbye or tell you how much I loved you. 'I don't care what anyone says you were a good dad when we were little, you taught us so much I know deep down you just wanted the best for us! 'You must have felt so alone in the end I can't even imagine. I hope you are peaceful now and never have to run again. 'You were a beautiful man and will be greatly missed by us. Without you I already have a piece of me missing that belongs to you forever!' Rodney many years ago, on a beach with five of his children . Emmanuel Clavell, also known as Manny, tried to save his uncle Rodney Clavell's life during a 12-hour-siege on Thursday which ended with 'a shot' He was the uncle who mentored him in prison and to whom he looked up to and in Rodney Clavell's final hour, nephew Emmanuel Clavell tried to save his life. But when Emmanuel Clavell, 39, made a last minute dash to the siege where his uncle was holed up on Thursday surrounded by police in a shutdown of the Adelaide CBD, he was a fraction too late. 'Manny managed to push through two barricades to get to police and beg to speak to Rodney,' Emmanuel Clavell's uncle, Gary Clavell, told Mailonline. 'He wanted to talk him out. He had just got through the barriers to try and ask whether he could negotiate, when one of the officers said, ""We've heard a shot"". 'I don't know whether the police wouldn't let Emmanuel through early enough or whether he was just too late, but it was all over for Rodney. 'Emmanuel was close to Rodney after he'd got into a bit of trouble and Uncle Rodney looked after him in prison, made sure he was okay. Yeah, protected him.' Emmanuel spent a year in prison, including several months at the Adelaide Remand Centre where Rodney Clavell was serving time as an influential 'top dog' inmate. 'He couldn't get through and he's very upset, very cut up,' Emmanuel's father, Wayne Clavell said. Gary Clavell, Rodney's half brother, told of the fugitive's complex past and tumultuous family relationships . The Clavell family have shared some early family photos of Rodney, here with one of his ten children . Mailonline can reveal the untold background of fugitive Rodney Clavell, his close family bonds and the secrets and lies of his complicated relationships with his father and brothers, and the strong bond he formed with his nephew. Gary Clavell, a 63-year-old Adelaide gyprocker who is a half- brother to Rodney Clavell, 46, said the key to why the fugitive went on the run and shot himself dead in the siege said lay in his relationship with his father, Alby, and the mysterious death of a brother, Ricky. Rodney Clavell took his own life following a 12-hour siege in Adelaide on Thursday . 'I'll never forget the day he pulled me aside and begged me to take him away from the family,' Gary Clavell said. 'He was about 13 at the time. Rodney was a lovely kid, but he was very sensitive. 'I'd lay his problems back to then, our father, and his [full] brother Ricky who was a thief and a drug dealer.' Rodney's late father, Edward Alfred 'Alby' Clavell was a violent alcoholic who fathered two families - Gary and his brother Wayne and two siblings, before moving on to formed a relationship with Beverley Cox, fathering her sons and daughters, Ricky, Rodney, Raylene and Roslyn. 'Dad was bastard. It was long-handled shovels over the back and a piece of four by two on your legs,' Mr Clavell said. 'Rodney might have had it easier after Alby gave up alcohol, but he was still a cold man. It was a straight 'shut the f*** up' and Rodney was a timid, nice little boy. 'He was also living in a home where his grandmother was very nasty on the drink, so one day he got me outside and asked me if I could take him away. He wanted to come and live with me to escape all the nastiness.' Mr Clavell said when Rodney was in his late teens, Alby taught him how to weld and Rodney worked as a welder at the South Australian submarine base, at Osbourne, in north-western Adelaide and was so skilled he taught at a local TAFE college, thereafter becoming a prison officer in the early 2000s. 'Then he became religious which doesn't come from our side of the family. He got religious to the point that he banned our father from his home for the last two years of Dad's life because the old man just couldn't not swear. Emmanuel Clavell was the nephew of Rodney, and the pair had a close relationship while serving time behind bars together . It was revealed that Rodney, here with one of his daughters, had a tough relationship with his own father, according to step-brother Gary . 'Dad died 14 years ago. It was after that Rodney started having problems. 'Dad had taught him boxing and he was a very good amateur boxer. But then through [his brother] Ricky he got into drugs and he started working as a debt collector. 'He was an enforcer. He pulverised anyone who didn't want to pay the money they owed.' Gary Clavell described Rodney's older brother, who died around six years ago, as 'a mongrel' who had robbed a post office in Adelaide's northern suburbs in 1984. 'Ricky was like Alby and the opposite of Rodney,' he said. He got into drugs and he stole off his family. He knocked off the Elizabeth post office. 'Then he got stabbed in jail. After he got out he got Rodney involved in the drugs and they were selling them together. 'Then Ricky got murdered. It was the weirdest thing and I think it really affected Rodney.' Mr Clavell said Ricky was 'asked by a friend' to help clean up a rented property to reclaim the bond. The friend told Ricky he could have sandwiches and a bottle of coca cola in the refrigerator on the premises. When Ricky fell ill, he was taken to hospital, but died of poisoning three days later. The 'friend' was never charged. Gary Clavell opened up about Rodney's dark past with his family and history with drugs and crime . 'It affected Rodney. Ricky was the bad brother with the slightly tuned eye from an accident that gave him a mental look. 'Rodney was the good brother and the good looking one, even from his early teens who had no trouble attracting lots of female. 'I don't know what he felt after [Ricky's death], but he was the one in the family the others looked up to.' A prostitute who knew Rodney Clavell told Mailonline she couldn't imagine him carrying out the brutal hostage drama described by police. Fugitive Rodney Clavell was found dead inside the brothel where he had been hiding out in Adelaide's CBD on Thursday, his body discovered following a 12-hour siege. 'He was a criminal, but I don't think he would have hurt those girls,' said Mindy, 30, who works at a brothel in Adelaide's CBD not far from Marilyn's Studio. Rodney had a complex past with his own family, and the loss of his brother Ricky had a big effect on him . 'He knew one of the girls and I'm pretty sure he was friends with the manager [name witheld].' A prison officer who worked with Clavell at the Adelaide Remand Centre in the early 2000s described him as a good officer whose downfall came when he started using steroids. 'He was a well spoken bloke, very respectful, a nice fellow,' said the currently serving officer who asked not to be identified. 'He did his job well, then he had a downward spiral and went out of control,  started using steroids. 'It's a tragedy.' A former South Australian prison official said Clavell had relatives who were in the prison system in  the 1970s as inmates. 'They were well known petty crims,' he said.","Rodney Clavell took his own life following a 12-hour siege in Adelaide's CBD on Thursday .

"Nearly 1,000 paratroopers dropped out of the sky in Normandy on Sunday - but this time they did so in peace, instead of to wrest western France from the Nazis as they did during World War II. Drawing huge crowds who braved hot weather and lined the historic landing area at La Fiere, the aerial spectacle re-enacted the drama of the Normandy landings and served to cap commemorations marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Among the planes ferrying paratroopers for the event was a restored C-47 US military transport plane that dropped Allied troops on the village of Sainte-Mere-Eglise - a stone's throw from La Fiere - on June 6, 1944. Skies filled: Paratroopers are dropped near the Normandy village of Sainte Mere Eglise, western France, during a mass air drop, on Sunday June 8, 2014, as part of commemorations of the 70 anniversary of the D-Day landing . And the pilots who originally flew it took the controls again last week, 70 years later, remembering their experiences. Sunday saw dozens of veterans escorted down a sandy path to a special section to watch the show alongside thousands of spectators - most of whom lined two sides of the field. Others took shelter in the shade as the lack of wind caused the sun to beat down hard.

Display: Paratroopers watched by the crowd, prepare to land near the Normandy village of Sainte Mere Eglise, western France . Planes including the C-47 aircraft flew by loudly overhead several times, with two dozen military paratroopers - from countries including the U.S., Britain, France and Germany - jumping with each passage. They were scenes reminiscent of the pivotal event, when around 15,000 Allied paratroopers were dropped in and around the village of Sainte-Mere-Eglise on D-Day. It became the first to be liberated by the Allies and remains one of the enduring symbols of the Normandy invasion. Veteran Julian 'Bud' Rice, a C-47 pilot who participated in the airdrops of Normandy on D-Day, watched the show. 'It's good to see 800 paratroopers jump here today, but the night that we came in, we had 800 airplanes with 10,000 paratroopers that we dropped that night, so it was a little more,' he said.

Rice flew in a C-47 aircraft earlier in the week, similar to the one he flew on D-Day. With him was veteran pilot Bill Prindible, with whom he watched the show. 'Very impressive,' Prindible said. 'You just have to imagine there'd be a squadron of 72 aircraft, 36 aircraft going by every time one of those guys went by.' At the invitation of the French government, this restored Douglas C-47 - known as Whiskey 7 - flew for the festivities and released paratroopers as it did when it dropped troops behind enemy lines under German fire. The plane has almost as a rich a story to tell as the pilots who flew it. Although the twin-prop Whiskey 7, so named because of its W-7 squadron marking, looks much the same today as it did on June 6, 1944. It looked very different when it arrived at the National Warplane Museum in western New York as a donation eight years ago. It had been converted to a corporate passenger plane. The museum's president said that for its restoration they had to take out the interior because it then had a dry bar, lounge seats and a table with a map of the Bahamas. And it has moved with the times - now sporting two GPS systems to keep the aircraft on course.","Thousands gather at Sainte-Mere-Eglise to observe aerial drop of 1,000 paratroopers - reenacting their assault on the French town hours before D-Day armada launched .

"Seventeen-year-old Rudy Hummel hasn't let one of the coldest winters in decades, drenching rain or clouds of mosquitoes prevent him from sleeping outside every night for a full year. What began as an experiment, however, became a mission to raise money for those without a roof above their heads. 'I’m not going to claim to have any idea . what it’s like to be homeless, but it opened my eyes to the fact that, . yeah homeless people are there,' Hummel told Arise News this past . January, The Blaze reported. Hummel was preparing yesterday to spend one last night in his treehouse at his family's home in Hermantown, near Duluth, making it 365 straight nights outside. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rudy Hummel stands in front of his snow cave outside his home in Hermantown, Minn. where he slept outside for an entire year . He endured 76 subzero nights in a snow . cave. The Boy Scout would pitch a tent while traveling, even using a . hotel's deck. By his count, he slept outdoors in 30 different places. Hummel's experiment became a fundraiser . along the way for Habitat for Humanity and the Hawk Ridge Bird . Observatory in Duluth. He invited friends over to sleep in his yard for . his last night and urged other people following his adventure to donate . and join them by sleeping out wherever they are. Winter nights weren't so bad, Hummel said, even when it got down to 27 degrees below zero one night. His cave, a hollowed out pile of snow called a quinzhee, kept the temperature about 10 degrees warmer than outside. But mostly he relied on layers — a fleece liner inside a mummy bag inside two other sleeping bags, with two or three quilts over that. He'd wear up to three layers of pants and up to seven shirts. 'The worst nights of all were actually during summer, the really hot, humid nights' that often turned stormy, he recalled. 'I would be completely drenched with my own sweat.' Two nights were especially tough, Hummel said. One was last summer, at Woodland Caribou Provincial Park in Ontario, when he used a hammock with a mosquito net. Rudy Hummel is bedded down in treehouse outside his home in Hermantown, Minn. where he spent a year camping to raise money for charity . 'There were so many mosquitoes that I couldn't get to sleep because the buzzing was so loud,' he said. And . there was a rainy night as the snow melted this spring. He decided his . quinzhee was unsafe so he pitched a tent on the driveway and got soaked . moving his gear. 'That's the only night where I've actually been cold,' he said. 'The wind would rattle the tarp around, I . couldn't get much sleep, the tarp leaked, the rain flew in through the . side 'cause of the wind. The thunder kept me awake,' he told NNCNOW.com. Hummel's parents were proud of their son despite having their own concerns for his safety. 'Ugh. I wanna be like him. I just... he's got more together at 17 than I do . right now really, in many ways,' said Rudy's dad, Mark Hummel. Mark is thankful for the way his son has dedicated his life to making a difference in society. 'I like to think in general that children stand on the shoulders of . their parents, and generation after generation we can grow and evolve as . people and as humanity, but man he came up with a really tall ladder on . top of my shoulders,' said Rudy's dad. Rudy Hummel jumps from his treehouse outside his home where he spent his last night of camping for an entire year . Hummel said he got the idea last April . to spend every summer night in his treehouse. In August, he decided to . go for a full year. In December, he turned it into a fundraiser and . started a website with links to his two charities. He chose Habitat . because he could have gone inside anytime, but knew that some people . don't have that choice. He also picked Hawk Ridge because he learned . that the squirrels, owls and other creatures sharing his backyard . weren't just visitors. He had raised about $4,000 as of Thursday. Hummel . had mixed thoughts about the end of his experiment, mainly because his . bedroom was in 'dreadful' shape after a year of disuse. 'I . will have to do a significant amount of cleaning before I can lay in my . bed,' he said. 'It's amazing how much stuff accumulates in a place you . don't use.' His parents are . proud, but his mother, Gail Johnejack, laughed at the suggestion that . she might be happy to have him back safe inside. 'If he pulled this off I'm pretty confident he could pull whatever off,' she said. Rudy plans to put his unique experience into writing. 'A scout leader in my troop has offered to help me try to put together some stories into a book, so I'll take him up on that. Maybe it won't get published but it will help me at least immortalize these memories for myself,' said Rudy. Rudy's friends say that he has a big heart but that it continues to grow every day. 'If you compare him to the rest of us, he's the biggest giver amongst us,' said Rudy's friend, Andrew Clauson.

The armed men, dressed in black, stormed . into rooms at Anbar University, west of Baghdad, and told students to stay put before they let them go . following a stand off. The attack came as Islamic extremists and other anti-government militias have held parts of the nearby provincial capital of Ramadi and the city of Fallujah since December amid rising tensions between Sunni Muslims and the Shiite-led government.

Attack: The gunmen stormed Anbar University, west of Baghdad, this morning, taking dozens of students hostage in a dormitory . An Al Qaeda splinter group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other Sunni-led militants have controlled parts of Anbar province, including the city of Fallujah and parts of Ramadi, since late December. Iraq is currently grappling with its worst surge in violence since the sectarian bloodshed in 2006 and 2007, when the country was pushed to the brink of civil war despite the presence of tens of thousands of US troops. The latest violence has been fueled by Sunni Muslim anger at the Shiite-led government in Baghdad, as well as the civil war in neighboring Syria. ISIL has carried out scores of deadly attacks on both sides of the border and imposed a brutal form of Islamic rule in territories under its control. It was not immediately clear if ISIL was behind the university attack. Violence has claimed the lives of 799 . Iraqis in May, the highest monthly death toll so far this year.

"The new president of Ukraine has been sworn-in and called for talks with the country's east as pro-Russian rebels launched their latest attack in Luhansk. The assaults took place at Lugansk International Airport over Saturday evening and Sunday morning in the immediate wake of the inauguration of Ukraine's new President Petro Poroshenko. Scroll down for video . President Petro Poroshenko holds the mace of the Ukrainian president during his inauguration ceremony . 'It was clear the rebels were trying to destroy the building which controls the power supply to the airport,' said the source, one of the Ukrainian paratroopers guarding the airport. 'It's the first time we have had an attack of this kind. Up till now, we've only had a few skirmishes,' said the soldier, who identified himself only as Sergiy. According to a military source, there were no injuries in this latest attack. Pro-Russian separatist proclaimed the independence of the 'Lugansk People's Republic' in May at about the same time as the neighbouring 'Donetsk People's Republic'. The two districts have been the scene of ceaseless fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian insurgents that have killed more than 200 people since mid-April.

When approached, a spokesman for the 'Lugansk People's Republic' could not confirm the assaults on the airport which has been closed for the past month because of the instability in the region. The airport is one among very few areas in the Lugansk not controlled by the separatists, who have taken over most of the cities, set up numerous roadblocks and recently seized several checkpoints on the border with Russia. The international airport at the nearby city of Donetsk briefly came under rebel control late last month. The Ukrainian authorities took it back following severe fighting that cost the lives of dozens of fighters, mostly of Russian nationality, according to a report issued by Donetsk insurgents.

A police officer looks at a protester who holds a sign reading: 'Scrap the system' during inauguration of Petro Poroshenko as new president of Ukraine . Poroshenko's inaugural address after taking the oath of office in parliament gave little sign of a quick resolution to the conflict in the east which Ukrainian officials say has left more than 200 people dead. He also took a firm line on Russia's annexation of Crimea insisting that the Black Sea peninsula 'was, is and will be Ukrainian'. He gave no indication of how Ukraine could regain control of Crimea, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has said was given to Ukraine unjustly under Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Hours after the speech, Putin ordered security tightened along Russia's border with Ukraine to prevent illegal crossings, Russian news agencies said. Ukraine claims that many of the insurgents in the east have come from Russia. Poroshenko said he would offer a corridor for safe passage of 'Russian militants' out of the country. However, rebel leaders in the east dismissed Poroshenko's speech. An Orthodox priest blesses people during the Orthodox Holy Trinity at a church in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine .

Denis Pushilin, a top figure in the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, said: 'At the moment it's impossible for him to come (to Donetsk for talks). 'Perhaps with security, a company so people won't tear him to pieces.' Poroshenko offered amnesty to rebels who 'don't have blood on their hands.' But Valery Bolotov, the insurgent leader in the Luhansk region, said he didn't believe it. Rebels in both Luhansk and Donetsk have declared their regions independent. The new president promised 'I will bring you peace' but did not indicate whether Ukrainian forces would scale back their offensives against the insurgency, which Ukraine says is fomented by Russia. Russia has insisted on Ukraine ending its military operation in the east. Ambassador Mikhail Zurabov, representing Moscow, at the inauguration, said Poroshenko's statements 'sound reassuring' but 'for us the principal thing is to stop the military operation' adding that the insurgents should also stop fighting in order to bolster the delivery of humanitarian aid, RIA Novosti reported.

Poroshenko, often called 'The Chocolate King' because of the fortune he made as a confectionery tycoon, was elected May 25. He replaces Oleksandr Turchynov, who served as interim president after Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country in February after months of street protests against him. The fall of Yanukovych aggravated long-brewing tensions in eastern and southern Ukraine, whose majority native Russian speakers denounced the new government as a nationalist putsch that aimed to suppress them. Within a month, the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was annexed by Russia after a secession referendum and an armed insurgency arose in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.

(meaning revival of Ukraine) during a rally of Maidan activists on Independence Square in Kiev . In his inaugural address, attended by dignitaries including U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. John McCain and Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, Poroshenko promised amnesty 'for those who do not have blood on their hands' and called for dialogue with 'peaceful citizens' in the east. 'I am calling on everyone who has taken arms in their hands - please lay down your arms,' he said, according to an interpreter. He also called for early regional elections in the east and promised to push for new powers to be allotted to regional governments, but he rejected calls for federalisation of Ukraine, which Moscow has advocated. Biden later met with Poroshenko and said 'there is a window for peace and you know as well as anyone that it will not stay open indefinitely ... America is with you.' An Orthodox priest blesses people during the Orthodox Holy Trinity at a church in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . Call for peace: People pray at the Orthodox Holy Trinity church in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine today . Poroshenko also said he would seek early parliamentary elections because 'the current composition of the parliament is not consistent with the aspirations of the nation.' The current parliament, elected in 2012 with a large contingent from Yanukovych's former party, is to stay in place until 2017. Poroshenko insisted that Ukrainian would remain the sole state language of the country but promised 'new opportunities for the Russian language,' without giving specifics. He assumed power a day after meeting Putin at D-Day commemoration ceremonies in France. Putin has denied allegations by Kiev and the West that Russia has fomented the rebellion in the east, and he insisted Friday that Poroshenko needs to speak directly to representatives from the east. After the low-key inauguration ceremony, which included a choir in traditional national costume singing the national anthem, Poroshenko went to the square outside the landmark Sophia Cathedral for a ceremonial troop inspection. Taras Danchuk, a 37-year-old spectator at the square who was wearing a traditional embroidered tunic, said he supported Poroshenko's strategy for trying to negotiate an end the eastern conflict. 'Out of emotion I would like to say that we should destroy the terrorists, but that is not possible without sacrificing the civilians who live there, so there will have to be negotiations,' he said. The protests against Yanukovych were set off by his decision to shelve a long-anticipated agreement to deepen political and economic ties with the European Union and seek closer relations with Russia. The protests grew hugely after police violently dispersed some early gatherings. Poroshenko said he wants to sign the economic portion of the EU 'association agreement' in the near future. No major fighting was reported on Saturday but the Donetsk People's Republic said one of Pushilin's aides was fatally shot in Donetsk city, the region's capital. Also on Saturday, Russian officials including the ambassador and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu complained that two journalists from a TV channel belonging to the ministry had been detained by national guard forces in Ukraine and called for their release.","Assaults took place at Luhansk International Airport over this morning .

But Mr Churchill revealed how an ‘immense armada’ of more than 4,000 ships and several thousand smaller craft had launched the ‘liberating assault’ on the northern coast of France. ‘This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred’, he said. ‘The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course.’ D-Day on June 6, 1944 was the . beginning of an 80-day campaign to liberate the region which involved . three million troops and cost the lives of 250,000. Mr . Churchill’s statement also included news of the liberation of Rome: ‘A . memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the . last five months in Italy.’ But . the focus was on the events which were still unfolding in France, as . thousands of troops made their way across the Channel by sea and by air. ‘It involves tides, wind, . waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the . combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of . intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be . fully foreseen,’ Mr Churchill said. ‘There . are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and . we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the . course of the fighting.’ At . the time the wartime coalition government reported that obstacles and . mines in the sea had not proved as deadly as anticipated. Churchill described how the vast operation was 'undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred' Parliament was updated on the landings even as Commandos from the 1st SS Brigade waded ashore . Churchill said an 'immense armada' of thousands of ships was supporting the Allied forces . The British, American, French and Canadian troops who parachuted into enemy lines had successfully ‘quelled’ enemy fire. Mr Churchill said: ‘The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle.’ To applause from MPs, he concluded: ‘Nothing that equipment,  science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve.’ In response Arthur Greenwood, the . leader of the opposition during the Second World War, said the outbreak . of applause was a sign of ‘gratitude to all those who have bled and . fought in the battles in Italy’. He . added: ‘Now that our Armies there are on the march, it will not be long . before the German invader is turned out of that peninsula. We are . living through momentous hours.’ Mr . Greenwood went on: ‘There is nothing much that we can do, except to . pledge ourselves, and to pledge our physical and spiritual resources, to . the unstinted aid of the men and women who are serving overseas; to let . them know the pride that we shall feel in their victories and the . sadness that we shall feel about their losses.’ Thousands of troops parachuting into enemy lines had successfully 'quelled' German batteries . Communist MP William Gallacher said: ‘This is one of the most solemn moments in the life of this Parliament, and it is certainly not a time for making, or trying to make, speeches, but I should like to express my own feeling. ‘And I am sure the feeling of every Member of the House, that our hearts and our thoughts are with these lads who have gone across to the Continent and with their mothers here at home.’ Labour MP Aneurin Bevan urged Mr . Churchill to send a message ‘to the people of France at this moment… . directly from the representatives of the British people to the people of . France’. Mr Churchill . pledged to keep MPs updated on the progress of the landings, and . returned to deliver a second statement that evening. Having . spent the day listening to the latest communications from the front, he . revealed the operation was ‘proceeding in thoroughly satisfactory . manner’. He claimed that ‘many dangers and difficulties which at this time last night appeared extremely formidable are behind us’. He suggested that the Channel . crossing had been completed ‘with far less loss than we apprehended’ and . the RAF had been successful in weakening the German batteries. He . went on: ‘The landings along the whole front have been effective, and . our troops have penetrated, in some cases, several miles inland. Lodgments exist on a broad front.’ Opposition leader Arthur Greenwood said Britain was 'living through momentous hours' while Labour MP Aneurin Bevan urged Mr Churchill to send a message of solidarity to the people of France . The ‘outstanding feature’ had been the troops parachuted into German lines ‘on a scale far larger than anything that has been seen so far in the world’. Despite fears about the weather, and concerns that visibility would be poor, ‘these landings took place with extremely little loss and with great accuracy’ he said. As details emerged of progress being made along the beaches and into key towns, Mr Churchill said several bridges had been captured. But he warned: ‘All this, although a very valuable first step - a vital and essential first step - gives no indication of what may be the course of the battle in the next days and weeks, because the enemy will now probably endeavour to concentrate on this area. ‘In that event heavy fighting will soon begin and will continue without end, as we can push troops in and he can bring other troops up. It is, therefore, a most serious time that we enter upon. ‘Thank God, we enter upon it with our great Allies all in good heart and all in good friendship.’ play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . Dwight D. Eisenhower and Winston Churchill visiting troops in Normandy . I have to announce to the House that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European Continent has taken place. In this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of France. An immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships, together with several thousand smaller craft, crossed the Channel. Massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time. The fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled. The obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended. The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle. I cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details. Reports are coming in in rapid succession. So far the Commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan. And what a plan! This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred. It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen. There are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting. The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course. This I may say, however. Complete unity prevails throughout the Allied Armies. There is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends of the United States. There is complete confidence in the supreme commander, General Eisenhower, and his lieutenants, and also in the commander of the Expeditionary Force, General Montgomery. The ardour and spirit of the troops, as I saw myself, embarking in these last few days was splendid to witness. Nothing that equipment,  science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve.","Wartime PM delivered statement to Parliament hours after operation began .

"A worried Cyril Smith MP smoking in his office during the Jeremy Thorpe scandal . Secret documents revealing why Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith escaped prosecution for child abuse will now be published after a lengthy legal battle. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been ordered to release papers relating to its decision not to bring charges against the obese paedophile politician while he was still alive. Police submitted files about Smith’s abuse of boys in his hometown of Rochdale in 1970, 1998 and 1999, but each time prosecutors recommended that no action should be taken against him. But the . Information Rights Tribunal has ruled the CPS must make public documents . explaining why its lawyers decided he should not be brought to court. Judge .

"A new book about Paul McCartney has revealed how the former Beatle battled with alcohol and drugs in the 1970s – and how the band came very close to a reunion years after it fell apart. Man On The Run: Paul McCartney In The 1970s, by Tom Doyle, draws upon several in-depth interviews, and reveals how the musician was stricken with a mental frailty that will astonish his fans. After all, this was a man whose fame straddled the world. Music maestros: John Lennon, left, and Paul McCartney during the photo session for the cover of the Abbey Road album in 1969 . McCartney struggled so much to find his place in the rock and roll world after the Beatles split in 1969 that he became heavily reliant on alcohol and wracked with anxiety. He felt ‘utterly worthless’, he told Doyle. McCartney spent long periods of time at the isolated High Park Farm in Argyll, Scotland, becoming so reclusive that rumours spread that he’d died. Rock in hard times: Paul with wife Linda . McCartney saw Lennon for the last time at his New York apartment - the Dakota - in the Upper West Side . Doyle writes: ‘His often sleepless nights were spent shaking with anxiety, while his days, which he was finding it harder and harder to make it through, were characterized by heavy drinking and self-sedation with marijuana… . ‘When he did get out of bed, he’d reach straight for the whisky, his drinking creeping earlier and earlier into the day. By 3 in the afternoon, he was usually out of it.’ His wife Linda found this downward spiral ‘frightening beyond belief’. New beginning: Paul McCartney performing with his new group Wings in the 1970s . Revealing: Man On The Run . To make matters worse there were huge ups and downs in McCartney’s relationship with John Lennon. In 1976 Lorne Michaels joked that he’d give the Beatles $3,000 if they reunited on Saturday Night Live – and McCartney just happened to be watching with Lennon at his New York apartment. They nearly took a cab to the studio. However, when McCartney called round to the apartment – the Dakota – the next day, guitar in hand and ready to make music together again, Lennon spat: ‘Please call before you come over. It’s not 1956, and turning up at the door isn’t the same anymore.’ They never set eyes on each other again. McCartney found some solace in the group he formed in the 1970s – Wings – but it suffered harsh criticism, with a Rolling Stone reviewer pondering whether the first album, Wild Life, was ‘deliberately second rate’ – and John Lennon describing McCartney’s new compositions as ‘rubbish’. McCartney admitted: ‘To me there was always a feeling of letdown, because the Beatles had been so big that anything I did had to compare directly with them.’ The decade, Doyle writes, was book-ended with nine days in a Japanese jail for trying to smuggle marijuana into the country. And Lennon was assassinated on December 8 that year. McCartney began recording again, but this time his life was on a distinctly upward spiral.

"A property in Sydney's inner-west with rotting floors, crumbling ceilings, and packed full of garbage sold for $923,000 over the weekend. The uninhabitable dump on Durham Street, Stanmore, went under the hammer on Saturday, and had bids from 20 serious buyers. The bidding started at $600,000 but quickly climbed, before selling for $923,000, which was 15 to 20 percent higher than the expected price, according to selling agent Ron Alexander. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore sold for $923,000, despite the fact that it is uninhabitable in its present state . From the outside it doesn't look too bad, though the state of the house indoors is a different matter entirely . The property needs a lot of work before it will be fit for human habitation . The realtor estimates that with renovations, including a new kitchen, new floors and new ceilings, the property could sell for $1.2 million . The house is still littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors have already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property . The two-bedroom art deco home was described by Mr Alexander as a 'basic dumpster'. It is littered with broken-down appliances, old clothing, and furniture, and this is after Mr Alexander removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property. 'It's very run-down, very basic… But it's got a hell of a lot of potential,' he told MailOnline last week. But Mr Alexander said the dilapidated condition of the property 'put people on' rather than putting them off the purchase. 'They like the basics, just the demand is a lot stronger for the basic dumpster, rather than the reno-ed you-beaut [house],' he told MailOnline. He said that buyers want to be able to 'do it your own way rather than undo someone else’s taste.' Evidence of this, he said, was the fact that 32 Durham St, Stanmore, a fully-renovated three-bedroom home in great condition, sold for $980,000 on Friday, less than $60,000 more than the 'dumpster' down the road. The house is a deceased estate that has not been on the market since it was first built in the 1930s . The property is extremely neglected and it would be a huge job to renovate . The house is in a very derelict state, but is in an excellent location . The house was sold to a builder, though there was some interest in the property from 'brave hearts' - young couples who are keen for a renovation challenge . The house is in one of the best locations in the Sydney suburb of Stanmore . Before auction, the property had already attracted offers in the late $700,000s due largely to the location of the property. 'The location is outstanding, it's in one of the best parts of Stanmore,' said Mr Alexander. 'The home has very strong bones.' The house was purchased by a builder, and ninety percent of interest in the sale came from builders and professional renovators, along with the odd 'brave hearts' – young couples who want to take on a serious fixer-upper. The Durham Street home sold for 15 percent higher than the expected price . This list still taped to the wall gives an insight into how the home was once looked after . The backyard is in an extremely unkempt state, and nine truckloads of rubbish have already been removed from the property . Mr Alexander estimated that if someone 'fixed up all the warts' of the house – putting in a new kitchen, new ceilings and polished floors – they could sell it for $1.2 million.

"A Connecticut teen who has been kept away from her parents for more than a year, recorded a desperate plea on Sunday asking Massachusetts Gov Deval Patrick and a judge to let her go home. Lou and Lin Pelletier lost custody of their 16-year-old daughter Justina when doctors at Boston Children's Hospital diagnosed her with a psycholgoical disorder. The Pelletiers had been helping her get treatment for a different rare genetic disease at Tufts University before the conflicting diagnosis cast doubts on their parenting decisions. She was finally released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, where she was only allowed to visit with her parents for an hour weekly. However, Justina wasn't allowed to go home and has since been living at a residential treatment facility in Connecitcut. Scroll down for video . Justina Pelletier recorded a video on Sunday, begging authorities to let her go home to her parents. She is currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families . On Sunday, she posted a passionate plea to Gov Deval Patrick and Judge Josephy Johnston to just let her go home where she can be with her friends and family. 'All I really want to be with is my family and friends,' Justina said. 'Right now - you can do it. You are the one that's judging this. Please let me go home Judge Johnson and Gov. Patrick please right now, please let me go home right now. I need to be home with my family. I know you can do it. Please right now, I need to be home right now.' Mr Pelletier says he didn't force his daughter to record the video, and that it was an idea she had and created with one of her sisters. Justina may get her wish, too. On Friday, the state filed a motion to close her case. However, Mr Pelletier isn't getting his hopes up too fast. 'We have come to learn actions speak louder than words,” he told My Fox Boston. The Pelletier's trying ordeal began 16 months ago when they submitted their daughter for evaluation at Tufts University hospital. Lou and Lin Pelletier lost custody of their 16-year-old daughter when she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder last year. Before that diagnosis, they had been paying for her to get treatment for a rare genetic disease . Justina’s . case has gained attention after a diagnostic dispute between her . doctors at Tufts Medical Center and at Boston Children’s Hospital over . whether her deteriorating condition was primarily a physical or a . psychiatric problem. She . was being treated at Tufts for more than a year for mitochondrial . disease, a group of genetic disorders that affect how cells produce . energy, often causing problems with the gut, brain, muscles, and heart. However, doctors at Children’s hospital took a different view and . concluded that her physical symptoms were primarily caused by psychological disorders. After the . conflicting diagnosis, doctors allegedly gave Justina's parents the bewildering and . heart-breaking news that they wouldn't be able to take their daughter . home. Justina was released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, but has not been allowed to go home yet . Justina’s parents . refused to accept that her condition was psychological in nature and tried to discharge her and bringing her back to Tufts. Speaking . of the moment their daughter was taken away from her, the teenager's . mother said: ''They came in, and they said we cannot take Justina out of . the hospital. 'They called DCF (Department for Children and Families). 'They said Justina had 'somatoform disorder,' a form of mental illness that is characterized by physical symptoms.' Linda . and her husband Lou Pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by . security, and within the short space of four days they had lost custody . of their beloved daughter. 'It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of,' said the teenager's father. 'They . told me that Mitochondrial Disease did not exist,' says Lou, a . financial planner. 'Instead, they said she had Somatoform Disorder, . which is effectively a stress-related mental problem. 'They . said she had been misdiagnosed, overmedicated and forced to undergo . unnecessary procedures. It was as though they were accusing us of . needlessly harming our daughter.' Mr Pelletier says the idea for the video was completely his daughters. She recorded with one of her sisters . Experts . claim one in every 2,000 children in the U.S. suffer from Mitochondrial . Disease, which saps energy, causes intestine and organ problems and gets . progressively worse with age. The . disease is hard to diagnose and, according to the Mito Action support . group, parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused . of somatization disorders or fabricating pain. Meanwhile, . Somatoform Disorder is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers . feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Between 0.2 and 2 . per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the U.S. have been . diagnosed as sufferers. Justina’s family insists she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children’s Hospital.","Justina Pelletier, 16, is currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families .

"A chef has cooked up a dish so spicy he has to wear a gas mask and protective industrial gloves to stop the powerful vapours knocking him out. Muhammad Karim, 34, wanted to create the world’s hottest curry but feared the steam and smell of it would make him pass out as he served it up to customers. So he puts on the mask, goggles and 3mm thick gloves whenever he cooks his 'Atomic Kick Ass Drumstick' which registers 12million on the Scoville heat measurement scale - almost three times as a powerful as police pepper spray.

Hot: Muhammad Karim has to wear a gas mask and goggles when he serves his Atomic Kick Ass Drumsticks which register 12million of the Scoville heat measurement scale - almost three times as powerful as police pepper spray . The director and executive chef of Bindi restaurant in Grantham, Lincolnshire, has also told diners to sign a disclaimer which warns the consequences of eating the dish could be facial paralysis and body shakes and even internal bleeding. The customers must wear two pairs of gloves when eating the meal which has the spiciest chillies in the world including the Moruaga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper. Mr Karim said: 'We have made sure that our staff are trained in first aid so we can look after the customers before the paramedics arrive. 'When they eat it, their body has a massive adrenalin rush and if they have heart or any medical concerns we won’t let them try the sauce. Safety is paramount.' The Atomic Kick Ass chicken drumsticks are soaked in mango and tamarind BBQ style glaze mixed with 15 of each of the four chillies before adding a 5ml of special chilli extract registering 13 million Scoville .

It is at least three times hotter than the pepper spray the police use. The Indian army used pepper spray to keep the public in order and that was only 3 million Scoville - it could deal with a lot of demons out there. 'If I didn’t wear an oxygen masks when cooking I would be out of action for the rest of the day.' The components of the sauce are quarantined in a medical cupboard with hazard signs warning all staff about the dangerous ingredients inside. But Mr Karim said he is safety conscious adding: 'Everything is kept in metal containers in a medical cupboard. It is paramount that all the ingredients to this sauce are kept separate from everything else. 'If somebody used these ingredients for the wrong curry it would be disastrous and we would be in a lot of trouble.

He said: 'The insurers are fine with us having this dish on the menu. We are covered for £10million in public liability so as long as customers have no health risks and sign a disclaimer, all is fine. We do take safety very seriously though. 'I want to use my Bangladeshi upbringing to educate England that a Vindaloo is not hot, it is what we eat for breakfast at home.

"Australian tennis player Marinko 'Mad Dog' Matosevic has slammed women's tennis and said he would never copy Andy Murray, who recently hired a female coach. His comment that he would never follow in the footsteps of Wimbledon champion Murray, who has appointed French former world No.1 tennis player Amelie Mauresmo as his coach, has overshadowed one of the biggest wins of his career. Matosevic, who is world No.60, beat ninth-seed Croatian Marin Cilic in an opening-round 6-4 6-4 upset win at the Queen's Club Aegon Championship in London on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Australian tennis player Marinko 'Mad Dog' Matosevic has said he would never copy Andy Murray's decision to hire a woman as his coach . Marinko Matosevic of Australia plays a forehand against Marin Cilic of Croatia during their Men's Singles match on day two of the Aegon Championships in London . 'For me, I couldn't do it since I don't think that highly of the women's game,' Matosevic, 28, said of Murray's decision. 'His mum coached him and she did a great job with him, so we'll see what happens. 'It's all equal rights these days. Got to be politically correct. So, yeah, someone's got to give it a go. Won't be me.' Bosnia-born Matosevic acknowledged there are 'a few guys' in the top 100 who are coached by women. 'I think [Mikhail] Kukushkin is coached by his wife, Denis [Istomin] by his mum, she's done a great job with him,' he said. Matosevic has been knocked out in the first round in all but one of his 12 grand slam singles appearances. His best result was at the French Open this year where he reached the second round. Murray (left) recently appointed French former world No.1 tennis player Amelie Mauresmo (right) as his coach . MailOnline contacted Australian tennis player Sam Stosur, who will play Christina McHale at the Aegon Classic in Birmingham on Wednesday, but she declined to comment. Australian Womensport and Recreation Association secretary Janice Crosswhite said the comments were sexist but they had a more damaging effect on Matosevic than on female tennis players. 'I think it reacts against that individual more than it affects the women's game,' Ms Crosswhite said. 'You know, they're out of step with their time, and it does show a degree of sexism still, that what men do is always going to be better what women do.' In grand slams men play best of five sets while women play best of three. 'I think that's why maybe some of the men look at the women's circuit as being second rate,' Ms Crosswhite said. Matosevic, who is world No.60, beat ninth-seed Croatian Marin Cilic in an opening-round 6-4 6-4 upset win . 'Because they're playing best of three.' Matosevic said his coach, Australian former tennis player Mark Woodforde, had challenged him to be more aggressive on the court an play the 'old school Aussie way'. 'All the older Aussies came forward, you know, and the match was on their racquet, you know, very attacking players because they grew up on grass,' he said. 'It's kind of got lost in the last decade since [Pat] Rafter retired, and [Lleyton] Hewitt was playing a so it got lost, I guess.' World No.5 Murray will work with two-time grand slam winner Mauresmo for the four-week grass season. Some players, included Roger Federer, have publicly supported the move but the Brit said he didn't care if there was criticism.","Australian tennis player Marinko Matosevic has slammed women's tennis .

"This dramatic CCTV footage shows the moment thieves used angle grinders and pickaxes to steal more than £3,000 from train station ticket machines. Police are hunting a gang of men who they believe are responsible for targeting the machines at six railway stations across north London and Hertfordshire since April. In footage of the raids - which caused more than £100,000 worth of damage - the thieves can be seen taking an angle grinder to the self-service ticket machines before forcing the cash compartment open with pickaxes. Scroll down for video . The suspects used angle grinders and pickaxes to force open the self-service ticket machines at six railway stations across north London and Hertfordshire. They stole more than £3,000 in the raids in April and May . Hadley Wood station in Enfield, north London, was targeted on April 22 (pictured) and the thieves stole £650 in cash and caused more than £23,000 worth of damage after breaking into the self-service ticket machine . The most recently reported attack occurred on May 23, when the thieves stole £850 from the ticket machine at Welham Green station in Hertfordshire and caused £7,000 worth of damage . The hooded suspects, who targeted all of the machines in the early hours, then appear to make off with the cash, which amounted to a total of £3,238. British Transport Police officers have now released CCTV footage and images of three men who are currently their main suspects. Detective Constable Nick Thompson, leading the investigation, said: ‘I am now confident this spate of thefts is the responsibility of the same gang of three men. ‘They target smaller stations in the early hours when there are no staff on duty and the last train has gone. ‘They arrive as a group, head straight to the automatic ticket vending machines and set about a sustained attack using heavy-duty cutting equipment and pickaxes.’ In the first reported incident, which took place just after midnight on April 19 at Brookmans Park station in Hertfordshire, the suspects tampered with the security cameras before breaking open the front of the ticket machine and stealing £750 in cash. Their actions caused more than £23,000 worth of damage. The suspects targeted the six railway stations in the early hours when there were no staff on duty and the last train had gone . The suspects took an angle grinder to the self-service ticket vending machine before forcing the cash compartment open with a pickaxe . The six raids caused more than £100,000 worth of damage to the machines in north London and Hertfordshire . After forcing their way into the machine, the suspects then made off with the cash compartment . The ticket machines were left completely unusable after the raids causing disruption to hundreds of rail users . This was followed by an attack two days later on April 21 at nearby Bayford railway station. Despite again causing more than £23,000 worth of damage to the machine, the gang left empty-handed as they targeted a machine which only accepted card payments. Three weeks later two stations were targeted on the same night, with ticket machines at Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, and Oakleigh Park, north London, being attacked in the early hours of May 18. The suspects got away with more than £900 in cash from the two machines and caused an estimated £30,000 worth of damage. Hadley Wood station in Enfield, north London, was targeted the following morning and the thieves stole £650 in cash and caused more than £23,000 worth of damage.

I am doing everything I can to catch the individuals responsible' DC Thompson said: ‘The money stolen in these attacks really does pale into insignificance when you consider the cost of the damage – which is estimated as thirty-three times the value of the cash taken. ‘These thefts haven’t just hit the rail industry financially, they’ve also caused disruption and inconvenience to passengers, with ticket machines taken out of service for repairs. ‘I am doing everything I can to catch the individuals responsible as I believe it’s only a matter of time before they strike again. ‘If anyone recognises the men pictured, or thinks they may have witnessed the incidents taking place, please get in touch.’ Tony Holland, First Capital Connect crime prevention manager, said: ‘Last year we invested £700,000 to upgrade our CCTV systems and ensure we had coverage at every single station. ‘We're pleased that has paid off in providing an image of these criminals whose actions have caused so much damage.’ Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40, or text 61016, quoting reference ESUB/B9 of 04/06/2014.

"Victim: Jamie McMahon was battered to death in a churchyard by thieves who stole from him to buy tobacco and crisps, a court heard . Thieves battered a man to death and stamped on his face so hard they left the imprint of a trainer on it just to steal £30 to buy tobacco and crisps, a court heard today. Jamie McMahon was left for dead  lying face down in a churchyard after he was allegedly attacked at random by Michael Francis, 33, and Mark Lewis, 19. The 26-year-old had been on his way home from playing snooker with friends when he stopped to eat a doner kebab in St Giles’ Churchyard, Northampton, only to be violently attacked. A jury at Northampton Crown Court heard how Mr McMahon was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' when he was approached by Francis and Lewis who were 'on a mission to steal and rob' in the early hours of October 2 last year. The snooker-hall worker was left with . horrific head and facial injuries after being stamped on so hard they . left behind the imprint of a trainer, jurors were told. His body was found lying face down on the ground by a cyclist who was passing through the graveyard at around 8am. The jury was told how Francis and Lewis, who deny murdering Mr McMahon, stole £20 from his pocket and his iPhone, which they went on to sell for just £10. Yvonne Coen, prosecuting, said they went to the church looking for 'easy pickings' as there were no CCTV cameras and people were often 'worse for wear'. 'The two defendants walked more than two miles into town with the intention of robbing someone,' she said. 'They set upon Mr McMahon and kicked him while he was on the floor. 'Jamie was left for dead, face down in the churchyard. 'The spoils they stole from him were £30. This was £20 in cash and the £10 they received for selling his iPhone. 'Jamie McMahon was killed for that.' The court heard that CCTV cameras tracked the pair on their walk home and they stopped at a BP garage. Scene: Mr McMahon on his way home from playing snooker with friends when he stopped to eat a doner kebab in St Giles' Churchyard, Northampton, only to be violently attacked, jurors were told . There they used £12.39 of the stolen cash to buy tobacco, soft drink, jam sandwiches, crisps, milk and sugar. Mr McMahon suffered a number of injuries to his face as a result of the attack including cuts, deep bruising and a fractured eye socket. A pathologist concluded that the head injuries would have left him unconscious and he would have died within an hour of the attack. Giving evidence, Gary Knight, a friend and work colleague said Mr McMahon took part in a snooker match in the evening before his death and seemed his normal 'bubbly, bouncy' self. Mr Knight said his friend Mr McMahon left Cooper’s Snooker Club when it closed shortly after midnight and they then parted when he walked towards the town centre. 'Jamie was one in a million and I feel lucky to have met him,' he said. 'He was the sort of guy that made everyone happy and he was great at one-liners. 'He was an awesome person to know. 'If there was any trouble he was the sort of person to try to calm things down. He never went looking for trouble.' Francis and Lewis, both from Northampton, deny murder. Lewis has already pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery. Francis also denies one charge of robbery. The trial, which is expected to last nine days, continues.

"German rescue workers have managed to reach an injured man trapped 1,000metres underground in 'one of Europe's most difficult caves', but it could still be several days before he is freed. The 52-year-old German researcher was hit by rocks on Sunday morning as he made his way through the Riesending cave system near Berchtesgaden, on the German Austrian border. More than 80 mountain rescuers have been working to free him, and although they have now reached the man, who has not been named, the operation to bring him out could still take several days. German rescue workers (one pictured entering the cave) managed to reach the injured man on Monday . Tricky operation: Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots . Six experts from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are now with the man, who they say is conscious and able to walk with help. The accident happened more than three . miles from the cave entrance, and access to the site -  about half a . mile underground -  requires covering tricky terrain such as vertical . shafts and bottlenecks. The rescue service has set up a radio communication system that allows rescuers to send text messages to the surface. Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl . said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in . Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots. More than 80 mountain rescuers from numerous countries have been working to free him . Six experts from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are now with the explorer - who they say is conscious and able to walk with help . 'We have shafts that go straight down . 350 metres (1,150 feet), where you have to rappel down and climb back up . on a rope,' he told Germany's n-tv television. A four-member rescue team reached the . 52-year-old German cave researcher yesterday. He had suffered head and . upper body injuries a day earlier in a rockfall deep inside the caves. One of his two companions made a 12-hour solo climb back to the cave entrance to call for help, while the other stayed with him. Mr Reindl said the cave system has tight spots where only a slim person can squeeze through, and explorers also have to contend with water. Another mountain rescue official, Stefan Schneider, told a televised news conference that a doctor was in the cave, but it wasn't clear when he could get to the patient. 'It's going round the clock, and it's going to last a few more days,' Mr Schneider said. Rescuers working in several small teams of up to four people each have laid a telephone line several hundred metres along the route to help with their efforts. Others have set up camps inside the cave system, which lies on the border with Austria. Fifty-two cave rescue specialists from Bavaria, 28 from Austria and some from Switzerland were at the scene.","German cave researcher, 52, was hit by rocks on Sunday morning .

"A Gold Coast mother so desperate for attention she poisoned her healthy daughter with cancer drugs will spend at least two years behind bars. But knowing the suffering she caused and having to explain that to her daughter when she grows up is a greater punishment, a court has heard. She's also unlikely to ever regain custody of her daughter and son. Scroll down for video . The maternal grandmother, outside court on Wednesday, now cares for the young girl, who had been poisoned with chemotherapy drugs . A Queensland mother poisoned her healthy daughter, pictured, for attention . The woman bought chemotherapy drugs online and fed them to her daughter over a period of nine months . The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was sentenced on Wednesday for causing grievous bodily harm to her then four-year-old girl. She was sentenced to a maximum of six years, has already spent 426 days in custody, and will be eligible for parole on April 10 next year. The court heard she was so desperate for attention that before poisoning her daughter, she faked symptoms to have her own appendix removed. The 23-year-old mother of two bought the chemotherapy drugs over the internet and fed them to her daughter over nine months. She also wrote about the girl's ‘fight for life’ on Facebook, attracting more than 8,000 supporters and even $500 in donations. The drugs last year caused her daughter, now aged five, to suffer life-threatening illness, including bone marrow failure. The woman posted about her daughter's 'illness' on Facebook and received a small amount of donations for medical treatment . The drugs caused life-threatening illness to the girl, who suffered bone marrow failure last year . The mother had been suffering a rare mental disorder known as factitious disorder by proxy, her lawyer said . Outside Brisbane District Court, the girl's maternal grandmother said it was tough seeing her so sick. ‘It was really hard, it was heartbreaking,’ she told reporters. ‘But I'm not going to focus on that. She's healthy now.’ Despite the ordeal, the grandmother, who is now caring for the little girl, said the family was sticking by her daughter who won't be eligible for parole until 2015. ‘She's my daughter… she's going to get the help she needs,’ she said. Defence barrister Catherine Morgan said the mother had suffered from an extremely rare mental disorder known as factitious disorder by proxy, where a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates symptoms of someone in their care. She said her client had also faked symptoms to have her own healthy appendix removed. The young girl is now healthy since recovering and reportedly misses her mother . The woman, who also faked symptoms to have her own appendix removed, is currently being sentenced . Prosecutor Glen Cash argued the woman was suffering a personality disorder, not a mental disorder, as she was not delusional, psychotic or out of touch with reality. Mr Cash said the mother fed the drugs to her daughter to attract attention to herself, but conceded that her capacity to see it was wrong was impaired somewhat.

"Not many people will have the chance to come eye-to-eye with a whale, but a photographic exhibition with stunning gigantic images of the majestic creatures is changing that. American artist Bryant Austin is the only photographer in the world producing life-size photos of whales, but in order to capture the breathtaking images, he spends months in waters around the Great Barrier Reef, Tonga and Dominica. His unique process sees him immersed in the water without moving as he waits for different species of whale including sperm, minke and humpbacks to swim by so he can take the photos. American photographer Bryant Austin has captured whales from less than two metres away and his work is currently featured in an exhibition at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney . The photographer captured the stunning photos of the animals in waters around the Great Barrier Reef, Tonga and Dominica . With the mammals getting as close as two metres away from him, the magnificent result sees Mr Austin capture the whales at their most serene as they gracefully carve through the ocean unperturbed by his presence. The detailed portraits show the underwater giants beautifully submerged as the sun shines through the water and creating rippled shadows. Entitled Beautiful Whale, the exhibition illustrates Mr Austin's 20-year journey exploring waters and taking photos of some of the ocean's largest mammals in all their grace. On his website Studiocosmos.com it is stated that Mr Austin's life-long passion has been connecting humanity with the 'greatest minds in the water'. As part of the photographic process, Mr Austin gets within two metres of the whales and this enables him to get all of the animal's intricate details, colours and tones . Mr Austin was inspired to capture the whales in full when he was tapped by a passing 45 ton female humpback whale's two ton, 4.5-metre pectoral fin in 2004 . The inspiration for his work was propelled while he was floating motionless when he was tapped by a passing 45 ton female humpback whale's two ton, 4.5-metre pectoral fin in 2004. At this point Mr Austin was prompted to start capturing the animals in their full scale. The most crucial aspect of his work is the need to be less then two metres from the whales when he takes the photos in order to capture their true colours, subtle tones and intricate details. Because of the proximity required, Mr Austin waits for the mammals to come near him, which can see him spend up to three months with small groups of whales. The exhibition, which is the largest collection of Mr Bryant's work to date, is being shown exclusively at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney until February 1, 2015. The photos life-size images provide a unique glimpse into the gigantic creatures' world, as they move through the water unperturbed by the artist's presence . The Beautiful Whale exhibition features images of humpback, minke and sperm whales is also Mr Bryant's largest collection of work to date .","American photographer Bryant Austin has taken life-size photos of whales from less than two metres away .

"Former Australian Workers Union official Bruce Wilson is currently before the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption in Sydney . A builder has told the royal commission into union corruption that Julia Gillard's ex-boyfriend, allegedly corrupt union official Bruce Wilson, paid for the renovations of her home in 1993. Athol James, 84, said that he was paid by Julia Gillard for the renovations, who in turn was funded by cash payments from Mr Wilson, suggesting for the first time that there was a direct link between the former prime minister and the union funds. Athol James told the commission that he began work on Ms Gillard's home in Abbotsford, Melbourne, in 1993 and through this met 'her male companion' whom he later came to know as Bruce Wilson. 'During the work I would deal with Ms Gillard in relation to any payment for the completed work,' Mr James said. 'I would give her the invoice. I am pretty certain she said she would get money from Bruce and pay me in the next few days. I'm certain she said Bruce was paying for it.' Mr James replaced some doors and windows in the home between March and June 1993 at a cost of $6,040 according to invoices tendered in the commission. In August a further invoice of $2,986 was submitted by Mr James' company for fencing and flooring at the home. Mr James, 84, is also certain he 'saw Bruce hand Ms Gillard a large amount of cash on two occasions'. 'Ms Gillard said to me that as Bruce brought her the cash, she would pay me by cheque. 'When Bruce handed Ms Gillard the cash, she would write me a cheque. 'I was never paid in cash and I don't know what happened with the cash Bruce handed her.' One of Mr Wilson's former employees, Wayne Hem, a researcher and librarian for the Australian Workers' Union, also told the commission today that Mr Wilson gave him $5,000 to deposit in Ms Gillard's account. He testified today that after a night out in 1995, a 'scruffy' looking Mr Wilson called him into his office at the Victorian branch office of the Australian Workers' Union. 'He took a wad of notes out of his pocket and he wrote on a piece of paper a bank account number,' Mr Hem said in his witness statement. 'He handed me the cash and the piece of paper and asked me to deposit the cash. 'I looked at the paper, asked him to tell whose account it was, and handed him the piece of paper back so that he could write the details on the paper for me. 'He then wrote Julia Gillard on the piece of paper and handed it back to me.' Bruce Wilson is the ex-boyfriend of Julia Gillard and allegedly made payments to her in the mid-90s . Mr Hem counted the money and deposited it at the Commonwealth Bank in Carlton before returning to the office, he told the commission. Mr Wilson also gave an envelope, which Mr Hem assumed contained cash, to a painter at an Abbotsford house in Melbourne that was being renovated, Mr Hem testified today. 'About four weeks later I was talking to Bruce [Wilson] and he mentioned where Julia [Gillard] lived,' Mr Hem said. Mr Hem said he realised at this point that the Abbotsford home where Mr Wilson dropped into to pay tradesmen 'was in fact Julia's'. Mr Hem began working as a librarian and researcher at the AWU in 1994. The inquiry is examining allegations figures in the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) West Australian branch set up a secret 'slush fund' in the early 1990s and used some of the cash to help officials win elections.

"This is the moment a man led his two horses across a railway line seconds before a speeding train passed. The man and his white and brown horses narrowly missed being hit by the train which was hurtling towards them as they crossed the train tracks at Shotton low-level railway station in Flintshire, Wales. A local councillor contacted police after spotting the near-miss, suggesting the consequences of his actions could have been ‘catastrophic’. The man and his white and brown horses narrowly missed being hit by the train which was hurtling towards them as they crossed the train tracks at Shotton low-level railway station in Flintshire, Wales . The man managed to safely cross the low-lying tracks with his horses but just seconds after reaching the safety of the verge, a train passed at a speed of up to 75mph. Councillor Elwyn Jones said: ‘I couldn’t believe someone would take such a risk. ‘The horses were stalling as they were crossing and I thought it could have led to the derailing of a train. ‘Within a minute of them getting off the track, a speeding train came through. The consequences could have been catastrophic. I can’t believe somebody would be so stupid to take risks like this.’ British Transport Police officers have now warned of the dangers of crossing railway lines and urged members of the public to take care at level crossings. In a statement, a spokesman said: ‘I cannot emphasise enough the dangers associated with this type of behaviour. ‘Anyone who trespasses on to the railway is taking a gamble with their own lives, as well as the lives of the staff and passengers travelling on the trains. ‘People may think they know the lines well and know the passenger timetables, but they don’t know the freight timetables, with services running 24 hours a day. A local councillor contacted police after spotting the near-miss at Shotton railway station (pictured), suggesting the consequences of the man's actions could have been 'catastrophic' ‘Modern trains are also deceptively quiet and travel at extremely high speeds and, clearly, cannot swerve to avoid people in their path. You can’t outrun a train. It’s on you before you know it. ‘Luckily on this occasion, no one was injured - but the scenario could easily have been different.’ Others have also been caught on camera crossing railway lines or level crossings when trains are approaching at high speed. In 2009, an impatient mother ignored a red warning light at a level crossing at Wareham station in Dorset and began to cross the tracks with her baby in a pram. While other pedestrians waited patiently for the train to pass, she carelessly decided to cross the tracks despite the fact a train was accelerating towards her. She was forced to break into a run to reach the other side safely, leaving observers stunned and horrified. In 2009, an impatient mother ignored a red warning light at a level crossing at Wareham station in Dorset and crossed the tracks, in front of a speeding train, with her baby in a pram . In another incident, a cyclist came within inches of her life while trying to dash across a level crossing at Waterbeach in Cambridgeshire. The unnamed woman ducked under the level crossing barrier and ignored warning signs as she attempted to cross the tracks in September last year. However, she appeared to realise at the last minute that she wouldn't safely  make the crossing and pulled her bike back suddenly as the train hurtled past at a speed of up to 75mph. Network Rail has regularly warned of the dangers of this type of behaviour and has run several campaigns, including 'Would It Kill You To Wait?' in an attempt to deter reckless actions.","The man led his horses across the tracks at Shotton low-level railway station .

"A sailor has died after falling down a lift shaft and becoming trapped inside on board the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Bulwark. Police were alerted this morning to reports of a 'serious industrial accident' on board the warship, which is currently docked at operating base HMNB Devonport in Plymouth, Devon. Ambulance crews were also called to the naval base, where HMS Bulwark - an amphibious landing ship - has been moored for maintenance work. 'Industrial accident': A sailor has died after falling down a lift shaft and becoming trapped inside on board the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Bulwark . Paramedics treated a man for head injuries but he died from his wounds at the scene. The police, the Navy and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are all investigating the incident which is not being treated as suspicious. It is believed the man, who has not been identified, was carrying out maintenance work when he fell down a lift shaft and became trapped. 'We were called to HMS Dockyard Devonport at 10:54am following a reported industrial accident on board HMS Bulwark,' said a spokesman from Devon and Cornwall Police. 'A crew member reportedly sustained injuries having been stuck in a lift shaft. 'Unfortunately this man died as a result of this incident. 'Police are investigating the death together with the Health and Safety Executive. It is not being treated as suspicious.' A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said the initial 999 call was made at 9:53 am. Probe: Police were alerted this morning to reports of a 'serious industrial accident' on board the warship, which is currently docked at operating base HMNB Devonport (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon . He said: 'We were called to Devonport, Plymouth, to reports of a male with a head injury. 'Unfortunately he died at the scene and there was nothing we could do for him. There were no other casualties.' In the wake of the incident investigating police officers boarded HMS Bulwark, which is due to take part in training drills off the coast of Plymouth before heading to Scotland for a NATO exercise, Joint Warrior. HMS Bulwark, which entered service . in 2004, is one of the UK’s two newest amphibious transport docks . designed to put personnel ashore by air and by sea. The Albion-class ship’s primary role is to take as many as 405 Royal Marines ashore using its landing craft and dock. It also has an assault helicopter, which launches from a two-spot flight deck, and can carry as many as 31 large trucks and 36 smaller vehicles into battle. Role: Last week the ship was involved events marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, performing a gun salute and taking part on an amphibious demonstration at Southsea beach . Navy chiefs have mainly deployed the 19,560-tonne ship worldwide in counter-terrorism operations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Last week the ship was involved events marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, performing a gun salute and taking part on an amphibious demonstration at Southsea beach, before carrying UK veterans from Portsmouth to Normandy as part of a flotilla of international ships. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the incident and next of kin are being informed.' The HSE added: 'Two inspectors have gone over to the site. Police will take the lead on this investigation.' Devonport is one of three UK operating bases for the Royal Navy and the biggest naval base in Western Europe. The 650-acre facility is also the sole repair and refuelling facility for the UK’s nuclear submarines. It was the scene of another dangerous incident on March 14 when HMS Argyll accidentally fired a unarmed torpedo at the dock during a botched training drill. Dubbed 'the proud flagship of the Royal Navy and the nation', HMS Bulwark entered service in 2004 and is one of the newest amphibious transport docks in the fleet. The vessel was sent on it's maiden deployment to assist in counter-terrorist and counter-piracy missions, and became the Navy's flagship in 2011 . The assault ship HMS Bulwark, whose home port is HMNB  Devonport, has the primary role of delivering Royal Marines ashore as quickly as possible, using  landing craft and dock, or by assault helicopter from the two-spot flight deck to move as many as 405 troops. She can carry 256 troops with their vehicles and combat supplies, and this can be swollen up to 405 troops. Her vehicle deck can be crammed with up to 31 large trucks and 36 smaller vehicles, such as Land Rovers and Vikings, and she can support two Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. The ship and its landing craft can also be configured to transport armoured vehicles such as the Army's Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank.

"Thousands of South Korean police stormed a religious compound today as they searched for a fugitive businessman wanted in connection with April's ferry disaster. Donning riot gear, officers forced their way into the sprawling church and complex in Anseong, 50 miles south of Seoul, at around 8am (12am GMT). They were hunting billionaire Yoo Byung-eun, who is believed to own the vessel that sank, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing. Scroll down for video .

Manhunt: Officers were hunting billionaire Yoo Byung-eun (left), who is believed to own the vessel that sank, leaving more than 300 people dead or missing. Right, a poster offering a $500,000 reward for tips about Yoo . It comes a day after 15 crew members of the doomed Sewol ferry, which sank off the southwest coast of South Korea on April 16, went on trial in Gwangju. Captain Lee Joon-seok, 68, and three senior crew members have been charged with homicide - a charge that could carry the death penalty. Two others have been charged with fleeing and abandoning ship, with a maximum sentence of life in prison, while nine are accused of negligence, which can also carry jail terms. Yoo, who has been the focus of a large hunt by police and prosecutors for weeks, is also believed to have contributed to the ferry sinking on April 16 through his alleged corruption. Forming a line: Donning riot gear, officers forced their way into the sprawling church and complex in Anseong . Police: Yoo is a member of the Evangelical Baptist Church. Above, police at the group's compound this morning . Authorities are offering a $500,000 (£300,000) reward for tips about the . businessman, who is a member of the Evangelical Baptist Church, deemed a . 'cult' by critics. In their latest move, around 6,000 police officers, accompanied by prosecution investigators, raided the group's extensive compound this morning, according to an unnamed officer. Four church members were detained for allegedly providing shelter for the businessman or helping him flee, while another was held for reportedly trying to obstruct the raid. Police say they are still trying to find and detain more church members for allegedly aiding Yoo. It is not clear whether the businessman himself was at the compound at the time of the raid. Arrests: During today's raid, four church members were detained for allegedly providing shelter for the businessman or helping him flee. Meanwhile, another was held for reportedly trying to obstruct the raid . Around 200 church members rallied against the raid, with some holding up a large banner, reading: 'We'll protect Yoo Byung-eun even if 100,000 church members are all arrested.' Yoo, head of the now-defunct predecessor of the ferry's current operator, Chonghaejin, allegedly still controls the company through a complex web of holding companies. His children and close associates are reportedly large shareholders - and the government has offered a $100,000 (£60,000) bounty for Yoo's eldest son. The Sewol ferry sinking, one of South Korea's deadliest disasters in decades, happened during a routine journey from Incheon on the mainland to the . southern holiday island of Jeju.

"The world's highest-paid hedge fund manager has just split with his wife, and is designating their palatial Hamptons estate as the bachelor pad. It was announced this week that billionaire David Tepper, 56, had split with his wife Marlene, 55, after nearly 30 years of marriage and their newly-built Sagaponack beach home will no doubt factor in the divorce. Tepper bought the home in 2011, in part to get back at the ex-Goldman Sachs boss who refused to promote him before he left to start his own hedge fund - Appaloosa Management. Tepper bought the 6,165-square-foot  oceanfront property from Corzine's ex-wife Joanne and demolished it, so he could build and even bigger home with views of the ocean from every room in the house. When asked if he purchased the home out of revenge, Tepper told New York Magazine: 'You could say there was a little justice in the world.' New bachelor pad: Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper is currently living in his Hamptons house after splitting with wife Marlene . Tear down: Tepper bought the property in 2011 and tore it down to rebuild a new property with better views of the ocean . The Teppers have not yet formally filed for divorce, but have separated and are telling friends that the marriage 'has run its course', a source told PageSix. 'They hope to settle things quickly, quietly and amicably,' the source said. The head of $20 billion Appaloosa Management is worth an estimated $10 billion and made $3.5 billion in 2013 alone - meaning that divorce proceedings could reach eye-watering sums. Split: Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper and his wife Marlene are divorcing, according to sources . Forbes lists him as the 129th richest person in the world. The Teppers, who married in 1986, have three children in their 20s, Brian, Randi, and Casey. They share a mansion in Livingston, New Jersey and a $43.5 million oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. As well as running his company in Short Hills, New Jersey, Tepper, who grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tepper worked as a trader at Goldman Sachs for eight years but left to start up his own hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, in 1992 after repeatedly being passed over for partnership. In 2009, he made a trade that netted his company $7.5 billion and gave him a payout of nearly $4 billion. 'What do you think I should do with it?' he asked New York Magazine afterwards. 'I could buy an island. I could buy a private jet... I could get myself a 22-year-old!' Family: The Teppers have three children in their 20s, Brian, Randi, and Casey, who grew up in New Jersey . Close: Brian pictured with Randi. The family hired Ashlee Simpson to sing at one of the girls' bat mitzvahs . In 2012, he was ranked as the top-earning investor and was paid $4.4 billion. In 2013, he took home $3.5 billion. 'His track record has long been phenomenal,' Forbes reported in its rich list. 'But since the financial crisis his returns have reached a whole new level.' Tepper is a man who is happy to share his wealth. Last year, he gave $67 million to his alma mater Carnegie Mellon University, adding to the $55 million he gave in 2004, Forbes reported. Mansion: Tepper and his wife Marlene share this large home in Livingston, New Jersey . He has also made several large gifts to the University of Pittsburgh, where he completed his undergraduate education. His wife is a member of the board of overseers at Rutgers University, where the couple also donated $3.4 million to the Mason Gross School of the Arts. The Teppers were spotted together in May at a charity dinner for the Robin Hood Foundation. Tepper is also a major donor to that foundation. And after Hurricane Sandy, Tepper donated $200,000 in gift cards to New Jersey families who had suffered loss in the storm. His spokesman declined to comment.","David Tepper, 56, has been living at his Hamptons home after splitting from wife Marlene, 55 .

"Deputy mayor: Councillor David Thomas has blamed the Police Federation for Torbay Council's coin toss . Councillors in a seaside resort could not decide whether to allow takeaways in a children's park - so they tossed a coin. Members of Torbay Council voted to ban fast food businesses from Cary Park in Torquay, Devon, after the coin landed on heads instead of tails. They have blamed their controversial voting method on the Police Federation, which elected its new leader on a 50/50 spin just weeks ago. Steve White, a former firearms officer, took the helm of the national organisation after a split in the ranks over his appointment was settled by the flip of a coin. Now, Torbay Council's deputy mayor David Thomas, who chairs its place policy development group, has defended its decision to do the same. 'I opted to use a random method of decision, which was a toss of a coin,' he said. 'If . you look at election law in a local or general election if the vote is . an even split - say 5,000 and 5,000 - the decision has to be made by the . presiding officer. 'They have to decide any method they choose. 'They can toss a coin or use a short straw or put candidates’ names in a hat and the one pulled out is counted as an extra vote. That’s a valid and legal way of deciding an election. 'Only two months ago the Police Federation of Great Britain appointed its chairman by the toss of a coin. 'I . thought in my infinite wisdom as a lowly councillor in Torbay that if . this was good enough for the Police Federation and if it is good enough . to decide on an MP it was good enough for Torbay Council.' Children's park: Councillors voted to ban food takeaways from Cary Park (pictured) in Torquay, Devon, after the coin landed on heads. Their recommendation will now go to Torbay mayor, Gordon Oliver, for a final decision . Angry: Today, the council's method of voting was condemned by caterer Claire Hall (pictured), who operated her Atomic Cafe at the park last summer. She said: 'It just seems like a game to them. I think it is  unprofessional' Councillor Thomas said he had been unable to use his casting vote on what was a split decision because he had a personal interest in the issue, as the owner of his own mobile catering firm. The four other councillors had been divided over the issue - with Steve Darling and Beryl McPhail against takeaways in the park, and Ken Pritchard and Jackie . Stockman in favour of them. As a last resort, council officer Charles Uzzell had tossed the coin at a private meeting of around 20 councillors, 15 of whom did not have the authority to vote. New leader: Cllr Thomas blamed the coin toss on the Police Federation, which elected its new leader, Steve White (pictured), on a 50/50 spin in May . They all watched as it landed on heads - meaning that no takeaways would be allowed in the park. Their recommendation will now go to Torbay mayor, Gordon Oliver, who will make a final decision. Cllr Thomas said: 'This decision is basically a recommendation to the mayor. It is his decision what he does. He can either listen to what was said or do something totally different.' Today, the council's method of voting was condemned by caterer Claire Hall, who ran her Atomic Cafe at Cary Park last summer. 'It just seems like a game to them,' she said.  'I think it is very unprofessional and I feel completely disillusioned. 'This is no way to treat all the people who supported me last year who really want to see a facility there.' Cllr . Thomas said the decision to ban food takeaways from park was not aimed at individual businesses. But he . accepted that the vote - if rubber-stamped by the mayor - may ‘affect an . individual business this year’. Last . year, Ms Hall secured a 200-signature petition to reinstate her . airstream van at the park when her trading licence was revoked after her . first few days of trading. She said she was concerned about competition from Decoy Park in nearby Newton Abbot. 'Torbay will lose all its parents to Decoy Park with its facilities, toilets and play area,' she said. Council: Cllr Thomas said he had been unable to vote on what was a split decision because he had a personal interest in the issue. The four other councillors had been divided over the matter. Above, Torbay Council . 'The council should think about providing a kiosk there with at least one toilet. It is an ideal spot.' Councillor Darling, who voted against the proposal, said he did not think the coin toss had been a 'satisfactory way' of dealing with the matter. 'I understand where [Cllr Thomas] was coming from with a toss of a coin as . it is legal, but it makes the council look ludicrous,' he said. Councillor Stockman agreed, saying: 'I think the chairman, knowing he had an interest . and couldn’t make the decision if it was an even vote, should have . handed over the chairmanship to another member of the committee for that . item of the agenda only. 'Then . no-one would have been put in the position of deciding something on the . toss of a coin which is not a good way of making a decision on . anything, least of all that.' But Councillor Beryl McPhail said: 'It is not the most desirable way of dealing with . things, but in these circumstances it seemed to be an acceptable way of . resolving the situation.' The Police Federation came under fire last month after electing its new leader on the flip a coin. Former firearms officer Steve White was chosen to take the helm of the beleaguered organisation after a 50/50 split in the ranks over his appointment was settled on the toss. His controversial election came just days after the scandal-hit police union was warned that it ‘must change or die'. Scandal-hit: Former firearms officer Steve White was chosen to take the helm of the beleaguered Police Federation (pictured) after a 50/50 split in the ranks over his appointment was settled on the toss of a coin . Addressing the Federation’s . conference in Bournemouth last month, Theresa May accused officers of treating the public with 'contempt' over the way they treated victims of abuse and domestic violence. She also announced that she was scrapping all Police Federation . funding this August because the organisation sits on 'vast reserves' of cash worth . tens of millions of pounds. The Home Secretary's intervention came as a fourth police officer was . sacked over the Downing Street 'plebgate' row involving the former Tory . Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The Police Federation, which represents 126,000 rank-and-file policemen and women, has also been rocked by accusations of bullying and obsessive secrecy. Speaking after Mrs May's attack, Mr White pledged to implement change, saying: 'This has been an historic week.

"Andrew Hardy, 48, was caught with £31,000 worth of cannabis growing at his flat in Shrewsbury. When questioned by police, he said he dealt drugs to keep his hometown 'calm' A drug dealer has been jailed after telling a judge he sold cannabis because he wanted to keep the people in his hometown calm. Andrew Hardy, 48, had around £31,000 worth of cannabis growing in his flat in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. It was discovered by officers after a police raid on October 31 last year. He told officers he had grown 728.9g of the Class-B drug in his home because he was 'making Shrewsbury calm.' Prosecutor Kevin Jones said: 'He was frank with the police and said he was ""making Shrewsbury calm."" 'He said he was regularly dealing £1,300 of cannabis to various people. 'He said he was providing a service to the public and was dealing small quantities almost every day.' He was jailed for 20 months after he admitted drug dealing at Shrewsbury Crown Court yesterday. Jailing him, Judge Robin Onions said: 'The problem for you is that for years and years you’ve been addicted to cannabis. 'I hope in the future you can find a way of living your life that doesn’t involve breaking the law.' Judge Onions also made a forfeiture order for the drug growing equipment in Hardy’s flat and ordered the drugs to be destroyed. Officers from West Mercia Police searched Hardy’s home in Shrewsbury hours after arresting him earlier in the day. They discovered he was carrying a small amount of cannabis and £290 in cash. When . they searched his home they discovered a cannabis bush. The plant had a . street value of between £19,672.50 and £31,317.50, the court heard. Shrewsbury Crown Court, pictured, heard Hardy defended his dealing by saying he was providing a public service to the people of the town. He was jailed for 20 months - with a judge ordering the drugs to be destroyed . They also found drugs paraphernalia along with £3,804.07 in cash. Mike Sherwood-Smith, defending, said: 'He didn’t try to hide anything from the police. 'He had a fairly wide circle of friends, all cannabis users and they all relied on him for their supply. 'He . didn’t claim any benefits in that time and relied only on his cannabis . sales of about £125 to £150 a week and some gratis cannabis for what he . was doing.'","Andrew Hardy, 48, caught growing £31,000 worth of cannabis in his flat .

"In their bright traditional dress, they couldn't have looked more different to Prince Charles in his conservative grey suit. The African dance troupe - resplendent in vivid red and orange skirts, leopard print vests and with animal fur tied around their shins and arms - grinned as they met the Prince of Wales during a Buckingham Palace garden party yesterday. The 65-year-old heir to the throne thanked the dancers for their performance - at an event marking the work of the Red Cross over the past 150 years and, especially, its efforts 100 years ago during the First World War. Prince Charles meets an African dance group at a garden party in honour of the British Red Cross Society . The Prince of Wales is President of the British Red Cross, whose work he praised at the event yesterday . Earlier Charles had joked with a group of women dressed in vintage nurses' uniforms - all modern day volunteers with the humanitarian organisation - who had joined hundreds of guests at the garden party. Soaking up the glorious sunshine, Charles spoke to supporters, volunteers, and full-time staff in his capacity as president of the British Red Cross Society. One volunteer Paloma Rossetti, 23, originally from Aix en Provence in southern France has been working at the Red Cross head office in central London and praised the organisation. She said: 'I wanted to work in the charity sector. I studied political science and focused on international organisations and studied the humanitarian movement. 'For me the Red Cross is not just another organisation it's the one that shaped the humanitarian movement.' Garden party guests are usually served a selection of sweet treats but yesterday they were given an unusual delicacy in the form of a cake made from a First World War recipe. Charles and Princess Alexandra met nurses dressed in World War 1 uniforms at Buckingham Palace . Charles paid tribute to the 150-year-old organisation at a garden party attended by hundreds of people . Staff from the royal kitchens made a fruit cake from a recipe given to the Red Cross by a Mrs J Laing of Herefordshire in 1988. It was created by her great aunt Mary, who was a Voluntary Aid Detachment stationed at Badminton House, Gloucestershire for most of the Great War. She made the cake and gave slices, with a cup of tea, to soldiers on the troop trains. Guests were entertained by military bands and dancers and singers from the organisation Zulu-Tradition, from the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa. The British Red Cross has an integrated HIV and TB project based in Kwazulu-Natal, working with communities to fight the epidemic and provide support to those living with the viruses. The Duke of Cambridge took the salute at a spectacular tribute to Britain's armed forces yesterday. The annual Beating Retreat display of military pomp and ceremony took on a special resonance this year, marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day and the centennial of the start of the First World War. Servicemen and women marked the sacrifices of their forebears by impressing the 6,500-strong crowd with a display of horsemanship, pageantry and gunfire last night. Prince William wore the black frock coat of the Irish Guards as he took the salute at Horse Guards Parade . William became Royal Colonel of the regiment in 2011 before his wedding to the Duchess of Cambridge . Adorned in the black and gold trimmed uniform of the Irish Guards, of which he is a Royal Colonel, Prince William opened the ceremony by taking the salute. A procession of military musicians, each in the signature uniform of their battalion, performed a series of war-time anthems at the Horse Guards in Whitehall, central London. The crowd saved one of their biggest cheers of the night for D-Day veteran Gordon Newton, who was shown on the big screen in the front row wearing his red beret and his medal adorning his chest. He sang along as The Band of the Welsh Guards led a rendition of the First World War ballad 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'. Asked what he thought of the display, he said simply: 'Wonderful.' Paying tribute to Britain's armed forces, Prince William said: 'As Colonel of the Irish Guards I am delighted to support the Household Division Beating Retreat. 'Year after year this wonderful event showcases the skill and professionalism of our military musicians whilst reinforcing the traditions and heritage for which we as a nation are justifiably proud and envied the world over.'","Prince jokes with South African dancers at event marking work of Red Cross .

"This shocking photo shows the girlfriend of a drug dealer boastfully rolling around in a pile of £20 notes - just before she was caught by police for her part in the lucrative business. Victoria Murphy, from Manchester, posed for a photo with thousands of pounds worth of illegal drugs money which her boyfriend had made through his cocaine-dealing trade. Minesh Patel, 30, and his brother Rakesh, 34, ran the 'professional' enterprise from a corner shop in New Moston, Manchester, where they hid £120,000 worth of drugs under the counter. Victoria Murphy, 30, who used the proceeds of her boyfriend's drug . business to pay her rent, posed for a photo as she rolled around in . thousands of pounds worth of £20 and £10 notes . They also stashed cutting agents - which are used to dilute illicit drugs - in a Haribo sweet box. The brothers even offered their customers a drug mail order service - described by the judge as the 'hallmark of professionalism' - which involved sending bundles of cocaine through the post after customers paid via bank transfer. Murphy used some of the cash to pay her rent and was convicted for concealing criminal proceeds after the shop which fronted the high-purity drug business was raided in October last year by police. Meanwhile, the brothers were jailed for a collective 11 years for masterminding the illegal set-up. Manchester Crown Court was told how police found cocaine stashed behind . the counter, while a Haribo sweets drum found in the cellar was stuffed . with the anaesthetic Lidocaine, which is used to mix the drugs. Another 1kg of cocaine was found buried under a child's bunkbed when Minesh's home in Blackley was raided. Rakesh Patel, 34, and his brother Minesh Patel, 30, pictured right, who is the partner of Miss Murphy, ran the lucrative drugs business from a corner shop in New Mosten, Manchester . During the hearing, Rakesh, from Ashton, admitted . possessing cannabis and being concerned in the supply of cocaine. He was jailed for five years. Minesh admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for six years. Caroline Smith, defending Minesh, said: 'Having worked hard over the years to build up the family business he found himself struggling financially. The pair kept cocaine under the counter at the shop and cutting agents - a chemical . used to dilute illicit drugs - in a Haribo sweet box at the newsagents . 'He needed to alleviate the debts . arising out of his drug misuse. He was buying cocaine so frequently it . led him into contact with dealers - he saw what he thought was an easy . way to make a profit.' Police found two years of texts linked to drug dealing on Rakesh's phone. Nikki Gatto, defending Rakesh, said he originally turned a blind eye to his brother's dealing and then got 'sucked in' himself. She said: 'It's quite clear Rakesh's involvement at each level was much reduced.' Judge Richard Mansell said: 'A hallmark of the professionalism of this enterprise is that you would supply drugs by post - an increasingly popular method. You were using the shop as a cover.'","Victoria Murphy used money from her boyfriend's drug trade to pay her rent .

"Repeat offender: Robert Stone was on parole for a previous meth bust when cops uncovered the meth lab in his retirement village home . A routine traffic stop led police to uncover a meth lab in a Fresno retirement community. Robert Stone, 64, was found Saturday evening to have about half a pound of methamphetamine between his car and home. Cops searched the senior citizen’s car after a background check revealed he was remarkably on parole for a previous meth bust. ‘It's shocking, I would never guess that anything like that would go on at a senior citizen village,’ neighbor Robin Schramek told KFSN. Police made the surprising discovery only because state law allows them to search the car of a suspect under supervised release. ‘When the officers searched the car they located four ounces of methamphetamine in the car, which is a lot of methamphetamine, so that's consistent with somebody who's selling,’ Fresno police Lt. Joe Gomez told the station. Officers also found plastic bags and an electronic scale in the vehicle, authorities told the Fresno Bee. A subsequent search of his apartment led to police finding more crystal meth, heroin, and the ingredients needed to cook more of the drugs, sources said. Meth lab: Stone lived at the end unit in this Fresno retirement community . The evidence: Fresno Police showed off the results of the modest bust, which they say had a street value of about $1,700 . Reclusive: Stone was seen as a hermit among the normally social retirement community . The total street value of the bust was about $1,700, police said. Images of the home show the blinds drawn . and several signs warning people to go away and give Stone his privacy, . but it never occurred to anyone it was because a meth lab was inside. ‘Just shocking someone that age would do that, but actually a perfect place to do it, right? Retirement village, who would suspect it going on there?’ Gomez added. Stone mostly kept to himself and was not very well known by the normally social community, neighbors said. He only moved in about three or four months ago, according to Schramek. The ex-con was hauled back to jail and hit with multiple drug charges.","Robert Stone, 64, was on parole for a previous meth bust when police pulled him over .

Chicago man Andre Davis, who served 32 years in prison before being declared innocent in the 1980 rape and murder of a 3-year-old girl, is now facing a new murder charge . The 53-year-old Davis is jailed without bond. NBC Chicago reports that roughly 15 months after Davis' release, Harmon was attending a party hosted by Davis' nephew at about 3 a.m. Prosecutors say the 19-year-old Harmon got into a dispute with Davis' nephew over money lost in a dice game. Assistant State's Attorney . Robert Mack said the nephew shot and wounded Harmon, and Davis later cut . the man's throat and dumped his body in an alley. A witness later told police Harmon had made sounds after being shot, letting them know he was still alive. Andre Davis, right, pictured hugging his father Richard Davis inside the Tamms Correctional Center before his release in 2012, is accused of killing a man over a dice game . The unnamed witness and Davis then carried Harmon's body to the trunk of a Cadillac, and Davis drove off telling people he was going to find a place to dump the corpse. The body was found later that day in an alley. Authorities say Harmon suffered three gunshot wounds to the face, lower neck, and left armpit. He had also been stabbed four times. Davis told one witness he cut Harmon's throat, according to prosecutors. In addition to the 1980 case, Davis has faced attempted murder, aggravated battery and weapons charges.","Andre Davis was freed in the 1980 rape and murder of a 3-year-old girl after being cleared by DNA evidence .

"Anonymous pranksters have created a spoof map detailing the 'contemporary art' highlights of Huddersfield. The group - who call themselves MapFodder - poke fun of the pretentious blurb alongside modern art in galleries while leading walkers on a trial of eyesores through the West Yorkshire town. The leaflet, entitled Huddersfield Contemporary Art Trail (HCAT) have been anonymously distributed around public places with a railway station, car park and bus station among the highlights. Anonymous pranksters have created a spoof map detailing the 'contemporary art' highlights of Huddersfield . Fluorescent strip lights on a tower are grandly renamed 'Never! Never! Never!

The 'collective' claim the piece is reminiscent of later Rothko 'but with less form and variation- creating a solemn and contemplative atmosphere' HCAT satirises Metro's policy of playing muzak at Huddersfield Bus Station in 'Endless, Helpless' by 'Antonio Perogi'. It says: 'Perogi's notorious sound installations imbue existing music with an effect opposite to that intended by its composers.

The man can then be seen running from the shop empty-handed, chased by the petite mother-of-two . Mrs Bassi said her mother’s instinct took over as she fought to protect her daughter. Mrs Bassi -  who is just 5ft 2in and weighs 9st - said: 'It was just . horrific. I was shutting down the shop and he just burst in waving the . gun around. 'He started shouting ""Give me the money"" and swearing at me. 'I . really don’t know why I did it, but I guess my mother’s instinct took . over, my daughter Sattreet was hiding and I just grabbed the gun. 'He had shouted at me to give him the money and I just shouted ""Get out of my shop"" - and started shoving him. 'I must have startled him because he turned and ran out of the shop. 'He just picked the wrong day to mess with me - I wasn’t having him take my hard earned cash.' Mrs Bassi said her mother's instinct took over as she fought to protect her daughter . The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the incident . She said the incident had badly affected her daughter, who suffered from nightmares and flashbacks. Her husband Parmjit, 32, was at home at the time of the attack, and she says they have all been left shocked by what happened. The family have run the store for 19 years but insist they will not be forced out by the incident. She added: 'We will not be moved - we are a close-knit community and we won’t be driven out by thugs like him.' A 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named, was later caught by police after officers found his trainers close to the scene and the gun discarded by old bike frames nearby. On Friday the teenager admitted attempted robbery, possessing a firearm with intent to commit robbery and possessing a prohibited weapon. Recorder Mr Michael Elsom told Stafford Crown Court: 'Mrs Bassi displayed quite extraordinary bravery in taking hold of the weapon.' Prosecuting Phillip Beardwell said the gun’s stock had been crudely cut down, the barrel shortened and loaded with a 12-bore round. He told the court the defendant had put forward a basis of plea in which he maintained he had been under pressure from others to commit the robbery. Mr Beardwell added: 'At the time he was associating with people who were on the periphery of a local organised crime group. 'The Crown’s view is this was either braggadocio to earn his stripes, or it was something done under direction. 'The evidence is he attended the store alone and he left the store alone.' Michael Anning, defending, added: 'This is not a determined and experienced criminal. 'He was under pressure in relation to a debt they said he owed. The gun was given to him by them to commit this offence.' The case was adjourned and the teenager will be sentenced at a later date at the same court.","Ranvir Bassi, 35, was in family-run shop in Stafford with daughter Satpreet .

"The mystery woman photographed on a hotel balcony with Sir Mick Jagger earlier this month is a leading ballerina 43 years his junior, who he met two weeks before his girlfriend L’Wren Scott’s suicide, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Stunning American dancer Melanie Hamrick, 27, was pictured embracing the 70-year-old singer ten days ago in Zurich, where the Rolling Stones were performing. At the time, sources close to Jagger said the tryst followed a chance encounter in a nightclub. But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Jagger first met the New York-based dancer three months earlier – and 6,800 miles away – in Japan. Melanie Hamrick, 27, met Mick Jagger two weeks before L'Wren Scott's tragic suicide however the exchanged contact details three months earlier when they met in Japan after the Rolling Stones played a sell out gig . On March 6 this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of the band. Melanie, who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no mention of the Stones concert. A spokesman for Jagger has confirmed that the pair met when Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact details in Tokyo. The week before the concert, on February 25, Jagger had attended a special reception for the ballet troupe in Tokyo, hosted by U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a long-standing friend of the rock star, but Melanie did not attend. When she first met Jagger, Ms Hamrick, left, was engaged to marry her co-star at the American Ballet Theatre Jose Manuel Carreno, right . There was no sign of Ms Scott on the trip, though she had previously travelled with Mick whenever he was on the road. At the time of the ambassador’s party, Melanie was said to be engaged to another older man, 46-year-old José Manuel Carreño, a fellow dancer. She lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared. It was there that Ms Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49. Mick and Melanie were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking as though they had just got out of bed. Mick, who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved top with slashed sleeves. Ms Hamrick was photographed embracing Jagger on a hotel balcony in Zurich ten days ago, where sources close to the couple say the first 'liaison' took place . During the afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water. The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the £2,250-a-night suite. Normally Ms Scott, right, travelled with Jagger whenever he was on the road but was not with him when the band played Tokyo . Friends of Melanie, who has a penchant for older men, did not know why she was in Zurich, believing she flew to Switzerland alone. One said: ‘Ever since the photos emerged Mel has kept her head down hardly stepping out from her apartment. Talk has been rife about their fling with many believing it wasn’t just a coincidence the two were in Zurich together following the ambassador’s reception in Japan. ‘We all knew it was Mel but many others got the wrong end of the stick when they thought it was principal dancer Diana Vishneva. 'People put two and two together and came up with five because Diana was pictured meeting Mick during the party in Tokyo. But it was Mel on the balcony. They can look quite similar.’ On Friday Melanie braved torrential rain to step out from her New York apartment to do some shopping. Wearing a grey leather jacket, white T-shirt and skinny blue jeans, she had her hair tied back in the same style she wore when with Mick. After being approached by The Mail on Sunday, Melanie told a friend: ‘They’ve found me, they’ve found me!’ But she refused to comment directly. She has been romantically involved with Carreño for six years, and engaged since May 2011. They met in 2004, when she joined the American Ballet Theatre at the age of 17. He was then the Broadway-based company’s premier danseur. A father of two, who was previously married to fellow Cuban dancer Ana Lourdes Novoa, Carreño has been the principal dancer with the English National Ballet and the Royal Ballet, and has appeared on Dancing With The Stars, America’s version of Strictly Come Dancing. But earlier this year he moved to California – 2,500 miles from Melanie – after taking a job as artistic director of Ballet San Jose. In an interview in February, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: ‘Carreno talks like a person who has come to the South Bay for the long run, which meant leaving behind his fiancee, American Ballet Theatre dancer Melanie Hamrick.’ Ms Hamrick pictured along with her colleagues from the American Ballet Theatre on a bullet train in Tokyo where she met with Jagger . Melanie’s friends have also noted that she has recently stopped wearing the engagement ring she once sported. Jagger was flooded with messages of support after Ms Scott, his girlfriend of 13 years, committed suicide while he was touring with the Stones in Australia. Soon afterwards, he issued a statement saying: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. ‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves... I will never forget her.’ But the images of the great-grandfather being hugged and kissed by Melanie, who describes herself as ‘goofy and awkward’, left Ms Scott’s family seething. Ms Hamrick lives in New York's Upper West Side just 3 miles from the apartment Jagger shared with Ms Scott . Speaking from her home in Utah, her  sister Jan Shane said: ‘These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling. ‘His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister – and then you see these photos. 'He will never change. And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed? The more I think about it – the more angry it makes me. ‘My sister deserves so much more respect than that. It hasn’t even been three months. I now believe that he was a bigger part of her troubles that no one knew about. I am so hurt to know that she was so sad and hurting inside and felt that she had nowhere to go.’ In the days following Ms Scott’s death it emerged her business based in London had been battling crippling debts. The latest accounts for LS Fashion Ltd, filed in the UK in October 2013, showed the firm had a deficit of £3.5 million. Her company also owed creditors £4.6 million. The label had been haemorrhaging money for several years despite Mick, worth £200 million, repeatedly bailing her out. The Tokyo concert was the first time Jagger and the Rolling Stones had played Japan in eight years . The Stones are due to play in Vienna tomorrow night as they continue their 14 On Fire world tour. Since the band resumed the tour following Ms Scott’s death, rumours have been rife the father-of-seven has been entertained by several women after the shows. Friends claimed Mick, while performing in Berlin last week, spent the night with an old flame after arranging to meet her in the German capital. And actress and singer Noa Tishby posted a picture on the internet of herself and Jagger sharing a joke in a hotel room during the Stones’ stay in Israel a fortnight ago. A source close to the band said: ‘Mick’s way of dealing with L’Wren’s death was to get back on stage as soon as possible. It wasn’t long though before he was up to his old tricks. ‘The girl in Zurich was just a brief fling but she isn’t the first and won’t be the last. Mick is like an old dog who can’t be taught new tricks. Even before he started singing he was a womaniser and he still is. He knows no other way. ‘I’m not sure what the girl in Zurich thinks, but she is a goner.’ Perhaps all the travelling to be with Mick has affected Melanie’s performances on stage. A review last week of American Ballet Theatre’s production of Cinderella, singled her out for having ‘lamentably weak’ feet in her role as the Winter Fairy.","Jagger and Melanie Hamrick met in Tokyo in March and exchanged details .

"Wayne Payne, 31, was travelling at 61mph when he hit a bike on which Cameron Ward was sitting in Erdington, Birmingham . A driver who knocked down and killed a five-year-old boy while travelling at twice the speed limit told his victim's grieving family: 'S**t happens, life goes on'. Wayne Payne, 31, was travelling at 61mph when he hit a bike on which Cameron Ward was sitting in Erdington, Birmingham. The . youngster, who was being helped along by his father John Ward, was . killed as he returned with his family from an Easter party on April 1 . last year. A . judge had bailed the killer driver over the weekend on 'compassionate . grounds' so he could see his two young daughters before being jailed. But . just minutes later Payne, of Erdington, argued with . Cameron’s grieving relatives outside Birmingham Crown Court - before . walking away saying: 'S**t happens, life goes on.' As . Judge Rafferty jailed the driver and told him: 'You were let out on . trust by me for the weekend and the fact that you behaved in that way is . a very unfortunate state of affairs.' Payne, who drove at 61mph in the 30mph area, did not brake and hit the rear of the bike, causing the youngster to be flung into the air. Police and paramedics were called to the scene but the schoolboy could not be saved. Unemployed Payne, 31, of Birmingham, denied causing death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury, who took just 45 minutes to deliver a verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. He was sentenced to five years in . prison and told he would serve at least half of the sentence in custody. He was also banned from driving for five years. The . court heard he had convictions for drug possession dating back to 2004 . and two fixed penalty notices from 2010 and 2012 for using a phone while . driving. Gulan Ahmed, defending Payne, said: 'He is remorseful and sorry for what he did. Cameron Ward, five, who was being helped along by his father John Ward, was killed as he returned with his family from an Easter party on April 1 last year . Cameron, pictured with his mother Katie. The court previously heard extracts of a victim impact statement from her, which said: 'My heart breaks every time that I think about him' Grieving: Pictured with his father John, who was with him when he died. He told the court: 'Cameron was my life and I have lost him' He has two daughters himself and he puts himself in the position of  the victims and tells me that he wishes he could turn back time and undo what he has done, but he can’t. 'He is going to have to live with what he did until the day of his own death.' A letter of apology was also handed to the court from Payne, via his legal team, which stated he had spent the weekend reflecting on his clash with the family of Cameron. Judge . Stuart Rafferty QC told him: ‘A five-year-old boy has lost his life . before he even had a chance to begin to live. If you had just been a few . seconds later you would have hit four people and not two. ‘You . were not doing 35mph, or even 40mph, you were doing twice the speed . limit and I’m satisfied that you had been doing that along the entire . length of the road. It was grossly excessive and there was no legitimate . reason at all for driving in that way. ‘Mr . Ward was blameless, but he will continue to ask himself if it was his . fault. One can only imagine his horror as a responsible parent when he . saw the speed at which the vehicle was approaching him at and he . realised that there was nowhere for him to go. Dozens of floral tributes were left at the scene of the collision in Court Lane, Erdington, Birmingham . Hundreds of people attended the little boy's funeral. His family told the court: 'Nothing is the same, nobody is the same and everybody hurts. We love and miss him so much' The judge has praised Cameron's family - pictured here at his funeral - for their dignity throughout the case . The little boy's coffin was taken by horse and carriage, and was covered in flowers and his favourite Spiderman character . ‘The . last memory the parents have of their little boy will not be a happy . one, it will be the sight of him after you had hit him.’ Howard Searle, prosecuting, told the . court how Mr Ward saw the headlights of a Vauxhall Vectra, being driven . by Payne, in the distance before he stepped into the highway. He . said: 'Mr Ward thought he had plenty of time to cross. As he got to the . middle of the road he heard the roar of a car engine and realised the . car was much closer to him. 'It was this defendant driving well in excess of the speed limit. He froze on the spot. One floral tribute, left by the youngster's parents, contained a heartbreaking tribute to their son . 'The car being driven by Payne did not brake at all but drove into the bicycle. It hit the rear. 'Cameron was flung into the air and his father was injured as well.' Mr Searle said the defendant lost control of the Vectra and it continued for 50 metres down the street before colliding with a parked car. He said the defendant, who later claimed he had tried to swerve, had admitted careless driving. Mr Ward, 37, who had been walking ahead of his partner Katie Lawrence and daughter Ruby at the time of the crash, said he had seen the lights of a vehicle about 200 metres away and had gone out into the road between two parked cars. 'I thought it was safe to cross the road,' he said. 'It happened very quickly. It was over in seconds.' 'I don't know how I got up but I did. I knew he was dead. I wanted to disappear. Cameron was my life and I had lost him.' The court previously heard extracts of a victim impact statement from mother Katie, 23, who had described his birth as the happiest day of her life. She said: 'My heart breaks every time that I think about him. Nothing is the same, nobody is the same and everybody hurts. We love and miss him so much.' The Judge also thanked the family for their 'restraint and dignity' shown during the case.","Cameron Ward was killed when a car driven by Wayne Payne hit his bicycle .

"A council made an embarrassing error when it installed a plaque commemorating a visit to a town by King Charles I in 1663 - despite the fact he was executed 14 years earlier.

"A cancer-stricken woman was capable of 'detailed, clear thinking' when she signed over half of her £1.2million estate to toyboy lover Michael Badmin . A cancer-stricken woman was capable of ‘detailed, clear thinking’ when she signed away half her estate to a toyboy lover nearly half her age, a court heard today. Michael Badmin, 35, is fighting Alison Walker, 31, and Jennifer Rowan, 32, for a share of their mother’s £1.2million farm set in 90 acres near Girlinge Green, Canterbury, Kent. The daughters claim their mother Elizabeth Walker was in a ‘delusional and irrational’ state when she signed the will and have asked a judge to tear it up. But Professor Stephen D . Martin, consultant general psychiatrist and neuropsychiatrist, said he . would be ‘surprised’ if Mrs Walker had erred in her will, given the . evidence before him. A letter, apparently sent by Mrs Walker setting . out her rationale for leaving half her estate to Mr Badmin, was shown to the court today. ‘It suggests detailed, clear thinking’, Prof Martin commented. ‘It might not be the fairest reasoning in the eyes of the beneficiaries, but it is logical. It is certainly not a matter of mental disorder that is driving it. ‘It does not constitute a paranoid state, depression or delirium.’ The . note was ‘very eloquently written’ and contained a ‘richness of . intellectual content’, Prof Martin, an expert witness, instructed by Mr . Badmin’s solicitors, said. Despite a request to the judge to release it, the letter was not provided to the media. Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas . Strauss QC said documentary evidence suggested Mrs Walker was quite . capable of drawing up her will. He also said of the sisters's reports of their mother's behaviour - ‘pathetic may not be the right word but somewhere near it’. Mrs Walker died aged 53 in February 2010 from a brain tumour, barely a month after changing her will to leave half of her estate to Badmin - with the other half split between her daughters. Mr Badmin, from Sittingbourne, Kent, was in his early 20s when he first met Mrs Walker and their relationship ‘began in earnest’ over Christmas 2005, the High Court was told. Mrs Walker was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009, apparently cutting her daughters out of half their inheritance at the end of that year. Ms Walker and Ms Rowan contend their mother ‘failed utterly to engage in the process’ of making a will and relied on Mr Badmin to help draft it. Alison Walker (left) and Jennifer Rowan (right) say their mother Elizabeth Walker 'failed utterly to engage in the process' of making a will before she died - and relied on Mr Badmin to draft the document . Mr Badmin insists that, despite the . gulf between their ages, their relationship was loving and is battling . to keep the inheritance. His . barrister, Araba Taylor, said Mrs Walker had bequeathed him a life . interest in her share of the sale price of the 90-acre farm, near . Girlinge Green, Canterbury, Kent, as she wanted him to ‘have a roof over . his head’ after she died. As . well as money from the house, the rest of her estate was divided, with . 50 per cent going to Mr Badmin, now of Sittingbourne, Kent, and the . remainder split between the sisters. The . pair had even wanted to get married until illness wrecked their dreams. ‘She always said she didn’t think it right that I should be a widower,’ Mr Badmin told  the court. Their relationship was ‘kept a secret’ until Mrs Walker had separated from her husband John in 2007, it was said. Oliver Hilton, barrister for the sisters, added: ‘It was a shock to the family, given that he was exactly 23 years her junior, of similar age to Jennifer and Alison, and Timothy’s former friend. 'Nevertheless, the parties managed to get on with the new relationship and living arrangements.’ The farm was the Walker family home . for many years until Elizabeth moved out to set up house with Mr Badmin . following the breakdown of her relationship with her husband, after more . than 20 years of marriage. The sisters are fighting with Mrs Walker's toyboy lover for a stake in their family home near the beautiful village of Petham (pictured), near Canterbury, Kent . Mr . Hilton explained how Mrs Walker was diagnosed with a brain tumour in . June 2009 that caused her to endure episodes of psychosis, . hallucinations and paranoia. Although . her mental condition improved from July 2009, he said she was often . vulnerable and that her mental capacity ‘waxed and waned’ in her final . months. Question marks persisted over whether she . remained ‘lucid’ in November and December 2009 – when instructions for . the disputed will were given. ‘Mr Badmin alleges that she did and the sisters maintain that she did not,’ said Mr Hilton. The barrister claimed that Mrs Walker ‘failed utterly to engage in the process’ when giving solicitors instructions to draft her will, and ‘very much took a back seat – relying on Mr Badmin throughout’. Alison Walker told the court she did . not believe her mother understood the true impact of her will, adding . that she became ‘very off with me which she had never done in her whole . life before she was ill’. ‘It . changed her perception of everything,’ she said. ‘Once she had that . brain tumour her closest family – even her grandchildren who she doted . on – were almost like strangers. ‘She just wasn’t normal; it changed her affections. ‘She would have made provision for him, . but I don’t think she would have made it of the kind she did, I don’t . think she understood what the will actually meant,’ the court was told. Deputy High Court Judge Nicholas Strauss QC said documentary evidence suggested Mrs Walker was quite capable of drawing up her will at London's High Court today (Royal Courts of Justice pictured). The trial continues tomorrow . But Mr Badmin’s barrister, Araba Taylor, maintained that the dying woman – although frail – remained sufficiently ‘on the ball’ to draw up her will, noting that she was a highly capable individual with a tight grasp of financial matters. Mr Badmin denied suggestions that his older lover had ‘reservations about their relationship’ before she set up home with him, and that they had ‘argued a lot’. He said: ‘It lasted quite a long time. She might have had doubts; I had my doubts – she was older than me – but if she did have doubts, they were fleeting.’ The case continues.","Elizabeth Walker died aged 53 in 2010 after suffering from a brain tumour .

"A record 247 million shoppers visited stores and websites over the post-Thanksgiving Black Friday weekend this year, a figure almost equal to latest census figures for the total number of American citizens over the age of 14. The National Retail Federation released the figures on Sunday, which reported that the number of shoppers this year was up nine percent from 226 million in 2011. According to the 2010 Census, an estimated 308,745,538 people live in the United States. Once you subtract everyone under 14 years of age from the total population, that means there are 247,518,325 people in this country, just over the number who went shopping this past weekend according to the NRF. Record Breaking: Nearly 250 million Americans went shopping over the Thanksgiving weekend, that's the same number as there are citizens over 14 . Cash Flow: The staggering number of shoppers brought in roughly $60 billion over the course of the four-day weekend . Deep pockets: Retailers are extremely encouraged that the average shopper spent $423 over the weekend . This Thanksgiving also saw Americans . spending more than ever before. The average holiday spender dished out . $423 over the entire weekend, up from $398 last year. Meanwhile, total . spending jumped nearly 13 per cent to $59.1 billion across the country. The NRF stats don’t yet take into . account the numbers for Cyber Monday which was also a record-breaker. Sales grew 30 percent on last year according to IBM. Retailer are excited by these numbers, as they are seen as a successful start to the lucrative holiday season. There had been initial fears that the . weak job market and impending tax hikes would depress spending during . one of the busiest seasons for retailers. Despite the financial doldrums many Americans are apparently in, they were encouraged to spend courtesy of a number of creative new features designed to make holiday shopping more convenient. Specifically, Americans were spurred to shop thanks to efforts made by retailers to open stores on Thanksgiving evening, update mobile shopping apps for smartphones and tablets and expand shipping and layaway options. When shopping turns ugly: Security guards had to break up a fight between angry shoppers waiting at Target in Bowling Green, Kentucky . Shopping frenzy: A crowd goes wild over a $5 deal for headphones at Walmart . Cyber Monday was also a record-breaker, with sales up 30 percent on last year . A surprising big loser over the record-breaking weekend for online sales was social media commerce, which saw a shocking 35% DROP in sales compared to last year. According to data released by IBM, just 0.34% of all online sales on Black Friday came from people clicking through from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In sharp contrast, customers shopping using their mobile phones and tablets increased, with sales and traffic both up by over 65%, and iPad traffic doubling. In an uncharacteristic display, shops along Manhattan’s SoHo and Herald Square districts were brightly lit well past midnight, as lines of eager shoppers crowded along the blocks waiting to get in for their early openings. And for online shopping, lines were avoided altogether. According to comScore, which tracks digital spending, online sale rose a staggering 26 per cent to $1.04 billion on Black Friday, marking the first time such sales have surpassed $1 billion on that day. On Cyber Monday online sales were up more than 36 percent over Black Friday. Though there is still no data on how many more shoppers turned out thanks to the late-night openings, it does appear to have helped make Thanksgiving a more popular day for shopping. While in the past the third Thursday of November was reserved for eating turkey and watching football, this year, it saw more people out shopping than in year’s past. According to the National Retail Federation survey, the number of people who shopped on Thanksgiving rose 23.1 percent. Helping Hand: People were encouraged to spend thanks to new features making shopping more convenient, Toys R Us in Times Square (pictured) started sales on Thanksgiving . Digital Discounts: Some shoppers avoided the lines by going online and Black Friday saw online sales top $1 billion . All this has come as welcome news retailers across the country, many of whom can make upwards of 40 per cent of their annual revenue in November and December alone. They are hoping that this data will help buoy early, negative projections for the holiday season. The survey, however, did not bring all good news. It appears that early openings and increased sales on Thanksgiving Day may have dampened sales on Black Friday, which is still expected to be the biggest shopping day of the year. Sales of Black Friday slipped to $11.2 billion, down nearly two per cent from last year and below estimates that they would hit at least $11.4 billion. Meanwhile, the National Retail Federation estimates that overall sales in November and December will rise 4.1 percent this year to $586.1 billion. That's more than a percentage point lower than the growth in each of the past two years, and the smallest increase since 2009, when sales were nearly flat. Still, retailers are hopeful and believe that last weekend's earnings were just the start of what will be a successful holiday season. ‘Retailers and consumers both won this weekend, especially on Thanksgiving,’ said Matthew Shay, president and CEO of the National Retail Federation.","A record 247 million shoppers visited stories and websites over Black Friday weekend .

"A taxi driver who killed a talented teenager while acting like he ‘owned the road’ as he carried out an aggressive overtaking manoeuvre already had a string of previous motoring convictions for dangerous driving, a court heard. Sarah Jane Burke, 17, suffered catastrophic injuries when she was struck by David Baillie’s Volvo as she crossed the road on her way home from college in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear on September 17 last year. The talented teenager, who was excelling on an art and design course at Sunderland College, suffered multiple fractures and brain trauma after she was thrown into the air before landing on her head 20 metres away. Sarah Jane Burke, 17, (left) suffered catastrophic injuries when she was struck by David Baillie’s (right) Volvo as she crossed the road on her way home from college in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear in September last year . She died from her injuries five days later, leaving behind her parents and sister who are devastated by her death. Taxi driver Baillie, 39, who was off-duty when he hit Miss Burke, denied causing her death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury after just over an hour of deliberations at Newcastle Crown Court. After the unanimous guilty verdict was returned, Baillie’s string of previous motoring convictions - which include two for dangerous driving - were revealed in court. Prosecutor Nick Dry said: ‘He has around ten for theft of motor vehicles and taking without consent, five for driving while disqualified and five for having no insurance.’ The court heard how Baillie has even served time in prison in the past for his poor driving. Miss Burke’s devastated mother and father attended court for the entirety of the trial, and are expected to return tomorrow to see Baillie – who has been remanded in custody – sentenced. Judge Paul Sloan QC warned him: ‘You must understand, a substantial sentence of imprisonment is inevitable in the circumstances of this case.’ Prosecutors said Baillie was ‘consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs’ when he ploughed into the teenager. Miss Burke had been crossing the road on her way home from college when she was hit by Baillie, who had a woman and small child with him in the car, as he tried to dangerously overtake a Vauxhall Corsa. Taxi driver Baillie, 39, (pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court) was off duty when he hit Miss Burke and denied causing death by dangerous driving but was found guilty by a jury after just over an hour of deliberations . Witnesses claimed Baillie had been ‘tailgating’ the other vehicle and had hit the popular teenager in his desperate effort to get in front. One motorist said he thought Baillie was a ‘road rage’ driver while another said he thought Baillie’s Volvo must be either stolen or being chased. Another witness said: ‘It was as if the driver owned the road and no-one else was there.’ Baillie, of Sunderland, had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving but denied his behaviour was dangerous. Jurors were shown footage which was picked up by a passing bus and showed Miss Burke making her way home along the city’s Ormonde Street. A second set of footage, picked up by a camera on another bus, showed the aftermath of the tragedy which included the teenager lying on the road injured after being knocked down. Mr Dry told the court: ‘Witnesses watched in horror as she was struck and thrown into the air before coming to the ground, head-first. ‘Paramedics were on the scene within minutes and did what they could to stabilise Sarah Burke, who had clearly suffered multiple fractures and serious head injury. Miss Burke had been crossing Ormonde Street in Sunderland (above) when she was hit by Baillie as he tried to dangerously overtake a Vauxhall Corsa. The 17-year-old suffered fatal injuries and died five days later . ‘She was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle by air ambulance. Sadly, she died of her injuries five days later.’ The court heard how Baillie initially blamed the Corsa driver for causing the crash but went on to admit in a police interview that his driving had been dangerous as he had been paying more attention to the other motorist than to the road ahead. Mr Dry said: ‘He conceded his driving was dangerous, particularly the action to overtake on a busy, 30mph street with blind junctions, approaching traffic lights at a time when he was not focused on the road ahead.’ However, Mr Dry said that after Miss Burke died, Baillie ‘changed his mind’ and instead started to claim his driving was careless not dangerous. Mr Dry added: ‘We have a defendant driving dangerously from the traffic lights at Barnes Park Road until the point of impact with Sarah Burke. ‘Driving fuelled by rage and failing to get ahead of the Corsa, therefore consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs, culminating in the collision which cost a 17-year-old girl her life.’","Sarah Jane Burke, 17, suffered catastrophic injuries after being hit by Volvo .

"The best gift Liz and Mario Shlimon received on their wedding day was also an unexpected one – the early arrival of their daughter Eva, who was born less than eight hours after the couple tied the knot. The New Zealand couple celebrated their wedding and the birth of their first child in the same day, when their daughter arrived 11 days early. Liz Shlimon, 39, went into labour on the night of June 5, the day before their wedding was scheduled to take place at a registry office, but she was determined to make it down the aisle. Liz and Mario Shlimon got married while Liz was in labour and just hours later Mrs Shlimon gave birth to their first child, Eva . Mrs Shlimon's midwife told her she could get married, as long as she was at the hospital by 7pm on Friday, despite her waters breaking on Thursday night. The couple persisted with their plans, with Mrs Shlimon experiencing contractions at the hairdresser while she was getting ready for the wedding. The contractions continued throughout the morning, resulting in the ceremony starting slightlylater than planned. 'I was thinking, ""Just hold on there, just hang on. I've got to get through,""' she told stuff.co.nz. The couple’s two o’clock ceremony was short but sweet, and Mr and Mrs Shlimon decided to fit in lunch with their bridal party before they checked into Wellington Hospital. 'I couldn't sit down. The waiter was a bit concerned, he kept hanging around. He said ""I hope you don't have the baby here"",' she told stuff.co.nz. As Mr and Mrs Shlimon arrived at the hospital, still in their wedding clothes, they were met with applause from hospital staff who threw confetti over them. Mrs Shlimon traded her wedding gown for a hospital robe and gave birth to Eva Alishwa Shlimon at 9.50pm and she told MailOnline the baby is doing well. Eva Alishwa Shlimon was born at 9.50pm on June 6, 11 days before her due date . Mrs Shlimon said she was 'blown away' by people's interest in the birth and gushed about her new husband's parenting skills. 'Mario's good at the night times, so I get a wee bit of sleep,' she told MailOnline. The proud father, who runs a kebab shop in Porirua, announced the arrival of his first child on Facebook. 'The Kebab King's been a bit busy this weekend. Married at 2pm Friday and the early arrival of Eva at 9.50pm. Even had confetti on arrival at wellington hospital delivery suite!!' he wrote. Friends took to social media to express their congratulations. 'Congratulations, you both look lovely in the wedding pic and and your baby is gorgeous, that's actually very funny, what a honeymoon night lol,' wrote Fiona Wright. 'What a beautiful couple.

"Britain's first elected Muslim mayor could face a High Court battle after he was accused of electoral fraud and calling his main rival a racist to sabotage his chances. Documents challenging the result of last month's election in Tower Hamlets, east London, also claim Lutfur Rahman paid supporters to gather inside and outside polling stations to influence voters. His Labour opponent John Biggs was also illegally smeared during last month's campaign, the election petition argues. High Court battle: An election petition has been lodged at the High Court claiming Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman and his team broke electoral law and smeared opponent John Biggs . According to The Times the High Court paperwork also says supporters of the Bangladeshi-born mayor were canvassing inside polling stations and stood by residents as they voted while leaving pro-Rahman leaflets. It is also claimed that Mr Rahman - or members of his team - sent postal votes from people not on the electoral roll. If any of the allegations are true, which Mr Rahman denies, they are illegal and the cross-party team who submitted the documents claim the alleged acts changed the election result. Mr Rahman was elected for a second term in a tight contest with Mr Biggs in May, beating him by 37,000 votes to 34,000. But if the High Court petition succeeds in arguing the election was illegal there could be a new vote and Mr Rahman could be banned if he personally was involved. He told BBC London today: 'I have done, and we have done, nothing wrong.' The allegations contrast with reports from Scotland Yard, who stationed an officer at every polling station in the borough but said no major incident was reported. Mr Biggs told The Times: 'I was distressed by the accusations, which have no foundation. They were part of a cynical campaign to try to polarise community opinion.' Alibor Choudhury, Mayor Rahman's agent responded: 'All candidates in the mayoral election accept the results. This petition challenging the results does not raise any new issues or evidence.' Protection: Scotland Yard put an officer on every polling station but critics claim that Rahman supporters managed to influence voters inside and outside, it was alleged today . The troubled London borough has a history of allegations of election crime and is led by Mr Rahman, a Bangladeshi-born law graduate who controls an all-Asian cabinet at the top of the council. He was dropped by the Labour Party after claims that he was linked to the extremist Islamic Forum of Europe - which wants to create a sharia state – but first swept to power as mayor of one of London’s poorest boroughs in 2010. Earlier this year Mr Rahman - who has been criticised for his £42,000-a-year taxpayer-funded chauffeur - faced allegations, broadcast in a Panorama documentary, of diverting funds to interest groups in exchange for political support. Police last month said that they had found no evidence of criminality. Last month Britain’s election watchdog, the Electoral Commission, launched an investigation into one of the country’s most controversial councils amid claims that voting resembled ‘third-world village politics.’ Counting in Tower Hamlets took five days to finish after widespread allegations of intimidation at polling stations in the east London borough. Local Conservative and Labour politicians claimed crowds of supporters from the Tower Hamlets First party - founded by local mayor Lutfur Rahman – shouted at voters and left leaflets inside polling booths. They said officials counting votes were surrounded by ‘arguments, threats and chaos’ and political activists disputed how they counted ballot papers. One councillor said there had been a 21 per cent discrepancy between the first and second count of votes in one council ward.","Election petition sent to High Court claims Tower Hamlets poll was illegal .

"David Cameron today came under pressure over reports the NHS faces a £2billion financial black hole. The Prime Minister was challenged over reports of a cash shortage in the health service in England which is heaping pressure on staff and putting care at risk. NHS managers warned the service is ‘experiencing some of the most pressured times of its existence so far’. Scroll down for video . David Cameron told the Commons that the efficiency savings needed in the NHS were on track . The NHS's secondary healthcare budget in England, which includes money for hospital and mental health services, is £78 billion. But analysis of figures from the health regulator Monitor suggest that in 2015-16 there will be a funding gap of £5.1 billion. Even after all realistic efficiency savings are made there will still be a deficit of £1.6bn for 2015-16, according to the BBC analysis. In the Commons today, Mr Cameron insisted the NHS is on track to make £20 billion in planned efficiency savings. He told MPs: ‘The estimates being made today are being made on the basis that we have set challenges for the NHS in terms of making efficiencies. ‘They have met those efficiency challenges every single year under this Government and that money has been ploughed back into better patient care in our NHS.’ Labour's Andy Burnham said the NHS's finances were on a 'knife-edge' But Labour said that the health service's finances are on a ‘knife-edge’ as a result of the controversial NHS reforms. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron chose to put NHS finances on this knife-edge when he wasted £3 billion on a damaging re-organisation and clawed back a further £3 billion to the Treasury in recent years. That is why the NHS is in a such a fragile financial position.’ Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, said: 'The prospect of a further £2 billion cut in the NHS budget is a real blow for patients and staff. ‘The Government can't expect staff to plug this hole in NHS funding by cutting pay and conditions even further. ‘Starving NHS budgets further will have a significant and noticeable impact on patient care, staff training and hospital infrastructure. ‘The NHS is already under strain because of rising demand and the high cost of expensive drugs and treatments.’ The NHS Confederation, which represents health organisations across England, called for a 10-year funding settlement for the NHS to protect NHS funding in real terms for the next decade. Chief operating officer Matt Tee said: 'There is no doubt that the health service is experiencing some of the most pressured times of its existence so far. 'What we really need is for the NHS to have some certainty about the funding it will get in future years, so health service leaders can plan most effectively with their populations how to deliver the right services, in the right places, for the best value.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: 'The NHS is on track to make £20 billion savings this Parliament and we are confident that it will continue to make the savings necessary which will be reinvested to front line care to meet the rising demands of our ageing population.'","Prime Minister insists efficiency savings in the health service are on track .

"Karen James, 47, was jailed for two years at Cardiff Crown Court after stealing £35,000 from her employer over a three-year period . A depressed GP manager stole £35,000 from her employer and spent the cash on beauty treatments to cheer herself up after racking up huge debts, a court heard. Karen James, 47, was jailed for two years after pleading guilty to pocketing the money over a three-year period while managing the books and finances at Cyncoed Consulting Rooms in Cardiff, Wales. She spent the money on a host of beauty treatments after racking up huge debts and becoming depressed when she split with her partner of 21 years, Cardiff Crown Court was told. The court heard how it was James’ responsibility to look after the finances at the surgery, which was owned by five GPs who rented out space to other doctors and practitioners. Prosecuting David Webster said: ‘It was her responsibility to bank the takings. ‘One of the doctors who used the rooms insisted his payments were in cash and paid his [room] rent in cash. Two others also paid cash. ‘The partners were content with her managing things and relied on her until one doctor became concerned about her work and £700 was found in the cash tin, waiting to be banked, when she went on annual leave.’ James, who lives rent-free with her mother in Newport, Wales while she tries to cope with her debts, blamed poor management at the consulting rooms. Defence barrister Charles Rowe claimed the trusted administrator was out of her depth when she was promoted after just a year or two to manage the practice and said her 'responsibilities increased and tasks grew’. He said: ‘The partners, because they trusted her, took an increasingly less keen interest in day-to-day management and she was left to run it with the staff she chose. ‘She was handling the cash, organising the payroll and salaries and renting out the rooms - she struggled and became utterly overwhelmed. ‘She was also battling with depression, breaking up from her partner of 21 years, caring for her mother and in debt. James, 47, pocketed the money while managing the finances at Cyncoed Consulting Rooms (pictured) in Cardiff, Wales where she worked as a manager. She spent the money on herself after racking up huge debts . ‘Yes, she went for beauty treatments - put on her makeup, put on a smile and appeared to be a happy and successful woman - but underneath it was a different matter and her enormous debts were mounting. ‘She took out pay day loads and then turned to dishonesty. ‘The beauty treatments were just a short-term fix to try to make herself feel better.’ He and James disputed claims that the missing money totalled £51,493, saying there were discrepancies in some of the paperwork they had seen. Following an adjournment in the hearing, the court was told a figure of £35,000 had been accepted by both sides for the purpose of sentencing James. The mother-of-one initially denied . stealing the money but changed her plea to guilty as soon as her . daughter celebrated her 18th birthday. Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) heard how James spent the money on a host of beauty treatments as a 'short-term fix' after racking up debts and becoming depressed when she split with her partner of 21 years . Mr Rowe said: ‘Her daughter was only 17 at the time and once she had her birthday, James decided that was the time to face reality. ‘It was as if a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. ‘She has never been in trouble before, feels embarrassed, guilty and remorseful and intends to pay it back if she can.’ Sentencing James to two years in prison, recorder Paul Lewis QC said: ‘You stole cash intended to be banked, over a three-year period.’","Karen James stole the cash while working at Cyncoed Consulting Rooms .

"Claimant: Bento Touray claims she was fired from two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche because restaurant bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person . A receptionist fired from two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche tried to sue the restaurant for race discrimination after claiming bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person. Bento Touray had only worked at Michel Roux Junior’s exclusive London establishment for three weeks when she was let go in September last year, and replaced by a white woman. Miss Touray took the Mayfair-based French restaurant to an employment tribunal, claiming that general manager Emmanuel Landré, who was . on holiday when she was hired, told her to leave and she believed that . the restaurant did not employ black people front of house. She claimed that on his return Mr Landré had ignored her, it was 'apparent' he disliked her, and she alleges she was later replaced with a white receptionist. However, staff at Le Gavroche claimed Spanish Miss Touray had poor language skills, was badly organised and did not provide the exceptional level of service expected at one of the best restaurants in the world. Her case was later dismissed by the tribunal judge. 'I was dismissed because I am black. I was made to feel like one of the oddest employees there,' Miss Touray told the Central London Employment Tribunal. 'They treated me differently because I am black. 'Le Gavroche does not employ non-white staff front of house. This was confirmed by comments from my white predecessor.' Miss Touray was hired on August 23 by the restaurant’s assistant manager Ursula Perberschlager, after a day’s trial. She claims she was given the job permanently and signed a contract; however the restaurant states she was only given a month’s trial. Her role was to open the door for customers, greet them as they came in, show them their tables, look after the cloakroom and open the door for them on the way out. She denies she had ever been told her work was not up to standard or challenged on any mistakes. 'There were no complaints about how I fulfilled my role,' she said. 'No other staff at Le Gavroche made any complaint. 'When Mr Landré came back from holiday things changed. It doesn’t make sense to me. He treated me differently, he barely talked to me. Allegations: Miss Touray has taken the French restaurant to an employment tribunal, claiming that general manager Emmanuel Landré, who was on holiday when she was hired, told her to leave and she believed that the restaurant did not employ black people front of house . 'It was apparent Mr Landré did not like me, he did not speak to me. He would often ignore me and not even say hello.' She claims the general manager told her on September 11 that would be her last day of work, as she was no longer needed. She said: 'I asked why and also if I had done anything wrong. Mr Landré said that my work was good but they did not need another receptionist. 'I subsequently learned Mr Landré had recruited a new receptionist, I presumed he had her lined up when he dismissed me. She is of white skin colour. 'As a result of the discrimination I suffered serious injury to my feelings.. My esteem and confidence was undermined and I suffered stress as a result.. I attended counselling. 'I genuinely believe I have been subjected to race discrimination.' However, Mr Landré vehemently denied his sacking of Miss Touray has anything to do with her race. He said: 'Since it opened in 1967, Le Gavroche has always employed individuals with many different ethnic identities in both kitchen and front of house. 'The allegation that Le Gavroche does not employ non-white staff is simply not true; in 2013 alone we employed thirteen non-white employees in our front of house team. Five of the individuals in the receptionist role since the start of 2013 have been non-white. 'Miss Touray’s suggestion that . individuals are employed or treated differently according to their race . is entirely untrue and without foundation.' He . told the hearing that as soon as he returned from holiday in early . September concerns were raised by Ursula Perberschlager and her sister . Sylvia about Miss Touray’s work. He . said: 'I do not agree that I did not like Miss Touray, my only concern . was with her behaviour to our clients and whether she was capable of . performing her role at Le Gavroche. High Standards: Set up by the Roux brothers Michel and Albert in 1967, Le Gavroche became the first UK restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars in 1982 before it was taken over by Michel Roux Jnr (left) 'Despite additional training and close supervision I did not observe sufficient improvement in her performance. Miss Touray displayed a lack of organisation in how she performed her duties, often mixing up guest’s property and taking guests to the wrong tables. 'Due to her poor communication skills she was unable to undertake various administrative tasks or conduct telephone calls. I was very concerned by a failure on her part to be sufficiently personable with the guests. This is an extremely serious failure. 'She was the first experience people had of Le Gavroche, and their last, so would be their lasting impression. She affected the feeling people got out of the restaurant, and this would damage the reputation of Le Gavroche. 'Our clients pay a lot of money to come here. As one of only a handful of two Michelin-starred restaurants in the world customers of Le Gavroche have the highest expectations, and we always aim to exceed those expectations.' The court also heard from Noemi Guy, who had been a receptionist at Le Gavroche before being promoted to Mr Roux and Mr Landré’s PA. She said: 'I am a Swiss national, born in Haiti and of Black Caribbean descent. I did the same job as the claimant. It was a hard job; you had to be at your best all the time. There were high expectations but I made it though. 'I was never treated differently by Mr Landré or anyone else because of my colour.' Ursula Perberschager told the court she . had hired Miss Touray because she had some hospitality experience and . had suggested from a trial shift she could do the job. She . said: 'I explained to her her employment was on a one month trial basis . and it depended on Mr Landré. Despite comprehensive training, I became . concerned about Miss Touray's performance. 'She . was not able to perform tasks such as putting coats on hangers, or . pulling chairs out and moving tables for customers. We would expect to . see a genuine eagerness to serve customers in Miss Touray's role, but . that was not clear in her performance. Consequences: The tribunal was told that at the restaurant, overseen by Michel Roux Jnr (pictured), 'reputation is of absolute importance' 'We . expect a receptionist to be there and be present, and give customers . service before they ask for it. I told her there and then when she was . making mistakes and told her how to put it right. 'However there was no significant improvement in her performance.' Both Ms Perberschager and her sister said . they had challenged Miss Touray on numerous occasions about failures in . her customer service and were consulted when Mr Landré decided to sack . her. However, Miss Touray claims she was never told by either of the sisters her performance was less than exemplary. Summing up her evidence, Miss Touray told the tribunal: 'I believe Mr Landré is racist and you are protecting him. 'I believe 100 per cent that my dismissal was not due to my performance in any way. Ursula and Silvia have both worked with Mr Landré for 13 years. Will their evidence be objective? I don't think so. 'No one ever gave me any reason why I was dismissed or any opportunity to appeal. 'Before Mr Landré came things were fine, than he came and things started to change. I got on with the sisters before. They did not once challenge me on my performance. 'I noticed as soon as I started there were no other black faces around. There was nothing wrong with my performance. I was sacked because I am black.' Toby McArdle, representing Le Gavroche, told the hearing that Miss Touray simply did not meet the exceptional standards the restaurant demanded of employees. First set up by the Roux brothers Michel and Albert in 1967, Le Gavroche became the first UK restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars in 1982, before it was taken over by Albert's son, Masterchef: The Professionals judge Michel Roux Jnr in 1991. The restaurant lost the third star in 1993. Mr McArdle said: 'The fact Le Gavroche is a high end fine dining restaurant cannot be underestimated. One slip up on standards in such a prestigious and well known restaurant can result in significant consequences. Reputation is of absolute importance to the restaurant. 'It has not been suggested Miss Touray was a woeful employee but the expectation at Le Gavroche far surpassed that of most run of the mill restaurants. 'That she is unable to accept her performance may have been at fault shows her inability to look at things from an objective position. 'The claimant said she did not see any other black people front of house after two days there. I claim she is overly sensitive to race and colour. She has not elaborated on her allegation that Mr Landré treated her differently because of her colour or shown any actions of his that could be termed racist. I urge the tribunal to dismiss the claim.' The tribunal's judgement found against Miss Touray. Following the outcome Mr McArdle said: 'We were delighted, although not surprised, to receive the verdict we have always expected. 'We were justified in taking the stance to defend this baseless allegation by Ms Touray to full hearing, and have been completely vindicated on all counts. 'The Tribunal Judge Professor Alan Neal said that ""there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the restaurant has any policy or practice of discrimination in any form"".'","Bento Touray tried to sue restaurant for race discrimination .

"A speeding teenage driver who killed his best friend after crashing his high-powered hatchback a month after passing his test has been jailed for three years. Michael Lock, 19, of Colchester, Essex, had been driving at an estimated 55mph, almost twice the 30mph speed limit, when he lost control of his Citroen Saxo VTR. His friend Josh Irvine, 18, who had been a passenger in the car, died instantly when the car collided into a road-sweeper in Bromley Road, Colchester. Michael Lock (left) has been jailed for three years after admitting causing death by dangerous driving. Josh Irvine (right) died instantly in the collision with a roadsweeper in November 2012 after Lock lost control of his car . Lock had passed his test a month before the incident after taking an intensive learning course, the court heard. He was told he would serve at least 18 . months in a young offenders' institution after he admitted causing death . by dangerous driving. Josh's parents, Patrick and Tracey Irvine, last night said that not even a 100-year jail sentence would bring back their only child. Mr Irvine also branded 'hot hatchbacks' as loaded guns ready to go off. Lock and Josh Irvine had been friends since they met at secondary school at the age of 11 and worked together at Lock’s family business, run by his father, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Lock suffered serious injuries in the incident, on November 8, 2012, and had to spend more than six weeks in hospital as he was treated for multiple fractures, including his jaw, collarbone, eye socket and cheekbone. Josh's parents, Patrick and Tracey Irvine, last night said that not even a 100-year jail sentence would bring back their only child . Sentencing Lock, Judge John Dodd, QC, said: 'The circumstances are tragic. 'You were seen by a number of people in . the moments before the fatal impact and the common perception is that . you were travelling far in excess of the limit, and one or two of those were indeed fearful there would be a dreadful incident. 'You chose to drive far too fast in a vehicle which for you was too powerful. You have expressed profound remorse and I accept you are a decent hard-working young man. 'You never intended any harm to befall Josh that fateful day.' He added: 'You have been traumatised at the realisation that for the sake of a few moments of excitement you have destroyed Josh’s life and changed forever the life of his family and friends. 'That is a heavy burden for you to bear and that is punishment itself. I am acutely conscious no sentence I can pass can begin to ease the pain of this on those who have suffered and will continue to. 'I hope this terrible incident will cause other young people, other inexperienced drivers, to act with care in the future.' The teenager, of Colchester Essex, had been driving at an estimated 55mph, almost twice the 30mph speed limit, when he lost control of the Citroen Saxo VTR in Bromley Road, Colchester . Lock was also banned from driving for six years and must pass an extended test before he is allowed back behind the wheel. A victim impact statement from Mr and Mrs Irvine read to the court hailed Josh as 'a very special young man, kind, caring, sensitive, generous and thoughtful who touched everyone he met and made a lasting impression'. Judge Dodd added: 'He was plainly a fine young man of whom they were rightly very proud.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Irvine, of . Colchester, said: 'Even if the judge had passed a 100-year sentence I . would not be happy. 'You have been traumatised at the . realisation that for the sake of a few moments of excitement you have . destroyed Josh’s life and changed forever the life of his family and . friends' - Judge John Dodd, QC . 'Our lives ended that day. We’re just getting through day by day and today was a long time in coming - 588 days since the crash. 'Someone getting into a ""hot hatchback"" is like a bullet in the chamber ready to go off.' Mrs Irvine said: 'We would much rather our son be with us, and to new drivers I would say ""You are not invincible"".' Det Sgt Damon Bainbridge, of Essex Police, said: 'We hope that Michael Lock uses the opportunity he has now given behind bars to contemplate his actions and learn from his mistake. 'Lock underwent an intensive driving lesson course and after only a matter of days sat and passed his driving test. 'The young man’s parents then bought him a sporty car at some expense. This was foolish and we urge parents to consider the make, model and power of car they buy their children. 'These newly-qualified drivers should only be behind the wheel of vehicles which they can easily control. They have limited experience of being on the road and are in charge of what is a potentially lethal weapon.'","Michael Lock had passed his test a month before incident, court heard .

"A former SS soldier in a unit accused of massacring Poles and Jews during the Second World War lived in a London council flat for 66 years after the war. Serhij Woronyj, 89, worked as a printer and lived Bovingdon Close, Archway, until his death from a heart attack in March last year. During the war he served with the 31st Punitive Brigade, also known as the Ukrainian Self Defence Legion, which later became part of the 14th SS-Volunteer Division 'Galician'. Serhij Woronyj, 89, a former Nazi soldier in an SS brigade involved in the massacre of thousands of Jews and Poles during the Second World War, lived at this council house in Archway for 66 years . The SS division were involved in putting down the Warsaw Uprising in which more than 200,000 civilians and rebel fighters were massacred. Soldiers from the division were also involved in the destruction of Huta Pieniacka, a village in Poland which also served as a shelter for Jews, in which 1,000 people were killed. Troops also destroyed the village of Chlaniow in revenge for the shooting of an SS officer. According to witnesses soldiers went door to door, throwing grenades into buildings, setting houses on fire and gunning down civilians as they fled. One of Woronyj’s neighbours, who did not want to be named, said he was 'a big man who kept himself to himself'. Woronyj was captured by British forces in 1945  after the unit surrendered itself to the British at the end of the war, calling themselves the First Division of the Ukrainian National Army. They presented themselves as nationalists dedicated to the anti-Soviet cause and were accepted to settle in Britain with minimal checks for war crimes. Woronyk was eventually tracked down in Archway by private researcher Dr Stephen Ankier, who spoke to Mail Online about the unit's history. Based in Edgware, west London, Dr Ankier said: 'The battalion that Woronyj belonged to was originally formed late in 1943 to help the Germans fight Soviet and Polish partisans. Woronyj was part of the 14th SS-Volunteer Division 'Galician', who helped put down the Warsaw uprising in which hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed (pictured, Himmler inspects the division in 1944) 'However, it was not long before this SS-led unit was involved in committing executions and atrocities against Jews and Poles.' He added: 'During 1944 the battalion attacked and destroyed several Polish villages and killed many unarmed villagers, including women and children, at Edvardpole, Karczunek, Smoligow and Amerika. 'A section of the battalion was deployed to help suppress the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis.' Dr Ankier traced Woronyj after making dozens of trips to scour archives in Germany and Poland as well as travelling all over the UK. He made international headlines last year after he discovered one of the unit’s commanders, Michael Karkoc, living in Minnesota in the USA. German authorities are now considering if there is enough hard evidence to prosecute Karkoc and have him extradited from the USA. Woronyj worked as a printer until he died of a heart attack at Whittington hospital (pictured) last year . Woronyj’s council home is now occupied by a cousin who refused to comment on his relative's past. Dr Ankier added: 'Appalling atrocities on a massive scale were committed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Second World War. 'I believe that it is essential to find and document the truth about these terrible crimes as a way to pay homage to the victims’ memories and to inform new generations.'","Ukrainian-born Serhij Woronyj served with SS brigade in Second World War .

"The embattled founder and CEO of American Apparel has been ousted by the board of directors after spending years fighting sexual harassment allegations. The company's board voted unanimously Wednesday to replace Dov Charney as chairman and 'terminate his employment as president and CEO for cause,' a press release stated. Charney, 45, a native of Montreal, Canada, who first started American Apparel in 1991 as a wholesale business peddling T-shirts, had faced repeated accusations of sexual misconduct made by female employees, but all the cases have been either dismissed or settled. Scroll down for video . Ousted millionaire: Dov Charney, 45, has been fired as president and CEO of American Apparel for cause amid allegations of misconduct . Mad genius? Dov Charney, 45, a Canadian national, started American Apparel in 1991 as a humble wholesale T-shirt manufacturer . In 2011, four former American Apparel workers filed a lawsuit against Charney, but at the time the company came to his defense, claiming that the plaintiffs conspired to 'shake down' the fashion tycoon with an estimated net worth of $20million. In 2012, Mr Charney once again came under fire when Michael Bumblis, a former store manager in Malibu, California, accused the CEO of rubbing dirt in his face and choking him. Charney also allegedly called the man 'a wannabe Jew' and used a derogatory term for homosexuals. Bumblis was later fired from his job. American Apparel once again backed Charney, insisting that Bumblis' termination was in line with company policy. All the claims were either settled or dismissed. Under the terms of Charney's contract, he will be given 30 days before his termination is finalized. It is unclear what the alleged misconduct was. In the meantime, board members Allan Mayer and David Danziger have been appointed as co-chairmen. ‘We take no joy in this, but the Board felt it was the right thing to do,’ Mayer said in the statement obtained by Los Angeles Times. ‘Dov . Charney created American Apparel, but the Company has grown much larger . than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are . still ahead.’ Big business: American Apparel currently employs 10,000 employees and operates 249 retail stores in 20 countries . Courting controversy: The retailer has repeatedly come under fire for using young models dressed in sexy clothes to promote the brand . The board named chief financial officer John Luttrell as its interim CEO. Mayer, . who has served on the board since the company went public in 2007, said . the decision to fire Charney was prompted by an ongoing investigation . into alleged misconduct. A source told Chicago Tribune Wednesday . night that Charney was blindsided by the board's decision to dismiss . him and will likely 'fight like hell' to try and regain control of his . company. As . an edgy fashion brand catering to teens and 20-somethings, American Apparel . has drawn sharp criticism by using half-naked young women . to promote its products in ads. To this day, the company’s Tumblr account is filled with highly sexualized images of women frolicking in transparent tops, mixed in with Japanese Manga characters and pictures of pets. Explosive allegations: In 2011, Irene Morales (left) sued Dov Charney (right) accusing him of treated her as a 'sex slave' Weakened: Morales's claims were later  undermined by a trove of explicit pictures and messages she allegedly sent her boss . Legal victory: Two years ago, a New York judge tossed Morales' $260million lawsuit against Charney . Over the past decade, at least nine women have filed lawsuits against Charney accusing him of sexual harassment. In March 2012, the millionaire CEO scored a major victory when a judge in Brooklyn tossed a $260million suit filed by 21-year-old Irene Morales, who claimed that Charney held her as a sex slave in his Manhattan apartment and threatened to fire her if she refused to perform sex acts on him. Morales' claims had been severely undermined by explicit pictures and messages she sent to her boss, which were made public during the court case. Other cases against Charney followed roughly the same pattern, with some being thrown out in court and others being settled. Besides Charney's recurring legal problems, the brand has faced other challenges mainly stemming from its controversial approach to advertisement. The international retailer’s provocative campaigns have been known to feature female employees and even professional porn stars posing suggestively in little more than sexy lingerie. Charney, notorious for his hands-on management style, had photographed many of the ads himself. In May 2007, Oscar-winning director Woody Allen tried to sue American Apparel for $10million after the retailer used stills from the filmmaker's 1977 classic Annie Hall on billboards. The posters were removed eventually and Charney settled the case for $5million. Master of his domain: Dov Charney, then-chairman and chief executive officer of American Apparel Inc., stands for a portrait in a company retail store in New York in 2010 . Unexpected dismissal: Charney reportedly did not see his termination coming and will fight to regain control of American Apparel . American Apparel has built a large following thanks to its commitment to manufacturing its clothing in the . U.S. instead of outsourcing the work to other countries. The . company also prides itself on paying employees fair wages and providing . health insurance, which is uncommon in the garment industry. As of May 31, 2014, American Apparel had approximately 10,000 employees and operated 249 retail stores in 20 countries. But the retailer is facing an uncertain future after posting a net loss of $106.3million last year. As a teen growing up in Montreal, Canada, Dov Charney was obsessed with American culture. He has described his early envy of the choice available in America as compared to Canada in terms of how many 'hundred' different breakfast cereals teenagers south of the border could have. He adored the simple fashions of classic, bargain brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and began importing them and selling them to classmates while in High School. His early entrepreneurial spirit is evidenced by his claims to have sold 10,000 t-shirts while still a student, buying and transporting his stock himself in a rented U-Haul truck. Charney launched American Apparel in 1991 with a $10,000 loan from his father while still attending Tufts University. The company was originally conceived as a wholesale business manufacturing basic T-shirts, allegedly inspired by Charney's ex-girlfriend. By 1997, the humble sewing operation cranking out T-shirts has grown significantly, moving first to Charleston, South Carolina, and then to its now famous seven-story 800,000-square-foot Los Angeles factory. In 2003, American Apparel expanded into the retail market, with stores popping up from coast to coast and beyond. American Apparel has built a large fan base thanks to its commitment to manufacturing all its clothing in the U.S. instead of outsourcing the work to other countries. The company also prides itself on paying employees fair wages and providing health insurance, which is uncommon in the garment industry. Charney claimed to have the 'highest earning apparel workers in the world.' By 2005, Charney was looking at over $200million in annual revenue and in 2014, he had more than 260 stores worldwide, with revenue in excess of $500million. A year later, the prosperous business was sold for more than $380million to Endeavor Acquisition Corporation, but Dov Charney stayed on as president and CEO. Beginning in early 2000s, the fashion mogul has faced accusations of sexual misconduct, with as many as nine former employees suing Charney for alleged harassment. However, all the cases have been either dismissed or settled out of court. In 2009, things took a turn for the worse for American Apparel when the company found itself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, which was narrowly avoided thanks to an $80million loan. Six months later, American Apparel was forced to fire 1,800 workers after federal agents raided its factory and discovered that many employees were in the U.S. illegally. The once-thriving retailer continued struggling, and three years after American Apparel went public the New York Stock Exchange threatened to remove its listing because of delayed quarterly filings. In a bid to turn the company around, Dov Charney went on the offensive, closing several dozen stores, focusing on efficiency and harnessing the power of Groupon to sell clothes at a discount. The past two years have been a roller coaster ride for American Apparel, with strong quarters followed by losses and more bankruptcy talk. With Dov Charney’s firing, the company is once again looking at an uncertain future.                                                                                                                         Source: Business Insider .","Dov Charney, 45, will be replaced as chairman of American Apparel's board and terminated as president and CEO .

"Kayla R. Oxenham is alleged to have branded her two children, aged five and seven, with a burning stick so she could identify them as her own . A mother of two has been arrested and accused of branding her two children with a heated stick so she would know they were her own. Police said Kayla Oxenham, 23, used a lighter to set the stick on fire before pressing it against the children's bodies in order to mark them so she would know they were her own kids. The Port Charlotte, Florida, woman was taken to Charlotte County Jail after police discovered the alleged abuse following a tip-off from child welfare authorities. Aged only five and seven, the children told police their mother did it so she knew they were her children, and so they could have ice cream. Oxenham was taken to Charlotte County Jail on June 17. When spoken to by police, she denied the abuse had occurred. The Charlotte County Sherrif's Office website lists Oxenham as married and her profession as a medical assistant. NBC News reported the children told police their mother said she 'forgot how much she loved fire' when the branding took place. The children were taken for medical tests, where police discovered one of them had noticeable burn injuries. Oxenham was released on a $15,000 bond the following day.","Florida mother-of-two charged with child abuse for branding children .

"A pro-Russian militant waved a white flag today to signal the hand over of bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. The solider, was seen walking with a white flag near the village of Karlivka, near Donetsk, as they prepared to hand over the bodies of those who died in a downed Ukrainian military transport plane near Luhansk. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office had confirmed that 49 people were killed after separatists shot down the Ilyushin-76 transport plane as it was approaching an airport in Luhansk. It came as today the new president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced he will sign a controversial association agreement with the EU on 27 June. A pro-Russian militant walking with a white flag near the village of Karlivka, near Donetsk during the handover of bodies of Ukrainian soldiers . The solider, was seen near the village of Karlivka, near Donetsk, as the militants prepared to hand over the bodies of those who died in a downed Ukrainian military transport plane near Luhansk . Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's abandonment of the EU deal in November triggered protests, his removal and Russia's move into Crimea . The deal will establish free trade between the EU and Ukraine. Even as President Petro Poroshenko and his team prepared to unveil their blueprint for ending more than two months of rebellion, government forces, using artillery and heavy armour, said they were tightening the noose on separatists near Krasny Liman, north of the main regional hub of Donetsk. Government forces said the fighting erupted in the early hours after rebels refused to lay down their arms as part of Poroshenko's peace plan. The Ukrainian prosecutor's office had confirmed that 49 people were killed after separatists shot down the Ilyushin-76 transport plane as it was approaching an airport in Luhansk . A truck marked with a Red Cross and believed to transporting the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers passes a checkpoint in the village of Karlivka . Pro-Russian separatists transport empty coffins intended for bodies of dead fighters near the regional administration headquarters . Both Ukrainian government and rebel accounts of the fighting suggested a major battle involving armoured vehicles including tanks. One military source said 4,000 separatists were involved, while rebels sources in Donetsk said Ukrainian infantry supported by 20 tanks and many other armoured vehicles were storming the village of Yampil, about 12 km (7 miles) east of Krasny Liman. A top rebel commander, Igor Strelkov, reported 'heavy losses' in equipment and arms among the separatists, faced with a huge superiority in heavy armour on the government side at Yampil. 'We beat off the first attack and destroyed one tank. But it is difficult to take on 20 tanks. 'The battle is going on. Our people are holding but we can't rule out that they (government forces) will break through,' Strelkov, who is also known as Girkin, said in a videoed statement. He urged Moscow to 'take some measures'. Today the new president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced he will sign a controversial association agreement with the EU on 27 June . There was no word on casualties from the government side. From the nearby town of Siversk, artillery blasts, small arms fire and machinegun-fire could be heard from about 3 km away. From high ground, smoke could be seen billowing from rebel positions under attack. Poroshenko, installed as a president on June 7, is pushing a peace plan to end the rebellion which he said would be unveiled soon and presented to European Union ministers early next week. It includes an offer of a unilateral ceasefire by government forces and amnesty for the separatists - but only if they lay down their weapons. A government forces spokesman said on Thursday that it was when rebels refused a call to disarm - made in leaflets fired by big guns into rebel positions - that fighting broke out in the early hours of the morning. 'We issued an ultimatum to the terrorists overnight to surrender their weapons. We guarantee their safety and investigation in line with Ukrainian law ... They refused,' said government forces spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov. 'Now we are trying to narrow the encirclement. They are trying to break out,' Seleznyov said.Separatist rebellions erupted in eastern Ukraine in early April after street protests in Kiev toppled the Moscow-backed leader Viktor Yanukovich and Russia in turn annexed the Crimean peninsula. Eastern rebels have called for union with Russia. Pro-Russian separatists stand guard at a check-point as a car drives past outside Luhansk . Ukrainian troops and pro-Russian separatists were locked in fierce fighting in the east of Ukraine today . The violence has cost the lives of 147 Ukrainian soldiers and wounded 267 up to now, the defence ministry said on Wednesday. Many scores of separatist militia, civilians and members of other military bodies such as the national guard have also been killed and the overall death toll is much higher. Kiev has accused Russia of fomenting the unrest and of allowing volunteer fighters from Russia to cross into Ukraine to support the rebels. This is denied by Moscow, which has been urging Poroshenko to end 'punitive action' against the rebels. The United States and its Western allies largely share Ukraine's view. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden assured Poroshenko late on Wednesday there would be 'further costs on Russia' unless it used its influence to stop the separatist violence, the White House said. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen meanwhile sounded a new alarm about Russia's possible intentions, saying that at least a few thousand more Russian troops were now on Ukraine's long eastern border. 'I consider this a very regrettable step backwards. It seems Russia keeps the option open to intervene further in Ukraine,' he said in London. 'The international community would have to respond in a firm manner if Russia were to intervene further in Ukraine.' In Kiev, Poroshenko received a boost when parliament resoundingly endorsed his nominations for three key posts including that of foreign minister. Speaking to journalists later, he said he himself would sign an association agreement with the European Union on June 27 which will decisively shift Ukraine away from Russia's influence and rule it out from joining a Moscow-led customs union. Rebels rejected a call to lay down their arms in line with a peace plan proposed by President Petro Poroshenko, government forces said . Heavy fighting broke out at around 4 a.m. (0100 GMT) near the town of Krasny Liman, which itself has been under government control since early this month . It was Yanukovich's sudden refusal last November to sign that pact and upgrade relations with Moscow that precipated his own ousting and Russia's annexing of Crimea, and sparked the worst crisis in Russia-West relations since the Cold War. But Poroshenko knows he has to impress the West with his intentions of reaching a peaceful settlement to the eastern crisis by using minimum force. He said his new foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, would unveil his peace plan for the east on June 23 at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. Ukrainian forces, which lost 49 servicemen on June 14 when separatists brought down a military helicopter in Luhansk region, have been gradually tightening their encirclement of rebel positions to the south and east of Krasny Liman including the rebel stronghold of Slaviansk. Olesya, a woman in Yampil, said Ukrainian forces had entered the village in armoured vehicles bearing the Ukrainian flag. 'There was fighting all night. Mines were flying over our heads. Planes flew over and we could hear heavy weapons. It's awful what is going on here,' she said. Sergei, a 45-year-old who was leaving the village of Zakitne by scooter, said people had been sheltering in cellars for days and his wife had already left because there was no food, electricity or gas. He was now leaving because 'there are homes on fire and dead people on the streets'. 'There is an ongoing active phase of the ATO (anti-terrorist operation) in the region of Krasny Liman,' said government forces spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov .","Seen walking with a white flag near the village of Karlivka, near Donetsk .

"Actor Harrison Ford is said to be 'doing well' after his publicist . confirmed he broke his left leg while filming the latest Star Wars movie . The injury sustained by actor Harrison Ford on set of the latest Star Wars movie was a broken left leg, it emerged today. The 71-year-old is said to be 'doing well' after undergoing surgery for the injury, which took place after he was crushed by the Star Wars spacecraft Millennium Falcon. The actor, who was filming Star Wars: Episode VII at the time, was originally thought to have damaged his ankle during the mishap at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire earlier this month. But a spokesman for the star has now confirmed the injury was a broken leg. Although she did not give any further details of the accident, she said the actor was due to start rehabilitation soon and was looking forward to returning to work. Ford, who is returning to his role as Han Solo in the latest film, was working in the UK on the series when the accident unfolded. The actor, also known for his appearances in Indiana Jones, had to be airlifted to the trauma unit at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford after a hydraulic door fell on him. His publicist said today: 'Harrison . Ford's left leg was broken in an accident. 'His surgery was successful . and he will begin rehab shortly. He's doing well and looks forward to . returning to work.' Police said the crush involved a garage door, but it is believed the accident involved the door . of the Millennium Falcon. Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred. There were also fears the actor may . also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis but this has not been confirmed. After the incident, his son Ben said that film crews might need to rearrange scenes to only show the actor from the waist up, due to the injury. His wife Calista Flockhart, best known . for her starring role in sitcom Ally McBeal, flew . from the US to be at her husband’s bedside. The accident took place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, . pictured, while the 71-year-old was filming Star Wars: Episode VII in . which he plays Han Solo . Disney, which owns Lucasfilm the company behind Star Wars, said after the incident that shooting would continue as planned while the star recovered. After the incident, a source told The Mirror: 'The initial . day or two after the accident it was hard to move things around but now . we have had more time we can juggle things, bring some scenes forward . and push others back. 'There are lots of other actors in the movie so it is not a disaster. We are confident the film can stay on schedule.' The actor, who also played Indiana Jones, was crushed on the set when a hydraulic door - believed to be from the spacecraft the Millennium Falcon - fell down and hit him . The £200million movie, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, has been earmarked for release in December next year, after filming began in Abu Dhabi in mid-May. Carrie .

"A 16-year-old girl accused of helping her friend murder a man in a street attack has been cleared of killing him. The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was also found not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter by a jury at Bristol Crown Court. She had been accused of murdering Mark Roberts, 35, who was attacked as he walked home alone following a night out with friends in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset in October last year. Victim: A teenage girl has been cleared of helping her friend murder Mark Roberts, 35, (left) in a street attack. Ryan Sheppard, 18, (right) had previously admitted the murder of Mr Roberts and will be sentenced next month . Ryan Sheppard, 18, of Weston super Mare, had previously admitted the murder of Mr Roberts and will be sentenced next month. Jurors in the teenage girl’s trial heard that Mr Roberts was left lying unconscious in a pool of blood following the 'ugly and sustained attack'. Residents called paramedics and Mr Roberts, who suffered a cardiac arrest, was taken to Weston General Hospital, where he died 36 hours later. The court was told that Mr Roberts's cause of death was the combined effect of blunt force impacts to the head and face together with heavy consumption of alcohol.' Forensic scientists also found bruising and a partial shoeprint - matching footwear recovered from Sheppard - on Mr Roberts’s forehead. Scene: Mr Roberts was attacked as he walked home alone following a night out with friends in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset in October last year . Mr Roberts’s blood was found on Sheppard’s clothing, on his trainer and elbow and also on the cuff of a coat worn by the girl that evening. She claimed blood on her cuff was due to Sheppard telling her to wipe his shoe, the jury heard. The girl, from Bristol, had been accused of attacking Mr Roberts and then using her mobile phone to film Sheppard beating him to death. After her arrest, the girl initially refused to comment but later provided a statement to police denying any involvement in the attack. 'Ryan hit him in the jaw,' the girl’s statement said. 'I tried pulling Ryan off but I couldn’t. Ryan started banging Mark’s head on the floor and punching him to the body and face. Court: The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was also found not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter by a jury at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) 'Ryan stopped, he told me to video it. I was scared of Ryan so I did because I didn’t want him to do something like that to me. 'I filmed for a minute and a half, Ryan hitting Mark on the floor saying aggressive things to him. Mark was saying and doing nothing.' The court heard that the video clip was later deleted and police have never been able to recover it. The girl, who was 15 at the time of the attack, did not give evidence in her defence during the trial. An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: 'Over the past two weeks the jury has listened to the evidence in this case and after deliberating have found this young woman not guilty. 'We respect the decision reached by the jury and we’ll now start preparing for the sentencing of Ryan Sheppard, who has already pleaded guilty to the murder of Mark.'","Girl, 16, cleared of murdering Mark Roberts, 35, who died last October .

"With the summer sales in full swing, you would have thought the department stores would be desperate to encourage us to shop till we drop. But one luxury chain has taken a rather different approach – warning customers that carrying too many shopping bags could be a health risk. Harvey Nichols has teamed up with TV doctor Rosemary Leonard to tell shoppers they risk pulled muscles, neck strains – even fainting – if they don’t balance their bags correctly or overload themselves with too many bargains. Shopping, darling: Absolutely Fabulous stars Edina, played by Jennifer Saunders, and Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley are serial shoppers and fans of Harvey Nichols in the BBC sitcom . The store . is very precise in its medical advice, telling customers that when they . have enough bags to stretch 11in along their arms, they should stop . shopping. It has even issued arm bands to help them mark the cut-off . point. Meanwhile . bargain-hunters intent on a massive shopping spree are advised to order . online so they can have the bags delivered straight to their front . door. Dr . Leonard, who is BBC Breakfast’s resident doctor and a part-time GP, . said: ‘It might sound silly but carrying numerous bags can put untold . physical pressure on a shopper’s body. ‘Restriction of blood flow is common, . which means people can experience tingling of the fingers and in more . extreme cases numbness and even fainting. I often refer to this . condition as “high bag pressure”. The new arm band, issued by Harvey Nichols, which shows when customers are carrying too many bags . 'Other symptoms an overburdened shopper . could suffer include pulled muscles plus neck and wrist strain. As a GP . I see more cases of shopping-related stress injuries when the economy . is booming. ‘The best thing to do on a spree is to carry a few bags on each arm to balance the load.’ A . spokesman for Harvey Nichols, whose sales started this week, said: . ‘It’s not in our interests to have customers shop until they drop. ‘For . those wanting to make multiple purchases – and concerned about carrying . a heavy load – we would advise using our website and let our delivery . drivers take the strain.’ A spokesman for Harvey Nichols, whose flagship store in Knightsbridge, London is pictured, said: 'It's not in our interests to have customers shop until they drop' But it’s not just bulging shopping bags that are causing concern among doctors. Previously, the British Osteopathic Association revealed that four in ten women have suffered discomfort in  their neck, back or shoulders from regularly carrying a heavy handbag. Apparently it hasn’t put off savvy shoppers. Research has revealed how women walk up to 154 miles a year hunting for bargains – the equivalent of trekking from London to Nottingham. The Debenhams poll of 2,000 women revealed the average woman covers 2.96 miles on a shopping trip and spends around 2.5 hours browsing in stores every week. In contrast, men spend just an average 50 minutes and cover just 1.5 miles per week. Women also burn around five calories for every minute spent shopping – almost 48,000 per year – according to a separate poll.","Harvey Nichols have warned carrying too many bags could be a health risk .

"Yale scientists have successfully used an arthritis medication to fully regrow the head and body hair of a almost totally hairless 25-year-old man. Researchers administered the drug tofacitinib citrate to the unnamed patient, who suffered from the autoimmune baldness disease alopecia universalis. Within eight months, the man had regrown scalp and facial hair he'd not had in seven years. 'The results are exactly what we hoped for,' said Brett A. King, M.D., senior author of the paper, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. 'This is a huge step forward in the treatment of patients with this condition.' Unbelievable: Yale University researchers correctly guessed that a rheumatoid arthritis drug called Xeljanz could successfully regrow hair in a patient with the autoimmune disease alopecia universalis, which causes hairlessness over the whole body. This 25-year-old took the drug and by the end of eight months had all the hair back on his head, body and face that he hadn't had in years . Huge success: The drug had successfully been used before on plaque psoriasis, which the 25-year-old Yale patient also exhibited, but had never been used to treat alopecia in humans . The man was referred to Yale Dermatology in New Haven, Connecticut to deal with an autoimmune disease that coincided with his alopecia, plaque psoriasis, according to a department news release. Believing both his ailments could be alleviated with the same drug, researchers administered tofacitinib, made by Pfizer under the brand name Xeljanz, which is already FDA approved for the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis. According to Science World Report, the drug had successfully been used to treat psoriasis in people and alopecia in mice. But the results were nonetheless shocking. Photos of the man show him go from totally bald on top of his head to sporting a lustrous mane of blond locks. Alopecia is a hair-loss disease that affects, men, women and children. The onset is often sudden, random and frequently recurrent. Although the disease does not damage a person's physical health, it can have severe effects on quality of life and emotional health through its impact on confidence and self-esteem. Alopecia affects around 1.7 per cent of the population, with men and women equally affected. About 25 per cent of people affected have a family history of the condition. The exact cause of alopecia is not known, although experts generally agree it is a disease of the immune system. There is believed to be a genetic component and in some cases it is linked to stress. In alopecia, the immune system attacks the affected hair follicles by mistake. That halts hair growth and causes hairs to abruptly shed. There are several different types of alopecia, ranging in severity. Alopecia Universalis is the total loss of hair across the body, while Alopecia Totalis is loss of hair on the head alone. The vast degree of sufferers will experience some re-growth, some complete re-growth. 'There are no good options for long-term treatment of alopecia universalis,' said King. 'The best available science suggested this might work, and it has.' The patient took 10mg per day for two months followed by 15mg per day for another three months. By the end, he'd completely regrown scalp hair, developed eyebrows, eyelashes and facial hair, armpit hair and other hair. 'By eight months there was full regrowth of hair,' said co-author Brittany G. Craiglow, M.D. 'The patient has reported feeling no side effects, and we've seen no lab test abnormalities, either.' According to King, scientists believe the drug works by turning off the immune attack on hair follicles. The authors said the drug helps in some but not all instances of psoriasis.","The 25-year-old unnamed patient suffered from near total head and body hairlessness due to the disease alopecia universalis .

"'Dog killer': Baltimore police officer Jeffrey Bulger, 49, was booked Wednesday on charges after slitting the throat of a dog in police custody . A second Baltimore police officer has been suspended in a shocking case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. The Baltimore Sun reports officer Thomas Schmidt has been placed on a paid administrative leave along with fellow officer Jeffrey Bolger who has been charged with animal cruelty. The pair allegedly held down and cut the throat of a Shar-Pei, with officials saying there was no reason to kill the dog if it was already restrained. Schmidt is a 24-year veteran of the Special Operations Section, serving alongside Bolger who was hired in 1992. The union did not provide information regarding the terms of Schmidt's suspension. The alleged attack happened on Saturday morning in Brewers Hill, a south-eastern district of the city, after police responded to a report of a woman being bitten. Deputy Commissioner Dean Palmere said officers gained control of the animal, a seven-year-old Chinese Shar-Pei, with a dog pole and an officer used a knife to cut the dog's throat. Late last night, Detective Jeremy Silbert issued a statement identifying that policeman as Bolger. Announcing that internal affairs were investigating the killing, Mr Palmere called the incident 'outrageous and unacceptable'. Witnesses told police that as Bolger got out of his vehicle, he said: 'I'm going to f****** gut this thing.' He waited until colleagues got control of the dog before bending down and slashing its throat with a knife, witnesses said. It bled to death before animal control arrived, police told the Baltimore Sun. The dog was initially thought to be a stray, but later was determined to have escaped from its home. Its owner says her pet, called Nala, was not vicious but just lost and scared. Another case: A Baltimore police officer was suspended in a case in which he and another cop allegedly slit a dog's throat. Owner Sarah Gossard said her dog Nala, pictured, went missing and she had been trying to track the Shar-Pei down . 'I never thought in a million years the police would show up and cut my dog’s throat,' Sarah Gossard told CBS Baltimore. Miss Gossard had posted pictures of Nala online after the dog had gone missing. It is understood that the woman who was bitten had been trying to read the dogs tags, which were engraved with an address and phone number. 'She went missing Saturday and after looking for her all day, I found out through a neighbour that she was put down,' Miss Gossard told CNN. 'Police never contacted me until today. Only after did I find out more details. I learned from the news that she was stabbed in the throat. I want justice.' A woman who's hand was bitten by Nala was attempting to read the dog's tags which contained her home address . Shar-Pei's are a fighting breed originally used as palace guards in China. The protective and loyal dogs take well to training and are easily socialised but can be stubborn. Largely silent, they only bark when playing or worried. Bolger has been suspended without pay. Police are investigating why Bolger's colleagues didn't report the incident until Monday - two days later. Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told a news conference: 'We have no words to describe this. To say that we’re appalled at the allegations I think is an understatement.' Mr Palemere told reporters: 'This is an outrageous and unacceptable breach of our protocol. The BPD does not condone and will not condone such actions.'","Baltimore Police Officers Thomas Schmidt and Jeffrey Bolger are accused of slitting a Shar-Pei's throat .

"A young pilot and his father had a lucky escape when they were forced to crash land in a wheat field in East Yorkshire. The 18-year-old man encountered low-lying cloud after taking off from Beverly Airfield and made a ‘precautionary landing’ in the wheat.

"A building owner evicted a pastor and his worshipers from their church because of their fondness for handling venomous snakes while praying and dancing. Clyde Daugherty, who . built the LaFollette, Tennessee-based church in 1994, rented the building . to Andrew Hamblin for just $267 a month but eventually became fed up with all the serpents slithering about and occasionally injuring or killing congregants. 'Too many people were getting hurt and . dying, and that's a proven fact,' Mr Daugherty told 10News. 'He was focused too . much on the wrong things, like attention from the media and the TV show, . instead of the word of God.' Scroll down for video . Andrew Hamblin, the pastor of Tabernacle Church of God in LaFollette, Tennessee, was evicted from his church by the building's owner because of his snake-handling ways . Mr Daugherty said he had offered to sell the . church, trailers and surrounding property to Mr Hamblin for $66,000, but . the pastor declined and is now looking for a new building. Mr Hamblin's Pentecostal church practices a rare, century-old Christian . tradition of worshiping God with venomous snakes such as timber . rattlers, cottonmouths and copperheads, according to Urban Christian . News. The 22-year-old plays mandolin, loves zombie movies, receives food . stamps, has five children and was the star of a 16-episode National . Geographic reality series called Snake Salvation, which featured . Appalachia's serpent-handling churches. About 125 such churches exist in the U.S. Pastors use the snakes to show non-Christians that God protects them from harm, holding them aloft as they pray, sing and dance. The belief stems from a literal reading of Jesus' words in the Gospel of Mark: 'And these signs will accompany . those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak . in new tongues; they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any . deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the . sick, and they will recover.' The name Andrew Hamblin was removed from a sign for the Tabernacle Church of God . Mr Hamblin, who said he has been bitten . by poisonous snake many times, made headlines last fall after . authorities seized more than 50 venomous serpents in his possession. A . grand jury ultimately didn't indict him after his court appearances drew . large crowds of supporters. Mr Hamblin's mentor, fellow reality TV star and snake-wielding pastor Jamie Coots, died in February after being bitten at his church in Middlesboro, Kentucky.

"President Obama is encouraging more employers to adopt family-friendly policies by hosting a daylong summit Monday, even though the U.S. government doesn't always set the best example. The United States is the only industrialized nation that doesn't mandate paid leave for mothers of newborns, although Obama says he'd like to see that change. 'Only three countries in the world report that they don't offer paid maternity leave and the United States is one of them,' Obama said in his weekly address. Scroll down for video . President Obama pictured speaking at the White House Summit on Working Families in Washington today . 'It's time to change that. A few states . have acted on their own to give workers paid family leave, but this . should be available to everyone, because all Americans should be able to . afford to care for a family member in need.' Obama's summit comes in a midterm election year focused in many respects on women voters, and the White House was devoting all its star power to the event and even a surprise appearance by a celebrity to echo Obama's criticism of Mad Men policies in today's workplace. Christina Hendricks, who plays single mom Joan on the AMC drama that takes place at a 1960s ad firm, said, 'In the 21st Century the only place for a story like Joan's should be on TV.' Obama planned to speak midday and have a meeting with business leaders. First lady Michelle Obama planned to deliver a closing speech, while Vice President Joe Biden opened the event by talking about the value of family time. 'Not all of us have the kind of flexibility that I have,' Biden said. Mad Men star Christina Hendricks, said, 'In the 21st Century the only place for a story like Joan's should be on TV' (seen today at the summit) Should Obama create a maternity pay system funded by taxpayers? California, Rhode Island and New Jersey have a system of paid leave, but it's unclear how Obama would fund a national system. Obama has not endorsed legislation that would create one funded by a payroll tax, and he pledged in his 2008 presidential campaign not to raise taxes on families making under $250,000 a year. Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett said in a conference call with reporters Sunday that the president is trying to start a national conversation to explore the issue. 'Cost is an issue for any federal . program and we need to make sure we do this in a way where we are not . raising taxes on middle-class families,' she said. 'But . we also know what a good investment in our workforce it would be if . they had paid leave, and that investment will pay great returns.' While . some companies offer paid family leave to attract workers, the 1993 . Family Medical Leave Act only requires that employers provide unpaid . leave for medical and family reasons. Jill Biden kisses her husband, Vice President Joe Biden, as she introduces him at The White House Summit on Working Families on Monday . When Obama came to the White House, he instituted six weeks of paid leave for his workers when they have a child, get sick or injured or need to care for an ailing family member, using his authority to set his staff's compensation under the personnel code. He does not have the power to award paid leave to other federal workers without congressional action since they are covered under a different section of law. The White House has supported the goal of legislation introduced by lawmakers to change that, but it has yet to get through Congress. Obama said in an interview broadcast Monday on CNN's New Day that he took a month off when his older daughter, Malia, was born. He called it 'one of the most precious memories that I'll ever have' and said the middle-of-the-night feedings created an irreplaceable bond. 'We have unpaid family leave right now but for a whole lot of families it means they can't use it because they just can't afford it,' he said. 'A few states . have acted on their own to give workers paid family leave, but this . should be available to everyone, because all Americans should be able to . afford to care for a family member in need' - President Obama . Despite the paid leave for White House staff, the challenges of balancing parenting and working still remain evident there. The president's top aides include several dads of minor children but hardly any mothers with school-age kids — National Security Adviser Susan Rice being one prominent exception. 'It is a very challenging and demanding environment' for parents, Jarrett said at a media availability hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. 'And I think part of what we have to achieve here is to make it easier — that doesn't mean it's going to be easy — it's just going to be easier. And I think that's what the private sector acknowledges.' The summit being held at Washington's Omni Hotel will highlight businesses with family-friendly benefits to hold up as best practices. Obama says child care and flexible work schedules also are vital benefits. Actress Christina Hendricks spoke at The White House Summit on Working Families at a hotel in Washington . Executives representing Gap Inc., PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Johnson and Johnson, Goldman Sachs, Shake Shack, Cisco Systems and Intel Corp. are participating in panel discussions at the summit.

"American fans saw the cruel side of the beautiful game on Sunday night when the U.S. team lost at the death to Portugal - but the World Cup dream is not over yet. Team USA were 2-1 up during a sweltering game in Manaus on Sunday night before Portugal's Silvestre Varela's goal in the last 30 seconds of stoppage time denied them entry to the final 16. Only two teams will survive from Group G, known as the 'group of death', out of the U.S., Portugal, Germany and Ghana. The United States now has four points in Group G, the same as Germany. They face each other in Recife on Thursday while Portugal face Ghana on the same day in Brasilia. Scroll down for video .

U.S fans watch as the Portuguese team scores a last-minute 2-2 equalizer in the World Cup 2014 preliminary round group G match in Manaus, Brazil, between the USA and Portugal in Grant Park in Chicago . The top two teams will go forward to the next stage. Both Ghana and Portugal lag behind with one point each. Winning a World Cup game results in three points while a draw is one point. Team USA will enter the next round with the following results. If the U.S. win or draw against Germany, they will enter the final 16. A win against Germany places the U.S. at the top of the group meaning they will place the second placed team from group H (Belgium, Algeria, Russia and South Korea). If the U.S. and Germany draw, then the . latter takes top position in the group. The result of the Portugal vs . Ghana game has nothing to do with it. The World Cup Group G table.

In . goal difference, the U.S. is one up, Ghana in one down and Portugal is . minus four. If the U.S. loses, then the result they want is a Portugal . win, as they are less likely to make up the goal difference. If the U.S. loses on Thursday and Ghana wins, the latter will qualify if either game is won by two clear goals. For example, if the U.S. loses 1-0, then Ghana would need to win 2-1 to go through on goal difference. It is a nail-biting wait for U.S. fans who were seconds from watching their team walk off with their first come-from-behind win at a World Cup.

"A tractor spotted travelling along a busy motorway at 10mph was seized by police after they discovered the driver had no insurance. The large red Case tractor was stopped between junctions 5 and 6 on the southbound carriageway of the M6 near Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham.

A tractor spotted travelling along a busy motorway at 10mph was seized by police after they discovered the driver had no insurance . Inspector Mark Watkins said: 'To see such a vehicle travelling on such a busy stretch of road was both unusual and quite a surprise for the patrol officers. 'Tractors are one of the various prohibited vehicles on the motorway network - a fact that the driver seemed to be unaware of. 'We received a few calls into us at around the time that we stopped the tractor from concerned motorists who were both shocked and worried that the slow nature of the tractor could create a hazard to other road users.

"Dressed in blue, the disabled boy lies listlessly on the pavement in Mumbai, his ankle tethered with rope to a bus stop. Following its release last month, the picture of nine-year-old Lakhan Kale captured hearts across the world. Now, Lakhan's grandmother has revealed the heartbreaking truth behind the youngster's plight. Heartbreaking: Lakhan Kale is pictured lying listlessly on the pavement in Mumbai, his ankle tethered with rope to a pole of a bus stop. The nine-year-old cannot speak or hear and suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy . Sakubai Kale, who is in her 70s, spent years living in poverty on the dirty stretch of pavement with her grandson, who cannot hear or speak and suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Speaking to CNN, she explained how she became Lakhan's sole carer after his father died four years ago, his mother left and his older sister ran away. She said she had tried to earn a small living for the pair by selling toys, flower garlands and trinkets on Chowpatty, a renowned beachfront in the heart of the Indian city. At these times, Sakubai said she had had 'no choice' but to tie Lakhan to the red-coloured poles of bus stop 58, which is shaded by the hanging roots of a banyan tree. Carer: Lakhan's grandmother Sakubai Kale (pictured with Lakhan) has revealed the heartbreaking truth behind the youngster's plight. The pensioner spent years living on the dirty stretch of pavement with her grandson . Left alone: Speaking to CNN, Subakai explained how she became Lakhan's sole carer after his father died four years ago, his mother left and his older sister ran away. Above, Lakhan is pictured tied up to the bus stop . 'He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming. If he ran on to the road, he would get killed,' said the pensioner, who still lives on the pavement, surviving off food she buys from a vendor. At night, she said she would tie Lakhan to her own leg so she would know if he tried to walk away. Speaking through tears, Sakubai told of how her grandson's disabilities had emerged after he developed a fever at just a few months old. 'One night, he shook violently,' she said. 'He . was never the same again.' Family: The pensioner said she had 'no choice' but to tie up Lakhan while she was away due to his disabilities . She said she had finally made the decision to tie up Lakhan for his own safety, using a 'long' cloth rope which would not damage his ankle. Although thousands of pedestrians strolled past Lakhan unwittingly, a photograph of him tied up eventually appeared in a local newspaper last month. It sparked concern among charities and the police - with activists claiming he was just one of many disabled people in India facing daily stigma and a lack of facilities to assist them. At the time, Sakubai defended her actions, saying: 'What else can I do? He can't talk, so how will he tell anyone if he gets lost?' Sparking concern: Although thousands of pedestrians strolled past Lakhan unwittingly, a photograph of him tied up eventually appeared in a local newspaper last month. It sparked concern among charities and police . Disabled: Lakhan, who was tied up using a 'long' cloth rope, is pictured strolling along the dirty stretch of pavement where he was raised. He is now being looked after at a state-run institution in south Mumbai . Following the picture's release, social worker Meena Mutha placed Lakhan in a state-run institution in south Mumbai at the request of a local police constable. As the youngster was led away, his grandmother bid him a tearful goodbye, but said she was 'happy' he was going to be looked after. Sakubai added that she was hopeful she would get to see Lakahan regularly once she acquired an . official identity card that would allow her to visit the centre. Although the institution Lakhan is currently residing at takes in a range of needy children, Ms Mutha said it failed to cater specifically for those with special needs. She said she wants to find Lakhan more of a 'home', but that there is a serious shortage of suitable facilities in Mumbai. 'Residential homes are very, very few. There's a major need for the government to do something, a social responsibility to provide residential centres for children like Lakhan,’ she said. In February, a long-awaited bill was introduced into the Indian parliament aiming to give disabled people equal rights, including access to education, employment and legal redress against discrimination. However, the bill is yet to be passed.","Lakhan Kale, nine, was pictured tethered to bus stop in Mumbai last month .

"A teenage boy claims he has managed to capture a ‘guardian ghost’ on his phone at a Great War cemetery in France. Mitch Glover, 14, from Leamington Spa, was visiting the Neuville-St Vaast German war cemetery near Arras, in northern France, during a school trip when he took a photograph of the ‘ghost’. Not until after the school boy came home, did he notice the eerie figure in one of his pictures, which he says looks like a man wearing the uniform of a Scottish regiment. Can you spot the ghost? MItch Glover, 14, took this image of the Neuville-St Vaast German war cemetery near Arras, in northern France . Mitch was visiting France on a school . trip when he snapped several iPhone pictures in quick succession of the . war cemetery near Arras, scene of bloody battles of World War I, nearly a . hundred years ago.

"A new report has blasted three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky on child abuse charges. The report compiled by former federal prosecutor Geofrrey Moulton and released by the Pennsylvania attorney general's office said that poor decisions made in 2009 led to the 'serial child molester' escaping justice. The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward. Scroll down for video . Not caught soon enough: Jerry Sandusky in Greene Sate Prison where is serving life in jail for sexually molesting 10 boys over 15-years . Jail time: Jerry Sandusky, center, is escorted from his sentencing at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte on Tuesday, October 9, 2012 . However, it still took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because veteran prosecutor Jonelle Eshbach was overruled from arresting her because her supervisors believed that the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'. The report, commissioned by Attorney General Kathleen Kane and written by former federal prosecutor Geoff Moulton, blamed a three-year time lapse in filing charges on communication problems, an expungement of a 1998 complaint about the former Penn State coach and a failure to take certain investigative steps early on. 'The facts show an inexcusable lack of urgency in charging and stopping a serial sexual predator,' said Kane, a Democrat who had vowed to conduct a review of the investigation while running for office. 'The report documents that more investigative work took place in just one month in 2011 than in all of either 2009 or 2010.' Then-Attorney General Tom Corbett, a Republican, was in the midst of his successful 2010 gubernatorial campaign during the Sandusky investigation. Moulton said his review, including internal emails by state prosecutors, 'revealed no direct evidence that electoral politics influenced any important decision made in the Sandusky investigation.' Guilty: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, walks with his wife Dottie Sandusky into the Centre County Courthouse, on June 22, 2012 in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . As a candidate in 2012, Kane said Corbett may have had a political motive to slow down the investigation, an assertion Corbett denied. The arrest of Sandusky led to the firing of longtime Penn State coach Joe Paterno while Corbett was serving as a university trustee; Penn State alumni and fans have objected to how Paterno was treated. Corbett spokesman Jay Pagni said Monday that the investigation was conducted with the victims at the forefront. 'It was a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and in the end a child predator can no longer victimize anyone,' Pagni said. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving decades in prison sentence. The report said the lead prosecutor at the time, Jonelle Eshbach, hectored her bosses about the case during a stretch in 2010 when the probe was largely dormant. Eshbach drafted a grand jury report in March 2010 based on the claims of a lone victim, but she spent much of the ensuing months — as Corbett won the primary — trying to get approval for the report. Sacked: Joe Paterno arrives home after being fired in the aftermath of child sex-abuse charges against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky . 'In the interim, no witnesses were interviewed, no witnesses testified in the grand jury and no grand jury subpoenas were issued,' Moulton wrote. He said the basis for that decision was that one accuser's testimony wouldn't be enough to convict Sandusky and an acquittal would make it harder to file more charges later. According to the report, prosecutors told Moulton they waited until 2011 to search Sandusky's home computer and subpoena child protective services records because they 'believed that they were unlikely to be productive and would have risked publicly revealing the existence of the investigation.' Two days after Corbett was elected governor in November 2010, the Centre County prosecutor received an anonymous tip directing investigators to assistant football coach Mike McQueary, whose testimony would eventually help convict Sandusky. The investigation picked up steam after that, and authorities subpoenaed key figures at Penn State, including Paterno, vice president Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley. Additional victims were identified, and on June 21, 2011, Sandusky's home was searched, producing photos and typewritten lists of children who participated in events at Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, with some names highlighted. Special Deputy Attorney General H. Geoffery Moulton Jr. speaks at a news conference as Pennsylvania state Attorney General Kathleen Kane, left, listens, as the results are released of a probe into the Jerry Sandusky child molestation investigation on Monday, June 23 . Pennsylvania Attorney Gen. Kathleen Kane: Kane has released a report with new details on how police and prosecutors handled the Jerry Sandusky child molestation investigation . Cleared: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett talks to reporters in March 2014 - before the publication of the damning report into the prosecution of Jerry Sandusky . More resources early on, including additional investigators, may not have speeded up the case, Moulton said, because the best leads in 2010 and early 2011 were not related to how many detectives were devoted to the matter. He said decisions not to bring charges based solely on one accuser or, in June 2011, after three more witnesses had testified before a grand jury, 'fit within acceptable bounds of prosecutorial discretion.' Moulton noted that if authorities had put together a broad-based team early on, it's possible someone may have known about or turned up a 1998 police investigation of Sandusky prompted by a mother's complaint that the coach had showered with her son. That report had been expunged, one reason for the lengthy investigation, he said. Corbett said 'electoral politics did not enter his thinking in any way,' Moulton wrote, concluding the campaign donations Corbett received from people associated with The Second Mile do not appear to have affected the investigation. The report does not go into depth about actions at Penn State, where three former administrators await trial on charges they participated in a criminal cover-up of complaints about Sandusky. The university eventually accepted a set of penalties from the NCAA over its handling of the matter, including a four-year bowl ban, a temporary reduction in football scholarships, the loss of 112 wins from Paterno's later years and a $60 million fine.","Review of the child sex abuse case against Jerry Sandusky released on Monday found three years of delays in prosecuting the former Penn State football coach .

"San Francisco's city attorney issued a cease-and-desist demand to a mobile app which allows drivers who are fed up having to circle around trying find a parking space to purchase a spot from someone who is already parked in one. In a letter to Monkey App, city attorney Dennis Herrera cited a provision in San Francisco's police code that prohibits people and companies from buying, selling or leasing public on-street parking and mandates fees of up to $300 for drivers who violate the law. Herrera's warning to Monkey Parking is the latest attempt by city government officials and state lawmakers nationwide trying to figure out how to regulate Web-based businesses that offer shared parking, transportation and housing services using mobile applications. A new app for San Francisco drivers called 'Monkey Parking' lets them buy a parking spot from another motorist already in a space . Among the more popular ridesharing services are Uber and Lyft, and popular housing apps include Airbnb. The Monkey Parking app allows drivers to get an often elusive parking spot and sell it for $5, $10, even $20, and then wait until the buyer arrives to take their place. Herrera has given its creators until July 11 to shut down operations in San Francisco or possibly face a lawsuit under California's Unfair Competition Law. Herrera added that besides the violations, Monkey Parking's app encourages drivers to unsafely use their mobile devices and engage in online parking bidding wars while behind the wheel. Dobrowolny said in an email Monday that he is talking with his legal staff and didn't immediately have a specific comment about the letter. In a letter to Monkey App,  city attorney Dennis Herrera cited a provision in San Francisco's police code that prohibits people and companies from buying, selling or leasing public on-street parking and mandates fees of up to $300 for drivers who violate the law . 'As a general principle, we believe . that a new company providing value to people should be regulated and not . banned,' Dobrowolny wrote. 'This . applies also to companies like Airbnb, Uber and Lyft that are . continuously facing difficulties while delivering something that makes . users happy. Regulation is fundamental in driving innovation, while . banning is just stopping it.' The . city attorney's warning to Monkey Parking comes about a month after his . office started investigating the startup, which began its San Francisco . operations in April. 'Technology has given rise to many laudable innovations in how we live and work — and Monkey Parking is not one of them. It's illegal, it puts drivers on the hook for $300 fines, and it creates a predatory private market for public parking spaces that San Franciscans will not tolerate,' Herrera said in a written statement. 'People are free to rent out their own private driveways and garage spaces should they choose to do so. But we will not abide businesses that hold hostage on-street public parking spots for their own private profit.' Parking in San Francisco has long been known as a driver's worst nightmare. A recent San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency parking census reported that the city has 440,000 parking spots available - but only 275,000 of those are street parking. Herrera has given its creators until July 11 to shut down operations in San Francisco or possibly face a lawsuit under California's Unfair Competition Law . The Monkey Parking app allows drivers to get an often elusive parking spot and sell it for $5, $10, even $20, and then wait until the buyer arrives to take their place . Herrera's letter to Monkey Parking also asked Apple Inc. to immediately remove Monkey Parking from its app store. Apple did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. San Francisco-based technology expert Charles Belle, who runs the Startup Policy Lab, whose objective is to connect the startup community with policymakers and government, believes the issue between Monkey Parking and the city attorney is a great example of the need to create more forums for the two entities to engage. 'Companies need to be familiar with local laws, but threatened legal actions, such as cease-and-desist letters, only divert attention away from the opportunity to rethink how the community can use technology to improve government services,' said Belle, who's a former executive director the Privacy and Technology Project at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Two other tech companies, Sweetch and ParkModo, which Herrera said also violates city and state laws, will receive similar cease-and-desist warnings later this week. Sweetch co-founder Hamza Ouazzani Chahdi, whose $5-per-parking-spot swapping app was also warned to cease and desist, said Monday the goal is just to reduce congestion, which creates pollution and other problems. 'We don't understand why they want to shut us down. We are trying to solve the huge parking problem, which is not only bad for drivers but for all the city,' he said. ParkModo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"This is the heartwarming moment British tennis player Naomi Broady gets a kiss from her proud niece as she celebrates getting through to the second round at Wimbledon. The 24-year-old was embraced by her four-year-old niece Lola-Rose after sealing her first-round victory over Hungarian Timea Babos. British number four Broady, ranked 164 in the women's game, beat the world number 94 by two sets to one to seal her first ever grand slam victory. Heartwarming: British tennis player Naomi Broady gets a kiss from her proud niece Lola-Rose Broady as she celebrates her win at Wimbledon . Broady, a former under-18 UK girls' champion, entered the famous tournament as a wild card, and came from a set down to beat Babos. Her win comes after she spoke out about how she was embroiled in a scandal which threatened her career after posting a photograph of herself posing next to a condom machine on a night out seven years ago online. Broady maintained that the picture, uploaded to social network Bebo, was taken on an innocent girls' night out, but after it caught the attention of the press the Lawn Tennis Association cut her funding, putting her career at risk. Proud moment: Naomi Broady embraces her four-year-old niece after winning her game against Timea Babos by two sets to one . Victory: Broady, a former under-18 UK girls' champion, entered the famous tournament as a wild card, and came from a set down to beat Babos . To this day she has no coach and travels alone to tournaments. 'I don’t know why it was such a big deal,' Broady told the Mail on Sunday. 'I . wasn’t drunk and I wasn’t doing drugs either. I was trying to live, for . a few nights at least, as a normal 17-year-old. It was blown out of all . proportion. Scandal: Broady was embroiled in a scandal which threatened her career after posting a photograph of herself posing next to a condom machine on a night out seven years ago . ‘I . was disgusted with how the LTA handled things. They warned me the . picture would be appearing in the next day’s newspapers, but I heard . nothing after that.' Broady said the picture had 'tarnished' her with a 'bad girl reputation'. Her . property developer father Simon was so disgusted with the LTA's . decision to axe his daughter's funding that he pulled her younger . brother Liam, then 13, out of the LTA programme. He also sold the family home . to finance their careers instead. When the LTA offered Miss Broady funding again the following year, it was turned down on principle. The family continued its boycott until last year when Liam, now 20 and on the men’s circuit, decided to accept LTA funding again – a move that has angered his father to the point where they are no longer on speaking terms. 'It’s a very touchy subject,' Broady, who also has a sister and another brother, said. 'Dad says he was trying to protect us, but now Liam is older and has to pay for tennis himself. It’s a difficult family issue. I try to stay out of it.' But she insists she will not follow her brother’s example. ‘I don’t want their money and now  I have the prize money from Wimbledon I don’t need it,’ she said. ‘I won’t be bought by them after everything that’s happened. Win: Broady beat the world 94 to progress to the second round of Wimbledon . Against all odds: Since the row Broady has refused to accept funding from the LTA . ‘I still to this day don’t understand what we did wrong.  If I want to have a night out then I will.

"A man died after burning his buttocks in a scalding hot bath, an inquest was told. Andrew Tomlinson, 44, endured a number of increasingly hot baths in an extreme bid to ease chronic back pain. But the boiling water burned Mr Tomlinson’s buttocks and flank leaving him needing hospital treatment. Andrew Tomlinson, 44, suffered from chronic back pain and when medication failed to work - he tried hot baths in an attempt to ease the pain. However, one scalded his buttocks and he was taken to Southend Hospital, pictured, where he later died from his injuries . He was admitted to Southend Hospital last month - but sadly the burns turned septic and he was declared dead just days later. An inquest held at Chelmsford Coroners’ Court found Mr Tomlinson died as a result of an accident. The court heard how Mr Tomlinson, from Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, had begun taking boiling hot baths after high-strength anti-inflammatory drugs failed to quell his chronic back pain. A post mortem, carried out by pathologist Dr David Rouse, gave the cause of death as sepsis caused by burns. Coroner Eleanor McGann said: 'This gentleman was having baths for chronic pain and thought the hot baths would help. 'We know from the family it was something he had been doing. 'It is very sad he was having baths so hot they have led to burns and led to sepsis. 'He did not mean to harm himself in this way and my conclusion is that this was an accidental death.' Hot baths are recognised as treatment for short-term back pain on the NHS Choices website alongside hot water bottles, ice packs, painkillers and changing your sleeping position. But bathers are warned to always check the temperature of the water before climbing into the tub due to the dangers of scalding water - particularly for young children and the elderly. Hot bath water is the biggest cause of severe and fatal scalding injuries in young children.","Andrew Tomlinson, 44, from Westcliff-on-sea, Essex, had chronic back pain .

"Poignant cartoons by a member of the Great Escape forgery committee who were executed by the Nazis in World War II following their now infamous break out have emerged. The accomplished caricature sketches of several RAF officers held at prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III were produced by Flight Lieutenant Henri Picard. The talented artist was one of the 76 escapees to make it out of a 350ft long tunnel under the camp before guards spotted the mass break-out. These are two of the drawings created by Flight Lieutenant Henri Picard - one of 50 Allied men executed by the Nazis after they escaped from Stalag Luft III. It is thought the cartoons are of the man's roommates or other members of the Great Escape Forgery Committee who successfully fled the camp via a tunnel in 1944 . Another of F/Lt Picard's drawings - showing an unidentified RAF officer smoking a pipe. The talented artist  was one of 76 Allied troops to escape via the 350ft-long tunnel built under the camp - and the 50 who were recaptured and executed by the Nazis . F/Lt Picard had previously survived his own great escape. In 1942 he bailed out of a stricken plane and spent five days adrift in a dinghy in the North Sea before being captured. He was not as lucky two years later in the more famous escape bid that was immortalised in the 1963 Steve McQueen film, The Great Escape. After getting out of the camp he and comrade F/Lt Gordon Brettell were caught during a document check on a train 100 miles away in Nazi-occupied Poland. The two men were among 18 escapees who were driven to a forest near Danzig and shot by the Gestapo four days after the break-out. In all, 50 of the 76 men were executed on the orders of Adolf Hitler. The three men in F/Lt Picard’s drawings are thought to either be members of the forgery committee for the Great Escape or F/Lt Picard’s room-mates at the PoW camp. It is likely the sketches were rolled up and collected by an Allied prisoner while the camp was hastily cleared by the Germans as the Russians advanced across Poland. Flt Lt Henri Picard, pictured, was one of 18 men driven to a forest near Danzig and shot by the Gestapo four days after the escape. The break-out has since been immortalised in 1963 epic The Great Escape . Stalag Luft III - the prison camp where the escape took place and where the F/Lt Picard was kept. It is thought the drawings would have been rolled up and kept by an Allied prisoner when the camp was cleared by the Germans as the Russians advanced across Poland in 1944 . They were recently spotted for sale by an eagle-eyed dealer at a fair. Experts from Bosley’s Auctioneers on Marlow, Bucks, were able to identify the artist and their connection with Stalag Luft III. The drawings are now being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £1,200. Bernard Pass, of Bosley’s, said: 'The person selling them has no connection with Henri Picard, they are bargain hunter who spotted them at a fair. 'The artist’s name is on them along with the date they were produced so it didn’t take too much effort to identify who the artist was. The break-out was immortalised in 1963 film The Great Escape, starring Steve McQueen as Captain Virgil Hilts USAAF and Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett DFC RAF (pictured) The Stalag Luft III murders were committed by members of the Gestapo on order of Adolf Hitler on March 25 1944. Of 76 escapees, 73 were recaptured - mostly within a few days of the break out. 50 of those men were executed in the forest near Danzig. The deaths caused outrage. So much so, that in June of that year, Foreign Minister Anthony Eden announced in the House of Commons that those guilty of what was then a suspected war crime would be 'brought to exemplary justice.' Following the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, the Police branch of the Royal Air Force, with whom the deceased had been serving, launched an investigation into the killings. Wing Commander Wilfred Bowes, OBE headed the 15-man probe which tracked down, arrested, and interrogated the alleged war criminals responsible for the murders. Many were tried and convicted - with 13 hanged. A decision was made by the British government  after 31 August 1948 not to prosecute any more people involved. 'One of the men in the drawings was . Flight Lieutenant William Barrett who was at Stalag Luft III from March . 1942 to January 1945 when the troops were moved out. 'I think the three men were either part of the forger team or were room-mates of Picards. 'The three works were probably put up . on the walls and then maybe just grabbed them and rolled them up when . the camp was evacuated. 'They were drawn on normal paper and there are a few creases in them. 'They are quite poignant considering who the artist was and what happened to him.' F/Lt Picard was a member of the Belgium Air Force who transferred to the RAF after the fall of France in 1940. He flew Spitfires in 350 Squadron and was shot down on bomber escort duties in August 1942. Seriously wounded in one leg, he bailed out and drifted for five days and six nights in his tiny dinghy, suffering from his wound as well hunger and thirst. His craft was thrown up on the French coast and he fell into Germans hands. At Stalag Luft III F/Lt Picard was part of the team that copied real ID papers and passes. In all, three tunnels - called Tom, Dick and Harry - were dug by more than 600 Allied airmen over a 12 month period beneath the PoW camp near Zagan in Poland. In March 1944, 76 men crawled the 348 feet to freedom through ‘Harry’ - the single greatest escape during World War Two. But 73 of the escapees were soon captured. The auction takes place on July 2.","Cartoons of RAF officers drawn by Flight Lieutenant Henri Picard .

"David Cameron today admitted he made a mistake by taking Andy Coulson into Downing Street as his chief spin doctor. The Prime Minister issued a 'full and frank' apology for his decision to hire the former editor of the News of the World, adding: 'I am extremely sorry I employed him. It was the wrong decision.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said that Mr Cameron had 'brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street' and his Government was 'tainted' as a result. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron promised to make a 'profound apology' if his former director of communications Andy Coulson was found guilty of wrongdoing . Coulson worked as director of communications for the Tory party and later the government from 2007 to 2011 . After resigning from the newspaper in 2007, Coulson became director of communications for the Tory party before taking on the same role when the coalition was formed in 2010. Coulson has been found guilty of plotting to hack phones while he was editor of the tabloid newspaper. The jury is still considering further charges against Coulson and former NotW royal editor Clive Goodman of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office by paying police officers for two royal directories. In a recorded statement in the Cabinet Room today, Mr Cameron said: 'I always said that if they turned out to be wrong I would make a full and frank apology and I do that today. 'I'm extremely sorry that I employed him, it was the wrong decision and I'm very clear about that.' Pressed on the assurances he sought before hiring Coulson, the PM added: 'I asked him questions, if he knew about phone hacking and he said that he didn't and I accepted those assurances and I gave him the job. 'I would say that no-one has made any complaints about the work that he did for me either as leader of the opposition or indeed here in Number 10 Downing Street. 'But knowing what I now know and knowing that those assurances weren't right, it was obviously wrong to employ him. 'I gave someone a second chance and it turned out to be a bad decision.' Mr Cameron walked off camera and left the room without answering the final question from his interviewer, ITV political editor Tom Bradby, who asked: 'On a human level do you feel sorry for him?' Within minutes of the guilty verdict against Coulson being announced, the issue was raised in the House of Commons. Chancellor George Osborne, a cheerleader for hiring Coulson on the Conservative staff, was accused of bringing the government into disrepute. Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'I think David Cameron has very, very serious questions to answer, because we now know that he brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street. 'David Cameron was warned about Andy Coulson, the evidence mounted up against Andy Coulson. David Cameron must have had his suspicions about Andy Coulson, and yet he refused to act. 'Now, I believe this isn't just a serious error of judgment. This taints David Cameron's Government, because we now know that he put his relationship with Rupert Murdoch ahead of doing the right thing when it came to Andy Coulson. 'This was not some small or accidental mistake. He stuck with Andy Coulson over a long period of time, and it wasn't like there wasn't information out there to arouse his suspicions. He was warned by the Deputy Prime Minister. He saw front page stories in newspapers. He was warned by newspaper editors. And yet still he refused to act and even today defended some of the conduct of Andy Coulson when he worked for him. 'I think David Cameron must do much more than an apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on these allegations against Andy Coulson, why as the evidence piled up he didn't do anything about it, and he's got to explain.' The Tories' decision to take on Coulson was always controversial, coming after his resignation from the News of the World. He publicly denied any knowledge of phone-hacking at the newspaper, but quit taking responsibility for the single case of Royal Editor Clive Goodman who was jailed for phone hacking. Chancellor George Osborne was among the key figures who pushed for Coulson to be hired by the Tories . When the Tories formed a coalition with the Lib Dems, Coulson moved from Tory HQ to Downing Street as the government's Director of Communications. But renewed questions about phone-hacking emerged in 2009, leading to calls for Mr Cameron to sack his close aide. Amid mounting pressure, he stayed in post until January 2011, when he quit. In July that year, Mr Cameron promised to apologise if Coulson was found guilty of wrongdoing. He told MPs: 'I have said very clearly that if it turns out Andy Coulson knew about the hacking at the News of the World he will not only have lied to me but he will have lied to the police, to a select committee, to the Press Complaints Commission and, of course, perjured himself in a court of law. 'More to the point, if that comes to pass, he could also expect to face severe criminal charges. 'I have an old fashioned view about 'innocent until proven guilty'. But if it turns out I have been lied to, that would be a moment for a profound apology. 'And, in that event, I can tell you I will not fall short.' Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls accused George Osborne of bringing the Treasury into disrepute by pushing for the Tories to hire Coulson in 2007 . In the Commons, Labour's Ed Balls challenged Mr Osborne about his role in pushing for the Tories to hire Coulson as the party's communications director. Mr Balls said: 'Does the Chancellor now accept that it was a terrible error of judgement...' But he was cut off by Commons Speaker John Bercow, who warned the question was not relevant to Treasury questions. Allowed another attempt at raising the issue, Mr Balls went on: 'Does the Chancellor accept that he has brought into disrepute the office of Chancellor and of the Treasury by urging the Prime Minister for his own reasons to bring Mr Coulson into government and has he not done damage to his own reputation and the government's?' Mr Osborne brushed the comments aside, taking a swipe at Mr Balls own background in the Labour spin operation. 'The person who worked alongside Damian McBride is not a person to give lectures on this,' he said, in reference to Mr McBride having to resign from Gordon Brown's government for plotting smears. In a statement later Mr Osborne said: 'I too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ Andy Coulson. 'He gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case. We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it's clear that we made the wrong decision. 'It's important for the victims of phone hacking that this has now been properly dealt with by the courts; and it matters for us all that we have a free and vibrant press which operates within the law.' During his trial, Coulson admitted that he never told the Tories he knew of the hacking of Labour home secretary David Blunkett's voicemail in 2004 because, if he had come clean, he probably would not have got the job. The 46-year-old maintained that he thought chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck was responsible and not Mulcaire. In his earlier evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in 2012, Coulson said Mr Cameron asked him about the Goodman case. He told the inquiry: 'I said to him what I said publicly - I knew nothing in terms of what they did.' Mr Cameron did not seek any more assurances over Coulson's links to phone hacking, despite allegations about legal pay-offs for victims being published in the Guardian in July 2009, the inquiry heard. Instead, the Prime Minister stood by his spokesman long after the first rumblings in the media that all the hacking at the NotW had not been exposed. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that Mr Cameron had 'brought a criminal into the heart of Downing Street' and his Government was 'tainted' as a result . Coulson (centre) checks his phone during the Tory party conference in 2009, the year before he entered Downing Street running the government's spin operation . When Coulson resigned as Mr Cameron's media adviser in January 2011, he said: 'Unfortunately, continued coverage of events connected to my old job at the News of the World has made it difficult for me to give the 110 per cent needed in this role.' The Prime Minister reacted by saying he was 'very sorry' that Coulson was 'compelled' to resign because of the continuing pressure over phone hacking. After that, Coulson said he met up with Mr Cameron one more time in the spring of that year at a pre-arranged social event and had not spoken to him since. Mr Cameron told the Commons in an emergency statement in 2011 that he took 'responsibility' for Coulson's recruitment. 'With 20:20 hindsight - and all that has followed - I would not have offered him the job and I expect that he wouldn't have taken it,' he said. 'On the work he did, I will repeat, perhaps not for the last time, that his work at Downing Street has not been the subject of any serious complaint.'","PM stands by 2011 promise to issue 'profound apology' if Coulson guilty .

"A 3.7-metre saltwater crocodile which had a penchant for taunting Australian children every time the bell rang at a school on the very northern tip of Queensland has finally been caught. 'Shorty' the maneater would lurk in the waters near Injinoo Junior Campus in Cape York looking for his next victim during school breaks - but fortunately for the students he was fenced off from the school grounds. Shorty would habitually crawl from the Cowal Creek bed near the Jardine River and peer through the fence. But schoolkids no longer need to be on the look-out at lunchtime after the maneater was captured by wildlife. However his larger friend, a 4.5m saltwater beast, is still on the loose and the rangers have now pegged him as the region's most wanted croc. Shorty, the maneating monster, was captured by rangers from a primary school at remote Queensland community just 30km from the tip of the country . Gotcha: Shorty was causing a nuisance around the Injinoo Junior Campus in north Queensland having been sighted when the school bell was rung . Injinoo Junior Campus is located just 30km south of the top of Australia at Cape York and is regarded as a haven for saltwater crocodiles . Ranger Coordinator Warren Strevens said he wasn't 'surprised' when he heard the croc was tempted by the sound of the ringing bell. 'I heard the story when we captured it...but it didn't surprise anybody, he knew the habits of the school around bell time,' Mr Strevens told Daily Mail Australia. He believed the main reason behind Shorty's unwanted, yet prompt arrival at bell time would likely have been because he was scouring around for a meal. 'That's what you would associate it with.' Caught using a float trap, it took three days to lure Shorty into his cage where a big piece of meat awaited him. The trap was configured so that when the 3.7-metre monster bit down on his dinner, the steel trap's door closed behind him. On the hunt:  Rangers tow the caught croc to safety after he had been been sighted on numerous occasions around for the Injinoo Junior Campus, in the background . Using a float trap, the rangers managed to entice the croc inside using a large piece of bait which was configured so the trap door would shut when he ate it . A ranger transfers the croc from his river trap, to a more stable structure which was used to transfer him to the Edward River Crocodile Farm where he will be part of a breeding program . He was then pulled out of the water and taken to a nearby crocodile breeding facility. Daily Mail Australia has made repeated attempts to contact the school, without success. A Department of Education spokesperson said because of the common occurrence of crocodiles near the school, children have been told to take 'extra care around waterways' and 'exercise crocwise behaviour at all times'. About 100 students attend the school, which is fenced-off from the nearby creek where the crocs predominantly roam. The department has detailed a list of croc savvy tips for the school to skill up on in an effort to avoid becoming victim to the natural born predators. However, they are used as a guide only, and the department has assured Daily Mail Australia that at no times are children at danger at Injinoo Junior Campus when they go about their daily routine. 'At no stage are students at the school in danger from crocodiles while they go about their daily routine at the school.' 'The school grounds are separated from the creek by a public walkway and the school fence.' The wildlife management team celebrate the crocs eventual capture . There are reports of numerous crocodiles hanging inside the Jardine River at Cape York .","'Shorty' crept around a small, remote Queensland school and was sighted when its bell rang .

"A Pennsylvania arbitrator has ruled that Jerry Sandusky’s $4,900-a-month Penn State pension be reinstated, including back payments from October 2012, when his child molestation conviction prompted the state retirement system to end his benefits. Hearing examiner Michael Bangs wrote in an opinion dated Thursday but made public Monday that it was clear the former assistant football coach was no longer a Penn State employee after his 1999 retirement. That was critical to the pension dispute because the state Pension Forfeiture Act was expanded five years later, in 2004, to add sexual offenses to the list of crimes that trigger forfeiture. Scroll down for video . Flush with cash: A Pennsylvania arbitrator has ruled that Jerry Sandusky¿s $4,900-a-month Penn State pension be reinstated because he retired from Penn State back in 1999 - more than 12 years before his conviction . ‘The Pennsylvania forfeiture law is simply not applicable to SERS’ members who commit crimes after they have begun receiving their pensions, which is really what SERS is attempting to do in this case,’ Bangs wrote. ‘The courts simply cannot extend the current law beyond any rational interpretation of its current form.’ Both Sandusky and the State Employees’ Retirement System can respond to the recommendation, after which the retirement system board will decide whether the pension should be reinstated. That could occur this fall, and if Sandusky loses he could appeal to state courts. Pamela Hile, a spokeswoman for SERS, said Bangs' recommendation will go to the agency board for a final determination in ‘mid-to-late fall.’ If the board accepts Bangs’ recommendation, Sandusky’s Penn State pension would be reinstated to Oct. 9, 2012, when he and his wife, Dottie,lost the $4,900-a-month state benefit. Sandusky, who retired in June 30, . 1999, as Penn State's defensive coordinator, was convicted in 2012 of . molesting 10 boys over 15 years, some in the football team's showers on . campus. Bangs said that even . though Penn State provided Sandusky with an office and telephone after . his retirement, he was not a ’school employee.’ He said there was no . formal contract or agreement between him and the university. Guilty: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, walks with his wife Dottie Sandusky into the Centre County Courthouse, on June 22, 2012 in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania . Sandusky’s lawyer, Chuck Benjamin, said Monday he was pleased with the ruling, which accepted Benjamin’s argument that a report by former FBI director Louis Freeh was incorrect when it claimed Sandusky received 71 post-retirement payments from Penn State. In fact there were just a handful, and half were travel reimbursements, Benjamin said. ‘The unfortunate thing here is that SERS acted on the mistaken belief that the Freeh report was correct when the undisputed evidence showed it wasn’t correct,’ Benjamin said. Sandusky testified in January on the pension issue by video link from a state prison in southwestern Pennsylvania. He was the only witness his lawyers called. His pension benefits include a 50 per cent survivor’s annuity for Dottie Sandusky. The 70-year-old Sandusky is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison sentence after being convicted two years ago of sexual abuse of 10 boys. In a separate development on Monday, Pennsylvania's attorney general released a highly anticipated review of the Sandusky prosecution but found no evidence of political interference by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett during his time as attorney general. The report, however, has revealed three years of 'inexplicable delays' to prosecute the former Penn State football coach on child abuse charges. The pedophile's home was not searched and the report notes that it took a full year, from March 2009 until March 2010, for the office to recommend charging Sandusky when 'Victim 1' came forward. Not caught soon enough: Jerry Sandusky in Greene Sate Prison where is serving life in jail for sexually molesting 10 boys over 15-years . It took more 18 months before Sandusky was arrested because veteran prosecutor Jonelle Eshbach was overruled from arresting her because her supervisors believed that the testimony of one victim would be 'insufficient against a community icon like Sandusky'. The report, commissioned by Attorney General Kathleen Kane and written by former federal prosecutor Geoff Moulton, blamed a three-year time lapse in filing charges on communication problems, an expungement of a 1998 complaint about the former Penn State coach and a failure to take certain investigative steps early on. Two days after Tom Corbett was elected governor in November 2010, the Centre County prosecutor received an anonymous tip directing investigators to assistant football coach Mike McQueary, whose testimony would eventually help convict Sandusky. Special Deputy Attorney General H. Geoffery Moulton Jr. speaks at a news conference as Pennsylvania state Attorney General Kathleen Kane, left, listens, as the results are released of a probe into the Jerry Sandusky child molestation investigation on Monday, June 23 .

Additional . victims were identified, and on June 21, 2011, Sandusky's home was . searched, producing photos and typewritten lists of children who . participated in events at Sandusky's charity, The Second Mile, with some . names highlighted. The university eventually accepted a set of penalties from the NCAA over its handling of the matter, including a four-year bowl ban, a temporary reduction in football scholarships, the loss of 112 wins from Paterno's later years and a $60 million fine.","Pennsylvania arbiter ruled Jerry Sandusky was not Penn State employee after his 1999 retirement .

"Old Etonian Charlie Brooks was accused of orchestrating a campaign to . conceal evidence linking the hacking scandal to his wife but jurors agreed he was too 'daft' to be a criminal. The . Old Bailey heard how he made a series of 'cataclysmic' errors when his . wife was arrested, including hiding his 'rather large' stash of lesbian . porn. When Rebekah Brooks returned from Lewisham Police Station she also found her husband was drunk . and later 'lost it' when he stashed some possessions behind bins below their Chelsea flat. He . planned to collect the porn and laptop after police finished searching their London . home, he said, but a cleaner spotted the bags and handed them to . detectives. Protection: Charlie Brooks was accused of orchestrating a campaign for hiding materials from detectives to protect his wife, former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, but his defence claimed he was 'daft', not a criminal . Photographs of the bags and lists of . their contents were shown to the trial jury. Titles of the DVDs listed . included Instant Lesbian, Bride of Sin, and Lesbian Psychodrama volume 2 . and 3. They also saw CCTV of him wandering through the underground car park with the bags, and then leaving without them. Ms . Brooks told the jury: 'He said he had hidden a rather large porn collection. 'I . just lost it, I couldn't believe it. It sounded like a monumental . cock-up, - the idea that the police were going to arrest him, I had just . been arrested. 'It was the final straw of quite a cataclysmic few days.' Mr Brooks later said he only hid a stash of . lesbian porn to avoid police finding it and leaking . details of his 'smut' to the press. He claimed he wanted to avoid a 'Jacqui Smith moment' for his wife - a reference to the former Labour Home Secretary's . embarrassment when her husband watched a sex film later claimed on her . expenses. Mr . Brooks told the jury he 'incredibly stupidly' decided to hide a bag . containing explicit DVDs and a case with a laptop inside, but claims it . was not cover to up a crime. His defence said he was 'not academically gifted' and one friend described how he once downed an entire pint of washing up liquid in a bid to cure . a particularly bad hangover - an example of his lack of common sense, his defence team said. Evidence: CCTV images allegedly showing Charlie Brooks hiding evidence while wife Rebekah was being questioned by police were shown to the jury in the hacking trial in January .

The . material was then stashed in a black bag and hidden behind a bin . outside the Brooks's Chelsea flat by a security guard pretending to be a . pizza delivery worker, the prosecution said. After . making the drop in an underground car park he texted a colleague to . say: 'Broadsword to Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the . pot' - a reference to war film 'Where Eagles Dare' starring Richard . Burton and Clint Eastwood. His . accomplice then replied and called police 'f******* amateurs', . believing they had successfully hidden the material but it was found by a . cleaner and handed to police, the court heard.

"Olympic swimmer Amy Van Dyken-Rouen is getting back in the pool as part of her rehabilitation. The six-time gold medalist, who severed her spine in an ATV accident earlier this month, tweeted that she was excited to learn she would be swimming - and used the hashtag #Freedom - before she shared an image of her wearing her goggles in her hospital bed. The 41-year-old has shown almost superhuman strength as she endures a painstaking recovery and continues to show resolve as she embarks on months of rehab and using a wheelchair. Revealing just how far she has come, on . Monday she posted a photo of herself standing up with the help of a frame at Craig Hospital in suburban Denver, where she arrived . last week. Scroll down for video . Back to the pool! Olympian Amy Van Dyken Rouen, who severed her spine in an ATV accident earlier this month, has learned that she will be swimming as part of her rehab - and shared photos of her preparation . Her accident left . her paralyzed just below the waist and the odds of her ever walking . again are long - but she has impressed her doctors and fans with her . positive attitude. When her husband, former Denver . Broncos punter Tom Rouen, found her, Van Dyken-Rouen was lying face down . and not breathing. She began to breathe again after a witness lifted . her head and was airlifted to a Scottsdale hospital after being . stabilized by emergency personnel. 'Yes, . this injury sucks and yes, things hurt, but I'm alive and I'm so . thankful to be alive, so that's why I can be positive about it,' Van . Dyken-Rouen said from a stretcher during her first news conference since . the accident. 'It helps get me through the pain.' Fighter: On Monday, Van Dyken, who is paralyzed from the accident, shared this image of her standing with the caption: 'OMG... I'm standing. I have a lot of help, but I'm still up! #werl' New life: At the weekend, she shared this image of her first full day in rehab, saying: 'A good day, but tired' Support: She also shared this picture at the weekend showing her enjoying a picnic with her husband and dog . Van . Dyken-Rouen was injured when the ATV she was driving hit a curb and . sent her hurtling over an embankment near Show Low on June 6. Once at the hospital, doctors discovered she had a fracture dislocation of the T11 vertebrae, which had subluxed almost entirely over the T12 vertebrae. The dislocated vertebrae also severed Van Dyken-Rouen's spinal cord and caused a spinal fluid leak. Because of the severity of Van Dyken's injury, her doctor told her to say goodbye to her husband because there was a chance she would not make it through surgery. 'It was one of those things where I . looked at my husband and said, ""I love you, goodbye, please continue on . with your life"",' Van Dyken said in an interview. Staying positive: The six-time Olympic gold medal swimmer  smiles as she arrives in Craig Hospital in Colorado . Accident: Van Dyken-Rouen, right, was thrown from her ATV after driving back from dinner on June 6 . During more than six hours of surgery, doctors moved Van Dyken-Rouen's dislocated vertebrae back into place millimeters at a time to prevent a potentially-fatal rupture of her heart. They drilled screws into four vertebrae, inserted rods to stabilize her spine and patched the spinal fluid leak. The surgery was designed to stabilize not restore function, and Van Dyken-Rouen said she is still unable to feel anything from about her pubic bone down. She still faces an arduous road of rehabilitation and long odds for ever walking again, but will not back down whatever happens. In the short term, Van Dyken-Rouen . plans to buy the best wheelchair available, plaster it with . skull-and-bones stickers, paint it purple and dye her hair to match. Champion: Van Dyken became the first U.S. woman to win four golds at one Olympics . Long term, she will do whatever it takes. 'It's almost like a rebirth,' Van Dyken-Rouen said. 'I get to learn how to do everything all over again and I'm anxious to do that. It's time to start so I can get back to Arizona and continue my life - start my new life, I guess.'

"A study has found that graduates will earn $1.2million more over working life than if they had not gone to university. The news will be of some comfort to recent college graduates facing a tough job market and years of student loan payments. Those with bachelor's or associate's degrees earn more money over their lifetime than those who skip college, even after factoring in the cost of higher education, according to a report released Tuesday by The Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A student walks past Old Main on the campus of Penn State University in State College, Pa. A report has found that a degree is still a good investment for college grads, including those whose jobs don't require college . The study, by economists Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz, also found that a degree is still a good investment for college grads whose jobs don't require college. About a third of all college graduates remain underemployed for most of their careers. A person with a bachelor's degree can expect to earn about $1.2 million more, from ages 22 to 64, than someone with just a high school diploma, the report said. And someone with an associate's degree will bring in $325,000 more than someone with a high school education. The study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rising tuition costs, surging student debt levels and an increase in unemployment rates among new grads since the recession have caused some to question the value of higher education. The New York Fed study is just the latest to say that a degree is a good investment. A Pew Research Center report from earlier this year said young adults with college degrees make more money, have lower rates of unemployment and are less likely to be living in poverty than those with just a high school education. The New York Fed report said that between 1970 and 2013, those with a four-year bachelor's degree earned an average of about $64,500 per year, while those with a two-year associate's degree earned about $50,000 per year and those with only a high school diploma earned $41,000 per year. After subtracting tax benefits and average financial aid awards, the researchers said a bachelor's degree cost about $122,000 in 2013, while an associate's degree cost $43,700. Those numbers take into account that students held off earning money from a job to go to school. The study used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Education Department and The College Board. Even college graduates stuck in jobs that don't typically require higher education, such as coffee shop baristas or clothing store cashiers, have more earnings power than those with just a high school diploma, the report concluded. Someone with an associate's degree will bring in $325,000 more than someone with a high school education . That suggests that even in those jobs, college graduates are paid more than workers with just a high school diploma. Recent graduate Katie-Beth Vornberger thinks her degree will eventually pay off. The 24-year-old graduated from George Mason University in May with $20,000 in debt, even though she worked part-time to help pay for some of the tuition. She's currently working in a paid summer internship where she helps a consulting company in Fairfax, Virginia, manage their social media accounts. She said she is earning about $4 more an hour than the job she had before graduating, which she attributes to having a degree. 'I'm hoping it turns into a full-time position,' said Vornberger.

"Frostie, the two-month-old snow goat whose battle for survival won him millions of fans around the world, died on Monday, only about a week after he was able to walk for the first time. Edgar's Mission, a not-for-profit sanctuary for rescued farm animals outside of Melbourne, announced the news on its Facebook page today. An autopsy revealed that Frostie's spinal column was riddled with abscesses, with one so large that it was pressing on his small rumen, preventing the stomach from functioning properly and leading to bloat. Scroll down for video . Frostie the snow goat licks the nose of one of his handlers at Edgar's Mission, the animal sanctuary that took him under its wing in May. Frostie died on Monday after battling a hind leg infection since birth . 'In the early hours of Monday morning, the little champ told me he was not well, as his rapidly expanding stomach screamed bloat,' according to a post on the group's website. 'As the little guy took his last gasps of breath, he looked into my tear filled eyes as I begged him to stay. I told him I loved him and would do so forever more. It was not until I knew his spirit had passed that I would scream, “Why?” at the top of my lungs and sob inconsolably into his warm, sweet smelling white fur.' Frostie snuggles up in his bed in a picture likely taken not long before he died. His autopsy revealed that his spinal column was covered with abscesses . Edgar's Mission, a sanctuary for rescued farm animals, nursed the near-disabled baby goat back to health until he took a turn for the worst in recent days . Frostie's many admirers quickly began expressing their dismay at his passing on the website. 'No...not Frostie!! Im a bit shocked..Frostie was doing so well.' wrote Bronwyn Russell. Fostie was covered in lice, severely dehydrated and was unable to use his back legs when he was first brought to Edgar's Mission in May. At birth, he contracted a hind leg infection through his umbilical cord. An Edgar's Mission employee holds Frostie the Snow Goat in her arms an undated photo . Frostie is shown here about a week ago without the wheelchair he has used since May . The sanctuary fitted Frostie with a custom wheelchair so he could run around and play with the other animals. Pictures of the goat with his rear wheels rapidly went viral around the internet. Before being inherited by Frostie, the wheelchair belonged to Leon Trotsky - a baby pig who was injured when his mother sat on him, crushing his hind legs. Just last week it seemed all the antibiotics, painkillers and  tender love and care Frostie was receiving were doing the trick. For the first time, he was let out of his wheelchair and began running freely around the farm. 'That Frostie was a sickly little kid goat was something that we knew from the very day he came into our world,' Edgar's Mission said in the Facebook post. 'Frostie’s lot was not good, but no one told him that. He wanted to live, and that was just what we promised him we would help him do.' Despite being just one of 350 animals cared for, Frostie got all the attention he appeared to have needed at the sanctuary - which also houses cows, alpacas, deer, sheep, chicken, geese, ducks, rabbits, guinea pigs, peacocks and horses, in addition to goats and pigs. 'The fact that Frostie looked a little different was no justification to me for denying him the chance at life he so richly deserved - we would do no less if he were a puppy or kitten,' Edgar's Mission said.

"A 22-month-old girl who was left with three legs after she was separated from her conjoined twin in Panama has arrived in Los Angeles to undergo life-changing surgery. Ana Paula was joined at the pelvis with her sister when they were born in a rural village in Panama, and the two girls were separated when they were 20 years old, but her sister did not survive. After the surgery, Ana Paula was left three legs, three kidneys and possible reproductive issues. At the weekend, she arrived in Los Angeles, where she will multiple procedures at Shriners Hospital for Children to remove two of her legs - procedures that she would not be able to have in Panama. Scroll down for video . Welcome: 22-month-old Ana Paula gets a big welcome in Los Angeles airport after arriving from Panama . Fighter: She was born conjoined to her twin sister at the pelvis and was left with three legs after they were separated at 20 weeks. Only her left leg has function and the other two will be removed . The hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Kit Song, said her middle leg would be removed and that her right leg did not have a functional knee or foot so would likely be removed from above the knee, CBSLA reported. She will then be fitted with a prosthetic and will hopefully be able to walk. 'I think she’ll be very functional as a . walker, at the very least with crutches or with the arm crutches or . something similar,' Dr. Phoebe Scott-Wyard said at a press conference. Dr Song added: 'Will she . be able to run and play like other children? No. She will . be different than other children, but she will be able to move about and . keep up with her peers.' Life-changing: She arrived in LA with her mother, who says she hopes her daughter will be able to walk . Hopeful: Dr Kit Song, the chief of staff at the LA hospital, said her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable cases like it in the world each year - but that he knew his team could help . Twins who are joined at the pelvis, like Ana Paula was, can be fused at a 180 degree angle from each other in a condition known as 'Ischiopagi'. The twins can share two legs, three legs - with the third often being two fused legs - or four legs. Ana Paula has been left with three legs, although one does not have any function and one has no function in the foot or knee. As well as sharing the pelvic region, they can share the gastrointestinal tract and genital area. Most twins will need these regions reconstructed after they are separated. Both twins do often not make it through surgery. About one in every 100,000 live births and one in 10 conjoined twin births are affected by the condition. The toddler’s trip to Los Angeles was made possible by Shriners Hospitals and the Children of War Foundation, which secured funding for her medical costs and long-term rehabilitative care. 'My hope is that she will be fine and she will do well with her health … and she will also be able to walk,' Ana Paula's mother, Ileana Monrroy, said through a translator at the press conference. Ana Paula will have her first surgery in a month, after doctors make a thorough plan of how to move forward. 'I think we can execute this very well,' Dr Song said. 'It's the thinking process behind the plan that’s going to take some time.' Her medical condition was so rare that there are only 12 survivable . cases like it in the world each year, he added.

"Barcelona's last bullfighting ring has been earmarked to become Europe's largest mosque - just a few streets away from the city's famous Roman Catholic church La Sagrada Familia. The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has reportedly expressed an interest in funding the transformation of La Plaza Monumental into a mosque housing as many as 40,000 worshippers. If the €2.2 billion, or £1.8 billion, scheme is approved by city planners the historic arena, which has been empty since staging its last bullfight in September 2011, would become the biggest mosque in Europe. Plans: Barcelona's last bullfighting ring, La Plaza Monumental, has been earmarked to become Europe's largest mosque . As part of the plans, the new place of worship would boast a 300metre-high minaret - making it one of the world's tallest, while the mosque would only be bettered in size by those in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. When completed in 2020, the new mosque, which would employ 4,000 people, would be located just 750 metres from La Sagrada Familia, the famous basilica designed by celebrated architect Gaudi. Mowafak Kanfach, of the Islamic . Federation of Catalonia and founder of the city's Arabic Book Shop, said Barcelona's growing Muslim community was . in need of a purpose-built mosque, rather than the current situation where people worship in shops and the basements of houses - which has led to neighbourhood conflicts. New start? If the ¿2.2 billion scheme is approved by city planners the historic bullring, which has been empty since staging its last bullfight in September 2011, would become the biggest mosque in Europe . Past glory: Bullfighters Enrique Ponce (left) and Serafin Marin are carried on the shoulderd of supporters in July 2011, just weeks before the arena's final fight . 'The law says that everyone has the . right to pray in a dignified place, not in a shop,' he told Spanish daily 20 Minutos. Mr Kanfach, who said that the Emir was keen on buying the bullring, said chances of the project being approved could be boosted by the fact the Qatar Foundation, a non-profit organisation founded by the current Emir's father, already has a strong presence in the city, and the state-owned Qatar . Airways sponsors Barcelona's football team. He said that the new mosque could become a popular tourist attraction, and would also house a Qur'an study centre for 300 students, as well as a museum of Islamic art and history, restaurants and shops which would be open to all members of the public, regardless of faith. 'People in Barcelona should be proud that Muslims want to transform the pain of bulls into a spiritual center,' said Mr Kanfach, who first proposed a mosque for the city in 1998. Neighbours? The proposed mosque would be just 750 metres from the famous Gaudi-designed Roman Catholic church La Sagrada Familia . Controversy: Two men hold up anti-bullfighting banners off the side of the Plaza Monumental in 2008 . He added that Barcelona is the only major city in Spain not to have a mosque, despite having a similarly-sized Muslim population to Valencia, Marbella and Fuengirola. It has been estimated that around 50,000 Muslims are living in the city. The plans are subject to the sale of the bullring by current owners the Balana family, who are said to be in negotiations with the Emir, and municipal approval. And the scheme has not been met with universal support, with leader of the People's Party of Catalonia, Alberto Fernández Díaz, saying a 'mega-mosque' was 'not suitable' for Barcelona. He raised concerns that 'people and countries' involved in the project may have 'values which collide with ours', according to 20 Minutos. Opened in 1914, La Plaza Monumental could once house 19,582 fans for bullfights or around 25,000 for events such as concerts. Bullfighting was outlawed in Catalonia in 2010, with the ban coming into force in 2012. Since the last bull fight was staged in 2011 other plans put forward for the building have included a marketplace, flats and a public garden. Another former bullfighting arena, Las Arenas, was also proposed as a potential site for a mosque in 2004, although a shopping centre was eventually built in its place.","Emir of Qatar is reportedly interested in buying La Plaza Monumental .

But this made playing golf a very tedious process until Mr Gribble discovered the Paragolfer and became the driving force behind bringing the $35,000 German-designed cart to the Moore Park golf course in Sydney – the only one for public hire in Australia. James Gribble was the driving force behind bringing the Paragolfer to Moore Park in Sydney . The $35,000 German-designed cart is the only one for public hire in Australia . Now Mr Gribble plays the game he loves at least once a week and was part of an Australian team that took out the inaugural World Cup of Disabled Golf held in South Africa last month. ‘After breaking my neck four years ago not knowing if I'd even survive, words can't express how amazing it felt to be upright and swinging a golf club for the very first time,’ he said. The Hunters Hill resident broke his C4 and C5 vertebrae when he fell backwards off a stool while backpacking in Africa almost four years ago. ‘It’s given me back a massive part of what I lost after the accident,’ he said. 'To be standing up and enjoying a round with my mates is incredible…the banter, the competition, and being able to access the outdoors are probably the three biggest things.’ Now a Moore Park golf accessibility ambassador and the founder of Empower Golf Australia founder, Mr Gribble said his dream was to have a Paragolfer at every course across the country. ‘Golf is a very unique sport - it is the only sport out there with a unique handicap system which allows people with any form of ability, age or gender to compete – there’s no other sport on the planet that replicates that,’ he said. ‘Almost six per cent of  population in Australia play golf – by far the biggest ball sport in the country - we also have more golf courses per capita than almost anywhere else in the world yet historically very few disabled golfers.' Mr Gribble was also instrumental in the $1 million refurbishments and accessibility upgrades at the course and its facilities including a new accessibility ramp and a unisex disabled toilet. Mr Gribble now plays the game he loves at least once a week by using the Paragolfer . After being told he would never walk again, the 35 year-old can now walk small distances on crutches . ‘With the combination of automated tees and the Paragolfer, Moore Park Golf is set to become one of the most accessible and accommodating public golf facility in Australia for golfers with disabilities,’ he said. He said now that golf has been included as an Olympic event for Rio in 2016 there was no reason why it couldn't also be added to the Paralympic program.

"Lord Campbell-Savours, a former Labour MP, condemned the ‘back-stabbing’ of Tony Blair by former supporters . Tony Blair has been the victim of ‘vomit-inducing’ attacks from people who once backed the invasion of Iraq, a Labour peer has claimed. The former Prime Minister has been roundly criticised for his call for new military intervention to counter the rise of militant extremists in ISIS. But Lord Campbell-Savours, a former MP, condemned the ‘back-stabbing’ of Mr Blair and insisted that the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (WMD) was not the sole reason for backing the 2003 invasion. Two weeks ago Mr Blair, who led Britain into the conflict alongside US President George W Bush, denied the appalling bloodshed was connected to the 2003 invasion. ‘We have to liberate ourselves from the notion that 'we' have caused this,’ the former Prime Minister wrote in an extraordinary essay. ‘We haven’t.’ He went on to call for decisive military response 'including military strikes against extremists in Iraq and Syria'. The remarks sparked a furious backlash from across the political spectrum, including from senior Labour and Tory figures who supported the war in 2003. Lord Campbell-Savours used a House of Lords debate on the situation in Iraq to condemn Mr Blair’s critics. He told peers: ‘I supported the first intervention in the early 1990s and in 1997 to 2001 repeatedly called for and openly supported military intervention. ‘I was not alone and I find it what I can only describe as vomit-inducing to hear the back-stabbing of Blair from many who openly supported intervention and are now in denial. ‘The idea that most of us supported intervention on the single justification of WMD is nonsense. Our concerns went far wider.’ The 70-year-old was a Labour MP for Workington from 1979-2001, and served on Neil Kinnock’s frontbench in the 1980s and 1990s. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has been heavily criticised for his call for new military intervention to tackle the threat posed by Islamist jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the Iraq . Speaking in last night’s debate, he said that in the run-up to the Iraq invasion the main concerns on both sides of the Atlantic had been the need to protect the Kurds, stop environmental destruction and population displacement in the south, and curtail the aspirations of Saddam to invade neighbouring states. He added: ‘In my view one of the most important reasons, rarely talked about, was the need to remove Saddam's threat to the international oil economy. ‘That threat was a cause of volatility in international oil markets with the potential to destabilise economies and impact on the employment policies in the oil-dependent economies in the West - something we should still have in mind. ‘These are the real reasons for intervention, not WMD and my only criticism of Blair is that concerns over justification in international law drove us down the WMD route.’ His defence of Mr Blair comes after two weeks of heavy criticism for his call for Britain to join new military strikes to counter the threat posed by Islamist jihadists who have seized control of large areas of the Iraq, plunging the country into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011. Lord Prescott, who served as Deputy Prime Minister at the time of the war, accused Mr Blair of trying to take the West 'back to the crusades'. Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary at the time of the invasion, said it was 'impossible' to argue that the war ordered by Mr Blair 'played no part at all in today's events'. Fighters of the al-Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) parade in a commandeered Iraqi security forces vehicle down a main road at the northern city of Mosul, Iraq . Former Deputy PM Lord Prescott accused Mr Blair of wanting to take the West 'back to the crusades' but Lord Mandelson insisted the Iraq war had been a ‘mistake honestly made’ Boris Johnson, who voted in favour of the 2003 war, claimed Mr Blair ‘surely needs professional psychiatric help’ for refusing the accept that the conflict was a ‘tragic mistake’. Former foreign minister Lord Malloch Brown urged Mr Blair to 'stay quiet' because his presence in the debate was driving people to oppose what might be the necessary response.; . Clare Short, who quit Mr Blair's cabinet in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion, said he had been 'absolutely, consistently wrong, wrong, wrong' on the issue, and opposed more strikes. However Lord Mandeslon leapt to Mr Blair’s defence, insisting the Iraq war was a ‘mistake honestly made’. The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Mr Blair had not ‘gone a bit nuts’ for calling for new military action and did not take the ‘country to war on a lie’.","Former Labour MP rushes to the defence of ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair .

"A woman was killed in a terrifying freak accident after her car hit a roundabout and then careered across the roof of a multi-storey car park before landing on the ground below. Shocked eye-witnesses said the vehicle struck the roundabout at high speed, hurtling it 30ft onto the top floor of the car park where it hit two cars before crashing over the back wall and landing on the ground 10ft below. Emergency services were called to the . scene of the horrific smash at 9.15am today, on the edge of the Port of . Dover in Kent, but were unable to save   her.

Freak accident: The wreckage of the car that was launched into the air after a hitting a roundabout, sending it flying across a rooftop car park. The driver was thrown for the car and died at the scene . Damage: The car smashed into two other vehicles before plunging over the other side of the roof . The woman driver, who has not been identified, was seen being tended to by paramedics on the top floor of the car park after apparently being thrown   clear of the car, but she didn't survive. The dramatic crash was witnessed by crowds of horrified port workers who were stood around 400m away. The roundabout is on a slight hill just yards from the concrete building, which sits below it. P&O Ferries press officer Brian Rees, who saw the crash from his office around 500 yards away, said: 'It was so extraordinary, and happened so quickly,   that for a moment I didn't believe my own eyes.' Extensive damage: This blue Kia on the roof of the multi-storey car park was destroyed by the impact . The second vehicle damaged in the accident on the roof of the car park. Witnesses said the car was spinning so fast it looked like a propeller . He added: 'The car somehow got up enough speed to . hit the roundabout, hurtle off the top of the car park at the business . centre, soaring into the air   somersaulting, debris flying off, end . over end, and thankfully I couldn't see where it came down to earth.' 'The only thing I can compare it to would be a James Bond movie - for a moment I doubted what I'd just seen. Emergency: A helicopter hovers above the scene of the accident. Nobody else was hurt in the horror crash . 'My immediate reaction was that it would be a miracle to survive such an accident and I'm hearing that it has ended in tragedy.' Colleague Chris Laming added: 'The car when coming through the air was spinning so fast, end over end, my colleagues thought it was a propeller it was   rotating so quickly. 'Everyone here is absolutely aghast that a car could be going so quickly it could launch itself 30 feet in the air and travel for such a distance   across the car park. It was unbelievable.' A Kent Police spokesman said: 'A car travelling coast-bound on the A20 collided with the Aycliffe roundabout just before 9.15 am this morning.

"Guilty of assault: Peter Samms went to the home of his son's ex-girlfriend Stephanie Wardn . The father of footballer Danny Simpson has been found guilty of assault after a bust-up with his son’s former girlfriend. Bodybuilder Peter Samms confronted Stephanie Ward, 25, after she revealed how the Newcastle United star had 'cheated' on her with X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in a national newspaper. Samms, 46, barged into Miss Ward’s home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, just hours after she had aborted the child she was carrying with the footballer. During the confrontation, last November, Samms acted in an 'intimidating and threatening' manner, magistrates in Manchester heard. Miss Ward’s mother Gillian, who had answered the door when Samms arrived at the house, was knocked off balance as he went past her. Samms allegedly warned Miss Ward that he had 'gangster friends' and she would never be able to go out in Manchester again. Prosecutor Rebecca Radcliffe told magistrates that Samms, who works as a security guard, was intimidating 'in terms of body language and physical movement'. Samms, of Ellesmere St, Manchester, denied  common assault and a charge of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. He was cleared of the second count but found guilty of common assault. Samms was fined £375 and ordered to pay £400 costs and £100 to his victim. Scroll down for video . Close: Tulisa was pictured cuddling up to Danny and a group of friends as they spent an evening together . Lashing out: Tulisa Contostavlos has been branded a 'homewrecker' for reportedly romancing Newcastle ace Danny Simpson . Last November, Miss Ward revealed how she’d been left devastated after finding out Simpson had been dating 24-year-old Tulisa. She branded the singer a 'home-wrecker', adding: “She’s been sleeping in my bed! Danny has humiliated me in front of my family, friends and the whole nation.” But Tulisa’s lawyers later issued a statement saying: “Tulisa categorically denies any allegation that she entered any relationship with Danny Simpson while he was still in a relationship with Stephanie Ward.' Ms Ward told The Sun newspaper: 'We've been off-and-on for the last seven years - but absolutely solid for the last two. 'As . far as I'm concerned he has cheated on me because we hadn't broken up . or anything. She's a home-wrecker and has destroyed my family.' Happy families: Danny has a baby daughter, Skye-Lorena, with his on-off girlfriend of seven years, Stephanie Ward . The pretty brunette is the mother of Simpson's baby daughter Skye-Lorena. She had been reportedly three months pregnant with their second child. It's believed Tulisa met the footballer through mutual friends, before enjoying a date together. Her fans will have been hoping the singer is finally having some good luck in the romance stakes after a series of heartbreaks in recent years. She split from her bandmate and boyfriend of two years Fazer earlier this year. A video of the singer and her ex-boyfriend Justin Edwards also emerged on the internet. Tulisa filed a lawsuit against her ex and it was settled in July - with Edwards subsequently apologising for releasing the tape. Tulisa also dated skins star Jack O'Connell, but their romance eventually fizzled out.

"They could easily win the award for the cutest pets in Britain, but these 11 micro pigs already have another accolade to their name. While the animals themselves are miniscule, this litter of micro pigs is believed to be the biggest in Britain. And these adorable images show the 11-strong litter in the first few weeks of their lives, complete with their wrinkled little snouts, oversized ears and tiny trotters . Mother poppy, pictured far right, gave birth to what is believed to be Britain's largest litter of micro pigs . Owners Marc Cox and Caroline Chaplin, pictured above, were stunned when Poppy gave birth to 11 micro pigs . The micro pigs from the litter, which were born on June 7,  were all snapped up within one day of being born . Owners Marc Cox, 53, and Caroline Chaplin, 52, said they were amazed when their pig Poppy gave birth to the 11-strong litter . The couple, who run PetPiggies in Ridgmont, Bedfordshire, have been breeding pigs for the last five years and had never known a micro pig to have a litter so large. Mr Cox said: 'It’s definitely the biggest litter we’ve ever had. On average micropigs have a litter of six, 11 is exceptional. It’s a new record for us and I’ve never heard of a bigger micro pig litter. 'We had no idea Poppy would have so many - she was big but there was nothing to indicate we’d be expecting a litter as large as this. The couple, who run PetPiggies in Ridgmont, Bedfordshire, have been breeding these adorable pigs for the past five years . The couple said it is by far the largest litter they've seen and said a litter usually consists of an average of six . Mirco pigs are smaller than a standard farm pig and are born weighing around 9oz - the size of a tea cup . 'Once she’d gave birth to four, I was thinking we’re nearly there but she just kept going. 'She gave birth to another and then another and another, I kept thinking: gosh how many are in there? 'But we love them all, they each have there own little personalities, some are very playful and others like their own space.' Marc said it took less than 24 for the pets to be snapped up after they were born on June 7. They have just a few more weeks with their mother before they move into their new homes. The tiny piglets have just a few more weeks with their mother before they move into their new homes . When they are fully grown, aged two, they weigh between 40 and 65 lbs and grow to about 16 inches tall . He said: 'They were all sold within a day, even though we weren’t expecting so many we always have a huge waiting list of people wanting to own one. 'We make sure we meet all the owners and they know exactly what’s involved in keeping a micro pig and are well equipped to take care of it. 'So we have no doubt every one of these pigd will be going to a loving new home.' Micro pigs, which can live up to 18 years, are much smaller than a standard farm pig and weigh 9oz, about the size of a tea cup when they are born. At two years old they are fully grown and weigh between 40lbs and 65lbs and are between 12 and 16 inches tall.","Marc Cox and Caroline Chaplin were amazed when pig Poppy had 11 babies .

"Jeremy Paxman told the audience at the Chalke Valley History Festival that Newsnight was made by 13-year-olds . Veteren broadcaster Jeremy Paxman has criticised Newsnight just weeks after retiring from the flagship show, claiming it is made by a bunch of '13-year-olds' who were on a 'fool's errand' trying to change the world. The 64-year-old also admitted his politics as a 'one-nation Tory' clashed with the idealistic ideas of his former young colleagues. Speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival about his new book, he said: 'Look, Newsnight is made by 13-year-olds. 'It’s perfectly normal when you’re young that you want to change the world. 'The older you get, the more you realise what a fool’s errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible.' According to the Telegraph, the University Challenge presenter made the comments after taking questions from the crowd after speaking about his book on the First World War, Great Britain's Great War. One audience member asked whether London Mayor Boris Johnson’s description of Paxman during the last Newsnight show - which showed the pair riding tandem through London together - as the 'last one-nation Conservative in the BBC' was accurate. Paxman avoided directly answering whether this was the case, saying: 'If I had to ... are there any members of the press here? I think I’ll plead the fifth on that one'. But he later added: ‘To be frank, I suppose I am a one-nation Tory, yes.' During the event, Paxman shed light on his political views, saying he was 'in favour of governments getting out of people’s . lives, particularly foreign government'. The former presenter of Newsnight, said his right-leaning . politics as a 'one-nation Tory' clashed with his idealistic young . colleagues who were on a 'fool's errand' trying to change the world . He said that Europe had been 'nothing but trouble for us' and joked that Belgium was a 'pointless little country'. 'The closer you can take decision-making to the people affected by those decisions, the better,' he said. The comments are unusual for Paxman who had to remain neutral during his 25 years fronting the BBC's famed politics show. London mayor Boris Johnson, who was interviewed on Paxman's last show, branded the journalist as 'the last one-nation Tory in the BBC' - a comment Paxman refused to answer at the festival . The journalist, known for his abrasive questioning style, also admitted that he 'seriously . considered' quitting the show after the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine scandals. He  conceded that there were 'several individual bad decisions' and that 'loyalty commanded that I stayed'. Newsnight has been revamped under former Guardian deputy editor Ian Katz, who was appointed the new editor in May 2013. Over the past year, there have been accusations that the show - which infamously featured Kirsty Wark dancing to Michael Jackson's Thriller last year - is being dumbed down. Paxman, whose BBC biography says he got his break in broadcasting 'making the tea at Radio Brighton', has spent his working life with the corporation. His career includes a stint covering the troubles in Northern Ireland and working as a presenter on radio, breakfast TV and the Six O'Clock News before finding the show he made his own. The Leeds-born broadcaster, who studied at Cambridge University, is the author of a string of books including studies of Victorian Britain, politics and fishing.","64-year-old made the comments during talk at Chalke Valley History Festival .

"A top High Street fashion chain yesterday claimed two labels sewn into summer dresses saying 'sweatshops conditions' and 'exhausting hours' were hoaxes. Primark were under-fire after claims the labels were a 'cry for help' from workers making the cut-price fashion. But bosses at the chain say the two matching hand-made labels were put on dresses made thousands of miles apart - one in Romania and one in India. Rebecca Gallagher, left, and Rebecca Jones, right, both bought their summer fashion garments from the Primark store in their native Swansea spending £10 on the dress and top containing the hoax labels . A investigation by Primark found that one of the garments has been made in Romania and the second was manufactured in India leading them to conclude that both labels were hoaxes, most likely attached in the UK . Two women shoppers were shocked at finding the hand-made labels sewn into bargain tops bought from the same Primark store in Swansea city centre. Rebecca Gallagher, 25, spotted a label reading: 'Forced to work exhausting hours' next to the washing instruction of her bargain top. And a second shopper Rebecca Jones, 21, revealed how she found another label reading: 'Degrading sweatshop conditions'. The two women - who do not know each other - bought their £10 summer clothes from the same Primark store. Both Miss Gallagher and Miss Jones purchased their £10 garments in the Primark store in Swansea . A Primark spokesman said: 'Nobody should be in any doubt that Primark places the utmost importance on the well-being of workers in its supply chain. 'Primark would not sell clothes unless we are satisfied that they were made in accordance with our Code of Conduct. 'It is for this reason that we take all allegations of breaches of our Code extremely seriously from any sources.' The company - who say workers in our supply chain to make contact 'confidentially' - launched an investigation into the labels. The spokesman said: 'Our investigation has led us to the conclusion that it is more likely than not, to have been a hoax carried out in the UK. 'The labels are clearly from the same source. 'It is almost impossible to imagine circumstances in which such similar labels could have been sewn onto the garments at the factory where they were made. 'They were made by different suppliers, in different factories, on different continents, one in Romania and the other in India, thousands of miles apart. 'However, both garments carrying the hoax labels, were bought from our Swansea store in 2013. 'It may be no more than a coincidence that an exhibition of labels of a similar kind was held in Swansea, also in 2013. 'Visitors were encouraged to sew labels, using similar wording and appearance to the hoax labels, onto clothing.' Primark say it is continuing to investigate the discovery of a note in a pair of cropped trousers in Northern Ireland, with investigations being carried out in the UK and China. It comes after the discount fashion retailers have been criticised over working conditions of workers abroad - but Primark insists it has a strict code of ethics. Miss Gallagher said she would never wear the multi-coloured dress ever again after spotting the label . Miss Jones said having spotted the label she know spends time thinking how her clothes have been made . Miss Jones, of Porthcawl, said: 'I was really shocked when I saw the label saying it was degrading sweatshop conditions. 'I used to shop a lot at Primark but not so much now. The label has made me think about how my clothes are made. 'I have no idea who made the label or how it go it there - but it does make you think.' Fellow shopper Miss Gallagher, 25, spotted the handmade label sewn into the multi-coloured dress from discount store Primark. She had vowed never to wear it again because of the fear it was made by a tired worker toiling in a foreign sweatshop. Miss Gallagher, of Swansea, said: 'I was amazed when I checked for the washing instructions and spotted this label. 'It was stitched by hand to say “Forced to work exhausting hours” and sewn in with the other normal labels. 'To be honest I’ve never really thought much about how the clothes are made. But this really made me think about how we get our cheap fashion.' 'I dread to think that my summer top may be made by some exhausted persontoiling away for hours in some sweatshop abroad.' Primark’s ethics came under fire in 2011 after the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh killed 1,000 workers, 580 of whom were employed by a Primark supplier. The company recently announced it will pay out compensation to workers who were injured and the families of workers who died in the collapse. The high street chain assured that it has 'a code of conduct in place, to ensure products are made in good working conditions and all employees are treated fairly'.","Primark investigation discovers garments were made in Romania and India .

"A man who almost died when he fell 110ft from a Scottish castle as a teenager has spoken of his miraculous recovery. Doctors were ready to switch off life support for James Mclean, who slipped while playing on the ramparts of Greenan Castle in Ayrshire aged 13. He plunged from the stone tower, which stands on the edge of a cliff, and landed on the beach below. Miracle: James Mclean, pictured on his hospital bed in 2003, was given a 10 per cent chance of survival after plunging from Greenan Castle in Ayrshire . Plunge: Mr Mclean was playing on Greenan Castle in Ayrshire, pictured, when he fell from the walls down onto the beach below . Mr Mclean lost huge amounts of blood, suffered massive head trauma and was left with shattered knee bones protruding from his legs. He was given a 10 per cent chance of survival, and hospital staff went as far as inviting relatives to say their final goodbyes. But, miraculously, Mr Mclean, now 23, lifted his arm after after all hope had faded, convincing surgeons that he had a chance of living through surgery. Although his injuries have left him with limited vision, partial paralysis and epilepsy, he can now speak of his bravery nearly 10 years after the accident. He said: 'I've no memory of the day so have to rely on eyewitnesses - The castle is just a short walk from my house in Doonfoot and me and my friends used to play there all the time.' Back from the brink: Mr Mclean, now 23, was left disabled after his unlikely recovery, but is now strong enough to inspire others . 'When I walk past it now, it helps me think about how far I've come, rather than what happened there. 'The doctors said, ""If this boy wants to fight, then we'll fight too"". But the outlook was initially bleak after he was plucked from the beach by an air ambulance and flown urgently to Ayr Hospital. When his mother Janet arrived with family to see Mr Mclean, they were worryingly taken straight to the relatives' room. She said: 'I'm a health visitor nurse, so I knew that wasn't good. They gave him less than a 10 per cent chance of survival. 'He was moved to Glasgow's Southern General where, 48 hours later, they said he wasn't compatible with life and were going to switch off the life support machine. We were told to go in and say our last goodbyes.' Eventually, only Mrs Mclean was left - and was shocked when she entered the room to find her son missing. But happily, it was because doctors had seen him move and decided to operate rather than let him die. Return: Mr Mclean has no memory of the accident itself, but says visiting Greenan Castle only reminds him how far he has come . Mr Mclean spent nearly four weeks in a coma and the swelling in his head was so bad that half of his skull was removed for 11 weeks to ease the pressure. He spent another eight months in hospital, where he caught MRSA and septicaemia, but pulled through. Now Mr Mclean is positive about the future, having just completed a 20-mile cycle ride to raise money for charity. He said: 'I may never be able to drive a bus or fly a plane, but I like to focus on what I can do rather than what I can't. 'And I want to inspire people in the same situation as myself and try to help others with their disabilities and impairments.' 'I've gone from being a boy who was an inch from death to a man who strives to achieve and inspire. 'The trauma of the accident transformed me. My dad and I used to cycle on the islands when I was younger - the route was 20 miles long and I was determined to complete it.' Mrs Mclean added: 'Staff at the Southern General say he's their one in a million. He was in an untenable position and fought back.'","James Mclean plunged from Greenan Castle in Ayrshire ten years ago .

"Tourists in France are set to be stung by a rise in hotel tax – of a whopping 500 per cent. France's foreign minister has joined tourist chiefs in attacking the increase. The controversial measure, which has already been approved by Parliament after being initiated by Socialist MPs, will see up to £8 added to Paris's already sky-high room rates. Tourists in France are set to be stung by a rise in hotel tax ¿ of a whopping 500 per cent . Laurent Fabius, the foreign secretary, said the measure was 'dangerous and totally contrary to the promotion of tourism, a priority for jobs.' If rubber-stamped by the Senate, visitors to French hotels would find a tax of £6.40 (Euro 8) on their bills, rather than the current £1.20 (Euro 1.50). This figure will rise to £8 (Euro 10) in Paris - the most popular tourist destination in the world, where the biggest visitor group among some 30 million a year are the British. Laurent Fabius, pictured, the foreign secretary, said the measure was 'dangerous and totally contrary to the promotion of tourism' While small hotels will be able to charge less, critics said the measure will stop people coming to France, which has plunged into economic chaos since a Socialist government came to power in 2012. Roland Heguy, a hotel trade unionist, attacked 'irresponsible measures that will have grave consequences for our hotels, which me must remind people are ""Made in France"" businesses. 'The hotels that I represent are extremely angry, and request that members of parliament and the government instantly stop this massacre.' Hotel and restaurant owners are already smarting over a VAT hike to 10 per cent, along with other measures aimed at increasing government revenue. 'The situation is becoming intolerable,' said Paris hotel manager Jacques Houllier. 'A few years ago you could get a hotel room for a fair price, but now you need to be very rich indeed. Ordinary people just can't stay here, and the industry is suffering enormously because of this.' The Socialists, in turn, hope the massively increased hotel tax will generate the equivalent of around £112 million a year. Mr Fabius, who is in charge of tourism in France, has laid out plans to increase visitor numbers from the current 83 million a year to 100 million.","Tourists in France are facing a rise in hotel tax of a massive 500 per cent .

"Police in Tippecanoe County, Indiana have arrested a man who sympathized with the Las Vegas cop killers, after he posted incendiary remarks on Facebook threatening to kill more police and cause more terror. He remained jailed on Sunday. According to authorities, police reviewed statements made by Samuel Bradbury, 22, of Pine Village, Indiana. These statements, made on Bradbury's Facebook page, reportedly were threats to kill a Tippecanoe County judge, an Indiana Supreme Court justice and two Tippecanoe County law enforcement officers. In his postings, Bradbury also threatened to 'blow the Tippecanoe County Courthouse to pieces.' Police say that Samuel Bradbury, 22, threatened police in Indiana in a manner similar to Jerad Miller, who was also originally from the state . According to police, Bradbury claimed affiliation with the same anarchist group that Jerad and Amanda Miller, the shooters in the Las Vegas killing spree, belonged to, the '765 Anarchists.' Both Bradbury and the Millers are from Indiana. In YouTube ramblings, Jerad Miller called the Tippecanoe County Courthouse 'a beautiful building' but referred to it as 'a monument to authoritarianism.' According to police, Bradbury was also a member of alarming Facebook groups, such as 'No Tears for Dead Cops' and 'Illuminati Exposed (This is the resistance).' On June 8, Jerad and Amanda Miller slaughtered two Las Vegas police officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, as they ate lunch that afternoon - shooting both a close range. They then ran into a nearby Walmart, where Jerad fired a shot into the ceiling and declared 'this is the revolution' and demanded everyone leave. Joseph Robert Wilcox, 31, a shopper who was carrying a concealed weapon, tried to sneak up on Jerad. However, as he did, he passed by Amanda, not realizing the two were together. Amanda shot Wilcox at close range, killing him. Bradbury claims that he was affiliated with the same group as Jerad and Amanda Miller, the '765 Anarchists' Police footage recently released shows the Millers taking cover in the Walmart where their last stand took place. The couple then fled to a back corner of the store, where they prepared to make their last stand as officers armed with assault rifles closed in. The Walmart surveillance video shows both laying on the ground, pointing handguns at each other. Amanda appears to fire her weapon at her husband, a moment later he goes limp. The 22-year-old Indiana woman then turns the gun on herself. The video cuts out a moment before she fires the pistol into her own head. Police originally reported that Amanda had killed her husband, however, autopsy results and further investigation revealed it was police officers who fired the fatal shot. All three officers who shot at Jerad Miller are on paid leave, as per the department policy on firing a weapon on duty. The Millers frequently dressed as comic book villains from Batman. Jerad especially loved the anarchist Joker . Police also revealed that they had interactions with the Millers on three occasions. In February, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles called Las Vegas police and asked them to investigate threats Jerad Miller had made against the office. When reached at his apartment, Miller claim he never threatened anyone and said his comment was that 'that's how people get shot.' 'The interaction was normal; there were no anti-government or anti-police statements. They did not feel through the interview that the suspects were a potential threat,' McMahill said at a press conference Thursday. Police also visited in April and took a witness statement from the Millers in relation to a domestic violence report filed by their neighbors. Finally, on May 31, the Millers gave a witness statement for a sexual assault that occurred in their apartment complex.

"A chip shop owner is selling what he claims is the ultimate Northern lunch - a pie stuffed with steak pudding, chips, mushy peas and gravy. The 1ft-wide, £6.99 snack was invented by 54-year-old John Clarkson after he said Marks & Spencer's 'hoity-toity' fish-and-chips pie was too small. Inspired by the up-market food chain, he is now serving his own heart-stopping dish at his shop in Preston, Lancashire, declaring: 'It’s all paninis and wraps for lunch these days. A man can’t go to work on a wrap!' Meaty: John Clarkson of Preston, Lancashire, is selling what he claims to be the ultimate Northern lunch - a steak pudding, chips, mushy peas and gravy pie. The 1ft-wide dish is thought to contain 2,100 calories . Mr Clarkson, who previously made the . world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter, invented his pie after . seeing a 'gastropub' dish launched by M&S in April. The . fish and chips pie claimed to be the world's first and included an . all-butter shortcrust pastry with minted pea puree, cod chunks, chips . and bechamel tartar sauce for £3.49. But . Mr Clarkson said the pie - which has 531 calories compared to his pie's . estimated 2,100, more than the daily recommendation for women - was 'a . bit hoity-toity'. 'You would need ten of them to fill you,' he said. 'This is proper Northern food.' The . pie being served at Mr Clarkson's Mister Eater's Eating Emporium . centres on a steamed steak suet dish known as a rag pudding. By the slice: Mr Clarkson intends for the £6.99 pie to be shared between two, but it could be scoffed solo . Mouth-watering: The huge pie centres around a steak suet pudding surrounded by chunky chips . The pudding is placed in the centre of . the pie base and surrounded by chunky chips before a hefty dollop of . mushy peas is spread on top. The 1ft-wide creation is then topped with gravy before Mr Clarkson adds a pastry pie lid and puts it in the oven. Because . Mr Clarkson orders his rag puddings from a specialist supplier in . Rochdale, Greater Manchester, customers must pre-order each pie before . coming into the shop. Layering up: Mr Clarkson then adds mushy peas and a generous portion of gravy until the base is full . Finished product: The pie is topped with mushy peas, gravy and a pastry lid before being put in the oven . Side order: The shop owner said customers can accompany their pie with whatever they want - even more chips . Large: Mr Clarkson said his customers were complaining about gastropub pies being the size of cupcakes . Mr Clarkson's pie contains a rag pudding, a traditional dish first eaten in Manchester and the surrounding region during the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s. A former staple of chippy . cuisine, the dish contains minced meat and onions which are wrapped in a suet pastry before being boiled or steamed. Rag puddings were once . cooked in a muslin cloth - a rag - which gave them a striking resemblance . to a small pillow. Nowadays they are similar in preparation and taste to more common steak and kidney puddings. 'This is the real deal,' he said. 'Customers have come in and asked me to do something because they said M&S's are like cupcakes. People want proper food so I did my own version. 'I always look to do things that nobody's done before, and nobody's ever done this. 'We’re showing people how . it’s done. This is meant to feed two but if you could eat one to . yourself go for it and give yourself a pat on the back if you finish.' Mr Clarkson, who runs his shop with his wife Corinne, 39, is known for his food creations which he describes as ‘putting a twist on the ordinary’. As well as battering Ferrero Rochers and mince pies at Christmas time, he has created ‘Spam doughnuts’ and what he claimed was the world’s tallest burger. 'We just want to put a smile on people’s faces,' he said. No frills: John Clarkson created the dish after saying an M&S fish-and-chips pie (pictured) was too small . Tasty: The chip shop meal pie is only the latest of a string of creations by Mr Clarkson and his wife Corinne, 39 . Finishing off: Customers who want to try the pie will have to order one from the chip shop in advance .","John Clarkson serves the hefty meal from his shop in Preston, Lancashire .

"The jobless would be given financial help to move house to find work under a plan to tackle long-term unemployment. Anyone out of work for more than a year would be given cash by their local council to cover the costs of hiring a removals van or paying a deposit on a home. The idea has been drawn up by the Centre for Social Justice think tank, set up by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. People out of work for more than a year could be given financial help to move to areas where there are more jobs . Under the proposal, the long-term unemployed would be given money if they land a job which is more than 90 minutes’ commute from where they live. The CSJ argues that people living on benefits in social housing are much less likely to be in work, and less likely to move to find a job. The plan will draw comparisons with Norman Tebbit’s 1980s suggestion that the jobless should get on their bikes. In 2010, Mr Duncan Smith sparked a row by claiming the unemployed should ‘get on the bus’ and look for work. He cited Merthyr Tydfil in Wales as somewhere where people had become ‘static’ and ‘didn’t know if they got on the bus an hour’s journey they’d be in Cardiff and they could look for the job there Critics condemned the message that people had to move to new areas in the hope of finding work. Mr Duncan Smith set up the CSJ in 2004, after standing down as Tory leader. He stepped down after joining the Coalition government in 2010. However, the CSJ insisted its scheme would be voluntary, and for many moving costs are a major barrier to taking up a job further afield. In a report published today, The Journey To Work, the think tank said the process of relocation for work should be made ‘less financially burdensome’. Current rules mean there is little incentive for the unemployed to look for work in other areas where the labour market is booming. The plan has being drawn up by the Centre for Social Justice think tank, which was set up by Iain Duncan Smith and follows his message in 2010 to jobseekers to ‘get on the bus’ and look for work . Norman Tebbit, who was Employment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher . Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'. But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' never actually said anything of the sort. The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981. A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'. The then Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.' The CSJ said: ‘We recommend the Government pilots a relocation scheme to help with the cost of moving home for work e.g. hiring a removal van or help with an up-front deposit. ‘This scheme would apply to any jobseeker who has been out of work and claiming Housing Benefit for 12 months or more and has received a concrete job offer which would require them to commute further than what is currently expected under existing regulations (90 minutes each way).’ The money could come from the Discretionary Housing Payment currently used by councils to help people claiming Housing Benefit and requiring more help with housing costs. The CSJ calls for the plan to be piloted in areas of high unemployment. ‘To be clear, this is about supporting people to meet their ambition of moving, rather than forcing anyone to do so. ‘Of course this has to be done in a managed way to prevent significant population imbalances, which is why this recommendation is deliberately restricted to the long-term unemployed with a concrete job offer.’ A source at the Department for Work and Pensions said the plan was not being considered at present, but would be looked at by ministers. Official figures show people living in social housing in England are more likely to live in financial poverty and less likely to be employed than home-owners or those living in the private rented sector. Just 35 per cent of working-age social tenants are in full-time employment, compared to 65 per cent of private renters and 81 per cent of homeowners. Tenants in social housing are also less likely to move, the CSJ said. Some four in 10 social renters have been in the same house for at least 10 years, compared to fewer than one in 10 of private renters. Phyllida Culpin, Director of Customer and Community Services at Yarlington Housing Group told the CSJ: ‘The cost of moving can be difficult for people to meet, particularly when they are moving to take up a job after a period of unemployment. ‘We offer assistance to residents with moving costs and we find that our support of £250 can make all the difference between moving or not.’","People out of work for more than a year could be offered council cash .

"Reports of two asylum seeker boats on their way to Australian shores last week raised many questions about whether the claims were true, and if the vessels would be the first to reach Australian shores this year. People want answers about the fate of these boats off Christmas Island, and whether they have been intercepted, but Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has been trying, somewhat unsuccessfully, to keep a lid on the matter. Speaking to Sky News on Monday, Mr Morrison gave a convoluted and confusing response when asked about the boats - which could potentially be the first to make it to Christmas Island since December 19. Scroll down for video . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is still refusing to confirm claims that two asylum seeker boats were intercepted off the cost of Christmas Island . 'Public curiosity is not the same as the public interest and the public interest here that I have to assess is what is in the national interest and what is in the national interest is that we maintain the integrity of an operation that is saving lives at sea and protecting the integrity of our borders,' Mr Morrison said - without taking a single breath. The immigration minister has repeatedly refused to confirm reports over the weekend that two boats were intercepted by Australian authorities off Christmas Island. One is reportedly carrying 153 Tamil asylum seekers, including about 30 children, many of them sick, while the second is said to have 50 people aboard. Refugee advocates said they had been in contact with some of those aboard, but had not heard from the Tamil asylum seekers since Saturday. There are reports that one boat carrying 153 Tamil refugees and another with 50 asylum seekers aboard hit trouble on their way to Australian shores . 'I'm fairly convinced the government will rendezvous to get the Sri Lankan navy to tow them back,' Refugee Action Coalition's Ian Rintoul told AAP. Mr Morrison will only confirm incidents that involve safety of life at sea, such as medical transfers, and has avoided answering any other enquiries. 'There have been no such incidents for me to report over the last few days,' he said. There are reports that one of the vessels may be travelling from India, but the ABC report that local authorities in India are not aware of any Australia-bound boats leaving their shores.

"A convicted murderer who was freed early from jail before he stabbed a mother to death in front of two police officers was told he would die behind bars today. Paul O’Hara, 43,  burst into the home of his terrified girlfriend Cherylee Shennan while the detectives were taking a statement about the vicious beatings he gave her. Despite the officers being there, he ran at the 40-year-old, from Greater Manchester, with a hammer and started battering her. The two officers desperately tried to fend off O'Hara and protect Miss Shennan. Killer: Paul O'Hara (left) stabbed Cherylee Shennan (right) to death as police officers desperately tried to protect her. He had been jailed for 14 years after killing previous lover Janine Waterworth . But as one of them tried to help her escape, O’Hara caught up with them and 'finished off' his lover by calmly stabbing her five times in the street. Paramedics had to work quickly to remove her body from the scene because Ms Shennan’s 12-year-old daughter had been due home from school at any time. In a statement the victim’s family said: 'Our family has been torn apart and tormented by this tragedy and our lives will never be the same again. 'Cherylee will always be loved and we will hold cherished memories forever in our hearts. She will never be forgotten by her family, friends and all that knew her.' The killing in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, occurred two years after O’Hara had been freed on licence having served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering another girlfriend in 1998. The career criminal had a string of convictions for violence dating back to 1989. Loss: O'Hara and Miss Shennan. The court heard how O'Hara, from Heywood, near Rochdale had a 'personality disorder' which fuelled violent rages . When questioned by police he said, 'There’s no point interviewing me I’m not going to say anything' before admitting his motive for murder was because he thought the police were about to recall him to prison. He added: 'She was running down the street scared s**tless. Why didn’t the police help her?' Today Judge Anthony Russell QC ordered O’Hara to serve a whole life term after he admitted murder plus separate charges of wounding one of the officers with intent and assault with intent to resist arrest. The judge praised the two officers for their 'commendable courage' and told O’Hara he would never be released adding: 'This was indeed a most brutal and savage attack. 'You are a very dangerous man, particularly to women with whom you form a relationship.' Earlier . Preston Crown Court heard how O’Hara, from Heywood, near Rochdale had a . 'personality disorder' which fuelled violent rages. After . spells in and out of jail he stabbed former girlfriend Janine . Waterworth, 21, to death just three days after she ended their . relationship. Judge Anthony Russell QC ordered O'Hara to serve a whole life term at Preston Crown Court . Ms Waterworth was knifed 12 times in an ambush close to a bus stop near her home in Oldham after O’Hara armed himself with his grandmother’s carving knife and waited in an alleyway which she used to go to work. Tests showed she had six knife wounds to the front and six to the back of the body and she died at the scene. O’Hara later confessed, saying he had lost his temper in the jealous belief she was seeing someone else. In November 1998 he was jailed for for life but was freed on licence in April 2012 having served 14 years. He got a job at a second hand furniture store which 40-year old mother-of-one Ms Shennan ran with her long term partner and a year later they began an affair. Graham Reeds QC prosecuting said the victim was popular and friendly. He added: 'But it is accurate to say that friends and neighbours noticed that after O’Hara’s visits to her home became more frequent she started to become more reluctant to leave the house.' The first incident that there was violence in the relationship came at the start of November. Her mother Betty and stepfather Johnny went to her house for a bonfire party and found her with a black eye and broken nose. She said she had fallen down the stairs when drunk. Shortly after Christmas Cherylee’s friend Linda Slade came to visit and saw the injuries. The defendant was also present and appeared tense and she said she had fallen down the stairs. Mr Reeds added: 'She later told her friend that he had fractured her jaw and he had threatened her with a knife on two separate occasions. The friend advised her to disengage from him slowly.' In March her mother and stepfather heard of the incident and went to her house to see for themselves, the stepfather rang the police and they arrived at the house. In 1989 sent to young offender’s institute for a variety of offences. In 1991 again sent to young offender’s institute for assault occasioning actual body harm after he hit a person with a baseball bat in the course of a fight. In 1993 he was sent to prison for burglary of a house and when police arrived at the scene he assaulted a police officer. In 1994 he was convicted of assault of a police officer and sent to prison for five months by Oldham Magistrates. In 1994 at Manchester Crown sent to prison for two years for wounding and GBH. This involved him arguing with two women and he wounded one of them and broke the arm of another by throwing her to the floor. Sent to prison for two years. In 1998 he was sentenced to life in prison for murder. The victim was his girlfriend Janine Waterworth and their relationship finished a few days prior to her death. When police arrived she broke down crying she told them that he had fractured her cheekbone fracture a couple of weeks previously and she had been to hospital. But she insisted she didn’t want any action taken against him. The court heard that O’Hara went round to Cherylee’s house on March 17 when two police officers were attending over reported domestic abuse against her. He came into the house shortly after police arrived and was armed with a claw hammer inside a plastic bag. Detective Sergeant Damien McAlister and Detective Constable Karen Kenworthy tried to calm O’Hara down but he started to attack Ms Shennan with the hammer. The court heard that Ms Shennan broke free and went to the back of the house but O’Hara caught up with her and started to strangle her. The police managed to hit him again and one of the officers got her out of the house. O’Hara then went into her kitchen and took a knife and barged through furniture blocking the front door. He chased Ms Shennan and one of the officers but they couldn’t run very fast as they were injured. He caught up to Ms Shennan who was on the floor and stabbed her five times. Witness, Scott Talbot, described the stabbing as 'controlled'. 'Each stab seemed more slow, in and out in a controlled action. After he pulled the knife out it then went in again,' he said. O’Hara was eventually confronted in a nearby garden still armed with the knife and was overpowered with CS spray. Tests showed Cherylee had been stabbed five times in the face, forearm and chest. Det Con Kenworthy said she had never been involved in 'such a frightening or horrific incident in 22 years service'. She had bruising to several places on her body but was able to return to work. Sgt McAllister had a two inch laceration to his forehead and puncture wounds to his temple and bridge of his nose which required 20 stitches. He later said he felt more upset he had not been able to get Ms Shennan away. In mitigation for O’Hara, defence counsel Tony Cross QC said: 'These are very grave crimes and the grim reality of the defendant’s position is the mitigation is his guilty plea to the murder and the guilty pleas to the other matters.' Speaking after the hearing Detective Supt Eddie Thistlethwaite, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Force Major Investigation Team, led the inquiry. He said: 'This was a truly horrendous incident which cost a young woman her life. O’Hara is a predatory and violent individual who manipulated his victims including Cherylee, praying on their craving for love and attention. 'He has shown no or little remorse throughout this process and his actions fully justify the sentence which has been imposed. 'I would like to thank the Crown Prosecution Service and Counsel for all their hard work which has resulted in today’s guilty pleas. O’Hara’s admission has at least spared the families the ordeal of having to re-live these tragic events through a trial. 'I would also like to praise the bravery of all police officers, PCSOs, and paramedics who attended what was a horrific scene. 'Special thanks must go to Detective Sergeant Damien McAlister and Detective Constable Karen Kenworthy who fought with O’Hara in the vain attempt to save the life of Cherylee. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the family and friends of Cherylee. They have shown enormous dignity and bravery throughout this ordeal.","Paul O'Hara, 43, first attacked Cherylee Shennan with a hammer .

"An Australian woman has spoken out claiming that Rolf Harris groped her in 2008 while they were posing for a photograph at a function. Louise Anton, from West Australia, has said that when she objected to being groped by Rolf Harris was told by the veteran entertainer 'Yeah but it feels good, dunnit?', it's been alleged. Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986 on Monday. He is due to be sentenced on Friday and the judge has warned him that he will probably receive a jail sentence. Another 15 women have claimed the former TV presenter harassed them in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Malta dating back to the late 1960s, including Louise Anton from Western Australia who has spoken publicly for the first time in the wake of Harris's conviction in London, telling Sky News UK that the entertainer indecently assaulted her in Australia in 2008. Scroll down for video . Rolf Harris posed with a picture of Louise Anton (right) at a function in Sydney in 2008 and allegedly assaulted her while the photograph was being taken . 'I know first-hand how quickly he can move and he knows exactly what he's doing,' Ms Anton told Sky News. 'I could feel as plain as day his hand running down my back and it rested on the top of my bottom. 'And then he slid his fingers down in between, and did that several times, and I just couldn't believe what was happening.' Ms Anton, from Perth, said she glared at Harris and said: 'Are you right?' 'He looked at me and said ""Yeah but it feels good, dunnit?"" with this smirk on his face. Everything just started spinning and I just couldn't believe this had happened,' said Ms Anton. Other Australian women have come forward claiming Harris assaulted them. Former Perth radio host Jane Marwick claims the celebrity grabbed her breast in 2001 while posing for a photo after an interview. At the time Ms Marwick thought it was 'inappropriate behaviour by a grubby old man' but said if she'd known Harris allegedly abused people 'of very tender years' she would have taken action. Former ABC radio host Verity James also alleged Harris groped her in the late 1990s or early 2000s. 'He kind of pushes you up against a wall in a big hug, grabbing at the buttocks and rubbing on your breasts,' Ms James said in late May.

Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris leaving Southwark Crown Court yesterday, with his wife Alwen, daughter Bindi (right) and niece Jenny (left), after being found guilty of 12 sex charges involving four women . 'I feel gutted and dismayed but it's very important that we do everything we humanly can to protect vulnerable young people,' Mr Abbott told ABC radio about Rolf Harris's guilty verdict. 'Sexual abuse is an utterly abhorrent crime,' Mr Abbott said. 'It's just sad and tragic that this person who was admired seems to have been a perpetrator.' Harris was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986 on Monday. He is due to be sentenced on Friday. Three of the counts Rolf Harris was convicted on this week pertained to Tonya Lee, a 43-year-old Australian, who told the court that Rolf Harris fondled her on a visit to London when she was 15.As she sat on his lap in a pub, Harris, then 56, indecently touched her. Terrified, she fled to the toilets but when she emerged, he pinned her up to a wall and molested her. 'I don't know how he sleeps at night,' she told A Current Affair in May. 'He touched me, he fondled me, I was absolutely petrified and I just wanted to scream but I didn't. 'He must be able to switch between two personalities like a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde sort of thing.' Traumatised, Ms Lee stopped eating and then endured a 16-year battle with anorexia, alcoholism and bulimia. Ms Lee later attempted to end her life with a cocktail of laxatives and alcohol. Australian producer Paul Redman, told Sky News he worked with Harris on a number of shows and knew of his wandering hands. He would reportedly warn female colleagues to stay clear of the star they nicknamed 'the octopus'. 'I used to warn girls, ""Just look, be careful,""' Mr Redman said. 'Don't go for the cuddle at the end because he has been known to grope.' The producer revealed that not many women believed him 'and unfortunately to their detriment that's why I know six girls who have been touched by Rolf'. The allegations come as it has emerged that the jury in Rolf Harris's child sex abuse trial didn't get to hear from a further nine women who claim the entertainer harassed them. The prosecution wanted to call seven of the women as bad character witnesses alongside six others who did give evidence during the eight-week trial in London. But most were ruled inadmissible during legal argument at Southwark Crown Court. Justice Nigel Sweeney didn't allow jurors to see footage of one English TV presenter who claimed Harris put his hand up her skirt while she was interviewing him live on air in the mid-1990s. During pre-trial legal argument, prosecutor Sasha Wass QC said watching the footage it was clear from the woman's reaction what was going on just out of shot. Rolf Harris was driven away from court yesterday in his limousine. He will return for sentencing on Friday and the judge has said he is likely to receive a custodial sentence . One potential witness claims she was working as a barmaid at a party for the broadcaster Michael Parkinson in 2005 when Harris kissed her in front of his wife Alwen. Harris allegedly grabbed the young woman as she was clearing up and started kissing her. A decade earlier, in the mid-1990s, the star attended a fete at Bray where he's lived since the early 1980s. He was allegedly in a tent signing autographs when he told a 13 or 14-year-old girl he liked her jumper and wanted to see what was under it. In 1991, another potential bad character witness met Harris during an art class in Belfast when she asked if she could interview him for the BBC. With children and a camera crew watching the artist allegedly pressed himself against her and stuck his tongue into her mouth. 'She felt disgusted and dirty and described him as opportunistic and predatory,' Ms Wass told the court during pre-trial legal argument. In 2001, a 20-year-old woman who looked younger than that allegedly met Harris at an art competition at Kensington Olympia. The celebrity pinched her bottom as they posed for a photograph, the court but not the jury heard. She looked at him angrily, but he simply shrugged. A 24-year-old with psychological problems was allegedly abused in 1999 when she met Harris while on holiday with friends. 'In the villa he was staying in he came upon her in the garden, put his hand inside her skirt and touched her buttocks,' Ms Wass said. 'On another occasion he came to where she was staying, went into her room while she was having a nap and got into bed with her.' The court heard he digitally penetrated her, performed oral sex on her and got her to do the same to him. Finally, a woman says she met the Australian at a motel near Sydney in 1977. She was 14 and Harris was visiting with fellow celebrity Harry Butler. The alleged victim says Harris touched her bottom and declared: 'Rolfie deserves a cuddle.' He subsequently followed her to a lift where he held her and touched her breast before she managed to escape. Rolf Harris has been kicked out of the ARIA Hall of Fame after being convicted of sexual abuse. ARIA chief executive Dan Rosen told AAP on Tuesday that the board had decided to withdraw the award following his conviction in the UK courts. Harris was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame, which acknowledges artists for their contributionto the culture of the Australian music industry, in 2008. The entertainer was also stripped of his BAFTA Fellowship and his CBE from the queen.","Rolf Harris has been convicted of 12 charges of indecent assault .

"Acclaimed headteacher: Anne Lakey denies having sex with a 13-year-old boy in the 1980s . An acclaimed headteacher accused of having sex with a 13-year-old boy in the 1980s told a jury she was 'shocked and horrified' when her accuser emailed her school with his claims. Anne Lakey, 54, told Durham Crown Court she believed the message from the complainant was a hoax, and said that the alleged abuse had not happened. The married mother-of-one from Stanley, County Durham, denies four counts of indecency with a child under 14 and five counts of indecent assault against a child under 16. The charges all relate to the same boy, who was one of a group who would visit her home. The complainant, who was not a pupil of hers, claims Lakey, then a teacher in her 20s, seduced him in his school uniform after allowing him to watch her bathe. Giving evidence earlier in the trial, he told the jury that matters progressed from a game of dare on a previous occasion when he fondled her. He said on other occasions, as their relationship continued over a period of months, they had oral sex. The offences are said to have happened in the late 1980s. Lakey, chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools which the jury has heard were formerly failing comprehensives in ex-mining villages and now among the most improved in the country, denies she was ever alone with him at her home. In December 2012, he spotted her picture on the internet and read a blog about her educational beliefs, in which it was stated that  Lakey was committed to giving young people the best chance in life. In anger, he then sent a message to the school accusing her of having sex with him as a teenager, the court was told. The complainant came forward in 2012 after seeing a piece of literature which said that . Julie Clemitson, defending, asked Lakey how she reacted to the email. 'When I was first made aware, it was just utter disbelief,' she replied. 'It was not true, therefore (I was) shocked and horrified. 'My chair of governors was on site. I called him in.' She said the email had been a hoax, adding 'it had not happened.' The complainant claimed Lakey sometimes telephoned his school pretending to be his mother, and said he was ill when he played truant to be with her. Lakey denied this, and said she was unaware he was skipping school, explaining: 'I would have said it’s not an all right thing to do.' 'Horrified': Lakey denies she was ever alone with the boy at her home, and said she was 'shocked and horrified' when he accused her . Denial: Lakey told Durham Crown Court (pictured) she believed the message from the complainant was a hoax, and said that the alleged abuse had 'not happened' Caroline Goodwin, prosecuting, asked: 'Why on earth would he be saying you had done these things to him?' Lakey replied: 'I don’t know why he is doing these things, if I said it would be speculation. 'I have no idea why (he) has put this allegation forward. 'When I got the email at school I was shocked, it wasn’t true. 'My instinct at the time it was (motivated by) money, but that’s speculation.' Lakey became the head teacher at Deerness Valley Comprehensive in 2001 which later became one of two schools to form the Durham Federation of Schools. Under Lakey’s leadership the school boasted GCSE pass rates of 80 per cent in 2013 against 26 per cent the year before, and it was named the country’s most improved secondary school last year. She was described as an ‘inspiring leader’ by the Chief Inspector of Education after improving GCSE pass rates at her struggling school by focusing on vocational education. But she was suspended from her position as chief executive of the Durham Federation of Schools last December after the allegations came to light. Lakey, who was appointed to the national leaders of education, a body charged with transforming struggling schools, entered teaching in 1982. The trial continues.

"It took four burly men to move a giant 166-kilogram Galapagos tortoise onto a truck so it could be moved for its annual weigh in today - possibly the biggest of the species in Australia. The 63-year-old named Hugo lives at the Australian Reptile Park on NSW's Central Coast and was taken to a nearby vet with industrial scales. Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner said it was not an easy task moving such a massive animal, which could be the largest in Australia. 'I think it's likely he one of the biggest and quite possibly he would be up there with the heaviest, if not the heaviest,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Four Australian Reptile Park keepers moved a gigantic 166-kilogram Galapagos tortoise onto a truck so it could be weighed at a nearby vet today . Named Hugo, the 63-year-old tortoise  was found to be in good health and put on one-kilogram since last year . 'Four big men moving 166 kilograms - each man taking a 40 kilogram portion or more is quite a bit to carry,' he said. Once at the vet, a forklift was used to get the gigantic animal off the truck and carrots were used to coax the huge animal  on to the scales by the four reptile keepers. Tipping the scales at 166 kilograms, the tortoise's weight increased by one-kilogram on last year's weigh in and Mr Faulkner said this was a sign of good health. 'He's considered a teenager turning into a man. He's in the prime of this life, they can live up to 150 to 200 years,' he said. Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner said the believed the tortoise could be the heaviest in Australia . A Galapagos tortoise can live up to 200 years Mr Faulkner said . 'The fact that he's put on a kilo, it's nice but we're not trying to get him to put it on - the weigh in is a condition of health. It's about maintenance to make sure he's retaining and keeping the weight.' Mr Faulkner said it was a slow process for the animals to put on weight because they do not eat a lot and any significant weight loss could indicate ill health. 'This is a great result for Hugo and means that he's really healthy,' he said. 'Hugo's habits haven't changed, which usually indicate abnormalities. He's a happy, healthy and very outgoing tortoise.' The Galapagos tortoise is from the Galapagos Islands, located about 900km west of Ecuador off the South American coast. Once off the truck, the men used carrots, Hugo's favourite food, to coax him onto the industrial scales so he could be weighed . Despite being in his 60s, Mr Faulkner said Hugo, pictured, was considered in his prime with many years still to come . Each Galapagos island has its own unique sub-species, although some have been destroyed due to feral species being introduced which destroy native vegetation and humans giving native animals food. The Galapagos tortoise, which is the largest of its species, is classified as 'vulnerable' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. They can reach nearly two metres in length and weigh up to 400 kilograms.

"Tropical Storm Arthur is the first storm of the hurricane season - and it's roaring up the eastern seaboard just in time to ruin Fourth of July cookouts and fireworks for most of the Northeast. The squall, which is currently about 95 miles off Cape Canaveral, Florida, was upgraded to a tropical storm late this morning and has the potential to strength into a hurricane as it approaches the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Arthur will bring coastal flooding, rough surf, thunderstorms and heavy downpours from the Carolinas to New England later on Friday, with the worst of the weather expected to hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina early on Independence Day. Rains are expected to drench most of the Interstate 95 corridor during the holiday commute on Thursday, as well. The tropical storm could hit Friday night in the New York City area - turning fireworks shows in a damp squib . Tropical Storm Arthur was centered about 95 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Tuesday. It was upgraded from a tropical depression on Tuesday morning . 'Right now it’s predicted to be a strong tropical storm, possibly a hurricane as it moves through the Outer Banks. And that’s going to cause a lot of problems for people to get out onto some of those roads and beaches out there,' AccuWeather senior meteorologist Paul Walker told MailOnline Tuesday. Most of the East Coast will also experience rough, possibly dangerous, conditions on the beaches as the storm passes by. 'All along the Eastern Seaboard, there is going to be rough surf and rip currents. It's going to be a threat for swimmers,' Mr Walker said. Forecasters hope the storm will break for the Mid-Atlantic on Friday night in time for some fireworks displays. However, it's remains possible that Arthur will turn the Fourth of July into a damp squib. The tropical storm will also likely rub up against a storm front that's rolling eastward from the Midwest, resulting in even more rain and thunderstorms. Tropical Depression One has since been upgraded to Tropical Storm Arthur. It is expected to batter the Outer Banks on Friday . The storm could cause havoc from North Carolina to New England, through it appears the heaviest rain and strongest winds will hit North Carolina and Virginia . 'As tropical moisture interacts with the front, very heavy downpours may erupt along the I-95 corridor late in the week,' AccuWeather Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok said. There's still hope for a break in the weather just in time for Friday night's Fourth of July celebrations for much of the northeast corridor. 'If the tropical system takes a northeastward turn late in the week, as we suspect, rain and thunderstorms will begin to shift eastward and out to sea Friday afternoon and evening so that the weather improves for fireworks Friday night from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia and New York City,' Pastelok said. The tropical storm is expected to push out to sea on Saturday - leaving the rest of the holiday weekend sunny and pleasantly warm. A rainy Thursday commute will greet many East Coast travelers who are hoping to make it to their holiday destinations . Rain is expected across much of the East Coast, Southeast and in the Rocky Mountains on Friday - though it could clear up in time for fireworks . Beautiful weekend: The tropical storm is expected to clear away by Saturday, leaving nearly all the country to sunny skies . A tropical storm watch is in effect for Florida's east coast from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach. The depression is centered about 95 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. It's been nearly stationary over the last few hours but a northwestward motion is expected to begin later in the day. Elsewhere in the country, scattered thunderstorms are predicted on Friday for parts of the Rocky Mountains and Texas and Oklahoma, Mr Walker said. Meanwhile in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Elida is meandering off Mexico's southwestern coast. Elida's maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph with some weakening forecast. A tropical storm warning is effect for Mexico's coast from Lazaro Cardenas to Cabo Corrientes.","Tropical Storm Arthur is expected to bring heavy rains, flooding and thunderstorms to the east coast from North Carolina to New England later this week .

"The sight of millions of stars would be enough to humble most people - never mind experienced photographer Craig Richards, who made a six-hour round trip to capture this incredible panorama of the Milky Way on a bitterly cold night. Dressed in a thick jacket and boots, the 42-year-old drove from his home in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, to Holy Island off the Northumberland Coast just after 1am on a mission to capture something very special. There he set up his Nikon D800e, complete with a wide-angle lens, and took eight carefully-planned shots which he digitally stitched together after he returned home at 7am - to a full day's work in his other job as a web designer. Scroll down for video . The perfect shot: Photographer Craig Richards spent hours capturing this image from Holy Island off the Northumberland coast on a chilly winter's night. The conditions had to be just right - with clear skies, low tides, no moon and winter conditions - before he could take his eight images which he painstakingly stitched together . As the Milky Way emits so little . light compared to factors like streetlights, the moon and the glow of . sunset, the freelance photographer had to plan his photo carefully. 'An image such as this requires lots of variables to be . in place including the right time of year for the Milky Way to be seen . off the east coast,' he said. 'It was a bitterly cold night,' said Mr Richards (pictured). 'I needed a big winter jacket, winter trousers, big boots, gloves, hat and of course my flask of coffee!' 'This tends to be during February through to mid May - any later with the . early rising sun, you get to much 'sun' pollution in the night sky at . around the time you'd expect to see the Milky Way. 'No moon, as the moon . sheds too much light into the night sky and of course clear skies.' On the night of his visit in March, he figured out the moon would be setting at 3.30am - just in time for the Milky Way to rise. Then there was the tide - with its famous Lindisfarne Castle which can be seen in the background, Holy Island is detached from the mainland and could only be reached via a narrow causeway when the water was low, at 2am. And lastly, there was his one-year-old grandson, who Mr Richards put to bed and left with the rest of his family before creeping quietly out of the house. 'It was a bitterly cold night,' said Mr Richards. 'I needed a big winter jacket, winter trousers, big boots, gloves, hat and of course my flask of coffee!' He set up his camera on a tripod and using a head torch, he cast light on the upturned fisherman's boats in the foreground for his 28-second exposures - something which drew some unwanted attention from the police. An officer crossed over to the island and questioned him. 'I guess a strange man stood out by the boat sheds with a head torch is a bit suspicious!' he said. 'He was suitably impressed when I showed him a couple of the images from the back of my camera.' He added: 'At 5.30am after packing up, I headed back home - stopping off at McDonald's for a well deserved breakfast and cappuccino, eventually arriving back home at around 7:30am - ready to start a regular day's work! 'I didn't even look at the images on the Mac until around lunchtime, at which point I was bouncing with joy over what I'd captured.' Streetlights could not be avoided entirely - the yellow light to the left of the award-winning shot is from the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, while the right hand side shows Bamburgh. But Mr Richards said: 'I’m utterly over the moon with the final images and people’s reactions have been extremely complimentary. 'It’s . been my best-selling piece of work to date. The image really comes to . life when you see it as a large, high-quality print.'","Craig Richards, 42, put his one-year-old grandson to bed before driving out to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne .

"A 72-year-old woman got a shocker Sunday when her Dell laptop exploded on her while sitting at her desk . Loretta Luff of Langhorne Manor, Pennsylvania says she was in the middle washing of loads of laundry when she sat down at her living room desk to check emails and play spider solitaire on the 6-year-old laptop, a gift from her daughter. Unexpectedly, the laptop blew backwards and send battery acid flying as far as six to eight feet away.

On the right, burn spots are visible on the floor near Mrs Luff's living room desk . When she got up, Mrs Luff stepped on a mini fire that started, burning her foot. Mrs Luff was able to douse the patches of flames erupting all over the carpet with water from her toy poodles' dog bowl, and responding firefighters put out the rest of the hot spots. Mrs Luff was taken to the hospital where she was treated for first- and second-degree chemical burns to her face, arm and foot. She was released later that night.

She says she's just glad she was at home when the computer exploded, as she fears it could have burned the house down if it weren't for her quick action. When she gets a new computer, she's going to be taking the battery out every night.

"Nathan Eames was left an offensive voicemail message by a Natwest employee after he was turned down for a loan . NatWest has apologised after a business manager accidentally left a three-minute message on a customer's answerphone, mocking his financial situation and calling him a 'k**b'. Nathan Eames, 39, received a call from a business team manager at the bank to discuss his 'feedback' after he was turned down for a loan. The call went straight to answerphone and the business manager left a polite message requesting he call her back. But the business bank manager then failed to hang up properly and, unaware the voicemail was still recording, immediately began joking with colleagues and mocking Mr Eames. She joked: 'God, I'm glad he wasn't there, 'cause he's a k**b.' Mr Eames, who declared himself bankrupt in 2009 due to the financial downturn, said he was 'shocked' at the message. The freelance photographer said: 'I was appalled when I listened to the message. I couldn't believe what I heard. 'Being . rejected for a loan is one thing - but being subjected to a torrent of . abuse by ignorant people, completely lacking in empathy and compassion . for my situation, is quite another.' Mr Eames, from Poole, Dorset, declared himself bankrupt in January 2009 after falling into financial difficulties during the economic slump. After getting himself back on his feet, he contacted his local NatWest branch in January to enquire about a £10,000 short-term business loan to enable him to buy a photography studio. His application was turned down and he was told that he had not been discharged long enough from bankruptcy. He didn't let the setback get to him and instead he began putting money aside each month in the hope that he could then fund his dream. Two weeks ago, NatWest got back in touch with him and asked him to fill out a customer satisfaction survey. Mr Eames said he told the bank he felt they should consider giving loans to applicants whose bankruptcy had been fully discharged after five years. One week later, on June 22, he was called back by the bank to discuss his feedback. It is believed the call was made by a worker at the Salisbury branch of the bank in Wiltshire . He didn't take the call but got a message on his voicemail from 'Sarah', a Natwest 'business specialist'. She said: 'Yeah hi, a message for Nathan, it's Sarah, the Business Specialist at the Natwest in Salisbury. 'It's just a quick courtesy call following your feedback on the 2nd of June with the monthly business banking survey. 'If you could give us a call back and ask to speak to the North Dorset business team, thanks then, bye.' The caller then thought she had hung up and said to her colleagues: 'God, I'm glad he wasn't there, 'cause he's a knob. 'He's complaining but it's so clear. It says.. No, no, he's put on here 'as ex-bankrupt I do not get anything from you' Her colleagues are heard laughing in the background as she adds: 'Start considering lending to ex-bankrupts are his comments.' Natwest has apologised to Mr Eames and says it is investigating the incident and the members of staff involved . After listening to the abuse, furious Mr Eames said: 'Going bankrupt was an extremely difficult decision for me but, at the time, I didn't feel I had any other choice. 'But the bankruptcy was completely discharged and, for the past five years, I have been trying to get back on my feet. 'So to hear someone, who doesn't know me, insulting and mocking me to colleagues was completely unjustified and demoralising. 'Natwest . should train all their staff to understand the complexities of going . bankrupt. It was the hardest thing I have ever done.' 'I'm . now considering closing my business bank account with Natwest. I'm not . prepared to give them my business when they obviously hold me in such . low esteem.' A Natwest spokesperson said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Mr Eames.

"A teenager who killed herself the day after a social worker assessed her as not posing a high risk to herself was 'failed by professionals from all agencies', a damning report says. Helena Farrell, 15, hanged herself at a beauty spot near her home in Kendal, Cumbria on January 4, 2013, the day after she was seen by a social worker at Cumbria's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). The teenager, a pupil at Kirkbie Kendal School, in Kendal, was academically very able and gifted in sports and music, playing hockey and also attending the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Helena Farrell was 'failed by professionals from all agencies', according to a new report into her death . Helena's father, Enda Farrell, and his wife, Maria, feel their daughter was let down by by the system . An inquest into her death heard last week that Helena, who had suffered from bulimia after and alleged sex attack on a school trip and who was upset over a failed relationship, had taken an overdose, self-harmed, and written letters of farewell to friends of relatives . But Helena, whose mother, Maria, is a GP, had not been deemed to be a risk to herself, and a referral to a mental health service near her home led to no action being taken for a month.  When she did see a CAMHS social worker, she was judged to be posing no imminent risk to herself. A new report of a review into Helena's death and the events leading up to it was published today by Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board. The report, in which Helena is referred to as 'Child J', slams the social workers who dealt with her for blaming her behaviour on 'a normal histrionic adolescent response' to her failed relationship. It says: 'The failure of professionals from all agencies to recognise the full extent of Child J's difficulties and take protective action is at first baffling in the face of mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide.' The 42-page review identified a 'lack of knowledge among a range of professionals' about the evidence for high-risk indicators for teenage suicide leaving them 'ill-equipped' to recognise the signs and respond accordingly. Let down: Helena displayed 'mounting evidence that she was at high risk of suicide', the review report said . And it said there was a 'lack of appreciation of the ""inner world of teenagers""' and 'false reassurance' that children would receive the help they needed. The report also questioned whether health professionals relied on the ability of Helena's parents, 'apparently engaged, professional parents', to protect her, and whether this affected their judgement in deciding on the need for intervention in Helena's case. Helena's parents, Enda and Maria Farrell, who are originally from Galway, Ireland, have said they felt their daughter was let down by the system supposed to help children and young people suffering mental anguish. And during the inquest last week, Coroner for south and east Cumbria, Ian Smith, heard that the CAMHS was in disarray. Richard Simpson, assistant director (children's services) for Barnardo's Cumbria and chairman of Cumbria Local Safeguarding Children Board at the time of the report's writing, said: 'The review report asks some serious and difficult questions for which there are few simple or straightforward answers. The teenager's problems had been written off as 'normal, histrionic adolescent response' by professionals . 'It is impossible to guarantee that a situation like this will not happen again, but the action plan that has been developed is our considered response to the findings and outlines the steps that will be taken to minimise that risk as far as possible. 'When any child dies it is a tragedy, but especially so in these circumstances. If there are families or young people out there struggling with similar issues, I strongly encourage them seek out help.' NHS Cumbria Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) clinical GP lead, children and safeguarding, Dr Amanda Boardman, said: 'Helena was a beautiful and talented young lady and will be deeply missed by all that knew her. 'Working with our partners, we are responding to the changing needs of children and teenagers in a world unrecognisable 20 years ago. 'The explosion of social media and pressures felt by young people has never been greater, and we are adapting and changing the services designed to protect children and young people to meet their needs.'

"Islamist militants fighting for ISIS appear to have released another propaganda video - this time showing a laughing jihadist mocking U.S. president Barack Obama. The 15-minute long professionally edited video, filmed somewhere along the rebel-controlled border between Iraq and Syria, shows an unidentified fighter pulling up to the camera in a Ford 350 pick-up truck and asking: 'Obama, did you prepare enough diapers for your soldiers?'. The slick video clip carries the logo of the AlHayat Media Center - the propaganda division of ISIS, which was also responsible for last month's slick recruitment video featuring three young British jihadists pleading with other Western Muslims to join them in the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Joke: The professionally edited video shows an unidentified fighter pulling up to the camera in a Ford 350 pick-up truck and asking: 'Obama, did you prepare enough diapers for your soldiers?' Jihadist: The bulk of the video features Abu Saffiya, an apparent ISIS militant who claims he comes from Chile and speaks in near-perfect English, albeit with an accent . Symbolism: Much of the video features a rant by Abu Saffiyah about the Sykes-Picot agreement. He then crosses the border and steps on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander's office . The bulk of the video - which is titled 'The End of Sykes-Picot' - features Abu Saffiya, an apparent ISIS militant who claims he comes from Chile and speaks in perfect English, albeit with an accent. Standing along the now effectively redundant border between Iraq and Syria, Saffiya begins a long rant about the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement - the secret pact between Britain and France that resulted in the carving up of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. Saffiya breaks into a long tirade about how ISIS' lightning advance through eastern Syria and North East Iraq has effectively destroyed the borders quietly drawn up by the Allied forces, before issuing a warning that ISIS plans on extending the territory under its control. The Sykes-Picot agreement features prominently in ISIS propaganda - most notably in last week's fourth edition of the militant group's slick English-language weekly magazine, which tells the story of the aftermath of the First World War through a distinctly Islamist perspective. Boastful: Saffiyah shows flags and military badges that were left behind by government troops when they fled the border. He then mocks the mainly Shi'ite forces for displaying swords on their clothing . One disturbing scene shows a room full of traumatised Shi'ite prisoners (pictured). Standing over them in a cramped room with no windows, Saffiya abuses the men for 'worshiping Lucifer', before locking the door . Transport: Saffiya boasts that ISIS now holds scores of U.S.-supplied vehicles that were stolen from government soldiers and border guards when the jihadists swept into Iraq's second city Mosul . One of the major claims repeated in pro-ISIS propaganda is that the militants are 'correcting' wrongs established by the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement. The secret pact between Britain and France - which resulted in the carving up of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War - is mentioned in most material released by ISIS' Al Hayat Media Center. Indeed this latest video is even titled 'The End of Sykes-Picot'. The 1916 agreement effectively divided the Arab provinces of the Ottoman . Empire outside the Arabian peninsula into areas of future British and . French control. The secret agreement is seen by many as a turning point in Western-Arab relations, as it broke a number of promises made to Muslim rulers about the founding of a caliphate in Greater Syria. Now, almost 100 years on, ISIS uses these broken promises as a rallying cry - saying the borders drawn up by the pact represent ongoing non-Muslim influence in the Middle East. Sykes-Picot also failed to take account of different ethnic groups in the region - creating new countries that were already steeped in sectarian divisions. The caliphate ISIS said it had established on Sunday was partially declared to remove the internationally recognised borders established by Sykes-Picot. This has the twin-effect of diminishing non-Muslim influence on Middle Eastern geography, and strengthening the authority of Sunni Muslims in North Iraq. After symbolically crossing the border and stepping on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander's office, Saffiya begins talking about the Iraqi government soldiers that deserted their posts in the face of the ISIS advance. He shows military badges that were removed from discarded uniforms, and mocks the mainly Shi'ite forces for displaying swords on their clothing. 'As you can see there are weapons and swords and the Iraqi flag, but they are nothing but cowards they only run away,' he says. 'The soldiers, they took these [badges] . off with their uniforms and they threw the uniforms in the streets and . ran away like they were civilians. They are cowards,' he adds. This video then cuts to a disturbing scene - which Saffiya jokes is 'exclusive footage' - appearing to show a room full of traumatised Shi'ite prisoners. Standing over them in a cramped room with no windows, Saffiya verbally abuses the men for 'worshiping Lucifer', before locking the door. The clip then shows Saffiya and a group of men destroying an abandoned police station with explosives. Saffiya goes on to boast that ISIS now holds scores of U.S.-supplied vehicles that were stolen from government soldiers and border guards when the jihadists swept into Iraq's second city Mosul. He jokes that the U.S. has spent billions in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and, rather than make the region safer, has only succeeded in indirectly providing militants with vehicles and weapons. 'Look at how much money America spends to fight Islam and it ends up being in our pockets,' Saffiyah says. The clip . then cuts to the scene on the ISIS fighter pulling up to the camera in . the Ford pick-up truck and mocking U.S. president Barack Obama. Daring . the American military to take on ISIS, the militant says U.S. soldiers . would be too terrified to take on the rebel forces, suggesting they . would need to pack nappies if they intervene in Iraq. The slick video clip carries the logo of the AlHayat Media Center - the propaganda division of ISIS, which was also responsible for last month's slick recruitment video featuring three young British jihadists (pictured) Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded allegiance from Muslims around the world . Leader:  ISIS has declared its chief, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured left and right), the head of the new caliphate under the name Caliph Ibrahim and called on all Muslims around the world to swear loyalty to him . Caliphate: A map purportedly showing the areas ISIS plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online. As well as the Middle East, North Africa and large areas of Asia, it also reveals ISIS' ambition to extend into Europe. Spain, which was Muslim-ruled until the late 15th Century, would form part of the caliphate, as would the Balkan states and eastern Europe, up to and including Austria . The . video emerged just two days after ISIS formally declared the territory . it controls in the Middle East to be a caliphate, and announced its . leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the new leader of all the world's . Muslims. The chilling announcement was described as the 'most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11'. Upon declaring a caliphate, the Sunni . militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in Iraq . and Syria has been branded too extreme even by Al Qaeda - demanded . allegiance from Muslims around the world. With brutal efficiency, ISIS has carved . out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border . between Iraq and Syria and laid the foundations of its proto-state. Now that it feels it has secure the . territory under its control, the group announced it would be changing . its name from the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (also known as the . Levant), to just the Islamic State, in order to appear less regional. ISIS militants are in possession of a massive long-distance ballistic missile, supporters of the jihadist group have claimed. Photographs . show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by . masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the . new Sunni Muslim caliphate. Supporters . of the group - which changed its name to the Islamic State upon . declaring the establishment of a caliphate on Sunday - said the missile . was a Scud, although experts analysing the images believe the weapon is . almost certainly inoperable and highly unlikely to pose a threat. Missile: Photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the Syrian city of Raqqa - the proclaimed capital of the new Sunni Muslim caliphate . The weapon . pictured being paraded by ISIS militants in Raqqa is believed to have . been captured from another rebel group, the Free Syrian Army. The . FSA are understood to have acquired the Soviet-built missile when it . captured a military base from government forces in the Deir ez-Zor . region of Syria last September. It is not . known how the weapon ended up in the hands of ISIS, but social media . accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in Iraq and Syria . claimed they are now preparing it for use.

"Washing and peeling potatoes for the Sunday roast can be a time-consuming task, especially if you have 1kg of potatoes to prepare. However, one Danish man has found an ingenious solution to slash the time needed to peel the spuds using just a bucket, a hose, a drill and a toilet brush. Leo Lund from Grasten came up with the idea to use the everyday household items so he could prepare the potatoes within just 50 seconds ready to be cooked. Scroll down for video . Starting off with a 1kg bag of potatoes, left, Leo Lund tips them into a bucket, right, and lines up his drill, with a toilet brush attached and his hose . Mr Lund then places the drill brush inside the bucket, left, and then blasts the potatoes with the water from his hose . In a video, Mr Lund can be seen taking his large bag of unwashed and unpeeled potatoes and placing them in a bucket. He then picks up a power drill, which he has attached a stiff toilet brush to the end of it. Mr Lund then blasts the potatoes with the hose, while at the same time holding the drill with the brush attached inside the bucket. The potatoes then go into a spin as the force of the drill and hose begin to wash and peel them . After a minute of the potatoes being spun, he then drains away the excess water ready to reveal the spuds . He then tips the potatoes, which have been cleaned and peeled into a pan ready to be cooked . He continues to hose down the spuds while using the drill brush to quickly peel them. And less than a minute later, he pours out the excess water to reveal his washed and peeled potatoes, which he places into a pan. Mr Lund then posted the video of his potato peeling on to his Facebook page and entitled his video, 'How to fix 1 kg of new potatoes ready for the pot in about 50 seconds, rather lazy than stupid.' The footage has now gone viral on the social network already receiving more than 17,000 likes and being shared over 100,000 times since it was posted last week.","Leo Lund from Grasten, Denmark came up with idea to quickly peel potatoes .

"The Wu-Tang-affiliated rapper who chopped off his own penis has revealed that he wants to star in a porn movie to prove that his manhood remains fully functional. Andre Johnson - who goes by the stage . name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar - was reportedly high on drugs . when the bizarre April incident occurred. Bearer spoke to TMZ outside a Long Beach barber shop on Monday and was happy to tell them that his genitals had recovered from the self-inflicted incident. Scroll down for video . Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, has revealed that he wants to star in a porn movie to prove that his manhood remains fully functional . ‘Does it work?!? Can Chris Brown dance? Can Kanye West rant? Can Jay Z fight off a trick?’ said Bearer when asked about his injuries. Bearer also admitted that he was high on PCP when the incident happened, before he made a plea to the adult entertainment company Vivid to feature him on one of its X-rated movies. Founder and co-chairman of Vivid Entertainment, Steve Hirsch, has reportedly told TMZ that he is definitely interested in featuring Bearer but wants to check out his injuries before making an offer. Newly-released audio from the 911 call has revealed the witnesses' shock and disbelief after the rapper's self-castration and leap from a second-floor balcony of a North Hollywood apartment. 'We have a friend over here and… we don’t know if he’s alive or not [after jumping from] the second floor… I don’t believe this s**t,' said the unidentified person. The caller claimed he and a couple friends were on the balcony when Johnson jumped from the balcony. High on drugs: Seen here performing as Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, Johnson was reportedly high on angel dust at the time he jumped . It was later reported the 40-year-old rapper was high on the drug PCP, also known as angel dust. The psychedelic is known for causing people to jump from ledges because they think they can fly. Loud screaming can be heard in the background. The person on the phone claims it is Johnson. He also says at least one child who witnessed the ordeal, but it is not clear if either of his daughters was present. 'I guess he’s alive, he’s screaming, but you need to hurry,' he tells the 911 dispatcher. 'There’s a puddle of [blood]’ The man then starts talking to another person in the room. 'What a stupid mother f****r, make me call the police. This is the worst s**t I ever seen in my life.’ Police soon arrive. 'You gotta come get him, he cut his damn penis off,’ he can be heard telling cops. 'We were sitting on the balcony and this mother f****r just came and [jumped]'. The 911 audio emerged almost two months after Johnson broke his silence about the ugly incident, saying depression drove him to do it. In dispute: Johnson (right) said he had been smoking weed, not doing PCP, and reading a book about self-castration at the time of the ugly April 16 incident . Johnson told TMZ last month that he was smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies right before the self-castration. He said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third child on the way. TMZ also reported that Johnson's member was able to be reattached by doctors. While he claims he will be able to regain full functionality, having more children will likely not be possible. The incident occurred at an apartment complex about 1am on Wednesday April 16. Police classified the case as an attempted suicide. Friends within the building said Johnson managed the mutilation quickly before running and jumping over the ledge. However E! Online reported that the rapper cut off the tip of his penis first, then removed his testicles and the remainder of his genitalia. When people from the building ran downstairs to see if Johnson had survived the fall, they said he was already on his feet screaming. He was found in critical condition before he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The organs were recovered upstairs inside the apartment. Neighbors initially said Johnson did not seem to be under the effect of hard drugs. Northstar is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and saluting their own Muslim beliefs. In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums. As Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RZA moved to distance himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do with them for 10 years. The dispatcher is bold. The caller is only italic when talking to others. Man, we have a friend that was over here and he just [sliced] his damn penis off and (unintelligible) and we don’t know if he’s alive or not.Which floor did he jump off?The second floor… god d**n I don’t believe this s**t.Okay, tell me exactly what happenedI don’t know.

"Spared jail: Lekeshia Henry-Richards, 28, stole signatures of around 150 clients of the exclusive private banking service based in the City of London . A NatWest banking officer who sold wealthy customers' details to criminals running a £400,000 fraud was spared jail because she has two young children. Lekeshia Henry-Richards, 28, stole signatures of around 150 clients of the exclusive private banking service based in the City of London. The information was used by a gang of swindlers to go on spending sprees at Apple and Selfridges stores in Beirut, Marseilles and London. One customer lost more than £130,000 before the scam was stopped in April this year. The mother from Leytonstone, east London, was spared time in prison because of her two young children, aged eight years and 18 months. She was sentenced at London’s Old Bailey to two years in jail suspended for two years - and ordered to carry out 90 hours of unpaid work. Judge Gerald Gordon said: ‘You were convicted by the jury of conspiring with other people to commit fraud upon your employer NatWest bank, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, by abusing your position as relationship advisor dealing with high value accounts at the branch in the City. ‘Between March and November 2011 you obtained details, mainly customer signatures, which you supplied to others for them to use in persuading the bank that customer change of address notifications were genuine when they were in fact fraudulent. ‘Credit cards, PIN and cheque books were sent and as a result of those details fraudsters could make use of the accounts and the resulting fraud netted the conspirators something in excess of £400,000.’ He added: ‘The reality seems to be that you got yourself into this for some reason, perhaps after some attempt to avoid it, and those you were supplying the information to had a strong hold over you. Your prolonged criminal conduct cost your employer a very large sum of money. Bank: The judge said she conspired 'with other people to commit fraud upon your employer NatWest... by abusing your position as relationship advisor dealing with high value accounts at the branch in the City' ‘The offences were fraudulent from the outset, lasted a substantial period of time and involved a substantial number of financial victims, although the bank assumed the losses. ‘You were acting while in an important position of trust within the bank. It’s difficult to see that you have shown real understanding of the seriousness of what you have done.’ Judge Gordon said the offences were serious enough for Henry-Richards to be sent to prison but that he had to consider her son and daughter. ‘They both have their own real problems and each is at risk if you are sentenced to immediate custody,’ he said. ‘Their position is a factor that it is right to take into consideration today. ‘With considerable hesitation I have come to the view that the sentence I pass is two years imprisonment suspended for two years.’ Henry-Richards used customer account numbers, addresses and images of their signatures to order new credit cards. The replacement cards were then diverted to the criminal gang. Signatures were obtained from the . accounts records in breach of her position as an employee, put on the . letter and sent to the bank. The . bank updated their records, taking the letters on trust with what they . thought were genuine signatures. Some time later replacement credit . cards and PINs were sent out. Big money: In one case the fraudsters went on a spending spree of more than £130,000 in Beirut (left), Marseilles (right) and London . From there the cards were in the hands of fraudsters who in one case went on a spending spree of more than £130,000 in Beirut, Marseilles and London. When the bank investigated the suspicious spending on that card they discovered around 150 other accounts had also been compromised. On all of those accounts Henry-Richards had accessed information and on most she had accessed the signature image panel. 'You were acting while in an important position of trust within the bank. It’s difficult to see that you have shown real understanding of the seriousness of what you have done' Lekeshia Henry-Richards . Text messages recovered by police from Henry-Richards’s mobile phone showed that she had been stealing the details to order. When interviewed by police she claimed she had been threatened by a man called ‘Steve’ who she thought was a member of a gang. Alexia Power, defending, said Henry-Richards has an eight-year-old son and baby daughter aged 18 months. ‘She is a single parent with two young children,’ she said. ‘She has suffered from mental health problems for a number of years and made numerous suicide attempts over the years. ‘She is the sole carer of two dependent children. To separate her from her very young children could lead to serious harm.’ Henry-Richards was convicted after trial of conspiracy to commit fraud between March 2011 and April 2014. She was also made the subject of a two-year supervision order and 12-month women’s programme.","Lekeshia Henry-Richards, 28, convicted of conspiracy to commit fraud .

"Loss: Tommy Main, 23, died after he was punched in the chest while doing a 'Punch4punch' drinking game with friends . A young father died after taking part in a dangerous new ‘Punch 4 Punch’ craze that is sweeping the nation. Tommy Main, 23, collapsed after trading heavy punches with another man in the violent ‘game’ during a birthday party. He was rushed to hospital by ambulance in a critical condition but died an hour later without ever regaining consciousness. Last night his family lashed out at revellers who filmed the violent clash and its tragic aftermath instead of helping to save the stricken young man. Ben, 38, one of his three brothers, said they have been left ‘devastated’ by the tragedy which they are still struggling to understand. He said: ‘I can’t believe my little brother has lost his life. He was punched in the heart and it stopped beating. He died instantly. ‘He’s got a little girl and she doesn’t know yet. How do you tell a three-year-old her dad is dead? She doesn’t even know what it means.’ Punch 4 Punch, which began in the U.S, is the latest reckless game of dare to take hold of the internet. Social networking sites are full of photos of young men showing off bloody cuts and large bruises after exchanging punches, often while being filmed. The tragedy echoes the neknominate drinking game which has claimed several young victims who were dared to drink huge amounts of alcohol. Tommy, who worked for his father’s removal firm, collapsed shortly after midnight on Sunday morning at a 16th birthday party at a house opposite his home in Erith, South East London. Witnesses said he traded several blows with another man, aged 20, before falling to the ground after a heavy blow to his upper chest. Ben Main said: ‘Even if they were exchanging punches, you can’t just play games and kill someone. It was a massive punch to the heart.’ Paying tribute to his brother, Ben added: ‘I’m facing my worst fear. It has come real and he is dead. I would call him every weekend to make sure he wasn’t getting in with the wrong crowd. ‘He was a well-loved character and his death has sent shockwaves everywhere. There are so many tributes to him it is surreal. ‘It has devastated my whole family. He had a heart of gold and has never done anything wrong to anyone – and now his life has been taken away.’ Another brother, Roy, 36, added that . life would never ‘be the same again’ and slammed those who watched Tommy . suffer the fatal injury. Writing . online, he said: ‘For the people that was at the party that can see . this call yourself friends … you should have stopped it not try and film . it.’ A Met Police . spokesman confirmed that the 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion . of murder and has been released on bail until September. A . post mortem examination was inconclusive and the family has been warned . it could take months for forensic tests to be completed. Investigation: The young father's death is being treated as unexplained rather than suspicious by police . Dozens of pictures were posted online in tribute to Tommy as his family and large circle of friends learned of the tragedy. Friends . said Ben, a Liverpool soccer fan, idolised his only child, . three-year-old Aimee. His father Mike, 60, was too upset to speak and . has already put his semi-detached home on the market. A . tribute page set up by best friend Matthew Davey attracted more than . 1000 ‘likes’. Mr Davey said: ‘He was my best friend in the whole world.’ Punch4Punch is a social media challenge and drinking game that started in the U.S. and has now landed in the Britain. The . two players have one hand tied behind their back and take it in turns . to punch each other with the free hand until one player gives up. Their . defeat usually involves a forfeit, often related to drinking excessive . amounts of alcohol. The challengers usually punch each other in the arm, but some players target other areas of the body, sometimes even the head. Like NekNominate, the challenge is filmed and then posted online for others to see. Dozens . of films of young men exchanging blows in ‘Punch 4 Punch’ can be found . on YouTube and via social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. In . many cases those involved drink shots of spirits in between punches as . crowds cheer and jeer their progress. The loser pays a forfeit, which . inevitably means drinking more alcohol. The fad comes in the wake of the Neknominate online drinking contest which was linked to several deaths earlier this year.They . included Isaac Richardson, 20, who died in February after downing a . lethal cocktail of wine, whisky and vodka at a backpackers’ hostel in . Woolwich. Investigators appealed for anyone who filmed or photographed the fatal confrontation to hand over the material. Det . Insp Michael Norman said: ‘Tommy's death is being treated as . unexplained but I would urge any of his friends who were at the party on . the night of his death to make contact. ‘I am especially interested in any images or footage from the nights of his death.’ A . Met spokesman said: ‘We await the results of a post mortem. It is being . treated as an unexplained death rather than suspicious.’ London . Ambulance Service said they were originally called to treat a man for a . ‘cardiac arrest’. He was taken to Darent Valley Hospital where he died. The NekNominate craze is only thought to have started in January this year in Perth, Australia, but has quickly spread via social media. It is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them. An early example of the trend was a woman who was filmed riding a horse into a supermarket before downing a can of Pepsi. But the videos have become increasingly dark with three deaths in Britain now linked to the craze. In March Bradley Eames, 20, from Nottingham, was found dead after he filmed himself downing almost two pints of gin mixed with teabags.","Tommy Main collapsed after punch to the chest during drinking game .

"Accused: Ben Blakeley is on trial for allegedly murdering his ex-girlfriend Jayden Parkinson . A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend told a prison nurse that he was 'a celebrity' after the killing and wanted to watch himself on TV news, a court heard today. Ben Blakeley, 22, was 'laughing and jovial' when he allegedly made the comment about the death of 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson while being held at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire. Blakeley also wrote a letter confessing to killing Jayden and said he 'deserved 30 years' for what he had done, the trial at Oxford Crown Court was told. The former binman, from Reading, Berkshire, is accused of murdering Jayden a day after she told him she was pregnant with his child. She was last seen alive with Blakeley on the afternoon of December 3 last year in Didcot, Oxfordshire after meeting him to discuss her pregnancy. Blakeley, who denies murder but admits manslaughter, dumped Jayden's body in the grave of his uncle at All Saints' graveyard in Didcot a week after killing her. Cally Brinsley, a senior nurse in HMP Bullingdon's health unit, said Blakeley had repeatedly asked for a television in his cell. 'He wanted to see what was going on with the case and seeing himself on the television,' she told jurors. 'He was very jovial in his behaviour. He would answer a question from me and, if he provided the correct answer, he would say ""Can I have a television now please?"" He did shout down the corridor at me ""I'm a celebrity now, miss"".' At this point in the nurse's evidence, Blakeley jumped up from his seat in the dock, swore and shouted: 'How can you say stuff like this?'. He then asked to leave the court and the trial continued in his absence. Ms Brinsley was asked about Blakeley's demeanour when he made the 'celebrity' comment and she replied: 'Jovial... he was laughing.' Victim: Jayden Parkinson, 17, was last seen alive when she went to meet Blakeley to tell him she was pregnant. Blakeley buried Ms Parkinson's body in the established grave of his uncle in a nearby churchyard . She told jurors that staff were not allowed to discuss legal matters with prisoners but, during a review of his health, he told her about Jayden's death. She said: 'He did say to me ""I told them where the shovels were. I got really drunk. I didn't want it to happen. If I could take it back I would"". 'I told Ben to stop because I didn't want to hear what had happened and I was there as a nurse and I was there for his welfare. Blakeley, pictured arriving at court, said he deserves the death penalty for killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend . 'Ben said ""Can I have a television now?"" as if he had given me some information and he wanted to have a reward. I told him that he couldn't.'' Ms Brinsley said on another occasion Blakeley asked her whether police had found Jayden's body. 'He was in quite an excitable state, as if he was expecting exciting news and then asked about the television once again, which was his main priority,' she told the court. She also said that Blakeley had been issued with a Bible while on remand and inside the back cover, prison officers later discovered, was written: 'RIP baby. I will miss you always. I am sorry xxx. I am sorry, sorry.' There was also a heart drawn on the page with the letters 'J' and 'B' inside it, the jury was told. Also found in the Bible were two newspaper cuttings, with one headlined: 'Jayden mother's nightmare.' The other article was about the police searching for Jayden's body and included photographs of a tent erected over a grave at All Saints' graveyard. The court also heard a statement from prison governor Carol Gaskin who said she had been handed a letter from Blakeley on December 19 last year. She said: 'He said ""I want to give you this and it needs to go to the police"". I asked what that was and Ben replied: ""That's my confession"". Ben said he had done everything he could to try and save her.' In another statement read out in court, prison officer Carly Roffey said she was on duty on December 20 when 'Ben said he deserved to get 30 years for what he had done but that was not worth her life'. She added: 'He said he had now come to terms with what he had done and would accept any punishment he got. He also told me that he had written a confession.' A court sketch of Blakeley and a defendant (obstructed by pole) who cannot be identified due to his age . Health care assistant Tracey Howarth told jurors of a meeting she and other staff members had with Blakeley two days before Christmas last year. She told the court: 'He just said that he wanted us to know that he hadn't just dropped her in a hole he had dug. 'He told me ""I didn't mean to kill her"" and he hadn't meant it to happen. He was grinning like he thought it was funny, (he) didn't appear to take it seriously.' Blakeley denies murdering Jayden but admits her manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice over the disposal of her body. The prosecution has refused to accept his manslaughter plea and he has gone on trial alongside a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. The youth has also pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice but denies a charge of preventing a lawful burial because he says he did not know he was helping bury Jayden's body.

"Three sisters who helped deliver a baby outside a Primark store in Birmingham have told how the mother went from clothes shopping to giving birth in just 'four minutes'. Emma Sheffield, 25, and her sisters Melissa Sheffield, 27, and Kelly Ryder, 29, were the first to comfort the woman who unexpectedly went into labour in the city's New Street yesterday. They have told how they saw the shape of the baby's head through the woman's leggings and managed to remove them just in time. Ms Sheffield said: 'Her face was glowing red. We asked her again if she was OK and when she was due and she told us: ""Anytime now"".' Kelly Ryder, 29, Emma Sheffield, 25, and Melissa Sheffield, 28, helped a new mum give birth outside Birmingham's Primark store yesterday. They have now told of the speed of the delivery . All smiles: The mother was wheeled away from the busy street on a trolley after the successful labour . Reliving . the episode, Ms Sheffield added: 'We were talking to a woman doing market . research just outside Primark when we noticed a pregnant lady walking . out of the store looking hot and flustered. 'We . all looked at each other alarmed and then the woman bent over a . bollard. Kelly asked her if she was OK, and she said she wasn't feeling . any pain. But we all thought she looked like she was in labour.' As they tried to move the pregnant woman into an alleyway, they saw the baby's head emerge beneath her clothes. Ms Sheffield added: 'Kelly saw the shape of the baby's head in her leggings - the baby had already started to come out. 'Kelly . shouted ""The baby's head - someone needs to grab the baby"". I grabbed . the head in the mum's leggings and the others laid the woman down on the . floor. 'Then Kelly and I tried to rip the leggings down. That was when I . saw and held the baby's head properly for the first time. 'She was so beautiful and crying. After the baby came out the mum was lying there saying: ""Oh my god it's a girl"". 'We heard her tell a girl in the pushchair that this was her little sister.' Thie woman suddenly went into labour in Birmingham city centre and was forced to give birth outside Primark . Pulling the sheets across: The paramedics shield the woman from the curious shoppers . A doctor then arrived and cared for the mother and newborn baby until an ambulance arrived. Ms . Sheffield said: 'It was all so fast and surreal. It must have been four . minutes from when we saw her come out of Primark to the baby being born. 'I think the new mum was stunned and hardly said a word. I don't think she expected to give birth there and then.' Crowds of shoppers cheered when the newborn baby girl was placed on her mother's chest, before the pair were helped into an ambulance. Witnesses . have told how well-wishers organised a whip-round for the new mother, . who was handed hundreds of pounds by passing shoppers. Shop worker Nadia Hussain told the BBC . the crowds were happy to contribute, adding: 'She got about £300 to . £400. The mother was waving at everyone, telling everyone to film her.' Another . shop keeper nearby said the woman was giving birth for about ten minutes . before paramedics arrived and held sheets around the woman. It’s believed kind-hearted Primark staff brought out towels from the shop to help. The new mother . and her baby, who was born on this sport, were taken to hospital and are reported to be doing well . A shop keeper working near the scene said the woman was giving birth for about ten minutes before paramedics arrived and held the sheets around her . One onlooker said: 'We were just walking out of Primark when I saw a crowd of people. 'We thought it was a street performance act. It was only when I walked out that I realised it was a woman giving birth. 'She seemed to be by herself and there were no medics there. She can’t . have been there very long as I didn’t see her when we went in.'

"These images show the incredible moment a heron plucks a duckling from the water and swallows it in a single gulp. The large bird, spotted in Adel Dam Nature Reserve, West Yorkshire, approaches its prey, grabs it and attempts to hold it under the water before finishing it off. Photographer Chris Hyslop, 66, witnessed the grim struggle - which lasted five minutes -and captured the images. Grab: The heron, photographed at the Adel Dam Nature Reserve near Leeds, is first seen grabbing the duckling . Swing: The bird - which would usually eat fish - swings the duckling back and forth as it struggles . The heron - a bird which usually chooses fish for its prey - is thought to be around three years old and well-practised in its duck-catching technique. Mr Hyslop said: 'I initially went down to try and get a picture of the heron in flight - they look quite extraordinary when they’re flying. 'The heron was fishing, wading around the water looking for something to eat. 'Then, all of a sudden, the heron spotted this mallard chick, which I would say was probably a couple of months old, and took maybe two steps very quickly towards it, before grabbing it in his mouth. 'He was shaking it around, which I think made the chick very disorientated, then the heron held it under the water. 'The whole thing lasted about five or six minutes, he probably didn’t want to swallow it while it was still moving so did his best to stop it from moving. Dunk: The duckling finds itself thrust back into the water - seemingly in an attempt by the heron to drown it . Brutal: The heron apparently attempts to drown the duckling, before deciding to swallow it whole . Gone: The heron can finally be seen swallowing the duckling for good after the five-minute struggle . 'He didn’t rush about it, but I could see that digesting it was a struggle. The way he did it, I’m pretty sure he’d done it before. 'After that, he relaxed for a little while, but not long after he tried to go for another chick. 'Then he spotted a group of young coot chicks, and tried to go for one of them. But these ones were much younger than the chick he’d already eaten, so the parents were still around. 'I think the mallard chick had been left to fend for itself, so was more vulnerable.' Chris, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, added: 'I’ve never seen anything like it before.'","Heron plucks duckling from water at Adel Dam Nature Reserve, Yorkshire .

"Arrested: Cynthia Watson, 51, was arrested Monday after accidentally giving her 2-year-old granddaughter a cup of tea laced with methamphetamine . A 51-year-old woman was arrested Monday after accidentally giving her 2-year-old granddaughter a cup of tea spiked with methamphetamine. Cynthia Ann Watson of Aloha, Oregon was visiting family near Hemet, California Sunday night when she made a cup of tea laced with the drug 'to get herself high'. However, the drink was left unattended and the toddler ended up drinking some of it. The young girl's mother sought help Monday morning because her daughter 'was talking rapidly, scratching her skin, could not sit still and was very agitated,' a Sheriff's department statement read. 'Thinking there might be some medical issue with her daughter, the reporting party took her to a local hospital to be examined.' Doctors ran tests on the little girl and found traces of methamphetamine in her system. The toddler was later released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery. Watson was arrested at the family's home on the 31000 block of Pine Street and is being held in lieu of $35,000 bail on charges of felony child endangerment and possession of methamphetamine. She is being held at the Larry D Smith Correctional Facility in Banning and is expected to appear in court for the first time Monday morning at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta.","Cynthia Ann Watson, 51, was visiting family in California Sunday night when she made a cup of tea spiked with meth to get high .

"A pilot had a lucky escape when the replica First World War British fighter plane he was flying nose-dived into the ground after clipping a fence on landing during a public display. The historic Sopwith Triplane fighter finished nose-down in the turf with its propeller ripped off by the force as rescue teams pulled the stricken pilot from the wreckage at the Shuttleworth Military Pageant. Display pilot Roger ‘Dodge’ Bailey was coming in to land on the grass airstrip after a flying display at the Old Warden airfield near Biggleswade in Bedfordshire on Sunday afternoon at around 3.45pm. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: This is the moment a replica First World War British fighter plane nose-dived into the ground after clipping a fence on landing during a public display . But thankfully he emerged momentarily ‘stunned’ but otherwise unhurt for the ordeal after being eased gently from the upturned cockpit by rescue staff. Witnesses described seeing the pilot trying to bring the Sopwith down quickly but said the afternoon’s unsettled weather and occasional gusting winds seem to have pushed the plane off course. Eyewitness Hilton Holloway from London said: ‘The plane was just a few feet above the ground, when the undercarriage clipped a fence, causing it to nose dive straight into the ground, shattering the wooden propeller, tearing off the undercarriage and damaging the upper wing.'

"In its zealousness to make amends with veterans whose health needs had been ignored, a Veterans Affairs hospital in Massachusetts accidentally reached out to a deceased, Vietnam veteran who passed away two years ago while waiting for care from the VA, a news report revealed yesterday. Suzanne Chase, a resident of Acton, Massachusetts, told CBS Boston on Monday that her dead husband received a letter in the mail two weeks ago from a local VA hospital informing him it was ready to fulfill the appointment he requested in 2012. 'I was in complete disbelief,' she said. 'It was 22 months too late, I kind of thought I was in the Twilight Zone when I opened this letter and read it.' It took the VA two years to contact the Vietnam veteran pictured here. This portrait of Douglas Chase was provided to CBS Boston by his widow . Chase's husband, Douglas, died in the summer of 2012 from a brain tumor several months after his wife put in a request to have his care moved from a hospital in Boston to a nearby VA hospital in Bedford. 'It was so difficult for him to take the ambulance ride into Boston,' she told CBS. 'We wanted to be closer.' But the VA never called, and her husband passed away in August of that year. At that time Chase says she contacted the government agency and asked it to carry out her husband's burial. The VA reportedly told her it wouldn't assume the costs because her husband was never treated at a VA hospital. 'It is absurd,' the Massachusetts resident told CBS Boston. 'It made me angry because I just don’t think our veterans should be treated this way.' Then, two weeks ago, Chase received the VA's about her deceased husband's long overdue doctor's appointment. 'I was like you have to be kidding, right,' she told the news station. Chase said she tried contacting the Bedford VA hospital immediately after opening the letter but never received a response. Only after CBS reported on the tragic misstep did the VA issue attempt to apologize for the tragic misstep. 'We regret any distress our actions caused to the Veteran’s widow and family,' a statement from the VA to CBS read in part. 'Thank you for bringing this regrettable issue to our attention.' The department said it could not legally release details on the Douglas Chase's case but it confirmed that acting the acting Veterans Affairs director had called Suzanne Chase to apologize for the oversight and left a voicemail when he couldn't reach her. Chase told CBS she did not receive a voicemail from anyone at the VA headquarters but an employee of the hospital that made the initial error contacted her. Suzanne Chase said she was 'shocked' when she opened a letter from the VA two weeks that said it was finally ready to see her husband . As part of a nationwide apology tour in the wake of an appointment scheduling scandal, the Veterans Affairs Department is contacting the backlog of veterans who were put on secret waiting lists by VA hospitals trying to cover up long wait times. An internal VA audit of 731 medical facilities that was completed last month found that 56,000 veterans seeking care waited more than 90 days for initial appointments at VA hospitals, and more . than 10 percent waited more than . 30 days, contradicting official reports that showed them waiting on average two weeks to a month. A separate report filed by Sen. Tom Coburn last month showed that 1,000 veterans died throughout the last decade as a result of VA mismanagement. When veterans died before VA doctors made time to see them, hospital staff would claim that care was 'no longer necessary' rather than saying that the veteran had passed away, a scheduler for one of the hospitals caught up in the scandal told CNN last week. 'I am . hoping if other people speak out, they can improve the system, so no one . else dies waiting for an appointment,' Suzanne Chase told CBS yesterday. In a report to the president last month . acting VA secretary Sloan Gibson said the VA had already reached out to 70,000 veterans to offer them appointments, 'but there is still much more work to be done.'","The Veterans Affairs Department recently found out VA hospitals were regularly lying about how long it was taking for doctors to see vets .
It's now on a crusade to clear the backlog of veterans who need care and has contacted more than 70,000 veterans  throughout the last month and a half to schedule appointments .
One of the veterans it tried to set up an appointment for died two years ago, showing just how long veterans were waiting for care ."
"A mother depressed over her son's suicide killed her two young daughters and herself early Tuesday using suffocating nitrogen gas at their upstate New York home, about a week after a stay in a mental institution, authorities said. East Greenbush Police Chief Christopher Lavin said a 911 call at about 1.45am sent police to the town house in the Albany suburb, where they found the mom and girls, ages 6 and 9, unconscious from exposure to the odorless gas in a first-floor bedroom. Rescuers had to break down the door to the locked room and tried CPR for a half hour before the three were taken to Albany Medical Center, where they died. Crime scene: Detectives work at the house in East Greenbush, N.Y. where angela Mtambu and her two daughters, ages 6 and nine, were found dead in a murder-suicide . Warning signs: Mtambu, a nurse, killed herself and the two little girls using suffocating nitrogen gas in the same room about a week after a stay in a mental institution . East Greenbush Chief of Police Christopher Lavin talks to reporters about the murder suicide on Tuesday . The mother, 47-year-old Angela Mtambu, was recently released from a Pennsylvania mental institution after being overcome with grief when her 23-year-old son, Mitchell Gwatida, asphyxiated himself in the same home in April, authorities said. 'I just think she couldn't take it,' the woman's brother, Bernard Pamberi, told reporters outside the home as he fought back tears. Horrific scene: Bernard Pamberi holds back tears as he speaks of breaking into his sister's bedroom and finding her and his two nieces with plastic bags over their heads next two two tanks of gas . Police said the father of the girls, Callidora and Eudora Thurston, has been notified. Angela Mtambu was a traveling nurse who was working in Houston this spring when she decided to return to the home she has owned for 12 years. A Texas relative who was concerned that the distraught Mtambu might be planning to kill herself and her daughters notified authorities in East Greenbush, and an Amber Alert was issued June 1. Mtambu was taken into protective custody in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and local social services took custody of the two girls, Lavin said. Mtambu was kept nearly three weeks for psychiatric observation before being allowed to reunite with her daughters and no order of protection was issued. 'She apparently did not exhibit behavior that is needed to trigger a preventative-custody arrest,' Lavin said.'I can't think of anything under the law that we could have done.' Lavin said she rejoined her family last week, social services followed up with visits to check on the children's welfare, and on Sunday night she was again allowed to sleep in the same room with her daughters. Pamberi said Mtambu lived with him for a short time after returning and another brother came from South Africa to help out. Family drama: Mtambu's son, Mitchell Gwatida (left and right), 23, died from self-inflicted asphyxiation April 1 in the same room where his mother and two sisters were found dead Tuesday . Serviceman: According to his obituary, Gwatida, a native of Zimbabwe served in the U.S. Air Force from 2010-2013 and was stationed in Okinawa, Japan . 'There was no sign. We spent the whole day, yesterday, with the children,' Pamberi said. 'We went for dinner at Applebee's restaurant. We took them for ice cream.' Pamberi and the other uncle who were staying in the home said they awakened to the sound of hissing gas Tuesday morning but couldn't get out of their room because they had been locked in. Pamberi said he then made the emergency call. Lavin said three police officers were the first to arrive at the scene and were affected by the high level of nitrogen gas. They weren't injured. He said more than one 30-pound tank of the gas was found in the room. According to Pamberi, his sister and nieces were wearing plastic bags over their heads. Lavin said it is possible Mtambu intended to mimic the death of her son, who took his own life in the very same room at 58 Rockrose Drive as his mother. 'She was going through all this grieving and I think that triggered everything she just couldn't take it,' said Pamberi . According to his obituary, Mitchell died April 1. A native of Harare, Zimbabwe, he moved to Albany with his family in 2002 and graduated from Columbia High School. The 23-year-old served in the U.S. Air Force between 2010-2013. His long-dormant Facebook page indicates that at one point he was stationed in Okinawa, Japan. Autopsies on the mother and daughters were expected to be performed Wednesday.","Angela Mtambu, 47, a nurse from Texas, and her daughters, Callidora and Eudora, were found with plastic bags over their heads next to gas tanks .

"The Travel Channel has pulled new-show Man Finds Foods just one day before it was set to air, following host Adam Richman's hateful online fight. The former Man V Food host was caught calling one critic a 'c***' and telling another to 'eat a bag of s***', after they condemned his use of the controversial term 'thinspiration' in an Instagram post. Thinspiration is a term used to describe online posts which encourage eating disorders, and have been banned on sites like Facebook and Yahoo. Richman seemed unaware of the term's significance when he included it in the caption of a photo showing his dramatic weight loss earlier last month. So when Instagram users started criticizing him, Richman got defensive and shot back with profanity - in one case going so far as to tell one user to commit suicide. New body: Travel Channel has pulled new-show Man Finds Food after host Adam Richman used hateful words to hit back at critics on Instagram. Richman got defensive when users called him out for using the pro-anorexia term 'thinspiration' to describe a photo of his dramatic weight loss. Above, two pictures show how much weight Richman has lost since he stopped competing in food competitions for old show Man V Food . Proud: The controversy started early last month when Richman posted this picture of his recent weight loss with the hastag 'thinspiration' Out of the loop: Richman seemed unaware that 'thinspiration' is a term used to describe pictures and quotes that promote eating disorders in online communities . Before: Richman was significantly heavier when he starred on eating-competition show Man V Food . Video Source Travel Channel . Though Richman has since apologized for the comments, it wasn't enough to keep his show. Travel Channel announced today that Man Finds Food has been postponed. It was slated to debut tomorrow, July 2. Richman became famous for hosting show Man V Food (also on Travel Channel), a show where he traveled the U.S. to compete in food eating competitions. Since the show ended, Richman began a healthier lifestyle and has since experienced a dramatic weight loss. Proud of his new body, Richman posted a photo earlier last month in which he's seen wearing an old pair of suit pants that are now much too big. 'Had ordered this suit from a Saville Row tailor over a year ago. Think I’m gonna need to take it in a little…. #Victory #EyesOnThePrize #AnythingIsPossible #fitness #transformation #thinspiration,' Richman wrote. When one user called him out for using the negative term, he shot back with a comment reading 'DILLIGAF' - which stands for 'Do I look like I give a f***?' When one user tried to explain the significance of 'thinspiration', Richman shot back with 'DILLIGAF?' - meaning 'Do I look like I give a f***?' Richman sent that comment to a friend of Amber Sarah, a 27-year-old fat activist who sought to put the foodie in his place. Online row: Fat activist Amber Sarah, 27 (pictured), was one of the many Instagram users that tried to explain thinspiration to Richman. He called her a c*** . In a post on her blog Adipose Activist, Sarah described how Richman first ignored her comment on his page. She then wrote a post on her personal Instagram, asking others to 'tell him that eating disorders are not a joke and nothing to take lightly'. That's when Richman got even more angry, calling Ms Sarah a 'c***' in a message that subsequently got deleted off his page. But that didn't stop him from using the hateful word again in yet another post on Ms Sarah's personal Instagram. When she told him he needed to apologize, Richman wrote back saying to 'give me a f****** break.' 'If anyone acts like a c*** I'll call them one. It's not misogyny, it's calling a spade a spade. Maybe you're the one being aggressive & unfair - and yes, if my use of the hashtag offended you, it was unintentional & for that I'm sorry.' When two of Ms Sarah's friends wrote to Richman, he responded similarly. 'Seriously - grab a razor blade & draw a bath. I doubt anyone will miss you,' Richman wrote to Instagram user @_bechen . To user @thefattestfox Richman said: 'oh eat a bag of s***, dummy. No apology is coming.' Richman did end up apologizing though, when he tweeted a statement saying: 'Yes. I've responded to internet hate recently with vile words directed at those hating me. I am sorry. I should know better & will do better.' Proof: Sarah shared screen shots of her online altercation with Richman in a blog post . 'Grab a razor blade and draw a bath': Richman went so far as to tell one of Ms Sarah's friends to commit suicide . Ms Sarah says she has no problem with Richman's weight loss, just his use of a damaging word that has an even greater effect since he is a celebrity with more than 92,000 followers on Instagram. 'As a public figure, even if you have a personal Instagram (Adam has 94,000 followers) you need to understand that the things you say will be scrutinized, and the words you use have meaning,' Ms Sarah wrote. 'You need to be extra careful to think about not what you mean when you say things, but how other people will interpret them. And in a society where eating disorders are at an all-time high, thinspiration is a loaded word.' For now, Travel Channel is replaced Man Finds Food with a show about grilling.","Travel Channel has pulled Richman's new show Man Finds Food after he made controversial comments online .

"The White House published its annual list of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue staff their salaries today.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, left, and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, right, also make $172,200 a year . The White House has been required by law to disclose the names, titles and salaries of every one of its employees to Congress since 1995. 'Consistent with President Obama's commitment to transparency,' Obama's administration has also opted to make the data available to the public each year in an easily searchable chart. Because of a pay freeze instituted by the president, senior-level White House staffers have continued to earn same exact amount as they did when the president took office. However, entry and mid level staffers have seen their stock go up in the Obama presidency from a base pay of $36,000 in 2009 to $42,000 this year. Furthermore, the White House lifted its pay freeze on employees making less than $100,000, a White House official told ABC News, allowing dozens of lowly White House employees, including press assistants, analysts and staff assistants, to take advantage of a one percent increase in pay for federal workers signed into law by the president last December. White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer, pictured here on Meet the Press in March, also makes $172,200 .

"JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer and will undergo radiation and chemotherapy treatment this summer, he has revealed. Dimon, a 58-year-old married father of three, disclosed his condition in a memo late on Tuesday addressed to the New York company's employees and shareholders. He will remain as CEO and continue to run one of the world's largest banks while he undergoes eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York, he wrote. 'The good . news is that the prognosis from my doctors is excellent, the cancer was . caught quickly, and my condition is curable,' he wrote. 'I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes.' Diagnosis: JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, pictured last year, has revealed that he has throat cancer but said that his prognosis is good because it was caught early . Dimon said the cancer remains confined to his throat and adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. He has received a biopsy, a CT Scan and a PET scan, he said. He shared the news on Tuesday night because the diagnosis forced him to cancel a five-country client trip, which would have seen him meet with the prime ministers of Italy and Greece. Despite canceling the trip, he will continue to head up the bank and will undergo treatment during a summer vacation. 'He is going to be actively involved in the business every day,' Joe Evangelisti, a corporate spokesman, told USA Today on Tuesday night. Evangelisti added that no specific individual will take over Dimon's responsibilities as he is treated. Dimon joined the firm in 2004 before taking over as CEO in December 2005 and adding the chairman title in December 2006. It makes him Chase's longest-serving top official - but the term has not been without its issues. In September, JPMorgan Chase . admitted wrongdoing and was fined around $920 million in a settlement . of the bank's 2012 'London whale' trading debacle. Support: Dimon is pictured with his wife Judith as they arrive for a state dinner hosted Obama at the White House in 2011. Dimon, 58, joined the company in 2004 before taking over as CEO in 2005 . Family: Dimon's family, including his wife and three daughters, made headlines last year when they sent out this Christmas card showing them hitting tennis balls around their pricey home . In one of the biggest trading scandals to hit the finance world, a group of London-based traders working in the firm's Chief Investment Office made huge bets on complex financial instruments and then covered up their losses for months. One of the traders, French-born Bruno Iksil, was nicknamed the London Whale because of the size of his bets. JPMorgan . initially said the trades, which racked up an around $6.2 . billion in losses, had been a hedge against risk and Dimon called it a 'tempest in a teapot' in a statement. He later conceded: ‘We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them.’ His family has also made headlines for their questionable choices; they were branded ‘tone deaf’ after releasing a decadent Christmas card in which they hit tennis balls around their palatial home. In the photo Dimon was pictured gleefully swinging his tennis racket as his wife Judy, their three daughters, Julia, Laura and Kara Leigh, laugh. MSNBC host Chris Hayes said it was as if . the Dimon family were saying: ‘Hey, we’re so rich we can destroy our own . stuff’, whilst The Atlantic magazine said it was ‘braggy and opulent’ Dimon earns more than $18.7m a year, making him one of the best compensated bosses in America. On Wednesday morning - following the Tuesday night announcement - shares were down 30 cents, or 0.52 per cent. July 1, 2014 . Message from Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon . Dear Colleagues and Shareholders, . I wanted to let you know that I have just been diagnosed with throat cancer. The good news is that the prognosis from my doctors is excellent, the cancer was caught quickly, and my condition is curable. Following thorough tests that included a CAT scan, PET scan and a biopsy, the cancer is confined to the original site and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of my neck. Importantly, there is no evidence of cancer elsewhere in my body. My evaluation and treatment plan are still being finalized, but at this time it appears I will begin radiation and chemotherapy treatment shortly at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, which should take approximately eight weeks. While the treatment will curtail my travel during this period, I have been advised that I will be able to continue to be actively involved in our business, and we will continue to run the company as normal. Our Board has been fully briefed and is totally supportive. As you all know, we have outstanding leaders across our businesses and functions - the best team I've ever had the privilege of working with - so our company will move forward together with confidence as we continue to deliver first-class results for our customers, communities and shareholders. I feel very good now and will let all of you know if my health situation changes. I appreciate your support and want to thank our employees for the amazing work they do day-in and day-out. I'm very proud to be part of this company and honored to be working with such an exceptional group of people.

"Mayor Rob Ford proudly marched through the streets of Toronto Tuesday to celebrate Canada Day, drawing a mix of cheers and jeers from the crowd. Ford's public appearance Tuesday came just one day after he returned to work upon completing two months at a rehabilitation center where he received treatment for his well-documented alcohol addiction. Sporting a burgundy shirt and a red-and-white lei around his neck, the jovial mayor attended the East York Canada Day parade, where he chatted up passersby and handed magnets and small ‘Ford Nation’ flags. Back on the stump: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford walks with his son Douglas as he takes part in the East York Canada Day Parade in his first public appearance since returning from a rehab clinic . All smiles: The mayor appeared in high spirits as he posed for photos with well-wishers . Ford Nation: Ford's supporters were out in full forces on the streets of Toronto sporting 'ford Nation' T-shirts and signs . Looking relaxed and about 70lbs slimmer, the 45-year-old politician disregarded hecklers who greeted him with loud boos and taunts of 'resign’ and 'you’re a disgrace.’ Canada.com's correspondent Rob Granatstein reported hearing one man yell at the troubled mayor: 'You're the gravy train, Rob' while another shouted, 'You're gonna ruin our parade.' Ford's political opponent John Tory referred to the incumbent, whom he is hoping to unseat in October, as 'the circus.' By all appearances, Mr Ford did not let the naysayers ruin his upbeat mood. He tweeted a photo of himself holding a giant Canadian flag while marching with the National Congress of Chinese Canadians. Granatstein said that despite the verbal abuse Ford was subjected to while marching in the parade, many people were eager to have their picture taken with the infamous Canadian, who has become known around the world as the crack-smoking mayor of Toronto. He's popular: During his second public appearance since leaving rehab, Ford happily shook hands with parade participants and chatted up would-be voters .

Don't rain on his parade: Amid the outpouring of support for Ford, some passersby greeted him with jeers and calls for resignation . But some residents of the East York neighborhood were put out by Ford's presence on the parade route. ‘It’s a travesty to have him in the East York parade… I just don’t think I can stand here and not say something against his presence,’ Elinor Mahoney told National Post. Mayoral candidates John Tory and Olivia Chow called Ford out over his refusal to answer questions posed to him by members of the Canadian press. Looking leaner: Ford appeared about 70lbs lighter, drawing complements from people in the crowd . Ford's brother, Doug, was quick to come to his sibling’s defense, insisting that he will sit down with reporters for in-depth interviews in due time. On his [part, Mayor Ford kept mum about his recent struggles and his future in politics. ‘I’m just going to talk about Canada Day today. It’s all about Canada Day I just want to meet the people, I’ll be happy to talk to you guys later,’ Ford was quoted as saying by Global News. The mayor got a standing ovation when he took the stage at the CHIN Picnic at Exhibition place in the afternoon, with some onlookers remarking on his leaner appearance. Ford was accompanied by his young son, and many parents in the crowd clamoured to have their own kids pose for pictures with the mayor. On Monday, Mayor Ford marked his return to public life with an emotional speech in which he credited rehab with saving his life. The beleaguered politician apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions. 'Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial,' he said at the press conference at City Hall. 'But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor.

"Bete noir: Professor Yoshihiro Kawaoka once aain has sparked controversy by creating a strain of H1N1 flu virus resistant to human antibodies . A controversial researcher who in the past had replicated the deadly Spanish flu of 1918 has done it again, this time cooking up in his lab an especially resilient strain of the H1N1 virus. Dr Yoshihiro Kawaoka, professor of virology at University of Wisconsin at Madison, has reportedly tweaked the 2009 strain of pandemic influenza responsible for some 500,000 deaths worldwide to make it resistant to the human immune system's antibodies. Kawaoka's many critics have said that his latest provocative experiment has essentially rendered the world’s population defenseless against the virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the H1N1 virus that sparked the 2009-2010 pandemic has turned into a regular human flu virus that continues to circulate seasonally worldwide. Kawaoka's goal, as The independent has reported, was to convert the virus into its pre-pandemic state in order to see how it has changed over the past four years. Ostensibly, his goal is to perfect the design of the flu vaccines of the future, but in order to achieve it, the scientist has enabled the virus to ‘escape’ the human immune system. ‘Through selection of immune escape viruses in the laboratory under appropriate containment conditions, we were able to identify the key regions [that] would enable 2009 H1N1 viruses to escape immunity,’ Professor Kawaoka told the paper. Scroll down for video . Contagion: The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was responsible for some 500,000 deaths worldwide . Palying with fire: Scientists familiar with Dr Kawaoka's research said he had selected strains of H1N1 resistant to antibodies, and then repeated the process several times until he came up with a super virus . The award-winning researcher has been tight-lipped about his latest project, but he has acknowledged that his study is now complete and ready for publication. The trailblazing virologist, who has been conducting his risky experiments out of a state-of-the-art laboratory at the Institute for Influenza Virus Research in Madison, lifted the lid on the H1N1 study earlier this year during a closed-door scientific meeting, where members of the audience walked away shocked. An unnamed scientist who saw Kawaoka’s presentation explained that his colleague had picked out H1N1 strains that were resistant to antibodies and then repeated the process several time until he had on his hands a super-virus that could not be wiped out by a vaccine. ‘He used a flu virus that is known to infect humans and then manipulated it in such a way that it would effectively leave the global population defenseless if it ever escaped from his laboratory,’ the unnamed scientist told the publication. He added: ‘Everything he did before was dangerous but this is even madder.’ Epicenter: Kawaoka and his team have been experimenting with deadly flue viruses in his state-of-the-art lab at the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Influenza Virus Research . Officials at the University of Wisconsin have reassured the public that there is little to no risk that the virus could escape from the lab. Rebecca Moritz, who oversees some of the research center's most sensitive work, explained that Kawaoka's project is a stress-test of sorts meant to identify H1N1 strains that could evade the human immune system in order to make the next vaccine more effective. ‘I have no concerns about the biosafety of these experiments,’ she said. On his part, Kawaoka has fervently defended his research methods and safety procedures in his lab, saying that the work is being conducted by experienced scientists under appropriate containment. Kawaoka’s work had been green-lighted by . Wisconsin’s Institutional Biosafety Committee, but some members of the . committee reportedly had been in the dark until recently about details . of the pandemic study. They have since expressed concerns about the . research. Another error: Health officials have revealed that a bird flu breach occurred in addition to the anthrax debacle. A CDC lab sent another lab a sample that was supposed to be weak bird flu but had been contaminated with a potent strain and killed all the lab chickens exposed to it . Committee member Tom Jeffries called on Kawaoka to to modify the flu viruses he has been working with to make them less dangerous to humans, according to Wisconsin State Journal. But the virologist responded by saying that doing so would undermine his research. Professor Kawaoka, 58, has emerged as a polarizing figure in the scientific community, where he has been widely denounced by infectious disease experts for his high-risk work with potentially lethal viruses. Last month, it was reported that his team used a process called reverse genetics to analyze the 1918 flu strain that infected 500million people, of whom 50million succumbed to the disease in the years following World War I. Former . chief science adviser to the UK government Lord May told The Guardian: 'The work they . are doing is absolutely crazy. The whole thing is exceedingly . dangerous. After critics called for his high-security research to be stopped, Kawaoka defended the work, insisting it had potentially 'life-saving benefits.'","Dr Yoshihiro Kawaoka, 58, had chosen strains of 2009 pandemic virus that were resistant to antibodies .

"It’s the kind of transformation you only see in fairy tales. A grim-looking woman’s hooked nose shrinks to reveal the reflection of a fresh-faced beauty. Elsewhere, a flat-chested blonde gains confidence from her curvy new shape. However watchdogs have ruled that the scenes – in a TV advert for cosmetic surgery – are only suitable for adults. Reflection: The advert for The Hospital Group shows a woman unhappy with her nose, left, who is then delighted by its sudden transformation . Viewers complained the commercial for The Hospital Group was irresponsible and harmful to impressionable youngsters. The ad - which also showed a man with crooked teeth - led to 36 complaints from viewers. They claimed it trivialised cosmetic surgery, implied surgical procedures ‘made you happy’ and said it would make children worry they were ‘unattractive’ and didn’t have the ‘perfect appearance’. The majority of those who complained said the advert, which was shown from 6.45pm, should not have been aired before 9pm as it would give children a ‘negative impact on their body image’. The ad showed three people whose lives were ‘transformed’ by cosmetic surgery. The first shows a a woman looking in a make-up mirror applying foundation to her nose, which elongates like Pinocchio. It then shows her ‘after surgery’ with a smaller nose as she mouths ‘Wow’ in the mirror. A businessman is then shown hiding his mouth with his hand during a presentation to cover up his crooked teeth before seeing an image of ‘how he could look’, with a gleaming smile. A glum-looking woman wearing a baggy jumper to hide her flat chest is then shown glancing into a shop window as she walks past with her arms ‘crossed tightly across her chest’. When she looks back into the shop window she sees how ‘she could look’ with a boob job. Curves: A woman gains a fuller figure after her breast surgery in the advert. The ad led to 36 complaints and the Advertising Standards Authority said it was irresponsible and harmful to children . She then flashes her ‘new large breasts’ in a tight, low-cut red dress as she runs her hands down her new figure. A voiceover states: 'If you’re unhappy with your appearance you could change it. If it affects your confidence you could overcome it. If it makes you feel self-conscious, you could take control with cosmetic surgery or dentistry from The Hospital Group.' The three people are then shown ‘transformed’ and ‘admiring their new looks’ with huge smiles on their faces. On-screen text during the ad stated: 'No surgical procedure is entirely without risk. Subject to consultation. Over 18s only'. Hollywood smile: A man is shown as much happier after having cosmetic surgery on his teeth during the ad . Bosses at the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ad was shown at various times between 6.45pm and 10:45 pm on a number of different TV channels. The ASA did not uphold the complaint that the ad ‘trivialised cosmetic surgery’ or that it ‘implied that life’s happiness could be achieved through cosmetic surgery’. It did, however, rule that the ad breached guidelines on when it could be shown and judged it to be irresponsible and harmful to children watching. 'We considered it likely that many young teenagers would identify with such negative feelings about their physical appearance' Advertising Standards Authority . The ASA said: 'We were concerned that children, and in particular young teenagers, were likely to interpret the ad differently to adult viewers. 'The ad featured three characters who were depicted as unhappy with their appearance. 'The depictions of their sudden physical transformations were accompanied by an instant and dramatic change in their emotional wellbeing. 'We considered it likely that many young teenagers would identify with such negative feelings about their physical appearance. 'We considered the ad’s scenarios were likely to reinforce harmful feelings that those who did not have a ‘perfect’ physical appearance were unattractive and should be self-conscious about their looks, should aspire to a particular ideal of beauty, and that they should take action to change their physical appearance in order to meet that ideal. 'We therefore considered that a scheduling restriction should have been in place to minimise the risk of children, particularly young teenagers, seeing the ad. 'We concluded the ad should have been given a 9pm timing restriction.' The Hospital Group said the ad showed scenarios that were relevant in everyday life and that a lack of self-confidence was a 'significant factor' in surgery . Bosses at The Hospital Group Healthcare Ltd said the ad showed ‘scenarios that were relevant in everyday life’ and that patients had told it a ‘lack of self confidence’ was a ‘significant factor’ in them getting cosmetic surgery. Clearcast - which clears ads before they are aired - said each of the people shown represented a ‘valid reason’ why someone might consider cosmetic surgery. It said: 'The first woman did not like the appearance of her nose and was shown using make-up in an attempt to tone down how it looked, but she did not feel satisfied with this and so opted for cosmetic surgery. 'The man felt physically uncomfortable with how his teeth looked and felt it was affecting his ability to speak whilst presenting to work colleagues. 'The second woman would like to be able to wear clothing that would suit a fuller bust.'","Advert for The Hospital Group shows three adults after cosmetic surgery .

"A photograph forgotten for almost 80 years could hold the key to solving the mysterious disappearance of Amelia Earhart. The picture, taken immediately before the legendary aviator launched her ill-fated attempt to circumnavigate the globe from Miami in June 1937, shows a distinctive patch of aluminum bolted to the side of her Lockheed Model 10 Electra. Not seen in any other photographs of the plane, the metal plate appears to match a piece of aluminum recovered from a remote Pacific Island in 1991 - raising the possibility that she perished as a starving castaway having survived a terrifying crash-landing. Scroll down for video . Revelation: This picture shows a metal plate has covered the specially designed navigational window about two thirds of the way down the fuselage . Prominent Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie believes that the photograph proves the metal plate he found 23-years ago on Gardner Island was from Earhart's plane after it was bolted onto the side as a repair for a smashed window. Indeed, the picture which was recovered from the vaults of The Miami Herald, is the only one in existence to show the apparent aluminum covering, which Gillespie believes was installed after Earhart suffered a rough landing. Convinced, Gillespie's forensic analysis of the plate he found in 1991 revealed it was made from the same type of aluminum commonly used in the manufacture of planes made in America in the 1930s. However, Gillespie's theory was dismissed when it was shown that the rivet patterns on the plate did not match those used on Earhart's plane. Tragic: Amelia Earhart leans on the propeller on the right wing engine on her airplane. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan disappeared on a flight over the Pacific Ocean in July, 1937, and neither their plane nor their bodies were ever recovered . Comparison: Amelia Earhart poses on her 'flying laboratory,' a specially fitted Lockheed Electra plane, as it nears completion in 1936. This was the plane she used for the around-the-world flight the following year that ended with her disappearance - visible on the right hand side is the special navigation window that was covered up as revealed in Miami Herald photograph . But now Gillespie says that he has been vidicated because the new picture suggests that his plate was not part of the plane, rather it was bolted into place before her departure from Miami. If indeed, that is the case, then it challenges the accepted wisdom that Earhart crashed into the Pacific Ocean along with her navigator, Fred Noonan and died. 'The replacement of that window had to be done in Miami, at a Pan Am facility that was helping Earhart,' Gillespie told the Miami Herald. 'If we can match a rivet pattern from the repair in the photograph to a rivet pattern on the wreckage, I think it would be beyond dispute that Noonan and Earhart weren’t lost at sea, but made it to the island,' said Gillespie, the executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR). It would conclude what has become one of the most mythical and mysterious aviation disappearances in history. The aluminum plate brings the world closer to the resolution of this mystery, but would write a tragic final chapter. It would mean that instead of dying instantly in a plane crash, she and her navigator suffered from exposure, thirst and disease on Gardner Island, which is otherwise known as Nikumaroro. The specific repairs on Earhart's plane was to cover over the window specially installed in the rear of the plane. Remote: According to Ric Gillespie Amelia Earhart lived out her days on Gardner Island - a coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles from Hawaii . It was used by Noonan to take sightings of the sun and stars for navigation in the days before GPS and satellites. It is visible in all pictures of her plane taken in California before she started her attempt to fly around the world in May of 1937 from California. However, in the June 1, 1937 picture held by The Miami Herald, the window is gone, replaced with the aluminum plate. 'I think the window must have been broken or compromised by the hard landing in Miami,' Gillespie. 'It wasn’t standard equipment and they found out it would take a while to replace it, so they just took it out and patched the fuselage instead.' From Miami, Earhart carried on eastwards to Puerto Rico and onwards through South America, Africa and Asia. He plane suffered various problems with her radio that sometimes left her unable to communicate. Then on July 2, 1937, Earhart set off from Lae, New Guinea, headed for Howland Island, 2,600 miles away. Close-up view of an aircraft fuselage skin that is claimed to belong to famed aviatrix Amelia Earhart's plane as shown during a press conference in Washington on March 16, 1992.  The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery claims that the skin and other items including a woman's shoe prove conclusively that Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan perished on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro while on the final leg of a round-the-world flight in 1937 . Her radio antenna was damaged on take-off which was probably the reasons why she couldn't hear the Coast Guard there trying to make contact with her 19 hours later. Instead all they heard was her increasingly distressing updates which finished with radio silence. 'We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you,' she radioed. 'We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south.' The search for Earhart was launched almost immediately, but was hampered by the huge distances involved. Howland is in the middle of the giant Pacific Ocean and 1,700 miles from Hawaii. However, during the search, planes passed over a small patch of coral called Gardner Island, 400 miles from Howland and saw recent signs of habitation. However, they put that down to the tribes of Pacific Islanders who lived there and moved on, never finding anything. Conspiracy theories immediately sprang up about Earhart. For years the most popular was that she had been captured by the Japanese and tortured to death as a spy. Search: Ric Gillespie has been searching for Amelia Earhart for nearly 25-years . However, Gillespie became fixated with the idea that Earhart did not crash into the water and died, but rather she found herself on an uninhabited island. 'The key to it is her final message, where she says ‘line of position 157 dash 337,’ Gillespie said to The Miami Herald. 'That’s a line that Noonan calculated from the sunrise, running 337 degrees to the northwest and 157 degrees to the southeast. And if you follow it far enough, there are two deserted islands on it, McKeon Island and Gardner Island.' It was then that Gillespie discovered the story of 68-year-old ex-Marine, Floyd Kilts who in 1960 gave an interview to a San Diego newspaper about his experience there in 1946 to remove a navigational device from World War II. Kilts said a Micronesian tribesman living on the tiny island of Gardner told him that when he and others first arrived there in 1938 he found a partial human skeleton and a woman's shoes. There was a fire pit nearby that contained the bones of small birds and fish. The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro, or Gardner Island in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumor claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory. More so, that meant that the search party who saw signs of habitation in 1937 and assumed they were Pacific Islanders were wrong. Someone else had left that evidence. Gillespie made sure to visit Gardner and in 1991 discovered the scrap of aluminum 19 inches wide and 23 inches long. It is made from a substance called Alcoa Aluminum, better known as 24st Alclad - which was used in very nearly all American planes built in the 1930, including the Lockheed Electra. Gillespie's excitement got the better of him when he proclaimed the scrap to be evidence of Earhart's plane. This was quickly ruled out when it was demonstrated to Gillespie that the rivet patterns on the piece of metal do not match her plane. However, Gillespie persisted and when he read that the plane's navigational window was replaced before they took off from Miami he set about trying to find pictoral evidence. His problem was that most photographers took pictures of Earhart with the plane from the left hand side because that was where she preferred to fly and the window was known to be on the right hand side. It was then that he finally found the picture in the records of The Miami Herald this week.","New photograph could confirm theory of disappearance on July 2, 1937 .

"A new mum has told of the agony she felt after a doctor left a surgical swab 'half the size of her hand' inside her body for nearly two weeks. Theresa Nguyen, 28, from Wellington, New Zealand, was unable to walk and struggled to care for her baby son after the mistake at Wellington Hospital. Mrs Nguyen gave birth to her first child at 4.17am on June 19 – a daughter she and her husband Tomi, 33, gave the traditional Vietnamese name Quynh. Theresa Nguyen gave birth to her first child, daughter Quynh, on June 19 . Because Quynh's cord was wrapped around her neck, a specialist was called in to perform a delivery using a suction cup, which resulted in Mrs Nguyen's perineum tearing. On a particularly busy night at on the ward, when the doctor was dealing with five women in labour, the doctor soaked up the excess blood with surgical swabs and gave her stitches before leaving. 'Unfortunately he didn't count the amount of swabs he used,' Mrs Nguyen told MailOnline. She spent two days in hospital and a further two days on a post-natal ward, where she was given painkillers. Once the drugs started to wear off when Mrs Nguyen returned home,she began to experience significant pain. 'It felt like something was digging inside me, it was a stabbing pain,' she said. Mrs Nguyen couldn't walk up the stairs, sit without pain, or get up and down through the night to feed Quynh. After the birth the doctor left a surgical swab inside her body, which she said was the size of a sanitary pad rolled up . Her husband had to take an extra week off work because she was unable to care for their daughter by herself during the day. Almost two weeks after the birth, Mrs Nguyen made an appointment to see her local doctor - which she almost cancelled because she thought the discomfort was 'just normal'. 'I actually spoke to a friend and said I felt quite uncomfortable and she said it took her a month to recover and I thought, ""maybe it's just normal"". It's been less than two weeks.' She ended up going to the appointment on Monday and the doctor who conducted her internal examination initially thought Mrs Nguyen had a 'big white cyst'. Mrs Nguyen was unable to sit without extreme pain because of the swab . Another doctor, called in to give a second opinion, said he thought she had something stuck inside her. Doctors removed the surgical swab with forceps, a procedure she described as 'really painful… it was like a mini-birth without the contractions'. Mrs Nguyen said the surgical swab was 'really big, bigger than half of my hand. It was the size of a sanitary pad rolled up and it had expanded because of the blood.' Mrs Nguyen said she was terrified by what they had found. 'You read stories about toxic shock syndrome with tampons after only a few days,' she said. She has been put on strong antibiotics and is awaiting the results of tests to make sure she has not contracted an infection. Mrs Nguyen said that she received an apology from two senior staff members at the hospital yesterday, which she accepted. 'The doctor was very professional, a very lovely guy… I don't blame the doctor, he was just under too much pressure,' she said. Two days after the swab was removed, Mrs Nguyen said she is feeling great and able to concentrate on her daughter. 'I feel so much better, it's amazing the difference that it's made. It's only onwards and upwards.'","Theresa Nguyen from Wellington gave birth to her first child on June 19 .

"Rugby league will endure another alcohol-fueled drama after a Queensland State of Origin player was accused of assault at a pub just 15 hours after he was named in the side. Rookie winger Will Chambers is at the centre of allegations he pushed a patron and sparked a scuffle at a Brisbane bar in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Chambers, only named to make his Origin debut earlier on Tuesday, had been with several teammates at the Down Under Bar at a late-night bonding session. Scroll down for video . Rookie winger Will Chambers is at the centre of allegations he pushed a patron and sparked a scuffle at a Brisbane bar in the early hours of Wednesday morning . Police and the Queensland Rugby League have confirmed they are investigating the incident. Tristan Furniss, 24, made a formal complaint against Chambers and was questioned at length on Wednesday. Furniss told Nine News he was pushed in the back after snatching a friend's hat back off the Melbourne Storm three-quarter. 'I didn't know it was coming. It was almost cowardly,' he said. 'I grabbed the hat and I was walking back to our table, which was the next table, and the next thing I know my back is thumping on the ground and I'm on the ground and all this stuff is going on on top of me. 'After the incident ... he was almost remorseful. 'He walked off to the side and had his head down. I think he knew he was in the wrong.' Police and the Queensland Rugby League have confirmed they are investigating the incident after a 24-year-old claimed he was pushed in the back by Chambers . Chambers declined to speak when he entered the Maroons' training base on the Gold Coast. Teammates Billy Slater, Aidan Guerra, Ben Teo and Darius Boyd were out with Chambers at the Edward St nightspot, according to Nine News. No punches were thrown during the scuffle and Slater reportedly pulled the parties apart. The incident, which comes days after Cronulla star Todd Carney was sacked for a lewd photograph taken at a urinal in a Sydney bar, has also been referred to the NRL Integrity Unit. The investigation has put a serious cloud over Chambers' involvement in next Wednesday's dead-rubber at Suncorp Stadium and could continue his gut-wrenching run of being a 'nearly man'. The incident allegedly took place at Brisbane's Down Under Bar during a late night team bonding session with several Queensland players . The 26-year-old, who played for the Queensland Reds in 2010-11, almost made the Wallabies in his two seasons of rugby union, and has spent the past two seasons on the fringes of the Maroons side. Chambers was 18th man for game two in Sydney and his game three call-up had come after veteran winger Brent Tate badly injured his knee. 'It's great to see Willie get his chance,' centre Justin Hodges told AAP on Tuesday. 'He has earned the right to be here.' Queensland's Origin team has prior history at the Down Under Bar with coach Mal Meninga landing himself in hot water last year for going behind the bar to pour himself a drink. 'The League is currently working with the relevant authorities to determine the facts and will be making no further comment until this is complete,' the QRL said in a statement. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Will Chambers was at a late-night bonding session with Queensland teammates at Brisbane's Down Under Bar .

"A daughter stole her sick father's life savings to go on a £70,000 spending spree while he spent the last years of his life in a care home. Lynne Waddle was given Power of Attorney over her father Ralph McAlpine after he moved to the home in 2006, and was supposed to spend his £100,000 life savings on care fees. Instead the the 50-year-old, of Annitsford, Tyne and Wear, drew five-figure cash sums for herself which she spent on holidays and laser treatment over three years, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Spending spree: Lynn Waddle was given Power of Attorney over her father after he moved to a home in 2006, and was supposed to spend his £100,000 life savings on care fees. Instead she drew cash for herself . Authorities launched an investigation after it emerged in 2011 that there was no money left to pay Mr McAlpine's fees. They discovered Waddle had taken sums of up to £20,000 from her father’s accounts between 2007 and 2010. By the time 77-year-old Mr McAlpine died last year, his care home was owed £17,000 - a cost which had to be met by the taxpayer. Prosecutor Paul Wardlaw said: 'The police became involved, and in June last year they arrested Miss Waddle. She was too upset to be interviewed. Sentence: Lynne Waddle, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court, was spared jail . 'In July she was interviewed and accepted, essentially, she had been on a spending spree. 'She had used the money belonging to her father for holdidays. for laser treatment and other things. 'In total she accepts she took some £70,827.' Waddle pleaded guilty to theft. Mr Recorder Barker sentenced her to 20 months in jail, suspended for two years, and 100 hours unpaid work. He said he could take a 'merciful course' after hearing Waddle was the sole beneficiary of the cash and had no previous encounters with police. Kate Barnes, defending, said Waddle had 'enormous respect and love' for her father and did not act out of malice when she spent the money. Miss Barnes added Mr McAlpine had encouraged his daughter to have surgery on her eyes and had not objected when she spent money. 'She has lost her family through it,' Miss Barnes said. 'Her children are estranged from her having learned her involvement in this offence.' The judge told Waddle: 'There is a public . interest in maintaining the ingegrity of Power of Attorney, because . when people lose the ability to control their own affairs it is . important that others close to them have the ability to manage their . affairs for them. 'It is important the Power of Attorney system is not abused and certainly not abused in the way you abused it. 'Theft of these monies constitutes a high degree breach of trust.' 'Merciful': Waddle was spared jail at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) and given a suspended sentence .","Lynne Waddle's father Ralph McAlpine had to move to a care home in 2006 .

"These pictures show a scientist being savagely beaten up in the street by two drunken thugs after he dared to make friendly conversation with them   at the end of a night out. CCTV images captured the moment Dr Dominic Henry, 32, paid a terrible price for engaging in small talk with strangers Alan Croydon and Arron Buckley as   he waited to get a cab home in Manchester city centre. For no reason, Dr Henry was punched to the ground and then kicked and stamped on up to 15 times 'with deadly intent' as he lay defenceless on the   ground. Scroll down for video . Attack: These pictures show the savage and unprovoked assault endured by a scientist in Manchester city centre in December . Blows raining down: Dr Dominic Henry was punched to the ground and then kicked and stamped on up to 15 times . The senior metallurgist, who works as a senior technical project leader for a chemical firm, was left with a badly bruised and swollen face and 'dips'   in his scalp. He managed to get home and when his wife, an NHS manager, saw his beaten face she began crying. He was admitted to hospital for a brain scan and later   feared he would lose his job after having to hold key meetings with global leading aerospace companies whilst nursing a black eye. The victim now believes the streets of home city will always 'pose a danger beyond many expectations'. In a statement Dr Henry - who works with Manchester Metropolitan University - said: 'Not being a small guy I naively felt I would be okay. 'I was   talking to them for a few minutes before they started punching. The fear began to build in me as one punched me from the side. Thug: Alan Croydon was locked away for 12 months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm. Dr Dominic Henry said the sustained attack was 'terrifying' 'It felt surreal. Scary. I lay there while they kicked and stamped on my head. I   couldn't believe it. The attack was brutal, violent, beyond the scope of my imagination. 'I could not comprehend how another human being could be so vicious and with such deadly intent without any just cause. As the kicks and stamps reigned   down, thud thud thud, I wondered how long it would last. 'I could feel the pain on my hands, arms and head. I was scared. They really wanted to hurt and damage me. It was terrifying. 'Never did I think this would be part of our lives, having to go through tests including a CT scan felt intimidating. I was an innocent, hardworking   man that didn't deserve what I got.' He added . that he had felt 'embarrassed' about his injuries and that the events of . the night had nearly taken away his successful career because his . black eye had 'not looked good professionally'. He . added: 'I just want to feel confident again but worry that the streets . of Manchester will always   pose a danger beyond many expectations.' Dr . Henry spoke out as Croydon, 25, from Manchester, was locked away for 12 . months after pleading guilty to assault occasioning actual body harm. A . warrant was issued with for Buckley, also 25, who has gone on the . run.  The case comes as Inspector Ian Hanson, 47, of Greater Manchester . Police said he himself would not go out in Manchester after midnight . because it is   'too dangerous'. Manchester . Crown Court was told the unprovoked attack occurred last December after . Dr Henry had been out socialising with friends at the Malmaison   Hotel . and a bar the city's trendy Northern Quarter district. The victim had work commitments the following morning and left early to hail a cab home but stopped when he came across Croydon, Buckley and a third man   loitering on a street corner. They began talking to him and spoke briefly to them only for his heart to begin 'racing' when the thugs suddenly turned   on him. Prosecuting, John Wilcox said: 'At first the conversation seemed to be pleasant enough. It clearly turned worse and then he was subject to the   initial punch by Croydon. 'His co-accused then got involved. He was kicked to the ground at which stage he says things became blurry. He could feel the punches to his head and   body.' Out of the blue: The men were seen chatting amiably before Alan Croydon launched his vicious assault . The senior metallurgist, who works as a senior technical project leader for a chemical firm, was left with a badly bruised and swollen face and 'dips' in his scalp . The judge said that Croydon was 'very, very lucky' that his attack didn't seriously injure the scientist - or worse . He added that Croydon initially struck five times to his head and body whilst Buckley hit him ten times. Mr Wilcox added: 'But to compound matters,   both returned to the victim and attacked him.'  The court heard that Croydon kicked the scientist a further three times before leaving the scene. Dr Henry had to use a handkerchief to wipe the blood   from his lip before phoning his wife before making his way home and reporting it to the police the following day. He added that although he returned to work the next day, his wife's work suffered and had also had an impact on her team. The court heard Croydon had been drunk on brandy following an all-day drinking session. He was previously given a suspended sentence for a racially   aggravated public order offence in 2011 and was subject to a community order in 2012 for possession of cannabis. This still from the CCTV footage shows the scientist being attacked as he attempts to stagger to his feet . Defence counsel Mr Steve Tettey said that his client had 'a reliance on alcohol' and added: 'There can be no dispute on the culpability. For Mr Henry   the psychological scars will remain long after his black eye heals. 'There is no good explanation for the defendant's conduct, the truth is he was so intoxicated, he had consumed over eight brandies having drunk   substantially during the day. He cannot recall the incident he was so intoxicated.' But the judge Mr Recorder Charles Garside QC told Croydon: 'You took part in what appears to have been a completely unprovoked attack on a stranger in   Manchester city centre. 'It goes without saying this was in the hours of darkness, you struck the first blow and you and your confederate used shod feet and fists. 'This was a   sustained and repeated assault. You take a leading role in the attack and you used shod feet as a weapon. 'The really aggravating factor is having kicked him to the ground, left him lying in the pavement and starting to move away, you and another went back   and went kicking and stamping on him again. 'The thing that marks this assault out is the fact that you returned to a man who was dazed and unable to defend himself. 'You were very, very lucky that no greater harm was done.' After the case Det Con Paul Wilde from Greater Manchester Police said: 'These two men viciously attacked an innocent man as he walked home after a   Christmas party. 'The CCTV clearly shows the ferocity of this attack and the man was very lucky to have walked away with minor injuries. 'Croydon and Buckley subjected   the man to an unprovoked and violent attack and such disgraceful acts will not be tolerated.'","Dr Dominic Henry was punched to the ground, kicked and stamped on .

"Tragedy: Kyle Winterbottom slipped and fell from a balcony during a party and had ecstasy and ketamine in his system . The mother of a schoolboy who died after falling from a balcony while on ecstasy and ketamine has warned that 'peer pressure' could lead to more teenagers dying. Joanne's Kelly's son Kyle Winterbottom, 16, slipped  as he clambered onto a third floor balcony during a party. The teenager, a talented rugby player, boxer, and swimmer, had traces in his system of ecstasy and ketamine a powerful drug used as an anaesthetic by vets to sedate horses. Witnesses described seeing Kyle with 'wide eyes' and a 'slack jaw' in the run up to his death in Oldham, Greater Manchester. Today police were hunting Sean Dockerty, 20, who lives at the flat where the incident unfolded after he failed to attend an inquest into Kyle's death. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. Officers investigated claims Kyle's drink may have been spiked with drugs after his parents said he did not abuse them - but found no evidence. The inquest was adjourned while Dockerty is traced. Outside the hearing  Ms Kelly, 41, a cafe owner said: 'Kyle's death has been devastating for the family and I don't want any other youngster to end up like him. 'I would say don't feel under pressure from your peers to take things when you don't know what you are taking. My Kyle wasn't always taking drugs - he wasn't like that - and now he's dead. 'Life is just not the same anymore. It never will be. I can't get my head around the thought that he's not here. 'He was just 16 - he would still give me a kiss when he was going out. It's heartbreaking. I will never get over it. I can never see past tomorrow at the moment.' Distraught: Kyle Winterbottom's mother Joanne (centre), pictured leaving her son's inquest with his father James, right, and uncle Allan, has said: 'I don't want any other youngster to end up like him' The accident occured in August 2012 after Kyle met up with friends at a house for drinks before going to a party in flats over two floors of the building. Witness David Major said he was at a party on the first floor of the block of flats at Heywood House, while Kyle was at the party on the third floor. In a statement Major said: 'Six or seven people came down from the party and started talking to us and asking for cigarettes. They were all drunk and had been using drugs. They were putting it into drinks and rubbing it on their gums. 'The group of lads had been talking to us for ten minutes when I heard shouting become loud an saw a male fall from the top while it looked like he was trying to swing to the other balcony. He fell straight down. 'One of the lads then punched me to the side of the jaw. They then ran off to the stairwell and I phoned an ambulance for the male I had seen. 'Once the ambulance had gone I left the flats away to Oldham. As we reached a road I saw another group of lads. Because of the time and their age I knew they must have been at Heywood House. I asked if the lad was OK and they said he was fine. 'I asked, 'why would he jump?' and one was waving a snap bag and he said, 'he is on this, we are all wired'.' Scene: 16-year-old Kyle died when he fell 40ft from this top balcony at a party he attended in Oldham . Friends: Leighton Brown, 19, Carlton Ellison, 18, Sean Docherty, 18 and Lee Bailey, 16, surrounded with tributes to Kyle . The inquest heard that at an earlier party nearby attended by boys and girls as young as 15 an older group were dishing out the party drug MDMA for free around a picnic table in the back garden. Investigation: Police said that they had considered whether Kyle's drink was spiked but found no evidence . A boy, now 17, who can't be named for legal reasons, denied spiking Kyle's drink but said that everybody around the table was 'more than likely doing drugs'. He added: 'I didn't see Kyle take any. But his eyes were wide and his jaw was grinding. He was gurning. He was clenching his teeth. I had seen people in worse states than he was in. 'I heard there was a party in Chadderton and everyone was going to go there but I stuck to my party. On the Sunday evening I went on Facebook and I saw 'RIP Kyle'. 'I had a look at who it was. It was then that I recognised him as the same person who I had met at the party. There were already messages and rumours suggesting I had spiked him. 'One of the rumours was that I put two full bags in his drink but that's £60 worth and I couldn't afford that.' During police inquries officers visiting 56 addresses during more than a year of investigation but concluded there was no third party involvement in Kyle's death. Coroner Simon Nelson adjourned the hearing for Dockerty to be arrested and presented at the inquest. Kyle's uncle Allan Winterbottom, 40, pleaded with Dockerty to explain what happened that evening. 'Just come forward and tell the truth,' he said. 'You're supposed to be his friend. Just tell us what happened. Kyle was a top lad. A loveable character. He had a lot of friends and would do anything for anyone. He was a very talented sportsman and lived life to the full.' Kyle's father, James Winterbottom, 42, added: 'Something needs to be done.. You hear too many of these horror stories. Kyle didn't even like cigarettes. I don't know how this could have happened.' Kyle the third youngest of eight children to parents Joanne and Jimmy was set to received good GCSE grades from Hathershaw College in Oldham. He took part in a triathlon event in Liverpool and played rugby for the youth team at Oldham St Annes Rugby Club.","Kyle Winterbottom slipped and fell in block of flats in Oldham .

"A crumbling city flattened by an earthquake filled with families still struggling to rebuild their lives needed nothing short of a superhero, and lucky for a New Zealand city that's exactly what they got. Flatman emerged from the rubble following one of the most devastating natural disasters Christchurch had ever seen, anonymously delivering supplies to those who needed it most. Now, nearly three years into his mission the secretive superhero is going from strength to strength armed with his simple message 'Be a bruv... Share the luv', and a whole lot of kindness. Scroll down for video . Flatman, the hero Christchurch needs has been delivering food packs, working with kids and spreading random acts of kindness across the New Zealand city since 2011 . The anonymous red and black caped crusader has been buying and delivering food parcels to struggling families, quake-hit residents and impoverished students of the flattened city. 'People had this real negative vibe around Christchurch and I wanted to change that . A lot of my friends were leaving the city and more people followed,' Flatman told the Daily Mail Australia. 'I love Christchurch and have always lived here so I wanted to bring back some joy and happiness to the city in a quirky fun way. Initially I thought to just help my friends with some food package deliveries but then changed it to strangers, and within one day I had made a Facebook page, ordered a costume and delivered my first two food packages to people.' A new short documentary in sync with the superhero's strong social media presence gives an insight into the life of Flatman and brings to light the good deeds he does for those in need. Originally Flatman's aim was to help struggling students, knowing all too well the toils of studying while trying to support yourself, made all the more difficult by the earthquake. 'The first people I was delivering to were all students...Seeing as a lot were leaving Christchurch for Australia or further afield it seemed like a way I could help. 'So that's why the name 'Flatman' came about as students pretty much all live in flats together. It wasn't until it started getting in the local papers that the focus changed from students to families and children, and pretty much anyone that could do with some cheering up,' he said. The caped crusader travels to school around the city teaching kids the power of kindness . Flatman is recognised in his home town by his distinct lycra costume, as he delivers packages to those in need . The superhero gets around in his Flat mobile, spreading generosity wherever he goes . The Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 flattened the city on New Zealand's south island, killing 185 and devastating many more who escaped with their lives but barely anything else. Since the devastating natural disaster, Flatman's focus has now changed, and he is now quite literally the city's hero, travelling far and wide to work with school kids, inspiring them to be their very own superheroes by 'being kind, generous, and looking out for each other.' In his red and black lycra costume complete with a mask and gloves, Flatman spreads hope with random acts of kindness, including what he calls 'Flatman vs traffic jam packs', small gifts given to drivers stuck in traffic to brighten their days. But his trademark power is the secret delivery of food packs, which he drops on people's doorsteps when they least expect it, often when they haven't even asked for help. These packs generally include some basic food items plus some other goodies, and always have toilet paper in them. 'The food packages are a mixture of essentials like toilet paper, tomato sauce , rice and pasta to more of the treat items like Oreos, Tim Tams, lollies and chips. Most food packages are around the $30 mark,' Flatman said. Originally Flatman paid for these all out of his own pocket, and admitted he could spend up to $600 per month putting together the parcels. Flatman visits kids across the city spreading his message and teaching kids to look out for each other . Community engagement is just part of Flatman's duties as the Christchurch superhero . He also attends charity events, but is never without his mask and cape . Flatman started his self-driven mission following the devastation of the Christchurch earthquake in 2011, which destroyed the city and left thousands without their homes . Now thanks to sponsorship and community donations, the caped crusader has a little more help providing to those in need, and can assist with more specific requests. 'I started off paying for the groceries myself which some months would get super expensive but it never worried me as my main focus was helping others,' Flatman revealed. 'I now have sponsors like Stadium Cars who gave me the flat mobile to make my deliveries in, and also Countdown (supermarket) and Hubbards cereal who provide me with vouchers and food to distribute to deserving people.' As well as inspiring school kids all around the city, Flatman visits children's hospitals - often calling in the help of his super friends to brighten up the lives of sick kids. Earlier this month he staged a 'Superhero Takeover', a visit to the Children's Ward at Christchurch Hospital to spread to the 'luv' to young ones and their families struggling with illness. With a crew bragging Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Iron Man and Captain America and more in tow, the band of merry men and women took over the ward in true superhero style scaling buildings, surprising children and spreading love. With his horizons ever expanding, Flatman revealed he responds to all sorts of requests that come to him from the local community. Since humble beginnings in 2011 Flatman has the support of his community behind him . Inspiring kids to be their own superhero is just part of what Flatman does, all while donning a spectacular red and black lycra costume . Another of the hero's trademarks is 'Flatman vs traffic packs' which can include stress balls or lollies for drivers stuck in their cars . 'I get a mixture of requests and nominations through my Facebook page and email. I never judge anyone that writes in as anybody is deserving of an act of random kindness. And that's what it is,' he said. 'I know that one food package isn't going to change the world but it might just make their day, week or month that little bit easier knowing someone has taken a moment of their day to care about them.' Flatman originally had a side-kick, Quake Boy, but is now on the hunt for a new friend to join him, and duties would include 'delivering of food packages, spreading joy and teaching children the powers of kindness'. The prospective assistant must also be able to drive the Flat mobile, a bright red decorated car splashed with Flatman's name, and will also need to don their very own lycra costume. When asked what was next on the agenda, the secret superhero said he would love to be Flatman full-time but it's too difficult to juggle around work. This however, is not a deterrent and he is committed to continuing his incredible work. 'Ive always got plans for the future. Being a superhero you never stop thinking up ways of trying to help others ,' Flatman said. 'Some of my more ambitious ideas are to create a Superhero Base right here in Christchurch that I can not only work from but kids can come and visit, interact with and leave with the message that anyone can be a superhero if they're kind, generous and show compassion to others. Flatman is now on the look out for a side-kick, someone who can help spread the message of kindness to kids all while wearing lycra . The superhero wants to travel to other parts of the world and assist in areas that suffered similar devastation to his hometown Christchurch . 'I'd also love to take the message to other countries who perhaps have gone through equally tough natural disasters like Christchurch and visit kids and families to help lighten the situation using kindness and fun as the main drives. 'I need to be Flatman full-time with the all the school requests , charity and events requests and food deliveries. Maybe one day the right company or person will step up to make this childhood dream come true.' If you'd like to help Flatman's cause, you can donate here, or keep up with the superhero's adventures here.","Flatman is the city superhero in Christchurch, New Zealand who emerged following the devastating earthquake in 2011 .

"Article, written by editors Fiona Godlee, Tim Delamo and Rosamund Snow, argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised, very few patients would chose to end their lives this way . Doctors should be allowed to help terminally ill patients to die, one of Britain’s most influential medical journals says today. But the BMJ’s call for assisted suicide to be legalised provoked immediate alarm and anger in the profession. In an editorial, the publication – formerly the British Medical Journal – says the terminally ill must be allowed to ‘call time on their lives’ when it is in their best interests. Senior doctors warned that such a change in the law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives. The British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of GPs – all oppose assisted suicide and polls show most doctors share the same view. A recent survey by the Royal College of GPs found that almost 80 per cent of family doctors opposed a law change to allow assisted dying. The BMJ is owned by the BMA but has editorial independence. The article, written by editors Fiona Godlee, Tim Delamo and Rosamund Snow, argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised, very few patients would chose to end their lives this way. It states: ‘People should be able to exercise choice over their lives, which should include how and when they die, when death is imminent. ‘Recognition of an individual’s right to determine his or her best interests lies at the heart of this journal’s strategy to advance the patient revolution in healthcare.’ The authors refer to Oregon state in the US, where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997. Only 71 patients there took  life-ending medication last  year, the equivalent in Britain to one patient for every GP practice, they claim. Senior doctors warned that such a change in the law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives . They quote figures from the British Social Attitudes Survey of 2010 which found 82 per cent supported assisted dying. It is the first time the BMJ has publicly backed assisted dying and the article follows calls from a leading doctor yesterday for medical staff to be trained to end lives. Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the law should be changed to allow medics to help patients die without fear of prosecution and there should be health professionals equivalent to midwives to administer fatal doses of medicine. ‘Just as midwives help babies come into the world, some terminally ill patients in pain may seek the help of a health professional to end their life,’ he said. But Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said: ‘Doctors’ key role is to protect the vulnerable. ‘What we want to avoid is a situation where older people feel pressurised into requesting assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden to their relatives.’ Former surgeon Dr Peter Saunders, of the campaign group Care Not Killing, said: ‘The BMJ is completely out of step with the medical profession. The current law exists to protect the vulnerable and those without a voice: Disabled, terminally ill and elderly people, who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives.’ Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA council, said: ‘There are strongly held views within the medical profession on both sides of this complex and emotive issue. ‘The BMA remains firmly opposed to legalising assisted dying. This issue has been regularly debated at the BMA’s policy forming annual conference and recent calls for a change in the law have persistently been rejected.’ Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘Good palliative and terminal care does not require assisted dying.’ The issue will be debated by the House of Lords this month under a Bill, put forward by Labour peer Lord Falconer, which would allow terminally ill patients with less than six months to live to end their lives with a fatal dose of medicine. They would first have to get a form signed by two doctors. Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The practice has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 and around 4,000 patients a year end their lives in this way.","BMJ’s backing has provoked immediate alarm and anger in the profession .

"The 12-year-old boy who died from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Boy Scout camp near San Diego on Monday has been identified. The San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office identified the boy on Tuesday as William Shook, of Las Vegas. Authorities are yet to determine whether Shook's death was a suicide or if the gun discharged accidentally. Ientified: Authorities identified the 12-year-old boy who suffered a fatal gunshot wound as William Shook . Chaperone: The boy's father is Las Vegas attorney John Shook, who was chaperoning the trip . Police are also trying to determine how the boy got the gun - according to KTNV, the gun is not registered, and authorities believe the boy brought it with him from Las Vegas. Shook is son of Las Vegas attorneys John Shook and Julie Shook, a deputy Clark County, Nevada, district attorney. The boy's father was at the camp as a chaperone. Police received a call early Monday morning that a boy had shot himself at the camp on Fiesta Island, Officer Matt Tortorella told The Associated Press. Officers found a gun in the boy's tent. It's not clear yet where the gun came from or how it got into the camp. Crime scene: Police say the 12-year-old shot himself in the head in a tent at Fiesta Island Youth Camp and Youth Aquatic Center . Shut down: Police have closed the camp to visitors while they investigate the tragedy . Police said that when they arrived, they found a 12-year-old boy in a tent with at least one gunshot wound. They tried to revive the child, but he died on the scene. The boy and his Boy Scout troop arrived at the camp on Sunday intending to stay until July 5. There were no firearm programs or activities available at the camp, and Boy Scouts of America policy does not allow personal firearms at its events, organization spokesman Deron Smith said. Distressed: Other campers have been provided with grief counselors following the death of one of their Scout group . Summer holiday: The boys were to spend the week sailing, kayaking and swimming but a shooting in a 12-year-old's tent has cut the camp short . 'This is an extremely sad day for our entire scouting family,' Boy Scouts of America said in a statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and all those who experienced this tragedy. Our top priority is providing support to our community and for those in the grieving process.' The organization said grief counselors were sent to the camp. The boy's father was a chaperone for the troop, and about 20 Scouts were at the camp, Lieutenant Mike Hastings said. The weeklong summertime program allows Scouts to camp among sandy dunes on Mission Bay in San Diego. They can sail, kayak, and do other activities while earning merit badges.","The 12-year-old boy who died Monday morning of a gunshot wound to the head has been identified as William Shook .

"A Bollywood star has been leading a double life - as a customer services officer at Oxfordshire County Council. Sonia Gill, 27, is a poster girl in India, where she has starred in five blockbusters - as well as fashion shoots, TV commercials and soap adverts. But despite her increasing fame abroad, she refuses to ditch her regular 9-to-5 job at home in Oxford. Scroll down for video . Double life: Sonia Gill, 27, is a Bollywood poster girl (left) between shifts at Oxfordshire County Council (right) Star: The Oxford-born actress has starred in five movies after being scouted at university in Buckinghamshire . At the council, she works on the Blue Badge team - processing applications and issuing parking badges for people with mobility problems. And any film parts she gets will have to wait until she gets a holiday. She said: 'I actually enjoy both jobs. I enjoy working at the council - the people are really nice. I like talking to people so working in customer services, that’s an advantage. 'I love everything about India and I have really good friends over there. The weather is great and the lifestyle is really good. 'It’s totally different to here - I have someone doing my cooking and cleaning. But coming back to the UK brings me back to reality. It keeps me grounded. 'It’s actually quite good for me because I’m quite a private person.' Sonia's career began when a scout spotted photos of her on Facebook while she was a Law student at Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe, which lead to her modelling in Asian bridal magazines. Work: Sonia 'loves' her job in which she processes Blue Badge applications and issues disability permits . Secret: Sonia has yet to tell colleagues she flies all over the world for films like Let's Play The Game (pictured) Work: She spent two months intensively learning Hindi and now gets offered lead roles in romantic comedies . At 22, she was offered a role in Let’s Play The Game and she flew to New York and New Jersey to shoot the Indian film. Later, she was offered roles in Mumbai, including television adverts and fashion shows, before starring in movie Society. And last December she spent six weeks shooting romantic comedy Arsho in the Punjab region of India, which has recently been released in UK cinemas. Incredibly, she even learned Hindi. 'I did it in a couple of months. I just converse with the locals but I still have a British accent so that works against me. 'But every time I come back people say I have an Indian accent!' She added: 'I usually go to India for six months and do a lot of modelling and acting and the other six months I’m usually here because my family are here. 'I’m pretty well known over there because I do a lot of TV commercials and I’m the face of a soap called Santoor.' And Sonia has even kept her alter ego a secret from her co-workers. Alter ego: Looking ravishing in gold, this is Sonia at one of her premieres with her co-stars who work full time . 'Nobody at work knows what I do, well they didn’t until now,' she said. 'They’re quite excited. They had no idea. I was hiding it so it was quite a shock for them. I didn’t really want the attention because I’m quite shy.' She added: 'When we do dancing we have a lot of rehearsals. It’s quite tough. I’m not an experienced dancer but I love to dance. 'You get to do all sorts of different dances - one day you’re doing jazz, then you’re doing contemporary then Bollywood.' But despite her anonymity here, Sonia took her friends and family to watch her in action on the big screen. 'I just had a movie released two weeks ago called Arsho,' she said. 'My family and I watched if together in Leicester Square. 'My family and friends were really excited - they were shouting and screaming in the screen. They were pretty impressed. I don’t think they expected much from me!'","Sonia Gill, 27, scouted when studying law degree in Buckinghamshire at 22 .

"Fear: Robbie Rodgers quit football after coming out but has now signed for LA Galaxy . An American footballer who used to play for Leeds United has announced he is gay and retiring from the sport aged just 25. Robbie Rogers, a Southern California native currently based in London, made the announcement in a heartfelt blog entry. The winger - who also played for Stevenage - revealed how he would feared he would suffer discrimination if he revealed his sexuality. In a blog entitled ‘The Next Chapter’, . Rogers wrote: ‘Things are never what they seem. My whole life I have . felt different. To overcome your fears you must be strong and have faith . in your purpose. ‘For the past 25 years I have been . afraid to show who I really was because of fear that judgment and . rejection would hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.' It comes as the Football Association . continues to try and tackle discrimination against homosexuality in the sport. Only a handful of footballers have ever announced they are gay as many still fear coming out will damage their careers. Footballer Justin Fashanu was the first and only English player to publicly announce he was homosexual. The Norwich City and Nottingham Forest player committed suicide eight years later in 1998. Rogers, who represented his country 18 times, including at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, also told how he kept his sexuality a secret even from his friends and family. He wrote: 'Fear that . my loved ones would be farthest from me if they knew my secret. ‘Life is only complete when your loved . ones know you. When they know your true feelings, when they know who . and how you love. Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the . pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding . questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret. Scroll down for video interview with Robbie Rogers . Explanation: American Rogers made his announcement via a heartfelt entry on his blog . ‘Secrets can cause so much internal . damage. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay. Try convincing yourself that your creator has the most wonderful purpose . for you even though you were taught differently. ‘I always thought I could hide this . secret. Football was my escape, my purpose, my identity. Football hid my . secret, gave me more joy than I could have ever imagined… I will always . be thankful for my career.’ Rogers rose to prominence at . Columbus Crew in MLS, scoring 13 goals in over 100 appearances and . earning international colors in the process. International player: American footballer Robbie Rogers has played for Leeds United and Stevenage . He then moved to Leeds United, a team . in the second tier of English football, on the advice of USA coach . Juergen Klinsmann. Rogers struggled with injuries and, after making only . nine appearances in five . months on loan at Stevenage, he has decided to call it a day. Rogers, who has more than 75,000 followers  finishes his blog with: ‘I will . remember Beijing, The MLS Cup, and most of all my teammates. I will . never forget the friends I have made along the way and the friends that . supported me once they knew my secret. A host of MLS players and international teammates have voiced their encouragement about Rogers' decision. New England Revolution and U.S. midfielder Benny Feilhaber wrote: 'proud to call you my friend.' New York Red Bulls and U.S. defender Heath Pearce tweeted: 'proud of you fam!' Chivas USA keeper Dan Kennedy offered 'ur the man Robbie we support u bro,' while teammate Juan Agudelo tweeted: 'Respect man. Proud of you bro.' LA Galaxy and USA center back Omar Gonzalez wrote, 'Congrats, Robbie! Really happy for you.' Gonzalez's fellow LA defender A.J. DeLaGarza tweeted, 'good for you man! All the best! Terps.' FC Dallas goalkeeper Chris Seitz praised Rogers' courage saying, 'really want to give a huge shout out to a great friend for being one of the bravest men I know' D.C. United's Chris Pontius wrote, 'Much respect. Nothing but support for you.' Vancouver Whitecaps defender Jordan Harvey chimed in with: 'Congrats brotha. Wish you the best.' Former U.S. international Sacha Kljestan wrote: '100 percent love and support for one of my best friends Robbie Rogers. You will be missed on the pitch. Amazing talent, amazing person.' Bolton Wanderers and U.S. midfielder Stu Holden sent: 'Much love and respect to my boy @robbierogers! Proud to be your friend bro.' Former USA star Eddie Pope hailed Rogers as a pioneer: 'Brave men like you will make it so that one day there's no need for an announcement. That day can't arrive soon enough. #support . ‘Now is my time to step away. It’s . time to discover myself away from football.  It’s 1 A.M. in London as I . write this and I could not be happier with my decision. 'Life is so full of amazing things. I realized I could only truly enjoy my life once I was honest. 'Honesty is a bitch but makes life so . simple and clear. My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and . live my life as my creator intended.’ Roger played for the U.S. national team 18 times, scoring twice. He featured in all three of the team's games at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup squad. Ruth Hunt, director of public affairs . for UK-based lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, said: 'It's . great that Robbie now feels able to be open about his sexuality but it . remains a shame that no professional player feels able to be out during . their career. 'Homophobia remains rife in football and we must work together to stop it for the sake of the game.' Gordon . Taylor, chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association in the . U.K., told Press Association: 'I'm pleased that he's come out for his . own sake. We do have players who've said that, while they are gay, they . don't feel comfortable enough to come out. 'It's . not dissimilar to many black players, and we need to create a safe . environment for them on and off the field. If there is abuse, that needs . to be dealt with by all the football family. 'It's no bad thing that he's . been brave enough to come out. We know of players who are playing who . are gay who've not had that confidence as yet. But, as the rest of the . world becomes more civilized, hopefully that will come.' Taylor . added that the PFA remains committed to programs of education on all . topics relating to discrimination, but that the issue is one that needs . to be tackled by society as a whole. 'There . needs to be a feeling that there is a comfortable environment for . everybody,' he said. 'We're aware through our sporting chance clinic . that players who deal with such issues at the moment feel they would be . targeted and the attention would no longer be on them as a footballer. 'That's a real challenge. But the . game has to be up to that. If we're going to claim to be the major sport . in the world, both in terms of spectators and participation, then we've . got to use that to create a better example.'

"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has today apologised for his controversial comments on racism in football after David Beckham and David Cameron waded into the row. The under-fire head of football's world governing body said he was sorry - but was adamant he would not resign from his role. Speaking to the BBC, the 75-year-old said: 'It hurts and I am still hurting because I couldn't envisage such a reaction.' Eye of the storm: Blatter posted this picture of him hugging South Africa's black football chief Tokyo Sexwale in 2009 which has only fuelled the racism row . 'When you have done something which was not totally correct, I can only say I am sorry for all those people affected by my declarations.' Despite people from the world of politics and football calling for Blatter to step down, he said he had no intention of resigning. 'I cannot resign. Why should I? When you are faced with a problem you . have to face the problem. To leave would be totally unfair and not . compatible with my fighting spirit, my character, my energy.' Criticism: Beckham described Blatter's comments as 'appalling' and said some things 'can't just be sorted out with just a hand shake' His apology comes after former England captain Beckham and the Prime Minister both waded into the row strongly condemning the FIFA president's comments. It follows a picture being posted on the FIFA website of 75-year-old Blatter hugging black South African football chief Tokyo Sexwale as he tried to back-track from his claim there is no racism in football. This morning, LA Galaxy player Beckham echoed the Prime Minister's condemnation yesterday, describing the comments as 'appalling' and said some things 'can't just be sorted out with just a hand shake'. The former England captain insisted the statement had been damaging to the sport. The FIFA president also became embroiled in an amazing Twitter row with Rio Ferdinand, who accused him of being 'ignorant'. Mr Cameron said: 'It's appalling to suggest that racism in any way should be accepted as part of the game. 'A lot of work has gone into ridding racism from all aspects of our society, including football. As many of our top sports stars have rightly pointed out, now is not the time for complacency.' Meanwhile, the airline Emirates told MailOnline they may not renew their £122million FIFA sponsorship deal when it expires in 2014. Emirates . are one of FIFA's six official partners and are concerned their brand . has been damaged by Blatter's remarks and the widespread outrage and . offence he has caused. Blatter dismissed racism as a problem on the football field, arguing . that any such incident should be settled with a handshake at the end of . the game. Tokyo Sexwale appeared to defend Sepp Blatter at a news conference in Johannesburg today . He compounded the situation by . comparing racist abuse to foul play. 'It's foul language, it's foul . play,' he said. An Emirates spokesman said yesterday: 'Emirates continues to closely watch . developments within FIFA ahead of discussions on the extension of our . partnership beyond 2014. However, we have no role in the management of . the organisation.' The . Dubai-based airline had previosuly expressed concern about its relationship with . FIFA in the wake of the cash-for-votes scandal. Boutros Boutros, the . Emirates vice-president, said: 'We are seriously thinking about not . renewing our partnership with FIFA beyond 2014. We don't get into . politics but we believe the situation with FIFA went beyond an internal . problem and became much bigger.' Go now: British Prime Minister David Cameron (left) with Sepp Blatter outside Downing Street earlier this year . Blatter's friend is Mosima Gabriel Sexwale, known as Tokyo Sexwale, after Japan's capital city, because of his love of martial arts. Why does deal with the FIFA president? Sexwale is the Minister of Human Settlements in South Africa and worked with FIFA on projects to highlight the battle against racism and apartheid. Why does he do that? He went into self-imposed exile to the Soviet Union to fight apartheid but was charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government when he returned in 1976. He was sentenced to 18 years on Robben Island, where he met his wife. He was released in 1990 and served under Nelson Mandela as the premier of Gauteng province. Anything else? He owns Mvelaphanda Holdings, the world's third biggest diamond company, and hosted South Africa's version of The Apprentice. At this stage FIFA's five other partners - Adidas, Hyundai, Coca- Cola, . Visa and Sony - have chosen not to condemn Blatter's comments, even . though they were invited to by Sportsmail. They did make their stance against racism clear. But it could be the fear of losing . major sponsors that threatens Blatter's position more than the criticism . he continued to receive yesterday, even though it came from some hugely . influential figures in football. Most staggering was the Twitter . exchange with Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand. His younger brother Anton is at the centre of the John Terry race . inquiry and Ferdinand attacked Blatter on Wednesday night for posting a . picture alongside a statement on the FIFA website of himself with a . black football official and South African politician. In an unprecedented move by Blatter, he . responded directly to Ferdinand. 'The ""black man"" as . you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work . against racism and apartheid in Africa.' Ferdinand tweeted back: 'To say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject.' Having suddenly found himself a pawn in the race storm, Sexwale held a press conference in Johannesburg today, at which he seemed to support Blatter, saying: 'We should distinguish racial remarks from things that are said when players are fighting for a ball.' As Cameron made his comments increasing . the pressure on Blatter from Westminster, Mr Robertson echoed his . sentiments saying: 'Sepp Blatter's comments are completely unacceptable. Action man: Prime Minister David Cameron took time out from meeting Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button at the McLaren factory in Woking to condemn Blatter . Sepp Blatter . rioferdy5 The 'black man' as you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in Africa ... We have done several joint activities to raise awareness on the struggle against racism in South Africa ... FIFA has a long standing and proud record in the area of anti-discrimination which will continue ... Blatter's total followers 191,681 . Rio Ferdinand . SeppBlatter to say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject ... I guess you now have the full support of all the women, gay community + people against racism in football ... If we want 2 stamp out racism in society a football pitch is a good place to start - loved by billions of people around the world ... Rio's total followers 1,643,977 . 'This is the latest episode that calls into question whether this man should be the head of world football. For the sake of the game, he should go.' While the Premier League and the FA reiterated their stance against racism, there was no direct attack on Blatter. But Ferdinand was joined by a number of Premier League managers in criticising Blatter. Tony Pulis, Martin Jol and Mick McCarthy were united in their feelings, with McCarthy calling the FIFA chief 's comments 'outrageous'. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor says Blatter's remarks were 'the straw which broke the camel's back' and that he should step aside for UEFA president Michel Platini. Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said he had been surprised by the comments but stressed both FIFA and UEFA had done much to combat racism in football. Boyce said: 'I was very surprised to hear the president's remarks but have been pleased that both he and FIFA have come out to try and clarify the situation.' The controversy started when Blatter . was asked directly by a CNN reporter if racism exists on the pitch, .

"Terrifying new footage of Felix Baumgartner's space jump has revealed exactly what the jumper went through during the record-setting descent. GoPro, the firm which built the cameras attached to the daredveil, released the new footage. It shows the entire descent from Baumgartner's point of view - including the out of control spin that almost cost him his life. Scroll down for video . The moment Baumgartner span out is captured in unprecedented new detail . People across the world watched in awe - and horror - as daredevil Felix Baumgartner became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the Earth. 'Fearless Felix' reached speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened and he landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history. Baumgartner became the first human to break the speed of sound during the jump, reaching a total speed of 833.9 mph. He also set records for the highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump and the fastest speed achieved by a human through the atmosphere after jumping from 128,100 feet above the Earth for the Red Bull Stratos mission. Felix Baumgartner broke the speed of sound after 34 seconds of free fall, ultimately accelerating to as high as 833.9 mph, or mach 1.24. Mr Baumgartner made his death-defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space, which took him two-and-a-half hours to travel 128,177ft above the New Mexico desert - and less than ten minutes to land.He landed on his feet despite moments during the descent that had silenced his mission control as he appeared to lose control and plunge into a head-over-heels spin. A chest-mounted camera capture's Baumgartner's helmet and the edge of space . The spin where controllers lost touch with the daredevil is also revealed . People who watched footage of the jump last year will remember how the daredevil fell to his knees and punched the air in triumph as the control room, packed with scientific experts and family including his teary-eyed mother, Eva, erupted into roars of applause. Speaking afterwards he said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. 'It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.' During the first part of Mr Baumgartner's free fall, anxious onlookers at the command centre held their breath as he appeared to spin uncontrollably. A helmet mounted camera looking down from the capsule . Five cameras were attached to Baumgartner during his descent . 'When I was spinning the first 10, 20 seconds, I never thought I was going to lose my life but I was disappointed because I'm going to lose my record. I put seven years of my life into this,' he said.Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble . Speaking after the jump Mr Baumgartner said: 'Trust me, when you stand up there on top of the world, you become so humble. It's not about breaking records any more. It's not about getting scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive' Mr Baumgartner said his Stratos jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information, including the first-ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects. He added: 'In that situation, when you spin around, it's like hell and you don't know if you can get out of that spin or not. Of course it was terrifying. I was fighting all the way down because I knew that there must be a moment where I can handle it.'","New footage released by GoPro, which supplied the five cameras attached to the daredevil .

"A law student was targeted by hackers who stole her Facebook account and used it to advertise her services as an escort. Jazmine Jones claims police have refused to take action over the 'e-whoring' scam - and says that the fraudsters have been threatening to steal her identity to set up fake bank accounts. The scammers have also managed to cheat other web users by posing as the 23-year-old student and asking for money because she was in trouble. Nightmare: Jazmine Jones, a law student from Kent, has had her identity stolen by online fraudsters . Miss Jones's fraud nightmare began last October, when she discovered that her email account had been hacked by identity thieves, who used it to access her Facebook page, stealing 300 photographs as well as personal information. The hackers set up additional Facebook accounts using her pictures, and saying that she was an escort. 'When I realised this was happening I went to the police straight away,' she said. 'They told me there was nothing they could do - ""Don't take it seriously, I'm sure it will be fine."" 'I also told Facebook but each time they close an account a new one opens up. In June it got completely crazy. There were 10 fake Facebook accounts of me. 'It's basically identity theft - not only this, but these accounts have been messaging guys on Facebook asking them to borrow money and saying I'm an escort to get money.' Theft: The hackers took 300 photographs from her Facebook account and set up fake pages in her name . Distraught: Miss Jones says police told her that they were powerless to act against the scammers . Miss Jones, from Beckenham in Kent, said that one man, named James, lost £250 after he received a message apparently from her, saying she was stranded in her car and needed money immediately. Recently, the situation turned even more sinister as the anonymous fraudster sent the students photos of her own driving licence, obtained from her hacked emails, and threatened to set up bank accounts in her name. 'It's complete cyber bullying and I'm starting to fear for my safety,' she said. 'I've contacted the police and they've told me that unless it is a terrorism threat there is nothing they can do about it. 'I feel let down and unsupported. It seems they won't do anything unless something really serious happens. I don't know who this person is and it's getting to the point that I feel I could get attacked or something. Danger: The hackers used Facebook to advertise the student's services as an escort . A Facebook spokesman said: 'We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and react quickly to remove reported content that violates our policies. 'The goal of these policies is to strike a very delicate balance between giving people the freedom to express themselves and maintaining a safe and trusted environment. 'We encourage people to report anything they feel violates our policies using the report links located throughout the site or by using the reporting tools in our Help Centre at facebook.com/report.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'If someone has created a fake social media account in your name, you should report this to the social media company provider concerned, who will then be able to take the appropriate steps to have the profile removed'.","Jazmine Jones, 23, had her email account targeted by fraudsters .

"The Fort Bliss soldier who repeatedly stabbed a pregnant military wife while she was on Face-Time with her husband posted overseas was sentenced to 30-years behind bars in El Paso, Texas today. The day after crying in court while he watched himself confess to stabbing nine-month pregnant Rachel Poole in October last year, Corey Bernard Moss, 20, listened in silence as his sentence was read. Moss admitted to breaking into the home of his friend on the evening of October 30, 2013 and then stabbing her in the head, back and neck, while she was talking to her husband, Justin Poole, who was stationed in Qatar at the time of the attack. She survived and so did her baby. Tears and testimony: Corey Bernard Moss broke down in tears (left) as he listened to his confession in the El Paso court room on Tuesday and then took the stand (right) in the hope of lessening his sentence of 30 years. He did not . New mother: Rachel Poole in hospital in the aftermath of her attack by Moss in October that left her blind in one eye and with multiple stab wounds on her torso and back . Injuries suffered: A mass of stitches can be seen on Rachel Poole's arm (left) while a horrific wound (right) just missed her spinal column during Moss' attack . Survivor: Rachel and her husband Justin Poole have come through the ordeal well and their baby girl is now safe and well (right) In court on Tuesday, Moss explained why he attacked a heavily pregnant women with a knife, saying that he didn't want to pay back $3,000 to the Poole's, who considered him a close family friend. Moss said that he had asked the Poole's to borrow a car while Justin was deployed, but when he returned it the car had serious damage, which they asked him repay. 'I gave Rachel the car back in August, and she was upset with the damage, she said I needed to pay for it and gave me an estimate of $3,000,' Moss said prior to his sentencing. He gave the court a sob story and said that he wanted to leave the army, take his own fiancee and daughter to New York, but couldn't if he owed the Poole's money. 'Money was really tight, rent was due, I got paid on that Thursday and I knew I couldn't give it to Rachel Poole, I knew I had other priorities,' he said to the court according to KFOXTV. 'My mindset was that my relationship with my fiancee was more important than getting the truck fixed, I kept bullsh***ng, delaying, and making up excuses to the Pooles as to why I couldn't pay them back.' He said that eventually Rachel Poole contacted his military superiors who ordered him to pay the money. Horror show: Rachel Poole (left), was nine . months pregnant when she was stabbed multiple times by an intruder in . her home as her husband Justin (right), who was deployed overseas, . watched in horror on video chat . Ambush: El Paso police say Moss went to the Pooles' home in the 9400 block of Wichita Circle, broken in and waited for Rachel to come home . It was then that he borrowed a knife from a fellow soldier and claims he went to the Poole's to 'frighten' pregnant Rachel. 'I waited, she opened the door, next thing you know I just started stabbing her. She turned around and yelled at me, she knocked my shades off. I had her on the ground, I tried to put my hand over her mouth, I was stabbing her,' said Moss. 'I wasn't saying a word at all, she was screaming at me to please stop and please don't kill her, but then she stopped screaming and I thought to myself, 'Please don't tell me she's dead.' Moss, who will also be dishonorably discharged from the military, said he didn't know how many times he stabbed Rachel. 'I don't remember, I think it was a lot of times, too many times,' he said. 'I didn't intend to kill her, I wasn't trying to get rid of her, it wanted to delay until my papers were done. I didn't want to pay back that $3,000.' Moss then revealed his twisted mindset and told the court how he ran away from the house and texted his friend, who he had just stabbed, 'Are you off work yet, Mrs. Poole?' - to make it look like he was never there. Happier times: A photo of Rachel and Justin Poole before the attack that will change their lives forever . However, Moss did not know that Justin Poole had seen and heard his friend attack his wife and phoned him and said, 'What the hell have you done?' When he returned home in Fort Bliss, a mutual friend of his and the Poole's restrained him upon sight. 'I ran away, but Perkins is really fast and he tackled me to the ground,' Moss said. 'That's when I realized I'm going to jail for a long time.' Moss told an incredulous court room that he didn't know Rachel was pregnant. 'The injuries I caused to her with my hands, I still can't believe I did that. I harmed somebody who called me a friend, who treated me like family, and I repaid them by destroying their family,' said Moss to the court according to KFOX TV. At his sentencing on Wednesday, prosecutor William Prasher said that Moss was a danger to society. 'The defense says there’s two victims in this case? There’s three. One stab lower than the chest and Rachel’s sweet little girl isn’t alive. Suspect: Cory Bernard Moss, 19, allegedly admitted to the knife attack, which was reportedly sparked by a money dispute . 'He didn’t want to pay Rachel $3,000. That’s the defense’s excuse for attempting double murder? Are you kidding me?' Just days after the attack Rachel gave birth to a daughter named Isabella at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas by caesarean section. Rachel was blinded in one eye after being stabbed in the head. The-then 31-year-old mother-to-be was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition and treated for stab wounds to her face and body and multiple fractures. The attack happened when Poole came home and began talking to her husband, stationed in Qatar. A short time later, police say Moss came out of hiding and surprised Rachel Poole from behind, repeatedly stabbing her with a foldout stainless steel knife and beating her. According to the affidavit, the victim instantly recognized Moss as her husband's debtor and yelled out his name several times so Justin Poole could hear it over the phone.","Corey Bernard Moss has also been dihonorably discharged .

"The Ivy League-educated former head of New York Mets ticket sales sued the club Wednesday, saying she was fired last month after insults and humiliation were hurled at her by the club owner's son, a top team executive who she claimed was upset that she had a child without being married. Leigh Castergine's Brooklyn federal court lawsuit named Sterling Mets Front Office LLC and Jeffrey Wilpon, the club's chief operating officer, as defendants. It sought unspecified damages and asked that the Mets be stopped from future discrimination. It said the club recognized and rewarded Castergine after she was hired in December 2010 as the first female vice president in the teams history  until she learned she was pregnant in August 2013. According to the lawsuit, Wilpon 'became fixated on the idea that Castergine would have a child without being married.' Lawsuit: Leigh Castergine is suing her former employers at the New York Mets for allegedly firing her because she was pregnant and single . He frequently humiliated Castergine in front of others by, among other things, pretending to see if she had an engagement ring on her finger and openly stating in a meeting of the team's all-male senior executives that he is `morally opposed' to Castergine `having this baby without being married,'' the lawsuit said. It added that no one, including the team's general counsel, challenged Wilpon's statement. The lawsuit said Wilpon also told Castergine, a University of Pennsylvania graduate, that she would make more money and get a bigger bonus once she was married. Then, it said, he told her 'something had changed' after the birth of her child and that she was no longer as 'aggressive' as she used to be. According to the New York Post, Jeff Wilpon even warned Castergine’s co-workers not to take any interest in her unborn child, who was born in March. She was let go in August. 'Do not rub her belly,' the suit says he commanded. 'Don’t ask how she’s doing. She’s not sick, she’s pregnant.' After she complained to the team's human resources department, she was fired on August 26, the lawsuit said. Accused: Jeffrey Wilpon, the club's chief operating officer was allegedly morally disgusted by Castergine's pregnancy . In a statement, the Mets said: 'We have received and reviewed the complaint. The claims are without merit. 'Our organization maintains strong policies against any and all forms of discrimination.' In the lawsuit, Castergine's lawyers described how the one-time $6-an-hour ticket agent for the Philadelphia 76ers gained experience in more senior jobs with the Philadelphia Flyers, Orlando Magic and the Boston Bruins before joining the Mets organization. The court papers said she introduced major pricing changes, new benefits and a flexible exchange policy for season ticket holders, earning two $50,000 raises, annual six-figure bonuses and a promotion to senior vice president. One industry publication even described her as 'the next female president in the sports industry,' the lawsuit said. But the goodwill soured with the announcement of her pregnancy, the lawsuit said. Her lawyers wrote that she became uneasy even before the announcement, when she attended a meeting of team executives in which one executive described how a female employee in the club's public relations department 'hasn't been the same since she had children' and might need to be moved to a different department. Days later, she revealed her pregnancy and discrimination became apparent soon afterward, the lawsuit said.","Leigh Castergine is suing the New York Mets after her firing last month .

"A card-playing pair of German doctors have attacked a ban for cheating with cough signals - saying one of them simply had asthma. World champions Michael Elinescu and Entscho Wladow were condemned by the World Bridge Federation last month for a scam which closely resembled the 'coughing code' of infamous Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? winner Major Charles Ingram. But gynaecologist Dr Wladow attacked the ban - which has rocked the sedate world of bridge - and insisted: 'I have asthma, so of course I cough a lot'. Burning their bridges: Entscho Wladow, 71 (left) and Michael Elinescu, 61 (right) were found guilty of cheating at the normally sedate card game, but Dr Wladow said he has asthma and vowed to challenge the decision . Dr Wladow was speaking to German newspaper Der Spiegel after the pair were banned from playing as a team for life and as individuals for 10 years by the Disciplinary Commission of the World Bridge Federation. He said the ban was 'an impudence', adding: 'In 10 years I could already be as dead as a mouse.' He and GP Dr Elinescu, 61 - both of whom vehemently denied the claims from the start - are planning to challenge the ban, the newspaper reported. The pair, known as the German Doctors, triumphed for Germany last September at the world bridge championships in Bali, Indonesia. But suspicions were raised about their . frequent coughing during matches by American player Eddie Wold, who made . a complaint to the World Bridge Federation. Hidden cameras were installed which led to a two-day disciplinary hearing last month in Dallas, Texas. High drama: The men playing against their American competitors in the World Bridge Championships final . The doctors did not appear at the hearing, but sent a number of letters challenging its legitimacy. The eyes of the bridge world were on the hearing as the panel heard evidence from opponents, CCTV footage and experts that the pair had coughed whenever they were weak in a certain suit. 'The evidence showed that there was a clear pattern in the way that Elinescu and Wladow communicated information to each other,' the panel's report said. 'On each and every occasion when one of them held a shortage in a suit, this was communicated by coughing. This coughing took place when it was that player's turn to bid. 'The number of coughs indicated in which suit there was a shortage. If there was no shortage there was no coughing.' Partners in top-level bridge games, where pairs must work in isolation but also as a team, have footboards between them under their tables and are not allowed to look at each other, said Robb Gordon from the American Contract Bridge League. Million pound fraud: Major Charles Ingram and his wife Diana cheated at a game on national television . And as Law 73B of . the game states: 'The gravest possible offence is for a . partnership to exchange information through prearranged methods of . communication.' The pair were stripped of their title and the world champions were named as the American runners-up instead. They were also made to pay the costs of the hearing against them. The case has striking similarities to that of 'Coughing Major' Charles Ingram who, in 2003, was found guilty of cheating in the TV game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? He, his wife Diana and accomplice Tecwen Whittock were convicted of fraud after the pair communicated answers to him from the audience by coughing on national television.","Michael Elinescu, 61, and Entscho Wladow, 71, were banned for 10 years .

"Micky Adams has stepped down as manager of Port Vale. Adams' second stint in charge at Vale Park ends after just under three-and-a-half years at the helm, following a miserable run of six straight defeats in all competitions. The 52-year-old has made the decision to leave after discussions with club chairman Norman Smurthwaite on Thursday. Micky Adams has resigned as Port Vale manager after losing 3-0 to Bristol City on Tuesday . He said via a statement on the club's official website: 'It is with great sadness that I have decided to leave Port Vale but I believe I am leaving the club in a stronger position than when I joined. 'I have spent five years in Burslem, punctuated by a spell at Sheffield United, and although the role of a football manager brings with it a rollercoaster of emotions, I will never forget my time at Vale and the many happy memories I will take away with me. 'This has not been an easy decision to make, which has been made even more difficult by the strong relationships I have forged during my time at the club. 'I would like to thank my immediate team, all of the staff at Vale Park and the many players I have worked with throughout my two spells. I have met some truly fantastic people. Adams rejoined Vale in 2011, after managing the club previously between 2009 and 2010 . 'In addition, I would like to thank all of the Port Vale fans for their fantastic support. I hope that the club has only bright times ahead. 'I believe now is the time for another manager to take the helm and I would like to thank Norman Smurthwaite and his wife Lorraine for their fantastic support. I wish the club every success for this season and the future.' Adams first became Vale manager in the summer of 2009 but in December the following year the opportunity to take charge at his boyhood club Sheffield United was too good to turn down and he left Vale Park for Bramall Lane, with the Valiants second in the League Two table. Port Vale's Chris Lines looks on dejectedly as Vale lose 3-0 to Bristol - Adams' final game in charge . His stay in South Yorkshire was shortlived and Adams was sacked at the end of the 2010/11 season following the Blades' relegation from the Championship. He immediately returned to Vale and got the club promoted in 2013. The Valiants finished a respectable ninth during their first campaign back in League One but their start to this season has brought only one league win. After a 2-1 loss to neighbours Crewe last weekend, Adams said he knew 'the consequences of losing too many games.' A 3-0 home defeat to Bristol City followed on Tuesday night, prompting Adams to consider his future and ultimately call time on his stay at Vale Park.","Micky Adams leaves Port Vale  after three-and-a-half years in charge .

"Fossilised faeces suggests an ancient baby shark might have been killed by its dinner. U.S. palaeontologists analysing a 70 million-year-old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died. The researchers think the shark, living close to the South Carolina coastline, bit off more than it could digest and probably died as a result. U.S. palaeontologists analysing a 70 million-year-old fossilised poo from an extinct newborn shark found it ate a baby turtle shortly before it died . David Schwimmer, a palaeontologist at Columbus State University in Georgia, told LiveScience: ‘It's a case where a newborn shark ate a newborn turtle and died.' The fossilised poo, which is also known as a coprolite, measures almost four centimetres long and was discovered in a fossil bed close to the South Carolina coastline. Between 70 million and 80 million years ago, the area was where the baby shark was born - in a tidal estuary where the sea met inland rivers. Inside the coprolite (pictured) are some minute turtle vertebrae measuring just 3mm long . Professor Schwimmer believes the size of the coprolite indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn. Inside the coprolite, which was described by the professor at the 73rd annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, are some minute turtle vertebrae. Each bone measures around three millimetres long, indicating the turtle must have been a newborn too. He believes the turtle that was eaten was a soft-shell species living in freshwater, while the small shark lived in the sea, indicating the fish had just come out of a pupping ground in the estuary, where the baby sharks hatched. Showing its predatory nature, the shark must have emerged from the pupping ground and almost immediately ate the newborn turtle, which probably only measured 10 centimetres in diameter, according to Professor Schwimmer. He believes the shark was probably not much larger than its dinner as the vertebrae in the fish’s faeces indicate. He also believes the shark died shortly after forcing down the meal. Professor Schwimmer believes the size of the coprolite, which measures almost 4cm long, indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn . Professor Schwimmer said: ‘It's possible the turtle was too much shell. [The shark] may have died from too much turtle. While Professor Schwimmer is not sure about the exact species of the shark and turtle, he thinks the shark could be the extinct Squalicorax kaupi. Scientists studying other shark coprolites have previously found some fish had tapeworms 270 million years ago.","A paleontologist at Columbus State University believes the size of the fossil indicates the shark ejected it when it was practically a newborn .

"The court heard that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has been paying her ex-husband Bernie, left, £90 million a year since their divorce in 2009 . Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone is being paid £60 million a year by his ex-wife Slavica as part of their 2009 divorce, court documents have shown. Details of the divorce emerged during Mr Ecclestone's trial in Munich where he is accused of  paying a German banker a £27.5 million bribe. German prosecutors claim that Mr Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky who was in charge of selling shares in F1 on behalf of Bayern LB bank. The payment, prosecutors allege was to guarantee that the 47 percent share in the F1 business was sold to Mr Ecclestone's preferred bidder CVC Capital partners for £685 million. The details were included in a 256-page indictment which show that Mr Ecclestone has received £300 million from his ex-wife since the split. The indictment, reported by the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Since his divorce from his wife, the accused has received payments on the basis of the British decree nisi. 'The payments amount to around $100 million a year. The duration of the payments from the divorce decree is not known.' Prosecutors claim that the payments come from an off-shore trust established by Mr Ecclestone in 1997 in the name of his then-wife Slavica and their two daughters Tamara and Petra. Mr Ecclestone set up the Liechtenstein based trust fund after he suffered a heart scare to protect his wife, who was not living in the UK for long enough for tax purposes, from paying inheritance and capital gains tax in the event of his death. The 83-year-old billionaire, second from right, appeared in court in Munich on Thursday where he is facing charges of bribing a German banker with £27.5 million over the sale of shares in Formula One . Mr Ecclestone, pictured, denies the charges and insists that banker Gerhard Gribkowsky was blackmailing him . Mr Ecclestone's lawyers claim that banker Gerhard Gribkowsky threatened to inform UK tax authorities about the Bambino trust using false information. It is believed that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has paid £300 million to her ex-husband Bernie, right, since their 2009 divorce . The Forumla One boss admits that he paid Gribkowsky £27.5 million, not as a bribe but because he was being blackmailed by the banker. Mr Ecclestone's lawyers read a four-hour long statement at the start of his trial on Thursday, which is expected to last until September. The trial is only sitting for one or two days a week in order for Mr Ecclestone to continue with his Formula One duties. In the statement, Mr Ecclestone rejected any suggestions that he had bribed the banker and said he was 'grateful' to be able to tell his own side of the story. If convicted of bribery and incitement to breach of trust charges, the billionaire faces up to 10 years in prison. Gribkowsky is currently serving an eight-year jail term for taking the cash. Prosecutors claim that Gribkowsky was in charge of selling a 47 percent share in Formula One held by Munich bank Bayern LB. They allege that Mr Ecclestone paid Gribkowsky the cash so the bank would sell their share of the Formula One business to the billionaire's preferred bidder, CVC Capital Partners for £685 million. The court heard that Mr Ecclestone, second left established the Bambino trust in 1997 for the benefit of his then-wife Slavica, second right and daughters Petra, left and Tamara, right . Mr Ecclestone's lawyers, pictured, read a prepared four-hour long statement by the billionaire denying the bribery allegations . The court case will only run one or two days a week so Mr Ecclestone can continue his work with Formula One . During his personal statement to the court, Mr Ecclestone said the trust fund was owned and controlled by his ex-wife and two daughters. He said that he did not own the trust fund and if Gribkowsky had approached UK tax authorities he could have faced a tax bill which he would not have been able to pay. He said: 'From today's point of view, it was not a rational decision. I saw my life's work in danger.' Mr Ecclestone revealed that he has not owned any part of the Formula One series since 1997 although he still runs the day-to-day business. He insisted that he had been 'blackmailed' by Gribkowsky claiming 'the alleged bribe has not occurred'. Mr Ecclestone said it was cheaper to pay Gribkowsky than fight his untrue allegation.","Divorce payment details emerge during Ecclestone's German bribery trial .

Archeologists say the battle outfit may have been a war trophy, as it was not buried in a grave with the 'elite' warrior for whom it was created. Scroll down for video . Perfect condition: The Bronze Age warlord's protective garb was made entirely of bone, and was found in 'perfect condition' after being secreted for between 3,500 and 3,900 years . Protective: The armour would have 'given good protection from weapons that were used at the time - bone and stone arrowheads, bronze knives, spears tipped with bronze, and bronze axes', experts said . It is believed to have been made from the bones of elk, deer and horse - though checks are still being conducted. 'The armour could have been a gift, or an exchange, or was perhaps the spoils of war,' reported The Siberian Times. Boris Konikov, curator of excavations, said: 'Such armour was highly valued. It was more precious than life itself, because it saved life.' The armour is being cleaned and restored to its original form after being found at a site near the Irtysh River in Omsk. 'We hope to reconstruct an exact copy,' he said. Combination of bones: It is believed to have been made from the bones of elk, deer and horse - though checks are still being conducted .

Scientist Yury Gerasimov, a research fellow of the Omsk branch of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, said: 'While there is no indication that the place of discovery of the armour was a place of worship, it is very likely. 'Armour had great material value. There was no sense to dig it in the ground or hide it for a long time - because the fixings and the bones would be ruined. 'Such armour needs constant care. 'So at the moment we can only fantasise as to who dug it into the ground and for what purpose. Was it some ritual or sacrifice? We do not know yet.' Despite this, he is certain that the armour belonged to a 'hero', an 'elite warrior who knew special methods of battle'.

"Young Lithuanian civilians are swapping their suits and ties for camouflage and joining a paramilitary group amid concerns that Ukraine is 'only the beginning' for Russia. Lithuania is among the Baltic states calling on NATO to intervene and ward off any potential threat from Russian forces. But as they wait, a force of students, businessmen, civil servants, . journalists and politicians are among hundreds who have joined . the Lithuania Riflemen's Union. Young Lithuanian civilians are swapping their suits and ties for camouflage and joining a paramilitary group amid concerns that Ukraine is 'only the beginning' for Russia . Russia's takeover of Crimea and increasing signs of its involvement in Ukraine's east are sparking a sharp rise in paramilitary recruits  who have joined the government-sponsored Lithuania Riflemen's Union, a group first set up in 1919 but banned in 1940 under Soviet rule. Students, businessmen, civil servants, journalists and politicians are among hundreds who have joined the Lithuania Riflemen's Union . The group - which was first set . up in 1919 but banned in 1940 under Soviet rule - now has around 7,000 members, three times the number since the beginning of the crises in Ukraine, and almost the same the amount of its military personnel. It comes after a respected Moscow political scientist and editor claimed Vladimir Putin is plotting to rebuild much of the old Soviet Union after being stung by a Barack Obama jibe that he rules a mere 'regional power' A member of Lithuania Riflemen's Union takes an oath on the Juozapine Hill, Vilnius, Lithuania. The group - which was first set up in 1919 but banned in 1940 under Soviet rule - now has around 7,000 members, three times the number since the beginning of the crises in Ukraine . It comes after a respected Moscow political scientist and editor claimed Vladimir Putin is plotting to rebuild much of the old Soviet Union after being stung by a Barack Obama jibe that he rules a mere 'regional power' The analysis from Yevgenia Albats came as the West assessed whether the Kremlin leader's seven point peace plan for Ukraine was serious, or a stunt to confuse NATO leaders at their Welsh summit today. She claimed recent comments from Putin suggest he has his eyes on grabbing back Kazakhstan and could also swallow up Belarus, Moldova, and even the staunchly Western Baltic states like Estonia, where Obama visited to deliver a message of support for eastern Europe. Putin said several days ago that the world's ninth largest country Kazakhstan, part of the old tsarist and Soviet empires,  was a recent appearance on the map, adding: 'I am confident that a majority of its population supports development of close ties with Russia.' Recent comments from Putin suggest he has his eyes on grabbing back Kazakhstan and could also swallow up Belarus, Moldova, and even the staunchly Western Baltic states like Estonia . The ailing 74-year-old Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev - who single-handedly created the state - was 'prudent' and would 'never act against the will of his country's people' by leaning too far to the West, he said. Albats said the comment was revealing about the intentions of Putin,  who makes all his decisions in 'close contact' with the former KGB. 'Ukraine is only a beginning, and those 'slips' about Kazakhstan are not at all coincidental,' she predicted, adding:  'We will see how it all unfolds in Belarus, Moldova, perhaps the Baltic states, to Kazakhstan, and so on.' She claimed that Russia's population is falling but if Putin rebuilt the old Soviet empire he would have larger numbers. 'We can only oppose the USA if we are big. The USSR could have done it, even though half of the country was starving,' she said.","Students, businessmen, civil servants, .
