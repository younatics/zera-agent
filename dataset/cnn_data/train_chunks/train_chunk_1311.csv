"She's busy forging a career as an art dealer in New York but that doesn't mean Princess Eugenie is immune to the lure of a little time off - even if some work is involved. The royal, 24, was spotted enjoying the sunshine in Miami, where she joined friends at Art Basel Miami Beach - an offshoot of the prestigious Swiss art fair. Dressed in a relaxed black jersey dress, a pair of mirrored aviator shades and a battered pair of Converse, Eugenie looked every inch the art enthusiast as she admired the wares on show. Scroll down for video . Arty day out: Princess Eugenie was in Miami for the Miami Beach edition of Art Basel . The princess, who studied Art History, English Literature and Politics at university, moved to New York last September for a three month internship which later turned into a £25,000-a-year job with online auction house, Paddle8. Since moving to the US, she has become a stalwart of the Big Apple social scene and was at the charity auction thrown by the Duchess of Cornwall's brother Mark Shand on the evening of his fateful fall. In the autumn, she was spotted enjoying a day out at the US Open tennis final, where she sipped champagne with entrepreneur Phil Winser, 29. Despite missing the biggest social event of the New York year - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's three-day tour - Eugenie appeared to be enjoying herself and looked relaxed and happy as she strolled through Miami's hip Wynwood area. Looking good: Eugenie looked every inch the art enthusiast in her black dress and comfy Converse . Amusing: Not even a crowd of bizarrely dressed anti-art protesters could dampen her enthusiasm . Career: Eugenie moved to the US last year to take a job at online auction house, Paddle8 . Not even a group of anti-art protesters dressed in an array of bizarre costumes could spoil her day, with the princess left chuckling in their wake. Art Basel was founded in 1970 and stages annual shows in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Miami Beach, all of which focus on modern art. Included in the displays at the Miami event are paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, prints, photography, film, video, and digital art by over 4,000 artists. 200 museums and galleries from Europe, the US and Latin America submit work to the annual event, among them pieces by up-and-coming artists as well as paintings by more established names.","Princess Eugenie, 24, was in Miami for Art Basel Miami Beach .

"A retired couple missed out on a trip to France for the Christmas markets after a coach company printed the wrong time of departure on their tickets. Derek and Moira Pearce, who are both retired schoolteachers from Gloucestershire, booked a four night bus trip to Lille, Amiens and Arras on a Shearings coach. However, after arriving at Royal Well Bus Station in Cheltenham in the rain for an 8.20am departure in plenty of time, they were left in the cold when the bus failed to turn up. Moira Pearce, 80, and her husband Derek, 86, missed their coach trip to the French Christmas . They were then told that their bus had arrived at the station - at 6am, and the times printed on their tickets were done in error. After contacting Shearings to explain of their predicament, they were told they would have to claim the money back on their insurance, plus any associated excess costs. Speaking to the Gloucestershire Echo, 80-year-old Mrs Pearce said: 'We had been ringing them to try and get our money back, but nothing has transpired yesterday. They have told us we should just claim on the insurance. 'The way they have handled it made me angry. 'We even asked if we could get a taxi and catch up the coach, but were told that if we wanted to do that we would have to pay for it ourselves.' The tickets printed said the coach would depart at 8.20am, but it left Royal Well Bus Station at 6am . The couple, who live in the village of Alstone were planning on buying Christmas presents for their grandchildren on their trip. A Thomas Cook spokesperson told MailOnline Travel:  'We are sorry to hear Mr & Mrs Pearce missed their coach trip to the French Christmas markets on December 7 as booked at the Co-operative Travel store in Tewkesbury. 'In this instance, Thomas Cook acted as a vendor on behalf of Shearings, with whom the booking was made. We have liaised with our colleagues at the coach operator with regards to this incident, and it is our understanding that Shearings are now in discussion with Mr & Mrs Pearce with a view to addressing their concerns in full.' A spokesperson for Shearings Holidays has since told MailOnline Travel: 'We're very sorry for the upset caused to Mrs Pearce. The timing issues were a result of a misprinted ticket, which we apologise for unreservedly. 'We have provided Mrs Pearce with a full refund and have offered a complimentary five day break as a gesture of goodwill.'","Derek and Moira Pearce from Alstone in Gloucestershire miss French trip .

"Olympic ace Victoria Pendleton delighted the Tory conference today by urging youngsters to take up sport to help them get a job later on in life. The cyclist said playing sport helped build vital characteristics which bosses wanted. She said: 'It builds character, confidence and resilience - things that don't necessarily show up in test results but that employers are always looking for.' The remarks echo Lord Tebbit's famous suggestion that the unemployed should get on their bike to find work. Ms Pendleton, who won gold in the velodrome at the Beijing and London Olympic Games, was at the Tory conference today to introduce Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. The cycling star told activists that every child should have access to PE at school. She said: 'It can bridge the gap between socio-economic status, race, gender, ethnicity and disability. 'Whatever you want to do, wherever you are, whoever you are, you can always get involved and that's all you need to do to reap the extensive benefits - the physical, mental, social, intellectual benefits.' She went on: 'In most instances, you just need someone with a little enthusiasm to give you a bit of direction and a little bit of encouragement. 'You don't have to be gifted and you don't have to want to do it professionally - you just have to enjoy taking part as the lessons you learn in childhood are vital and will stay with you for the rest of your life. 'Sport teaches kids things you can't measure - determination, discipline, persistence, team work, integrity, honesty.' 'It builds character, confidence and resilience - things that don't necessarily show up in test results but that employers are always looking for.' She said research showed more than 90 per cent of children behaved better and more than 95 per cent were fitter and healthier after more sport was added to the curriculum. The cycling star said sport adds 'firm foundations' for a healthy future. Pendleton's appearance on the Tory party platform was a long way from collecting gold on the podium at the London 2012 Olympic Games . Ms Pendleton said: 'Sport can often provide opportunity for children who feel their circumstances limit their options in life, increasing their confidence and the aspirations. 'Of course not every child can score in the premiership or clinch Olympic Gold but you can't underestimate the life lessons sport can offer - sometimes you win, sometimes you lose in sport as in life. 'But it's how deal with the success and the failure that builds character and that's what sport and physical activity can provide in abundance.' Norman Tebbit, who was Employment Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, said his father 'got on his bike' to find work . Norman Tebbit has long been associated with the phrase 'Get on your bike and find a job'. But the man nicknamed the 'Chingford Skinhead' never actually said anything of the sort. The actual quote came in response to a question about urban riots which plagued places like Handsworth in Birmingham and Brixton in south London in 1981. A young Conservative had asked whether rioting was a 'natural reaction to unemployment'. The then Employment Secretary told the Tory Party conference: 'I grew up in the thirties with an unemployed father. He didn't riot. He got on his bike and looked for work, and he kept looking 'til he found it.'","Cyclist said sport helped build vital characteristics which bosses wanted .

"Dubai has become the latest city to be mapped by Google’s Street View facility. It is the first time that the feature has become available in an Arab country, and it is hoped that it will boost tourism to the city. Available from today, the tool gives users a 360-degree, panoramic and street-level view of the city's main streets and attractions. Dubai has become the latest city, and the first in an Arab country to be mapped by Google's Street View tool . Two years ago Google launched a Street View applications for Dubai's Burj Khalifa - the world’s tallest building. The same was created for the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, while the desert of Liwa has also been mapped. It was captured using a camera device strapped on top of a camel. However, this is the first time that Street View has become available for the city’s  streets. The city is located in a region where local population are protective of their conservative culture. Like in other countries across the world, Street View in Dubai blurs out people’s faces and vehicle licence plates. The tool gives users a 360-degree, panoramic and street-level view of the city's main streets and attractions . While it covers tourist locations, it is not available in private residential areas. Dubai had been in talks with Google for about a year before launching the service. The company now hopes to roll out Street View in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the United Arab Emirates very soon, said Najeeb Jarrar, product marketing manager at Google in the Middle East and North Africa. ‘We decided to start with a city that is receiving large numbers of visitors so this can help them,’ he said.

The company now hopes to roll out Street View in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the Emirates in the coming years . ‘At the same time, it is a city where residents are extremely internet savvy and this service would benefit them as well. ‘There are also residents in Dubai who use the maps on a daily basis in their movement. Moreover, the regional office of Google is based in Dubai.’ UAE is among the top countries in the region for internet usage, with over six million of the 9.2 million population using the internet.

"It's November, and I'm sitting on a seaside terrace, enjoying an alfresco lunch of succulent fresh fish, fries and a fruity glass of white wine - and I'm not even wearing a coat. But since the restaurant - La Plancha in Bidart - is just a few miles south of Biarritz, one of the world's most glamorous resorts, I am wearing my Ray-Bans, bling-fest earrings and a generous slick of Chanel lipstick. To be honest, compared with the chic and slim French women gliding in and out of La Plancha, each with a cute dog under one arm, I still look très scruffy. But it's the thought that counts. Think of Biarritz, on the Bay of Biscay in south-west France, and the memory retrieves images of handsome European blue-bloods and Hollywood royalty sipping cocktails and cavorting by a pool. High and handsome: The Hotel du Palais adds an extra dash of charm to Biarritz's dazzling shoreline . Still at the heart of all this glitz and glamour is the Hotel du Palais Imperial Resort & Spa, standing in splendid isolation by La Grande Plage. Originally built as a holiday palace by Napoleon III, grandson of Bonaparte, for his empress, Eugenie du Montijo, it's been a hotel since 1893. Frank Sinatra, Ernest Hemingway, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Coco Chanel are just some of the famous people who have stayed there in the past. Staff at Hotel du Palais are far too discreet to disclose recent guests. During my visit, private jet-loads of well-off Russians were roaming around as Biarritz played host to a glitzy ball. A weekend of indulgence here should start in the massive Imperial Spa, which has a fabulous indoor pool. In 1858, French perfume house Guerlain was chosen by Empress Eugenie to create an eau de toilette, and for €120 (about £95), you can experience it during a 50-minute Guerlain Imperial Massage. Starry: Coco Chanel stayed at the Hotel du Palais . And if your hair looks past its best after a spot of surfing in the ocean, the Imperial Beauty Deep Embellishment treatment, which costs between €120 and €180 (£95 to £140), at the on-site Leonor Greyl Hair Care Institute should sort it. After all, you must look your best for dinner in the Michelin-starred Villa Eugenie restaurant. In fact, with its grand chandeliered Imperial Bar, 150 elegant rooms and suites, and classy service, the Hotel du Palais makes you want to dress up. Fascinatingly, you can learn how the authentic furniture and furnishings are kept looking tip-top on a visit to the hotel's workshops. Renovating just one of the rooms costs between €90,000 and €350,000 (£70,800 to £275,000), we learn. There are plenty of tempting boutiques in Biarritz, should your own wardrobe need an overhaul - or why not pop over to Spain? The border is just 30 minutes away by car. While you are there, you could learn about Basque culture at the San Telmo Museum, housed in a 16th Century convent in the middle of picturesque San Sebastian. Back in Biarritz, we stopped for hot chocolate at Miremont - the grand cafe dates from 1872 and was a favourite of King Edward VII, who also stayed at the Hotel du Palais. Energy levels topped up, we went for a long walk along the seafront, past the splendid Art Deco casino. Many of those we passed were wearing bling. And that was just the dogs...

"A woman who discovered her mother after she was sexually assaulted and fatally beaten will tonight watch the murderer be put to death in Missouri. Debbie Decker, 57, said before Paul Goodwin, 48, is given a lethal injection just after midnight in Bonne Terre, she plans to shout: 'I hope you rot in hell!' 'It will be 16 years, nine months, 10 days,' Decker told the Salt Lake Post Dispatch. 'I've been sitting back waiting for this to happen. I'm hoping all these bad memories will go away.' Goodwin has admitted to sexually assaulting Decker's mother, Joan Crotts, a 63-year-old widow, before beating her repeatedly with a hammer on March 1, 1998. Facing death: Paul Goodwin, 48, (pictured left in 2001 and right this year) will be put to death at 12.01am on Tuesday for sexually assaulting and beating an elderly widow to death in 1998 . He had previously lived in a boarding house next door to Crotts and blamed her for getting him evicted months before and returned to her home for revenge, prosecutors said. The night before the attack, Goodwin, who stands at 6ft 7 tall, drunkenly broke into the home and hid in the basement until the following morning, when he pounced on the 4ft 9 widow. He sexually assaulted her, then threw her down the basement stairs and hit her in the head with a hammer three times. Before leaving, Goodwin left a scrap of paper on the kitchen table reading: 'You are next.' Decker believes that message was for her. Victim: He attacked his former neighbor Joan Crotts for getting him kicked out of a boarding house . She discovered her mother, who was covered in blood but still alive. She had a broken hip, eight fractured ribs and massive head trauma and passed away while undergoing brain surgery that night. Police tracked down their suspect after finding a hearing aid belonging to Goodwin in the woman's backyard, and finding his fingerprints inside the house. Decker confessed but at his trial, his attorney used an insanity defense and said that the defendant had mental disabilities and a low intelligence level. A prosecution psychiatrist said Goodwin knew what he was doing and he was sentenced to death. Ahead of his death tonight, his attorneys are still trying to appeal the decision. Decker and other family members will travel to the prison today and watch the killer die. She said that she has lived in fear ever since the murder and needs to know he can no longer get her. 'I've had a fear since he's been locked up, as big as he is he could break out if he wanted to,' she said. 'There's always a way to break out of prison. I never trusted the fact that he couldn't. I need to make sure in my own mind that that man is dead.' Scene: He broke into her home in St Louis, pictured, and hid in the basement until the following morning, when he attacked her. He left a note behind reading 'You are next' - which Crotts' daughter believes was for her . Death chamber: He will be the 10th person to be put to death in Missouri this year - a record for the state . Her brother, Bob Decker, 61, will also be there . 'I just want to see the finality, that's all,' Bob Decker told the Post Dispatch. 'There's nothing he could say that would bring my mother back or to make us feel better. There is nothing he could say to his family and all the pain he brought them.' Goodwin's sister, Mary Goodwin Mifflin, previously said in an affidavit seeking clemency that her brother is so mentally disabled that he doesn't realize what is happening to him. 'It is just too much for him to comprehend,' Mifflin wrote. His death will be the 10th in Missouri this year - a record for the state. Only Texas, with 10, has performed more executions this year.","Paul Goodwin, 48, will be given the lethal injection for sexually assaulting and beating 63-year-old widow Joan Crotts with a hammer in 1998 .

"It’s a country as revered for its fine whisky as it is for its breath-taking landscape. But when it came to creating a scent that managed to evoke the splendour of Scotland, creators perhaps wisely chose the latter. Heathrow Airport has developed a new fragrance based on the heather that lines the Scottish Highlands, and which they are now pumping out in Terminal 2. The Heathrow  'Scent Globe' sprays aromas associated with different countries, including Scotland . Bosses hope that the aroma, created by ScentAir, will inspire travellers passing through the airport’s departure lounge to visit the country. The move comes after the launch of Heathrow’s Scent Globe in November – a large dispenser that sprays aromas associated with different countries. Perched in the departure lounge, the orb has already offered curious globetrotters exotic scents designed to evoke images of Thailand, South Africa, Japan, China and Brazil. The selection of destinations were chosen for their popularity with Heathrow passengers. To conjure up the essence of the nations, Heathrow worked with Design in Scent to produce tailor-made fragrances from ingredients associated with the designated country. Bosses hope the aromas will inspire travellers passing through the departure lounge to visit the countries . South Africa's smell captures the adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense and wild grass, while Brazil's scent oozes rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine. Japan is brought to life through cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris, capturing the essence of coastal villages synonymous with the great Pacific Island. For China, developers used ‘mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion', while Thailand used lemongrass, ginger and coconut. Because of the popularity of the experiment, bosses suggested creating a scent that was connected to the UK. Scotland’s scent is called ‘Flower of Scotland’ and will be used at the airport over the course of this week. Heathrow airport has developed a new fragrance based on the heather that lines the Scottish Highlands . A Heathrow spokesman said: ‘With around 13 million passengers a year using Heathrow as their gateway to Britain’s regions, in particular Scotland, it is no surprise that the next scent to be chosen to tantalise passengers over this festive period is ""Flower of Scotland"". ‘With 255 weekly departures to Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland is by far one of the airport’s favourite destinations. ‘The aroma of the heather capped highlands and the crisp loch air will be smelt throughout Terminal 2’s walkways and public areas.' The spokesman added: ‘Heathrow hopes the scent will encourage passengers to explore not only the exotic destinations the airport connects to but the wonderful hidden gems Britain itself has to offer.’ 'Flower of Scotland’ can be enjoyed until the end of the week when it will be replaced with festive fragrances to get passengers Christmas mood that capture the aromas of freshly cut Christmas trees through to more traditional concoctions of wild berries, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla.","Scent smells strongly of heather and is called 'Flower of Scotland'

"'It may surprise some of you to know this is not the first time I've sung on board a ship,' Mr Gordon Sumner - aka rock god Sting - declared to an enraptured audience on the Queen Mary 2. 'One of my first-ever jobs as a professional musician was on SS Oriana. 'In the early 1970s I sang every night, until the ship's purser told me I could no longer sing as I was upsetting some of the lady passengers. So the drummer ended up singing instead. That purser's sorry now, I tell you!' An Englishman in the port: Sting poses next to the Queen Mary 2 ahead of his recent appearance on board . I was one of the privileged passengers to enjoy an hour-long audience with Sting in the liner's Royal Court Theatre. We were docked in the Big Apple - and never had the rock star's 'Englishman in New York' sounded so appropriate. It may indeed also surprise readers to know that an audience with Sting is now par for the course - or par for the cruise - when it comes to on-board entertainment across Cunard's magnificent fleet. That's especially true on QM2, with her stunning 1,150-capacity theatre that rivals the best on Broadway. Although Sting's performance was a one-off to showcase songs from his new Broadway musical, The Last Ship (plus a few classic crowd-pleasers for good measure), the gig was a good example of the calibre of on-board entertainment now offered. You won't find any of those old cruise-line staples - obscure jazz artists, opera singers and tribute acts - on Cunard's fleet today. You're more likely to encounter music legends such as Rod Stewart, Lenny Kravitz, Carly Simon and Midge Ure. Rapper Kid Rock has done a gig on one of the ships. In August this year, to celebrate QM2's tenth anniversary, Grammy Award-winning James Taylor performed twice in the Royal Court during an eight-day Transatlantic crossing. Taylor's association with the ship began five years ago after he discovered the benefits of her sizeable hold. Having been forced to delay a European tour after his band's equipment was waylaid on a container ship, Taylor realised he could enjoy the leisurely pace of travel on QM2 safely accompanied by his instruments. 'It's a fascinating way to vacation,' Taylor said. 'There's something romantic about departing on a boat and seeing the water, and actually experiencing every nautical mile. 'It sort of makes a connection to another time and place.' Of course, Cunard's liners have been attracting stars for many decades: photos showing Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor and Charlie Chaplin - to name but a few - enjoying Cunard cruises are proudly displayed on QM2. The nice thing for today's stars is that the nature of the passengers on Cunard cruises tends to mean they are largely left to their own devices and are not hounded for autographs or 'selfies'. And it's not just A-list stars from the music world who are signing up to perform at sea. QM2 has also been playing host to big names from Hollywood including Tilda Swinton, actor Jason Schwartzman, and directors Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola. Next year, Cunard will celebrate its 175th anniversary - meaning there'll be more stars than ever adorning the fabulous fleet. Cunard (www.cunard.co.uk, 0843 374 0000) offers seven- and eight-night Atlantic crossings on Queen Mary 2 between May and October 2015. Prices from £1,299 for a voyage from Southampton to New York, including return flight and transfers.","Top cruise ship Queen Mary 2 regularly plays host to major celebrities .

"A devoutly Christian couple from Washington claim their newborn twins and one-year-old son were taken from them by the CPS after neighbors called 911 when they heard the homebirth. Erica May Carey and Cleave Rengo had their children removed from their custody for two months in September and they say it is because they gave birth to the twins at home without the assistance of a midwife. The parents also believe that their refusal to travel to hospital with paramedics - who were called to the house after they were alerted by Carey's birthing cries - contributed to the CPS decision. Back together: Cleave Rengo and Erica May Carey were reunited with their children on Friday - but under the supervision of the state and CPS . Despite their children being returned to them on Friday by the Superior Court of Washington, they are still under state protection and the parents have been ordered to seek counseling as a condition of their return. Indeed, civil rights campaigners have enthusiastically taken up the cause of Carey and Rengo, claiming that the removal of their children was unlawful. The state claims that the children were removed for health and domestic reasons and not because of the home birth. In fact, Carey and Rengo admitted that they only knew they were having twins after the first baby was born, having not had one ultrasound through the pregnancy. The state claimed that the parents refusal to use steroid-based medication to treat their one-year-old's eczema was another reason to take custody of their children. Commissioner Thomas Verge told Rengo, 23 and Carey, 29, that the couple's religious beliefs had caused a chaotic home life for their children. He said that if the state believes the children's lives are in danger again they will be removed. 'This is about second chances because you blew the first one,' said Verge to the couple according to the Bellingham Herald. But Verge also pointed out he could see the 'love you both have for your children.' Dad and son: Rengo and his son, Levi, who was also taken into custody by social services in Washington State . When the CPS heard of the verdict they said, 'We accept this ruling and will work with the family to provide them with services aimed at helping keep the children safe in their home.' The court removed one-year-old, Levi and twins Moran Kai and Daniel, both two-months-old from their parents on November 5. Unconventional: Erica May Carey, 29 and Cleave Rengo, 23, are common-law husband and wife . In his verdict to return the children, Verge said that the home-birth, 'has no bearing whatsoever on my decision here.' During the case which was heard in court last week, the state, 'attempted to show an unstable household marked by numerous contacts with law enforcement … within the past two years and refusal to provide medical treatment to the children,' according to the Bellingham Herald. The USA Today has reported that the couple's strict Christian beliefs, which caused them to use holistic treatments for their one-year-old's eczema was at the center of the dispute. It was only after the couple, who are common-law married in Washington because they have never got a marriage license, decided to have their home birth that the CPS became involved. 'I’ve done a lot of research about other women who have done it and they said the spiritual experience was so much more wholesome. It was just us. We wanted to preserve that sanctity and sacredness in our birth,' said Carey as she justified her decision to give birth at home. The CPS began showing up at their home after the 911 call in November and said that after they took custody of the children, one-year-old, Levi developed pneumonia and ear infections. Assistant Attorney General Rob Olson told the Washington court that law enforcement have been in contact with the famiy 21 times since 2013. The calls related to refusal to provide medical care for their children, with concerns they were underweight and domestic issues between the couple such as Bruce Rengo's mental health and bipolar disorder. However, Christina Nelson-King, the attorney for the couple argued that 'Most of the safety risk was primarily speculative,' according to the Bellingham Herald. 'Parents have a Constitutional right to parent as they see fit,' Nelson-King added. However, he criticized them for their attitude towards the CPS which he said was doing its job properly. Birthing: Erica (left) shows off her pregnancy belly while carrying Levi, who plays with his father (right) 'They did exactly what they should do,' he said, adding that they tried everything to help the family and were met by resistance. 'Their lives are dedicated to children. They are not the enemy. They are the heroes.' Washingon Governor, Jay Inslee waded into the controversial case last week to recognize the support the Rengo family has received. 'Over the past several days, hundreds of you have made your voices heard about a current case with our Child Protective Services in Washington regarding the Rengo family,' said Governor Jay Inslee on his official Facebook page on Thursday. 'I want to thank you for your concern and willingness to be vocal.' The Governor also sought to clarify any rumors surrounding the removal of the children by social services. 'I’d like to be clear: every child’s safety is our top priority in situations like these.

"A California couple who were held in Qatar for nearly two years before they were cleared in the death of their eight-year-old daughter have sued the engineering firm that sent them overseas. Matt and Grace Huang, who finally returned home to Los Angeles last Thursday, filed a negligence and wrongful termination suit against Colorado-based company MWH Global on Monday. Mr Huang, who had worked for the firm since 1999, was sent to Qatar to help improve the country's drainage systems ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the Los Angeles Times reported. But the suit claims that it failed to provide security or cultural training in Qatar, where mixed-race families are not accepted. The couple are Asian American and had adopted three black children from Africa. Scroll down for video . Freed: Matthew and Grace Huang, who arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after a two-year legal battle following the sudden death of their adopted daughter, have sued the company that sent them there . In the suit, the Huangs said that adoption is prohibited and East Asians are regarded as one of the lowest 'racial classes of individuals'. They added that the firm had 'abandoned them'. Following the sudden death of their daughter Gloria, who suffered an eating disorder after being malnourished as a young child, authorities accused them of adopting the children to harvest their organs, the couple said. Police said the Huangs had starved Gloria to death. MWH says it checked on the family's welfare and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on Matt Huang's defense. It also says that Huang resigned after they offered him a leave of absence from his job. The family's ordeal began in January 2013, when Gloria  started foaming at the mouth, her father told CBS News in an interview. He tried to save her but she passed away in hospital. Without carrying out a full autopsy of the girl, Qatari police turned their attention to the parents, who are of Asian descent. They were suspicious of the mixed-race family, the couple said. An initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'. Reunited: The couple appeared with their two adopted sons, Emanuel and Josiah, at their church in Pasadena, California on Sunday - but they said they felt the absence of their daughter . Welcomed back: Pastor Greg Waybright led applause for the family during their first public appearance . 'They thought we were human traffickers,' Matthew said. 'They said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them.' Grace added: 'For me, the hardest part, I think, was being asked over and over, 'Are you the real mom?'' Prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night, but he Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa. They were thrown in jail and the boys were sent to a Qatari orphanage for four months. While locked up, Matt said that he was physically and sexually assaulted while in prison. Their case was finally heard for the first time in November 2013 and they were convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. But after a year in prison, holes started to emerge in the prosecution's case and a judge granted them bail. Missed: They were thrown in prison after their daughter Gloria (pictured front) suddenly died in January 2013. She had been severely malnourished before she was adopted and suffered an eating disorder . A forensic pathologist hired by the family concluded there was 'no medical evidence' that the girl was starved by her parents and a proper autopsy was never carried out. During that time, the U.S. State Department called the case 'unfair' but failed to lobby for their release - and Matthew said he wonders if that was political. 'The U.S. government could have done a lot more, a lot quicker,' he told CBS. 'Qatar is such an important military base -- for the U.S. I felt like the U.S. government was unwilling to rock the boat and unwilling to make a strong stance with knowing that we were innocent.' But the department argued that Secretary Kerry had discussed it with the foreign minister. Then last Sunday, a Qatari judge finally overturned their conviction - but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day. Their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure Wednesday, with Mr Huang being detained for several minutes at the airport's passport control station as his wife watched in tears. Return: The Huangs finally left Qatar on Wednesday after a appeals judge threw out their conviction . Back home:The couple was reunited with their children and other relatives after they landed on Thursday . They finally arrived back in Los Angeles on Thursday. 'Mission accomplished. Matt and Grace are in Los Angeles,' The David House Agency, which represents them, tweeted. 'They have not stopped smiling.' The couple said they are relieved to be home and were pictured with their two sons at their Pasadena church on Sunday. 'It was just nice to be there with our church family again,' Grace said. 'But at the same time, we were just sitting in our usual order with the kids in between us, but there was just one who was missing.'

"Planes that travel faster than the speed of sound using radical 'hybrid wing body' designs could be the future of travel, according to concepts developed by Nasa. The US space agency has been working with manufacturers to design the next generation of planes that will make travelling around the world faster and more fuel efficient. Its archive of designs reveals just how different planes may appear in as little as ten years, with radical designs featuring needle-like bodies, sleek fuselages and delta wings. This computer-generated image shows a possible future 'flying wing' aircraft in flight over populated areas. This kind of design, produced by Northrop Grumman, would most likely carry cargo and then also carry passengers. Nasa says something like this could be in service in 2025 . One of the most popular designs is something called the 'hybrid wing body,' which is sometimes described as a blended wing body, according to a report in Gizmodo. In this design, the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft, which makes it extremely aerodynamic and creates dramatic cuts in fuel consumption, noise and emissions. In 2012, Nasa successfully tested the X-48C - a 'hybrid wing-body' plane with a greater internal volume for passengers and cargo. The triangle-shaped plane is reminiscent of spy planes and designed to cut through the air more efficiently. With a 21 ft (6.54 metre) wingspan, the aircraft was an 8.5 per cent scale model of a heavy-lift, subsonic airplane with a 240-foot wingspan that could be developed in the next 15 to 20 years for military applications. Our ability to fly at supersonic speeds over land in civil aircraft depends on the ability to reduce the level of sonic booms. Nasa has been exploring a variety of options for quieting the boom, starting with design concepts and moving through wind tunnel tests to flight tests of new technologies. This rendering of a possible future civil supersonic transport shows a vehicle that is shaped to reduce the sonic shockwave . The 'double bubble' D8 Series future aircraft design concept comes from the research team led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Based on a modified tube and wing with a very wide fuselage to provide extra lift, its low sweep wing reduces drag and weight; the embedded engines sit aft of the wings. The D8 series aircraft would be used for domestic flights and has been designed with a 2030-2035 timeframe . This is radically different to the 'double bubble' D8 Series future aircraft design concept which comes from a research team led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Based on a modified tube and wing with a very wide fuselage to provide extra lift, its low sweep wing reduces drag and weight; the embedded engines sit aft of the wings. 'The idea there is to take some of the lift that you would normally get from the wings and try and move that to the fuselage,' said Michael Rogers, a research at Nasa's Ames Research Centre. 'Another thing that's done to enable laminar flow on this vehicle is to reduce the sweep of the wings. It is easier to maintain laminar flow if the wings, instead of being swept back like a lot of modern commercial transports, are more sort of perpendicular to the side of the body of the plane. Supersonic could be superseded by something even faster. Mach 2.5 is about the speed limit for gas-turbine engines. Any faster and the temperature and pressure of air entering the engine is too high for the turbo machinery inside. To fly at hypersonic speed - Mach 5 and above - requires a different type of engine. A supersonic-combustion ramjet, or scramjet, has no moving parts. Instead of the rotating compressor and turbine in a jet engine, air is compressed and expanded by complex systems of shockwaves under the front of the aircraft, inside the inlet and under the fuselage at the rear. Scramjets have been under development for decades, but a breakthrough came in May 2013, when the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory’s Boeing X-51A WaveRider flew for 240 seconds over the Pacific on scramjet power, reaching Mach 5.1 and running until its fuel was exhausted. The next step is to build a high-speed cruise missile, able to strike distant targets in minutes, not hours. Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works - builder of the Mach 3.5 SR-71 Blackbird spyplane - has unveiled plans to develop a successor, dubbed the SR-72. Designed for reconnaissance and strike missions, the SR-72 would combine turbojet and ramjet/scramjet engines to enable the aircraft to take off from a runway, accelerate to a Mach 6 cruise, and then return to a conventional runway landing. If it can secure funding from the U.S. Defense Department, Lockheed Martin believes a prototype could be flying as soon as 2023 and the SR-72 could enter service by 2030, potentially paving the way for commercial applications of scramjet technology. This future aircraft design concept comes from the research team led by GE Aviation. Much lighter and more aerodynamic than current aircraft with the same capacity, the 20-passenger aircraft would reduce fuel consumption and noise and enable business jet-like travel between more than 1,300 airports. It features ultra-quiet turboprop engines and virtual reality windows . The 'Icon-II' future aircraft design concept for supersonic flight over land was created by Boeing with the help of Nasa. Its design is meant to save fuel. It also achieves large reductions in sonic boom noise levels that will meet the target level required to make supersonic flight over land possible . This idea for a possible future aircraft is called a 'hybrid wing body' or sometimes a blended wing body. In this design, the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft, which makes it extremely aerodynamic and holds great promise for dramatic reductions in fuel consumption, noise and emissions . Aeronautics engineers are also working to define a new standard for low sonic booms. They have been busy gathering data in order to create new, quieter planes that could help overturn the current ban on supersonic flight over land. ‘Lessening sonic booms - shock waves caused by an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound - is the most significant hurdle to reintroducing commercial supersonic flight,’ said Peter Coen, head of the High Speed Project in Nasa’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, Washington. ‘Other barriers include high altitude emissions, fuel efficiency and community noise around airports.’ 'We are nowhere near the maximum that we can get out of this industry,' added Nasa engineer Ruben Del Rosario. 'There is a lot of work to do.' This artist's concept shows a possible future subsonic aircraft using a boxed- or joined-wing configuration to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency. This design of an aircraft that could enter service in the 2020 timeframe . Boeing's advanced vehicle concept centers around the familiar blended wing body design like the X-48. What makes this design different is the placement of its Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines on the top of the plane's back end, flanked by two vertical tails to shield people on the ground from engine noise . The Silent Efficient Low Emissions Commercial Transport, or Select, future aircraft design comes from the research team led by Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation.Deceptively conventional-looking, the concept features advanced lightweight ceramic composite materials and nanotechnology and shape memory alloys .","Nasa's archive of future aircraft concept designs feature needle-like bodies, sleek fuselages and delta wings .

"President George W. Bush was not made aware of the harsh interrogation techniques that the CIA was using on terrorism detainees until four years after it first began using the tactics, a report released today by the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed. And even after Bush was informed by the government agency of the program, the CIA kept from the president the extent of the program's cruelty and ineffectiveness at obtaining reliable information, the 500-page document said. Other cabinet-level officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell and Vice President Dick Cheney, were also kept in the dark for some time, according to the report. White House officials who did have knowledge of the CIA's actions were concerned that Powell 'would blow his stack,' one email published by the Senate committee shows, so he was not told immediately. Former President George W. Bush is pictured here with then-Vice President Dick Cheney, right, and then-Secretary of State Colin Powel, left, during a September, 2001 cabinet meeting. A Senate report released today on the CIA's interrogation tactics during the Bush administration revealed that neither Bush nor members of his cabinet knew about the government agency's actions when they first began . 'The CIA provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information related to the operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the White House, the National Security Council principals, and their staffs,' an executive summary of the intelligence committee's report states. 'This prevented an accurate and complete understanding of the program by Executive Branch officials, thereby impeding oversight and decision-making.' It goes on to say that 'specific questions from White House officials were not answered truthfully or fully' by the CIA and that the government agency misled the National Security Council so it could continue using the questionable tactics, arguing that '[t]ermination of this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive.' The redacted document, based on a 6,700 page classified report, asserts that CIA records show that Bush was not briefed by the agency on the techniques, which Democrats say amounted to torture at times, until April of 2006. At that point, the study found that 38 of the 39 terrorism suspects who were mistreated had already been interrogated by the CIA, as the expanded interrogation program had already been underway since 2002. Furthermore, at the direction of top White House officials, then-Secretary of State Powell and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were not told of the program until September of 2003, despite being key members of the president's national security team. Cheney and then-National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, who would later lead the State Department under Bush, were not informed until sometime after that, and they too did not receive complete information about the program. According to the Senate report: 'An internal CIA email from July 2003 noted that ""... the WH [White House] is extremely concerned [Secretary] Powell would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's been going on."" ' Vice President Dick Cheney, left, Powell, center left, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, right, pictured here in the Oval Office with the president on April 18, 2002, learned of the CIA program sometime after the first year. President Bush, center right, wasn't told until 2006, the Senate report claims . The email, sent from the CIA's acting general counsel, John Rizzo, did not say who from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had instructed him to keep quiet, only that White House officials were concerned that dissemination of information to cabinet officials would result in leaks to the media. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage would later complain that that he and Powell were 'cut out' of key national security decisions as a result, it said. Neither the vice president nor the president were ever told of the exact locations of the CIA's overseas black sites at which they carry out the interrogation, which created a diplomatic snafu for Cheney once, Democratic aides who spoke with Bloomberg View said. Roughly five months after learning of the methods being employed by the CIA President Bush acknowledged in a Sept. 6, 2006 speech that the agency had used an 'alternative set of procedures' to interrogate detainees. The speech was vetted by the CIA, however, the Senate's report says, and based on the inaccurate information provided by the CIA. Thus Bush overplayed the significance of information acquired from detainees and the effectiveness of the CIA's interrogation techniques. According to the report, at one point White House Counsel instructed the CIA not to fully brief the president on the water boarding techniques the agency was using. The aides who spoke with Bloomberg said that once Bush learned the truth about some of the measures the CIA had taken, he was 'uncomfortable' with their actions. In a recent interview with CNN, Bush did not address rumors that the report would absolve him of involvement in the CIA's program nor did he shed any light on his knowledge of the agency's actions. 'Here’s what I’m going to say, that we’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' Bush told CNN host Candy Crowley, after noting that he hadn't yet seen the yet-to-be released Senate report. 'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he added. 'I knew the directors, I knew the deputy directors, I knew a lot of operators - these are good people. Really good people. And we’re lucky as a nation to have them.' Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a vocal proponent of the program, told the New York Times that he had not yet been briefed on the report, either. Nevertheless, he told the news publication on Monday that the information he had received led him to believe that the CIA would be characterized inaccurately in the Senate's study. 'What I keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it,' he told the Times. 'I think that’s all a bunch of hooey. The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program,' he claimed. The Senate report, five and a half years in the making, also claims that the CIA fed DOJ lies, as well, though. In at least one instance, the paper says, the CIA assured DOJ that the medical care of a detainee, Abu Zubaydah, who sustained a bullet wound during his capture would be put first. It then told its own staff that the interrogation of the combatant should take 'precedence' over his medical needs. The CIA released a statement refuting key findings of the Senate's study today, including the claim that Bush was not briefed on the true nature of its actions until midway through his second term. 'While the Agency records on the subject are admittedly incomplete, former President Bush has stated in his autobiography that he discussed the program, including its use of enhanced techniques, with then-[CIA Director George] Tenet in 2002, prior to the application of the techniques on Abu Zubaydah, and personally approved the techniques,' it said.","CIA began using harsh interrogation techniques in 2002; Bush was not told until 2006, Senate Intelligence Committee study revealed .

"A Jewish couple have created a Hanukkah-based alternative to popular Christmas tradition, the Elf on the Shelf, calling their version The Mensch on the Bench. Neal and Erin Hoffman, from Cincinnati, Ohio, came up with the idea after seeing how envious their son Jacob was of all his friends who were able to partake in the the increasingly-popular Elf on the Shelf customs. Eager to create a Jewish alternative to the festive toy based around their own religious traditions, the couple designed Moshe the Mensch. Scroll down for video . 'Elf envy started all of this': Neal and Erin Hoffman created The Mensch on a Bench as a Jewish alternative to the Elf on the Shelf . Embracing tradition: The couple wanted to teach their son more about his own religion, while embracing their own unique Hanukkah traditions . 'ELF ENVY. That is what started this whole thing,' Neal wrote on the couple's Kickstarter page, through which they managed to raise more than $22,000 to fund the project. 'Our son Jacob wanted to be like many of his friends and get an Elf on a Shelf, but being Jewish, the answer was no. That got us thinking. 'The Elf on a Shelf is a new tradition... So why couldn't we, as Jews, add a new tradition to our holiday to add some more Funukkah to Hanukkah. 'We created the story of Moshe the Mensch. Moshe was at the Temple when the Maccabees returned victorious from the war. Judah Maccabee was exhausted from the fighting and he wanted to go to bed. Super sized: The Mensch on the Bench range has expanded to include a limited edition doll and a five foot stuffed Moshe figure (pictured) The best of friends: Many Elf on the Shelf fans have already added a Mensch on the Bench to their collection and are documenting the characters' friendship on Instagram . 'But, with only enough oil left for one night, Judah was worried the lights would go out in the middle of the night. Moshe volunteered to sit on the bench of the Temple and tell everyone if the lights went out. What a Mensch sitting on that Bench.' Since reaching their funding goal in May last year, the Neal, a former Hasbro Toys employee, and Erin have already expanded The Mensch on a Bench range, which now includes a limited edition Moshe doll and a five foot stuffed Moshe, which has surprisingly  proved to be fairly popular with customers. Unlike Santa's scout elves, who return to the North Pole every night in order to report back on their children's behavior, the Mensch remains with the family in order to watch over their Menorah throughout the night to ensure that the flames keep burning bright. Each Mensch comes complete with a book documenting the story of Moshe the Mensch, and a set of eight rules for the family to follow in the weeks leading up to their Hanukkah celebration. Enjoying some festive fun: Just like the Elf on the Shelf, Moshe the Mensch enjoys capturing his nighttime antics on camera so that he can share them with the family come morning . Midnight mission: Unlike Santa's scout elves, Moshe the Mensch remains in the house all night in order to watch over the family's Menorah and ensure it keeps burning until morning . 'Every day of Hanukkah, make sure you give your Mensch a Shamash candle to hold... and every night use that candle to light your Menorah,' one rule reads, while another adds: 'One night of Hanukkah don't open presents yourself, instead buy presents and give them to people in need. 'Remember that a true Mensch is one who puts smiles on other people's faces.' Much like fans of the Elf on the Shelf, the Mensch's followers are also encouraged to document their doll's various escapades around the house and then share the images on Instagram using the hashtag #menschonabench. Thus far, the Mensch has been captured in a number of hilarious positions, from sledding down a makeshift mountain with his Christmas counterpart, the Elf on the Shelf, to enjoying a potato sack race against computer game heroes Mario and Luigi. In one image, the religious figure is even seen enjoying a bottle of red wine. Naughty or nice? Some of the images of Moshe the Mensch are slightly more mischievous than others . A Christmas Tradition: The Elf on the Shelf has become increasingly popular in recent years . And it's not just Jewish families who Neal and Erin hope will enjoy the new Hanukkah tradition. # . 'The product is designed for young Jewish families, but is a great introduction to Hanukkah for those not of the Jewish faith,' the couple wrote on their Kickstarter page. 'In the end our goal is to increase active participation in Hanukkah and make the celebration of the holiday even more fun than it is today. 'We also want to teach kids what it is to be a true Mensch and teach them to strive to make a positive difference in the world around them.","Jewish couple Neal and Erin Hoffman were able to fund the initial launch of the entertaining toy thanks to a Kickstarter campaign .

"Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts was all smiles as she and her boyfriend walked out of court on Monday after their arraignment for public sex charges was postponed until January. Watts, 29, who claimed that police accused her of being a prostitute when she was arrested in Los Angeles in September with Brian Lucas, hopes to take advantage of a new law in California which will allow a judge to dismiss her lewd conduct case. If the new law is passed in time, Watts and Lucas will appear in court on January 27 and will be sentenced to community service for the controversial arrest, which she initially claimed was sparked by racial profiling by the LAPD. Scroll down for audio . Exit: Django Unchained' actress, Daniele Watts and her boyfriend, Brian Lucas are all smiles after they leave an LA courthouse after finding out their arraignment for misdemeanor lewd conduct charges is postponed . 'We know we didn't do anything wrong and we love each,' said Watts outside the court as she stood next to Lucas. Asked if the postponement was acceptable, Watts' attorney said that it seemed so according to the New York Daily News. 'We're in the early stages on that right now, but I think all sides would like this to end in a way that benefits everybody positively,' said her lawyer Lou Shapiro outside the court. Watts and Lucas found themselves at the center of a national controversy on September 11 when she claimed that the LAPD arrested her because she was a prostitute after her and Lucas were caught involved in an amorous clinch in broad daylight. Smiling: Lucas and Watts have refused to apologize for their words following their controversial September arrest . She claimed the police were heavy-handed and left her 'wrist bleeding in pain' and claimed the whole affair left her humiliated. Lucas took to Facebook to specifically claim the LAPD arrested them because they assumed his girlfriend was a prostitute because they saw an interracial couple. A recording of the arrest by one of the officers involved showed that Watts accused the police of racism when she refused to produce ID after a series of 911 calls from witnesses claiming a couple was having sex in their car. 'Do you know how many times the cops have been called just for being black? Just because I am black and he's white? I'm just being really honest,' she said to LAPD Sgt. Jim Parker. In the recording Watts exclaims 'You are not the one who is in handcuffs' 'You're not the one who's spent your life being called a n----- and growing up in the south, and now I get the cops called on me. Watts (right) insisted she was just kissing her boyfriend in the car but witness accounts suggest different . An eyewitness in a nearby offfice building said Lucas was sitting in the passenger seat with his feet on the curb and Watts was straddling him and rocking back and forth . Pictures obtained by TMZ show Daniele Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in his car while the couple steady themselves with their hands on the car sunroof . 'The cop pulled us over because he thought I was a prostitute.' Parker later said in an interview with the MailOnline that he thought it was incorrect for Watts to accuse him and the other two officers of prejudice because he is gay and the other two police were a woman and a Latino. Parker said he released the audio in an attempt so show that he was simply responding to a 911 calls that told the dispatcher Watts and Lucas were having sex with the door open and was reasonable during their encounter. He also added that it was Watts' attitude and uncooperative nature that caused her to be arrested. In the immediate aftermath, prominent civil rights leaders took up Watts' cause, but then asked her to apologize when the audio and pictures showing Watts sitting on top of Lucas inside his car were made public. Sgt. Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he is speaking out because he's seen the department become dramatically more sensitive since he's been on the force . However, Watts and Lucas, who could face six months in jail have refused to apologize. 'I think there was a lot of personal risk involved for me to decide to even make that Facebook post,' Watts said on Monday according to the New York Daily News. 'I wouldn't have made that Facebook statement if I didn't believe this was an issue that deserves our national conversation and attention. 'And racial conflict is something that a lot of people don't want to talk about, because it's uncomfortable, but if I'm in a position where people are listening, I'm going to lend my voice to it. 'I believe conversations can help us move through these difficult things.'","Daniele Watts, 29, left court with Brian Lucas in Los Angeles on Monday .

"A study by scientists at Queen's University in Canada found the HPV vaccine has no impact on sexual behaviour in young girls (file picture) Fears the HPV vaccine promotes sexual promiscuity in young girls are unfounded, scientists say. A study in Canada has found the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine has had little impact on the sexual behaviour of teenage girls. HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection. Although in many cases the virus goes away by itself, and may cause no symptoms, it can cause genital warts or cervical cancer. There are more than 100 types of HPV infection, with around 40 affecting the genital area. Both men and women can carry the virus, but smoking, having multiple sexual partners and losing your virginity at an early age are all risk factors. Most women will have an HPV infection at some point in their lives, usually without knowing it. But others types of HPV are known to increase the risk of developing cancer, particularly cervical cancer. Since 2006, the HPV vaccine has been licensed in almost 100 countries, including Canada. In the UK the vaccine was introduced in 2008. Many of these countries have national HPV vaccination programmes to protect young girls against the virus before they become sexually active. However there are concerns the vaccine - which guards against four types of the virus shown to cause cervical cancer - may give girls a false sense of security about their risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. That false sense of security could, some experts argue, lead young girls to engage in riskier sexual activity. But  researchers at Queen's University in Ontario claim they have disproved the theory. Dr Leah Smith, lead author of the study, said: 'These findings suggest fears of increased risky sexual behaviour following HPV vaccination are unwarranted and should not be a barrier to vaccinating at a young age.' Her team analysed 260,000 girls, of whom around half were eligible for Ontario's publicly funded, school-based HPV vaccination programme during the first two school years it was offered (2007/08 and 2008/09). The researchers followed the girls until March 31 of their Grade 12 year. Around six per cent of girls became pregnant or contracted an STI between grades 10 and 12. This equates to 10,187 pregnancies and 6,259 cases of non-HPV-related sexually transmitted infections. Dr Linda Lévesque, senior author, said: 'Neither HPV vaccination nor programme eligibility increased the risk of pregnancy nor non-HPV-related STIs among females aged 14 to 17 years. 'The results of the study can be used by physicians, public health providers and policy makers to address public and parental concerns about HPV vaccination and promiscuity.' The study was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The human papilloma virus is known to cause cervical cancer, pictured. The vaccine was introduced in almost 100 countries across the world in 2006 .","Canadian study found HPV jab has no impact of sexual behaviour .

"Stunning images of an Indonesian girl holding a pet cat, a crowd of penguins on a South Atlantic island, and a colourful hot air balloon soaring over a red desert are in the running for the Sony World Photography Awards. With just over one month remaining for photographers to enter the contest, the World Photography Organisation has revealed some of the submissions for the 2015 competition. And the collection of photos is spectacular - with one of the standouts featuring an orangutan using a large banana leaf to shield itself from the driving rain. Photographer Andrew Suryono said: ‘I was taking pictures of some orangutans in Bali and then it started to rain. ‘Just before I put my camera away, I saw this orangutan take a banana leaf and put it on top on his head to protect himself from the rain. ‘I immediately used my DSLR and telephoto lens to preserve this magic moment.’ This year's submissions include incredible images of wildlife and some of Earth's greatest landscapes.

"The Duchess of Cambridge was once again flying the flag for British fashion in New York today in a cerise pink Mulberry coat. But anyone aspiring to emulate the royal's look will be disappointed to learn that the design, from the current autumn/winter 2014 collection, has already sold out online. The £1,500 double-breasted wool-silk garment was just roomy enough to accommodate Kate's five-month baby bump, and was no doubt tailored to fit perfectly. Scroll down for video . In the pink: The Duchess of Cambridge wore a £1,500 cerise coat by Mulberry on her visit to the 9/11 Memorial this morning . Trendsetter: The Duchess of Cambridge was later given a tour of the National September Eleventh Memorial Museum. Her coat has been such a hit with fashion fans, it has already sold out . Unlike yesterday's Goat coat, there was no need to drop the hemline which already fell below the knee. And the bold hue was a welcome burst of colour on a bleak and rainy morning at the 9/11 Memorial. Given the rain, the Duchess wisely wore her hair tied back in a ponytail, minimising any potential for frizz. The look was completed by black opaque tights and the same black suede heels she has worn for most of her New York engagements. Once inside the National September Eleventh Memorial Museum, Kate removed her coat to reveal the black high-neck dress she had been wearing underneath - the Vanessa style from Seraphine's current collection - with her Cartier Trinity necklace. Sellout: The wool-silk coat was only available to buy in the UK and has already sold out online . Also a British label, Seraphine specialises in maternity wear and also created the custom plum tweed coat worn by the Duchess on her arrival into New York City. Last night, however, Kate paid tribute to her U.S. hosts in a coat by New York designer Tory Burch. Incidentally, the $595 silver boucle Bettina design has also sold out . She teamed the coat with a pair of J Crew's black Toothpick jeans and high heels for a reception for the Tusk Trust, where she met Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, then a Brooklyn Nets game at the Barclays Center, where she and Prince William met LeBron James and enjoyed a chat courtside with Beyonce and Jay Z. Today saw the Duke and Duchess complete a jam-packed schedule. Following the 9/11 Memorial and museum, they visited two of New York City’s leading youth organizations – The Door and The CityKids Foundation – to see the work they do with disadvantaged children. Elegant: The Duchess of Cambridge wore a Seraphine maternity dress underneath the pink coat with her Cartier Trinity necklace . Custom made: Kate also wore Seraphine on her arrival in New York on Sunday - a plum tweed maternity coat . Style queen: Yesterday evening, Kate paid tribute to her U.S. hosts in Tory Burch's $595 Bettina coat (left) with $115 J Crew Toothpick jeans. Earlier that day she wore a $1,000 (£680) coat by Goat (right) Lunch was a reception with members of the British arts community - which again allowed us to see Kate's Seraphine dress and Cartier necklace. This afternoon they will visit the Empire State Building, and this evening they will be the guests of honour at a fundraising dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art benefiting their 600-year-old alma mater, the University of St Andrews. The couple will catch a late flight back to the UK after dinner that will see them reunited with Prince George by morning.","Kate wore the coat with a black Seraphine maternity dress, black opaque tights and black suede heels .

"He spent more than half a century teaching the nation about the night's sky as the presenter of one of world's longest running television series. Now Sir Patrick Moore's own private collection of manuscripts and observation logs, which chart nearly 60 years of staring at the stars,  are to be made available to the public to continue his legacy. The Science Museum in London has acquired the astronomer's extensive personal archive, which he collected at Farthings, his home in Selsey, West Sussex. Sir Patrick Moore in 1995 with 'Oscar', his 12 ½ inch reflecting telescope that he used to map the Moon . Among the documents are notes that illustrate his contribution to our understanding of the heavens thanks to his prolific work as an amateur astronomer. Draft scripts and memorabilia from The Sky at Night, which holds the record for the longest running television programmes with the same original presenter. The collection also includes 70 of Sir Patrick's observation books, featuring detailed drawings and records of the night skies, alongside manuscripts for novels and astronomy books. The Science Museum has also acquired a 12.5 inch reflecting telescope, nicknamed Oscar by Sir Patrick. He had used the telescope for mapping the Moon. The collection also features rare photographs of Sir Patrick, who died two years ago today, at work in his study and showing his softer side while holding his cat Jeannie, taken by Brain May, the former Queen guitarist and astrophysicist. Sir Patrick Moore captured enjoying a rare personal moment with his cat Jeannie at his home in Selsey, West Sussex, in a photograph taken by his close friend and astrophysicist, the former Queen guitarist Brian May .

The drawings were made on British Astronomical Association cards, an organisation he joined at the age of 11 years old and eventually became President of during his long career as an astronomer . May, who was a close friend of Sir Patrick, said: 'Patrick's friends and executors, have worked for a year to try to find the most fitting home for his core astronomical and personal archive. 'We're thrilled that the Science Museum has now agreed to give this precious resource a home. 'We're sure Patrick would be honoured that his legacy, a national treasure, will be in the perfect place - safe in Britain's top Scientific Museum, with plans for the material to be accessible to future generations.

Drawing of Saturn by Sir Patrick Moore made while observing the planet on April 12 and April 23 1983 . 'We feel there is no more fitting resting place for Patrick's legendary life's work.' The collection consists of several hundred items, will be kept at the Science Museum's library and archives  at Wroughton, Wiltshire, where it will be catalogued before being made available to the public. Alison Boyle, deputy keeper of science and medicine at the Science Museum, said: ""Sir Patrick Moore was a towering figure in astronomy and broadcasting during a remarkable career spanning most of the 20th century. 'This archive will help to inform the museum's future astronomy and space displays, and will become an important resource for all historians of popular astronomy.' Patrick Moore was probably one of the most eccentric yet instantly recognisable characters on British television after an onscreen career that spanned more than half a century. However, despite his public profile, he kept a secret heartache through his life that shaped many of his views, that at times seemed abrasive. Aged just 16, he joined the RAF as a Bomber Command Navigator at the start of the World War II after lying about his age. He turned down a place at Cambridge University to join up. During the way he met a nurse called Lorna and the pair fell deeply in love before getting engaged. However, just three years after they met, Lorna was killed during a German air-raid on London. It was a loss that left the astronomer heartbroken and sparked a life long loathing for the Germans. Patrick Moore rarely spoke about the loss he suffered after joining the RAF in 1940 (right) during the war . Sir Patrick remained a bachelor for the rest of his life and revealed in an interview shortly before his death that barely a moment went past where he did not think of her. In an interview with the Daily Mail he said: ‘It’s a long time back now. She was in London when one of Hitler’s bombs fell. That was it for me. It went too deep. 'There couldn’t be anybody else. She wasn’t there and there was no one else for me, so you make the best of a bad job. ‘We didn’t have enough time. And now we’re making friends with the Germans. If I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I’d push it down. 'There may be good, courteous, friendly Germans, but I haven’t met them.’ Sir Patrick spent much of the war working in intelligence against the Nazis but rarely spoke about what he did. The death of his father, Captain Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore, in 1947 from the gas he had inhaled back in the trenches of the Great War, also fuelled his hatred. Through his long career after the war as an astronomer, he found he was unable to heal from the emotional wounds he had suffered. He said: ‘I’ve had to visit Germany a few times during my career and as soon as I get there I’m in enemy territory. It’s absurd because I don’t feel the same about Japan.’ A Russian moon globe, based on photographs taken from space probes in 1959, given to Sir Patrick Moore .","Collection contains hundreds of drawings, observations and notes made by Sir Patrick Moore during his long amateur astronomy career .

"Terror plot: Texan Everett Adam Livvix, 30, was arrested in Israel last month for allegedly plotting to bomb Muslim holy sites . A Texas man has been arrested and indicted in Israel on weapons charges for allegedly plotting to bomb Muslim holy . sites, . The Israeli domestic security service Shin Bet and the Justice Ministry identified the suspect Tuesday as Adam Everett Livvix, 30, of Texas, and said he was wanted in the US on unrelated drug charges. Livvix, who was arrested November 19, was charged Monday . with conspiring with his roommate, an Israeli soldier, to steal 3lbs of explosives from the Israel Defense Forces. The Israeli authorities said an undercover police agent uncovered the alleged terror plot and that ammunition and weapons . material stolen from the military were found in Livvix's possession. A gag order on details of the case, being heard in a court . in the central Israeli city of Netanya, was lifted Tuesday. 'Under questioning, Livvix admitted ... he had weighed . various ideas about committing terrorist attacks at different . venues and even gave preliminary thought to the possibility of . attacking venues (of) Islamic holy places in Israel,' the Shin . Bet said, without identifying them. The suspect's attorney told reporters that the Shin Bet was exaggerating the security implications of the case, which coincides with high Arab-Jewish tensions in Jerusalem over access to a holy site where the al-Aqsa mosque now stands in place of biblical Jewish holy sites. The Justice Ministry said the court has ordered Livvix to . undergo a psychiatric examination prior to entering a plea. Israeli authorities said Livvix is a Christian and that he . arrived in the region in 2013, living first in the Palestinian . cities of Hebron and Bethlehem in the West Bank and . then residing illegally in the State of Israel. Fugitive: Livvix was wanted in multiple US jursdictions on unrelated drug and theft charges . According to Livvix's public arrest records, the 6-foot-tall, 200lbs man was wanted in Indiana for failure to appear in court on marijuana possession charges. He was also named most wanted criminal in Crawford County, Illinois, in connection to failure to appear and theft charges. The indictment against Livvix, made public Tuesday and cited by The Jerusalem Post, recounted how while living in the West Bank, the Texan was allegedly approached by a Palestinian operative who tried to recruit Livvix to assassinate President Barack Obama during his visit to the region last March. Livvix was allegedly offered sniper rifles to carry out the plot on Obama's life, but he refused. He then illegally crossed the border into Israel and settled in Netanya, where he passed himself off as a member of an elite Navy SEAL commando unit, the court documents stated. In mid-November, police were tipped off about Livvix's whereabouts, resulting in his arrest. Assassination: Livvix was allegedly approached by a Palestinian in the West Bank last year about killing President Obama during his March visit, but the Texas man refused . When officers kicked down the door to his apartment on November 19, Livvix attempted to flee by leaping from his seventh-floor window and landing on a sixth-floor balcony, but he was quickly apprehended. During questioning, the American fugitive admitted to committing fraud and plotting to carry out terrorist attacks on Muslim holy sites. When officers searched his apartment in Netanya, they allegedly discovered ammunition and spare gun parts stolen from the military. According to his indictment, Livvix had encouraged his soldier friend to steal six stun grenades, smoke grenades and tear gas canisters from an IDF base.","Everett Adam Livvix, 30, was arrested in November in Netanya, Israel, and charged with weapons possession .

"Strangers locking lips, a nun channelling Sister Act and a pet pup scaring the wits out of hapless strangers: these are the moments that got the world watching in 2014. California-based video sharing site, YouTube, has released its annual list of global top-trending videos, chosen based on views, shares, comments and likes. In the top spot for views was the aptly-titled Mutant Giant Spider Dog, which follows the adventures of a Polish dog dressed as a giant, furry arachnid as it bounds out of lifts and down dark alleyways. Scroll down for videos . Beware the Spider Dog: In the top spot for views was the aptly-titled Mutant Giant Spider Dog, which follows the adventures of a Polish dog dressed as a giant, furry arachnid as it bounds out of lifts and down alleyways . In one scene, a man taking out his rubbish flees for his life when Chica emerges from behind a door, while in another, two girls scream and run after seeing the creature atop a lifeless man in an elevator. Later in the video, a couple spot a flinching man wrapped up in a 'spider web' hanging from a tree in a park and the man bravely creeps towards it, while his girlfriend stays rooted in her position. In a year in which the World Cup captivated audiences worldwide, a Nike advert starring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar da Silva Santos Junior and Wayne Rooney also had fans clicking. 1 - Chica the Spider-Dog scares people in hilarious prank . 2 - The world's biggest football stars join together in Nike ad . 3 - See what happens when 20 people kiss complete strangers . 4 - Nun stuns the crowd and the judges on Italy's The Voice . 5 - The iPhone 6 Plus is put to the BEND TEST in online video . 6 - Simon finally gets around to pushing his Golden Buzzer on Britain's Got Talent . 7 - Budweiser releases adorable 'Puppy Love' Super Bowl ad . 8 - Devil Baby terrorises New York in horrible prank . 9 - Goku vs Superman: Epic rap battles of history . 10 - Woman catcalled 108 times while walking in New York . That video, Nike Football: Winner Stays, garnered just under 100 million views to rank second on YouTube's list. Coming in third was First Kiss, a black and white number from filmmaker Tatia PIlieva, documented the moment perfect strangers kissed - watched on by 94 million people and counting. While most of the participants laugh nervously to fill the awkward silences before their kiss, many of them become passionately lost in the moment when they finally lean in. Rounding out the top four was a clip from the Italian version of reality talent search hit The Voice, in which a 25-year-old nun from Sicily earned a near-instant standing ovation from studio audiences for her rendition of Alicia Keys' anthem No One. Sister Cristina Scuccia's audition tape has so far been watched by more than 66 million people. The fifth most popular video was of the new iPhone 6 Plus put to the test by YouTube user Unbox Therapy, who uses his bare hands to test the bendability of the new model. The problem, dubbed 'bend gate' by some on social media sites, was due to the phone's thinner aluminium exterior, and generated a number of viral spoofs. 1 - Frozen - Let It Go Sing-along . 2- Bars and Melody - Simon Cowell's Golden Buzzer act . 3 - The world's biggest football stars join together in Nike ad . 4 - 'Look Up' - A spoken word film for an online generation . 5 - Q&A Sunday - With my girlfriend . 6 - Frozen - A musical featuring Disney princesses . 7 -  Chica the Spider-Dog scares people in hilarious prank . 8 - Funny Montage - number 2 . 9 - See what happens when 20 people kiss complete strangers . 10 - Katy Perry ft. Juicy J - 'Dark Horse' parody . Other videos to feature in the top ten include a 'devil baby' terrorising the streets of New York courtesty of the makers of new horror film Devil's Due. The producers made a remote-controlled stroller containing a horrifying animatronic 'devil baby' that suddenly sits up and emits a demonic, blood-curdling wail when approached. Passers-by are lured to the stroller by the sound of a baby crying. Then, when they're close, the Satanic occupant gives them the shock of their lives. A more recent video, which came in at number 10, showed a 24-year-old aspiring actress filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around New York City. Shoshana Roberts, a graduate of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, was captured on a hidden camera by her friend, Rob Bliss, as she walked through the city's streets. Over a ten-hour period, she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'Smile' and 'Have a nice evening darling'. Until recently, Facebook page owners shared their Youtube videos on their Facebook page. But for the first time ever, page owners are uploading more videos directly to Facebook than they did via sharing from YouTube videos, according to new data from Socialbakers. The research found that YouTube's share of the videos posted to Facebook by content creators has been falling since May. According to Business Insider, this is because marketers and content creators are starting to realise there is more value in publishing a video directly to Facebook than there is uploading it to YouTube alone. One benefit is that Facebook videos automatically play as a user scrolls through the news feed, which means users are drawn to content rather than having to press play based on the title. Facebook also provides a large video preview image through the news feed than the smaller preview boxes offered on YouTube. The list reveals that there is no exact formula, but YouTube said popular videos tend to have three key characteristics. 'They’re entertaining or informative in some way, they’re something that you want to share with other people, and they come from a channel with more videos like it,' said the site. Meanwhile, more than 100 YouTube stars helped create YouTube Rewind: Turn Down for 2014, the latest in YouTube's series of year-end mash-ups. With cameos from Japanese beatboxer Hikakin, Sesame Street stalwart Big Bird, and US talk show host Conan O'Brien, and set to the dulcet tones of Happy singer Pharrell Williams and Fancy rapper Iggy Azalea, YouTube says its 2014 effort is the most international so far.","Top spot for most watched video went to 'Mutant Giant Spider Dog'

"Princeton University researchers have uncovered a previously unknown, and possibly substantial, source of the greenhouse gas methane to the Earth's atmosphere. After testing a sample of abandoned oil and natural gas wells in northwestern Pennsylvania, the researchers found that many of the old wells leaked substantial quantities of methane. Because there are so many abandoned wells nationwide - about three million - the researchers believe the overall contribution of leaking wells could be significant. Researchers at Princeton University say abandoned wells in Pennsylvania are emitting natural gas. And as many as three million nationwide could be leaking. Pictured is one of the wells the researchers tested, this one in the Allegheny National Forest . The researchers said their findings identify a need to make measurements across a wide variety of regions in Pennsylvania but also in other states with a long history of oil and gas development such as California and Texas. 'The research indicates that this is a source of methane that should not be ignored,' said Dr Michael Celia, the Theodore Shelton Pitney Professor of Environmental Studies and professor of civil and environmental engineering at Princeton. 'We need to determine how significant it is on a wider basis.' While oil and gas companies work to minimise the amount of methane emitted by their operations, almost no attention has been paid to wells that were drilled decades ago. These wells, some of which date back to the 19th century, are typically abandoned and not recorded on official records. Methane is the unprocessed form of natural gas. Scientists say that after carbon dioxide, methane is the most important contributor to the greenhouse effect, in which gases in the atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise radiate from the Earth. Pound for pound, methane has about 20 times the heat-trapping effect as carbon dioxide. Methane is produced naturally, by processes including decomposition, and by human activity such as landfills and oil and gas production. Dr Mary Kang, then a doctoral candidate at Princeton, originally began looking into methane emissions from old wells after researching techniques to store carbon dioxide by injecting it deep underground. While examining ways that carbon dioxide could escape underground storage, Dr Kang wondered about the effect of old wells on methane emissions. 'I was looking for data, but it didn't exist,' said Dr Kang, now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford. In a paper published 8 Dec in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers describe how they chose 19 wells in the adjacent McKean and Potter counties in northwestern Pennsylvania. The wells chosen were all abandoned, and records about the origin of the wells and their conditions did not exist. Only one of the wells was on the state's list of abandoned wells. Some of the wells, which can look like a pipe emerging from the ground, are located in forests and others in people's yards. Dr Kang said the lack of documentation made it hard to tell when the wells were originally drilled or whether any attempt had been made to plug them. 'What surprised me was that every well we measured had some methane coming out,' said Dr Celia. Other states like California and Texas may have similar emissions, according to the study. Abandoned wells could represent as much as 10 per cent of methane from human activities in Pennsylvania. And, unlike working wells, they can leak methane for decades. Shown is a fracking operation in Towanda . To conduct the research, the team placed enclosures called flux chambers over the tops of the wells. They also placed flux chambers nearby to measure the background emissions from the terrain and make sure the methane was emitted from the wells and not the surrounding area. Although all the wells registered some level of methane, about 15 per cent emitted the gas at a markedly higher level - thousands of times greater than the lower-level wells. Dr Denise Mauzerall, a Princeton professor and a member of the research team, said a critical task is to discover the characteristics of these super-emitting wells. Mauzerall said the relatively low number of high-emitting wells could offer a workable solution: while trying to plug every abandoned well in the country might be too costly to be realistic, dealing with the smaller number of high emitters could be possible. 'The fact that most of the methane is coming out of a small number of wells should make it easier to address if we can identify the high-emitting wells,' said Dr Mauzerall. The researchers have used their results to extrapolate total methane emissions from abandoned wells in Pennsylvania, although they stress that the results are preliminary because of the relatively small sample. But based on that data, they estimate that emissions from abandoned wells represents as much as 10 per cent of methane from human activities in Pennsylvania - about the same amount as caused by current oil and gas production. Also, unlike working wells, which have productive lifetimes of 10 to 15 years, abandoned wells can continue to leak methane for decades. 'This may be a significant source,' Mauzerall said. 'There is no single silver bullet but if it turns out that we can cap or capture the methane coming off these really big emitters, that would make a substantial difference.' The US Environmental Protection Agency is currently mulling whether to issue mandatory standards for reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector as part of President Barack Obama's broad climate action plan.","Researchers at Princeton University say abandoned wells in Pennsylvania are emitting natural gas .

"A fake business tycoon used photos of himself with Roman Abramovich, Jose Mourinho and Christiano Ronaldo to persuade football club shareholders to sell him their club for £1, according to court documents. A legal battle has broken out between Outail Touzar, 31, and Salisbury City Football Club bosses after the Moroccan took over the financially struggling club in June this year. After buying the club, he immediately made himself chairman and signed midfielder Prince Khalid Bin Bader Alsaud, 19, who became the first member of the Saudi royal family to play for a professional British team.

It has been claimed Touzar used pictures of himself with football celebrities to help convince Salisbury City Football Club owners to sell him their club . Touzar (left) with Prince Khalid Bin Bader Alsaud, who he signed immediately following his arrival at the club . Touzar (left) said at the time of signing Prince Khalid (right) he was 'honoured' to become the club's chairman . At the time, it was reported he was a successful businessman with links to wealthy oil-rich sheikhs. However, The Sun reported Touzar convinced Salisbury shareholders to sell him the club for a nominal £1 fee - which he ultimately failed to pay - after showing them photos of himself with Chelsea FC owner Abramovich, manager Jose Mourinho, as well as footballing star Cristiano Ronaldo and Fifa president Sepp Blatter. Salisbury chief executive Paul Smith said he thought the images of Touzar with the celebrities were faked. He said: 'Everything he brought forward proved to be a total scam. It was a load of rubbish.' The paper reported the club is now suing Touzar for damages and Touzar has not commented. MailOnline has requested comment from Touzar. The club's fans were left baffled in June when they woke up to discover their club had been sold to Touzar in a secret overnight deal. At the time, the club were in deep financial trouble and struggling to avoid closure. Salisbury City FC's new owner Moroccan businessman Outail Touzar pictured outside the Wiltshire club . Outail Touzar (second from right) pictured with club bosses at the time of the club's sale in June this year . Salisbury City Football Club in Wiltshire is currently under administration and without a league to play in . Upon his appointment, Touzar said he was 'honoured' to take on the role of chairman of Salisbury City FC. He said: 'After initial hesitation, deep thinking and consulting with my advisers I decided to accept the challenge of taking this lovely small town community club and build something special out of it.'

"The mere sight of your mobile phone can distract you - even if you are not using it. Researchers at the University of Southern Maine found that when people are asked to do a complicated task they are less successful if their mobile is still out. Those who put it in their pocket or their bag got on average 20 per cent higher in the test because they were more focused. Researchers from the University of South Maine found that people were distracted by their mobile - even when it wasn't in use (shown). People who couldn't see their phone scored 20 per cent higher in a test than those who could see it. Just the presence of a phone was found to severely limit reaction times . The findings suggest that when we need to do some work the best thing to do is not just turn your phone off - but put it away as well. The researchers asked two groups of students to carry out two different attention-sapping tasks, one of which was trickier than the other. Firstly they were given a page of 20 rows of numbers and asked to circle one number in particular whenever they saw it. Students spend up to ten hours a day on their mobile phones, according to a study published in September. Some even said they feel stressed if their phone is not in sight. A team at Baylor University in Texas found that female students spent an average of ten hours a day texting, emailing and on social media while their male counterparts spent nearly eight. Lead author James Roberts said the idea of becoming addicted to using a mobile phone was ‘an increasingly realistic possibility’. Secondly that they had to do the same and also cross off any two adjacent numbers in different rows that added up to the target number. During both experiments, half the students kept their phones on their desks and the other half put them out of sight. The researchers found that in both experiments, those who could not see their phones did better and scored an average of 26 compared to 21 if they could see their mobile. Lead author Bill Thornton, a social psychologist at the University of Southern Maine, wrote that being distracted by your mobile has ‘obvious consequences’ such as worse reaction times. He said: ‘The ""constant connectivity"" afforded by mobile technology has contributed to a preoccupation with the cell phone - an overwhelming majority of users check their cell phone upon waking and as the last thing before they go to bed’. Such behaviour is typical of ‘behavioural addiction’ and ‘diminishes our ability to maintain attention’, Professor Thornton added. Lead author Professor Thornton said such behaviour is typical of ‘behavioural addiction’ and ‘diminishes our ability to maintain attention’. Previous studies have found we are addicted to our phones, including one in September that said Students spend up to ten hours a day on their mobile phones . In his conclusion he wrote: ‘Results of two studies reported here provide further evidence that the ‘mere presence’ of a cell phone may be sufficiently distracting to produce diminished attention and deficits in task-performance, especially for tasks with greater attentional and cognitive demands. ‘The implications for such an unintended negative consequence may be quite wide-ranging (for example, productivity in school and the work place).’ A previous study illustrated the extent of the problem when it revealed that mobile users check their devices an average of 150 times a day as they cannot bear to be apart from them. We are now so addicted to our phones that we cannot go 10 minutes without fiddling around with them.","Researchers from the University of South Maine found that people were distracted by their mobile - even when it wasn't in use .

"Imagine the scenario: you’re at work, when your smartphone tells you some of the vegetables in your fridge at home have gone off, letting you know to pick more up on the way home. That’s one of the potential uses of a new technology developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Using a simple sensor that can be read by a smartphone, they have devised a way to wirelessly detect hazardous gases and pollutants. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have developed a method to detect hazardous gases and pollutants. They modified NFC chips (shown) to make them detect things in their environment, and the information could then be sent to your phone . The sensors are made using modified near-field communication (NFC) tags. These tags, which receive the little power they need from the device reading them, function as wirelessly addressable barcodes. Among their many uses they can be used to make wireless payments with an NFC-enabled smartphone. NFC tags can be read by any smartphone that has near-field communication capability. These phones can send out short pulses of magnetic fields at radio frequency (13.56 megahertz), inducing an electric current in the circuit on the tag, which relays information to the phone. To adapt these tags for their own purposes, the MIT team first disrupted the electronic circuit by punching a hole in it. Then, they reconnected the circuit with a linker made of carbon nanotubes that are specialised to detect a particular gas. The team refers to the modified tags as Cards (chemically actuated resonant devices). When carbon nanotubes bind to the target gas, their ability to conduct electricity changes, which shifts the radio frequencies at which power can be transferred to the device. When a smartphone pings the Card, it responds only if it can receive sufficient power at the smartphone-transmitted radio frequencies, allowing the phone to determine whether the circuit has been altered and the gas is present. But now the researchers have found that with a small modification, the chips can be used to detect the presence of gases. To adapt them for their own purposes, the team disrupted the electronic circuit by punching a hole in it. Then, they reconnected the circuit with a linker made of carbon nanotubes that are specialised to detect a particular gas. Using this system, the researchers have demonstrated that they can detect gaseous ammonia, hydrogen peroxide and cyclohexanone, among other gases. For now, the technology must rely on the phone being within five centimetres of the sensor. But the researchers are working on a Bluetooth technology to expand the range. Senior author of the paper and Professor of Chemistry at MIT Dr Tim Swager told MailOnline this could have a variety of uses. ‘It is ideal for large volume applications wherein consumers can check for example freshness of food for themselves,’ he said. ‘You could have a NFC system in your fridge that reads the sensor and then uploads data to a device that you can read from a distance. ‘Alternatively you could imagine consumers putting up their own sensor networks to monitor, for example air quality in a building.’ In a video detailing the technology it’s also shown how it could be used to detect explosives in packages. The demonstration shows the direct detection of peroxide explosives while cyclohexanone, a vapour that is typically given off from plastic explosives, can also be detected. Dr Tim Swager told MailOnline the technology could have a variety of uses. ‘It is ideal for large volume applications wherein consumers can check for example freshness of food for themselves,’ he said. ‘You could have a NFC system in your fridge that reads the sensor' (stock image shown) Dr Swager added in a separate news release from MIT: ‘The beauty of these sensors is that they are really cheap. You put them up, they sit there, and then you come around and read them. There's no wiring involved. There's no power. ‘You can get quite imaginative as to what you might want to do with a technology like this.’ The researchers have filed for a patent on the sensing technology and are now looking into possible applications. Because these devices are so inexpensive and can be read by smartphones, they could be deployed nearly anywhere: indoors to detect explosives and other harmful gases, or outdoors to monitor environmental pollutants. Once an individual phone gathers data, the information could be uploaded to wireless networks and combined with sensor data from other phones, allowing coverage of very large areas. The research was published in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have developed a method to detect hazardous gases and pollutants .

"A study has found that men who regularly do housework, such as cooking and cleaning (stock image), have less sex than men who don’t bother . You may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman. But sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes won’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle-aged women at least. A study has found that men who regularly do housework, such as cooking and cleaning, have less sex than men who don’t bother. Researchers from the Juan March Institute in Madrid studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle-aged US couples over 20 years, including their sex lives and how they divide household chores. The study, which was published in the journal American Sociological Review, found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females. The results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of 'masculine' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn. While egalitarian marriages tended to be happier, men who did ‘feminine’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven. In fact, men who divorced themselves from core chores, had sex one and a half times more a month than those who pulled their weight in the home. Overall, couples had sex once a week. Sabino Kornrich, a sociologist at the university, explained that gender stereotypes may linger in the home and could explain the results. ‘What we do in the house is really strongly tied to how people think of themselves as men or women or as masculine or feminine,’ he told Live Science. He explained that women may see men doing ‘feminine’ jobs as less sexually attractive. Alternatively, couples with similar roles may feel more like siblings than lovers, he added. While egalitarian marriages tended to be happier, men who did ‘feminine’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven. A stock image is pictured . Dr Pepper Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington, who has also written relationship books but was not involved in the study, said: ‘That companionable part of the relationship turns out not to be so sexy.’ She believes that couples who share everything may be such good friends that they don’t need sex to communicate. Constance Gager, a sociologist at Montclair State University in New Jersey cautions that the results may not apply to young couples who grew up in times when gender roles have largely changed. She found the opposite applied – that when tasks are not seen as gender specific, men have more sex when they do more housework and another study has backed up her claims. Men who do more household chores (stock image), are more satisfied in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘manly’ tasks, according to a 2013 study . Men who embrace their 'feminine side' around the house  have more satisfaction in the bedroom than those who stick to ‘manly’ chores like cutting the hedge and mowing the lawn, according to a 2013 study. The quality of the sex they had was superior as well if they were prepared to do their share of cooking and cleaning, the scientists found. The research by Cornell University contradicts the Washington study, but it used data on a similar number of families from 2006, arguably showing that attitudes have changed. Professor Sharon Sassler said that using old data has skewed the Washington results because the couples had married in the 1960s and 70s when things were very different. She said: ‘Couples who shared domestic labour had sex at least as often, and were at least as satisfied with the frequency and quality of their sex, as couples where the woman did the bulk of the housework. ‘In fact, these egalitarian partners were ranked slightly higher in all these categories, reporting more frequent sex and greater satisfaction with the frequency and quality of that sex than conventional couples.’","Researchers from the Juan March Institute in Madrid studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle-aged US couples .

"CIA claims they foiled a terror attack on Heathrow and Canary Wharf using controversial ‘torture’ techniques were rejected by a highly critical US report published today. The American spy agency said it had ‘saved lives’ by thwarting the planned 9/11-style attack on Britain’s busiest airport and business district. But a long-delayed report, published by the Senate’s powerful Intelligence Committee, today roundly rejected claims that ‘enhanced interrogation’ of terror suspects had played any part in stopping attacks. Scroll down for video . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged September 11 mastermind - seen shortly after his capture during a raid in Pakistan - was planning an attack on Heathrow and Canary Wharf . The report revealed CIA 'success stories' including 'dirty bomb' plotter Dhiren Barot (left) and Saajid Badat (right), a co-conspirator of shoe-bomber Richard Reid, were untrue . The report revealed CIA 'success stories' including 'dirty bomb' plotter Dhiren Barot and Saajid Badat, the co-conspirator of shoe-bomber Richard Reid, were untrue. It also detailed the CIA torture techniques used on al-Qaeda suspects - including sleep deprivation for 180 hours in shackled, stress positions and waterboarding to the point of unconsciousness. Its publication today has sparked a furious backlash in the US - with critics claiming it is naive and partisan in its criticism of the previous Bush administration. The report could also fuel anti-Americanism - heightening the threat to the US and other allies including the UK. The CIA immediately hit back at the report, insisting its interrogation programme was 'effective' and helped track down al Qaeda terrorists. Former Vice President Dick Cheney said the techniques used were 'absolutely, totally justified.' The CIA ran a network of secretive prisons around the world where terror suspects were subjected to 'enhanced interrogation techniques' Today's report into torture techniques claimed 'Heathrow Airport and a building in Canary Wharf (pictured)' because they were 'powerful economic symbols' But the report states: ‘The CIA represented that its enhanced interrogation techniques were effective and produced critical, otherwise unavailable intelligence, which thwarted plots and saved lives. ‘Over a period of years, the CIA provided the identification and thwarting of the Heathrow Airport Plot as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. ‘These representations were inaccurate.’ The report insisted that the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plots ‘had not progressed beyond the initial planning stages’ and had already been disrupted. It said 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had planned to attack the UK after his successful attack on New York. The report said: ‘After the September 11, 2001, attacks against the United States, KSM sought to target the United Kingdom using hijacked aircraft and surmised that Heathrow Airport and a building in Canary Wharf, a major business district in London, were powerful economic symbols. ‘The initial plans for al-Qaeda operatives to hijack multiple airplanes departing Heathrow Airport, turn them around, and crash them into the airport itself. ‘Security was assessed to be too tight at Heathrow Airport and the plan was altered to focus on aircrafts departing from mainly Eastern European airports to conduct attacks against Heathrow Airport. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed planned to hijack planes at Heathrow and fly them straight back into the airport . ‘Al-Qaeda was unable to locate pilots to conduct these attacks.’ The report adds: ‘The thwarting of the Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf plotting is one of the eight most frequently cited examples provided by the CIA as evidence for the effectiveness of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques. ‘The CIA further represented that the intelligence acquired from the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was “otherwise unavailable” and “saved lives”.’ The report found that Barot's plot, which included limousines filled with explosives and 'dirty' bombs was actually thwarted after investigations by UK government authorities. It also stated UK investigators, foreign intelligence services, international law enforcement efforts and the US military, rather than enhanced interrogation techniques, brought about the identification and arrest of Badat. The 500-page redacted report, which took years to complete, reveals details of the Central Intelligence Agency's 'Rendition, Detention and Interrogation' program, which President George W. Bush green-lighted after the 9/11 attacks. The report covers the treatment of terror suspects rounded up by U.S. operatives between 2001 and 2009, after the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda which destroyed the World Trade Center in New York and damaged the Pentagon. The report also revealed that the CIA misled the White House about the details and success of the program. President Obama has already admitted that the US ‘tortured some folks’. Since coming to office in 2009, President Obama has sought to distance the US from past deeds and outlawed harsh interrogation techniques which he has denounced as 'torture.' The CIA's defenders insist the methods saved American lives by helping to uncover al-Qaeda's network, while critics say they ran contrary to U.S. values and hardened anti-American attitudes. The CIA - whose headquarters is based in Langley, Virginia - has insisted that its 'enhanced interrogation techniques' saved lives . Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein delivered the damning indictment of CIA interrogation practices after the 9/11 attacks . Former Bush vice president Dick Cheney staunchly defended the interrogation program, telling the New York Times it was 'absolutely, totally justified'. He denied the CIA withheld any information, and emphasized the program had been vetted by the Justice Department. 'As far as I'm concerned, they ought to be decorated, not criticized,' he said of the CIA interrogators. 'When we had that program in place, we kept the country safe from any more mass casualty attacks, which was our objective,' he said. Even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve Bush and his White House of knowledge to the extent of which the CIA allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in Europe and Asia in the wake of 9/11, Bush has openly opposed the release of the document. 'We’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' he told CNN’s Candy Crowley during an interview that aired on Sunday. 'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he continued, calling the CIA operatives and directors about to be chastised 'really good people'. The 6,200-page report was prepared by the US Senate intelligence committee. The investigation began in 2009 and took three years to complete. The full report is 6,200 pages and has 35,000 footnotes. After negotiations over security concerns, this was reduced to 500 pages with redactions .","Spy agency said it had ‘saved lives’ by thwarting planned attack on UK .

"Proving to be masters of disguise, these nocturnal birds hide in walls, trees and stones in a bid to hunt for their breakfast. But a wildlife photographer was able to pick them out with his camera lens as they perched silently waiting for their prey in Chatsworth, Derbyshire. In the selection of obscured images captured by a photographer, known only as Villager Jim, sees the wise creatures use different environments such as a stone wall and a barn doorway to make themselves invisible. Scroll down for video . The nocturnal birds are masters of disguise as they hide in front of trees and walls as they wait for their breakfast. Can you spot the hidden owl in this picture? The owl, circled above, perches on a wall as it blends into the bark of the tree. The images were captured by wildlife photographer Villager Jim in Derbyshire . The 49-year-old said: ‘The owls will camouflage themselves against the stone wall while they sit in wait for their next meal. ‘Generally it will be worms and sometimes small mice, but every now and again they will get a bird too. ‘It’s one of those questions that will never be answered - how do they make themselves the same colour as the stone wall?’ The wildlife photographer, whose work has featured on BBC Countryfile, believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot. The 49-year-old photographer said: ‘The owls will camouflage themselves against the stone wall while they sit in wait for their next meal.' Where is the owl above? Circled, the nocturnal creature sits peacefully on wall while Villager Jim is able to capture these obscure images of the early-morning hunters in Chatsworth . ‘It’s one of those things where you will sit and sit and some people still can’t see it,’ said Villager Jim. ‘The only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette. ‘You have to see them either move or standing close to a light. They just go invisible.’ The wildlife photographer, whose work has featured on BBC Countryfile, believes it is a conundrum not that everyone is able to spot and says its even harder in the flesh . ‘The only real way you will see one in the flesh is when you see them from an angle as a silhouette. You have to see them either move or standing close to a light,' he says . The birds have become accustomed to Villager Jim, who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the shots. He said: ‘They’re getting more used to me now, so they don’t fly away quite as often. ‘They’ve really done well this year. They’ve paired up and bred really well. They’re now growing in numbers.’ The bird's nest location varies based on its habitat, but their homes have been found in holes in trees, rocks, cliffs, river banks, walls and buildings . The birds, which are most active at dusk, have become accustomed to Villager Jim, who sits an waits in the early hours of the morning to get the photographs . Villager Jim has several accolades and appeared in a book portraying the British Wildlife Photography Awards 2013 and has also won the Springwatch competition . His images portray many aspects of the Peak District, including the early-morning owls in Chatsworth, Derbyshire, in this mystical picture series . Three owls sit in a disused barn window in the early hours before hunting for their prey. There is a fourth owl camouflaged in this picture, but can you see it? The fourth owl can be seen perched on the roof of the barn. The birds are farsighted, meaning they are unable to see things close to them very clearly . Some owls can turn their heads as far as 270 degrees and these birds are much quieter in flight than most birds of prey, while hunting for food like other small birds . Another owl sits on top of a stone wall, in the left of the picture. The walls are a prominent feature in the Peak District and are home to a vast array of wildlife . As the sun comes up, an owl peers at the camera lens while it waits patiently for its breakfast. The birds generally eat worms but sometimes they have small mice . Owls cannot move their eyes within their sockets to a great extent, which means they must turn their entire head to see in a different direction .","A wildlife photographer  was able to use his camera lens to pick out these camouflaged night-time birds .

"Police are hoping that the final words said by a 19-year-old woman who was burned alive may lead them to her killer. Jessica Chambers was covered in flames when she was found on a road near to her home in the tiny community of Courtland, Mississippi on Saturday after leaving to get a bite to eat. A passerby called 911 after seeing her car alight and when first responders arrived at the scene and found her covered in flames, she whispered a few words that detectives believe could lead them to her killer, WMC reported.

Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body. Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said she had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Her father also said she had 'a big gash on her head'. 'They squirted lighter fluid down her throat and in her nose, and apparently they knocked her out,' added Mr Chambers, a maintenance worker for the sheriff's department. 'When the fire department got there, she was walking down the road on fire ... only part of her body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.'

"Soaring through the air, a hungry white-tailed kite prepares to snatch a vole from his mother's claws. The incredible mid-air takeaway was captured by Malaysian photographer Phoo Chan on a trip to Gomes Park in Fremont, California.

"Physicist Stephen Hawking arrived united his first wife as they attended the London premiere of his biopic The Theory Of Everything to see themselves portrayed on screen by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. Hawking and Jane Wilde, who divorced in 1995 after 30 years of marriage, have become closer since his 2006 split from his second wife and appeared on friendly terms as they arrived to see the Oscars-tipped film at the Odeon in Leicester Square. They also mingled with Redmayne and Jones, who have been  widely praised for their portrayals of the renowned physicist and his first wife in the tale of their early relationship, Hawking's first steps in his career and his diagnosis with motor neurone disease. Scroll down for video . Poignant: Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones were joined by their real-life counterparts Stephen Hawking and his first wife Jane Wilde at the premiere of his biopic The Theory of Everything in London on Tuesday night . Uncanny: Redmayne and Jones (left) portray the former couple (pictured on their wedding day, right) from  the renowned scientist’s days as a PhD student through to him being honoured by the Queen in 1989 . Praise: Hawking has already lauded the 32-year-old's portrayal of him on the big screen, admitting he kept mistaking Redmayne for himself . The film, which has already been tipped for awards season success, is based on Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen. Largely centred on the former couple's relationship, it covers the period from Hawking's days as a PhD student at Cambridge until 1989 when he was named a Companion of Honour by the Queen. In an especially poignant moment for Redmayne, he was joined by  Hawking in front of photographers as the pair prepared to watch the early years of his life played out on film. Speaking on the blue carpet, the 32-year-old actor admitted that despite having crossed paths with the professor during his own student days at Cambridge, he still felt starstruck at the prospect of playing him. He said: 'I'd been a student at Cambridge and seen Stephen across campus, heard his voice, but I was pretty ignorant so when I read the script, everything was a revelation. 'Stephen and Jane let Felicity and I into their lives, so we felt an enormous amount of responsibility to get it right.' When asked about the possibility that the role will land him a nod at next year's Oscars, the modest star added: 'I try not to listen to buzz because it's a fleeting thing and if you listen to the good stuff you automatically take on the bad stuff, so I try to put my fingers in my ears and just keep putting one foot in front of the other.' Looks like they're old friends: Eddie Redmayne looked thrilled to see Professor Hawking's first wife Jane Wilde . Working closely: Redmayne and Jones were introduced to Hawking and his ex-wife several times before filming took place . Man of the hour: The actor beamed as he stood next to the renowned scientist on the custom-made blue carpet at the London screening . Buzz: Redmayne led the cast at the premiere of the highly-anticipated new movie, which has already been tipped for awards season success . Loving: They may have split in 1995 after 30 years together but Hawking and Wilde have become close  since his divorce from his second wife . Esteemed opinion: Jones has revealed that she was nervous ahead of learning what the genius thought of the film . Inspiration: The Theory Of Everything is adapted from Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, about their 30-year marriage. They have grown closer since his divorce from second wife Elaine Mason in 2006 . Wilde, who was married to the genius from 1965 until 1995, also got to come face-to-face with actress Jones, who plays her on the big screen. Jones, who looked stunning in a  white Dior lampshade-style gown, spoke highly of the woman she plays on the big screen, now a professor of Romance languages, who once famously described physics as her then-husband's 'mistress, his one true love'. She gushed: 'Jane is incredibly open, she showed me photos of her and Stephen when they first met and I really felt I was getting this glimpse into an intimate side of their lives. 'Stephen and Jane have this wonderful unsentimental approach to life and such wit, so wherever we could we wanted to put that into the film.' Hawking first met Wilde, who was a friend of one of his sisters, when he was a graduate student at Cambridge and shortly before he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Portrayal: Jones plays Wilde when she first met Hawking at Cambridge university through to 1989 in the widely-praised project . Warm greetings: Jones appeared delighted to catch up with Wilde and has previously insisted it is 'her film' Troubled: Wilde, now a professor of Romance languages, has famously described physics as her then-husband's 'mistress'. The pair wed in 1965 and divorced 30 years later . The perfect couple: Redmayne and Jones made an attractive pair as they walked the blue carpet in Leicester Square together . Androgynous: Maxine Peake, who plays Hawking's second wife Elaine Mason in the film, was also at the London premiere . Scandal: Hawking married his nurse Mrs Mason in 1995 after leaving Wilde four years earlier. They went on to divorce in 2006 . The couple became engaged in October 1964 and were married the following July, with  Hawking later saying that the engagement had given him 'something to live for'. Their eldest child, Robert, was born in 1967, followed by Lucy in 1970 and Timothy in 1979. As Hawking's condition declined, he began to require crutches to walk and slowly lost the ability to write. He reluctantly started using a wheelchair in the late 1960s and by the late 1970s his speech could only be understood by family members and close friends. During a 1985 visit to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research on the border of France and Switzerland, Hawking contracted pneumonia and was so close to death that  Wilde was asked if his life support should be turned off. She refused and Hawking underwent a tracheotomy which removed what was left of his ability to speak, and left him needing round-the-clock care. One of his nurses was Elaine Mason, played in the film by Maxine Peake, who would go on to become his second wife. Hawking started using a computer programme called the 'Equalizer', which allows phrases, words or letters to be selected from a collection of around 3,000 - a method he still uses to speak today. Dapper: Redmayne looked suave in a blue checked suit, white shirt and black tie as he soaked up the attention . Teamwork: The pair's performance has already sparked an Oscar buzz ahead of next year's Academy Awards ceremony . Vision in white: Jones went for a demure long-sleeved Dior lampshade-style dress in white, which she paired with metallic shoes . Eclectic: The daring choice of dress boasted a quilted effect and embroidered detail on the front of one sleeve . Windswept: Jones's full skirt also looked particularly dramatic when the cool breeze ran through Leicester Square . Say cheese! The pair appeared to be in high spirits as they cosied up on the blue carpet for photographs . The programme used an American accent, and despite the others now available Hawking has said he wants to stick with it as it has become part of his identity. Meanwhile, his marriage to Wilde was under increasing strain and in 1990 Hawking told her he was leaving her for Mrs Mason. They divorced in 1995 and he married the nurse that September. Hawking and Mrs Mason divorced in 2006, after which Hawking's relationship with Ms Wilde, his children and grandchildren improved. The cast were also joined by celebrity guests including Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, who looked demure in a short black dress. Actress Maxine Peake, who plays Mrs Mason in the movie, was also present. Hawking, whose most famous work A Brief History of Time helped change the face of cosmology, has already revealed that he was so impressed by Redmayne's performance that he kept mistaking the actor for himself. Real life couple: Redmayne's beautiful fiancee Hannah Bagshawe supported him at the glitzy event . Joyous: The couple looked loved up as they laughed on the blue carpet. They are preparing to wed in the coming months . Stunning: Redmayne's fiancee Miss Bagshawe supported him at the London premiere of his new movie The Theory Of Everything on Tuesday . He said: 'I thought Eddie Redmayne portrayed me very well. At times I thought he was me. 'I think Eddie’s commitment will have a big emotional impact,' said the physicist, who shed a tear when he first saw the film. Meanwhile, Jones recently revealed that she was taken aback when first meeting twice-married Hawking - because he asked her for a kiss. She told the Daily Telegraph: 'He watched about an hour of filming and Eddie and I were waiting to see what he thought. Then an assistant appeared with a note from Hawking which said: “Would you ask Felicity if she will come and give me a kiss?” 'It showed his rather flirtatious nature and this amazing capacity he has to not take himself too seriously. I loved him. 'It’s so nerve-wracking meeting these people whose lives you are getting so involved with and you don’t want to make a fool of yourself, especially with someone like Stephen who has changed the world in so many ways. Eddie and I just sat there trying to make conversation and not seem like we are total idiots.' Royal seal of approval: Sarah Ferguson was among the well-heeled guests at the glittering premiere . LBD: The Duchess of York showed off her recent weight-loss in a short black dress with sheer detail, and a pair of platform shoes . Marilyn moment: She got a little windswept on the blue carpet as she stood in her elegant ensemble . Burst of colour: Laura Bailey refused to let winter dull her day and went for a multi-coloured pussy-bow dress with scarlet satin heels . Family time: Richard Madeley arrived at the screening with his daughter Chloe . Look a blue: The TV presenter-turned-fitness guru showed off her athletic figure in a navy lace off-the-shoulder number . Gosh, you're so embarrassing! Richard jokingly grimaced as his daughter planted a kiss on his cheek .

"A Maryland woman has delivered a miracle baby after doctors said a rare heart condition she suffers from would prevent her from ever having children. Shanelle Ragin was born with a single ventricle in her heart, which would prevent the organ from pumping blood properly. While surgeons corrected her congenital defect when she was just a day old with a procedure called the Fontan operation, she was left with side effects including difficulty breathing and other concerns that require her to take medication for the rest of her life. Scroll down for video . Miracle: Maryland woman Shanelle Ragin, pictured, has delivered a miracle baby after doctors said a rare heart condition she suffers from would prevent her from ever having children . Heart condition: Ragin, pictured left and right, was born with a single ventricle in her heart, which would prevent the organ from pumping blood properly. Doctors were fearful when she became pregnant . And when she unexpectedly became pregnant, doctors warned her that going through with the pregnancy meant risking death. 'It's one thing for half a heart to function for one individual, but now she's growing a baby inside of her as well,' Dr. Anitha John, a congenital heart defect specialist at Children's National Health System, told NBC News about the miracle. The pregnancy increased the risk that Ragin would suffer heart failure, especially during labor, when stress on the organ is increased, John said. She spent almost nine months on bed rest, all the while being monitored intensely. Still, doctors weren't sure the mother and baby would survive. 'Either one of us dying. That was my biggest fear,' Ragin told the network. Dangerous: The pregnancy increased the risk that Ragin would suffer heart failure, especially during labor, when stress on the organ is increased . Healthy: An expert medical team of about a dozen doctors and nurses at MedStar Washington Hospital Center ensured Shanelle pulled through, delivering a healthy baby called Carter, pictured left and right, two months ago . Bed rest: Shanelle Ragin, pictured left, spent almost nine months on bed rest, all the while being monitored intensely. But Carter was born without issue . But an expert medical team of about a dozen doctors and nurses at MedStar Washington Hospital Center ensured she pulled through, delivering a healthy baby boy called Carter two months ago. 'It was somewhat of a gamble on her part and on our part,' Freiss told NBC. Little Carter weighed just more than five pounds - and he has a perfect little heart. 'I felt really proud of Shanelle,' Freiss said. 'I think in a way, having a baby, a healthy beautiful baby like Carter, is an affirming part that you are a normal woman.' A 2013 study published in the Journal of American College of Cardiology looked at pregnancy after the Fontan operation and found 33 percent of pregnancies were complicated by an adverse maternal cardiac event, including heart failure. This could occur during pregnancy, labor or up to eight months post-delivery.","Maryland woman Shanelle Ragin was born with a single ventricle in her heart .

"A young mother has spoken of her shock at finding a snail in her hospital dinner shortly after giving birth. Angel Crawford, 20, recoiled in horror after spotting the mollusc while eating her mashed potato at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital. The model and musician, who was recovering with new baby Aimee, has vowed never to eat hospital food again. Sick: The snail was found in Ms Crawford's dinner at Aberdeen Maternity Unit after she gave birth . 'At first I didn't even notice it,' she said. 'But then I started eating and after one or two mouthfuls I saw it. 'I stopped and said ""that looks like a snail."" I looked closer and I started repeating ""oh my god, what is that?"" and then Gavin my fiance said ""It's definitely a snail."" 'It was still alive and I just felt totally sick.' Ms Crawford, who was already worried about the quality of hospital food before the incident on November 29, admitted the experience has put her off hospital food for life. She said: 'When you're going through all the emotions after giving birth and then you're worried about your child if she's not doing too well, it's not a good experience to have when you just want to eat.' Ms Crawford, from Aberdeen, Scotland, contacted Richard Carey, the chief executive of NHS Grampian, to complain about the event and she received an apology on Tuesday. Horror: Angel Crawford was shocked to discover a snail in her food at the maternity unit where she gave birth to daughter Aimee . Mr Carey's letter said he was concerned to hear about the 'upsetting experience' and an investigation revealed the snail had found its way onto the plate via a packet of frozen peas. He added: 'These peas have been returned to the supplier for them to conduct their own investigations and respond to NHS Grampian. 'On behalf of NHS Grampian, I offer my sincere apologies for the distress this incident must have caused you and would wish to assure you that this is an isolated incident.' But Ms Crawford has called for the hospital's food standards to improve. She said: 'They said that I could take a tour of their kitchen to try and change my opinion of them but I don't think it's good enough. Chief executive Richard Carey wrote to Ms Crawford who found a snail in her hospital food apologising . The snail made its way onto Ms Crawford's plate via frozen peas served at Aberdeen Maternity Unit (pictured) 'I think they need to look into it and make their standards better, not just the supplier that it went through, but also the NHS, the kitchen and then the people actually handing out the meals. 'It goes through quite a lot of hands and so for it to go unnoticed is shocking. 'I just want to prevent this happening to someone else because it's not really something people should have to go through when they're in hospital.' A spokesman for NHS Grampian added: 'This is a supply chain issue and we have taken the matter up with the company. 'More than 3,000 meals a day are cooked for our hospitals, and all our kitchens are subject to regular environmental health inspections. 'Food is bought under a national contract and in this case the peas are cooked in bulk before being plated. 'We were dismayed to learn of the presence of a foreign body in this meal and will share the outcome of the supplier's investigation with Ms Crawford.'","Angel Crawford was tucking into her dinner at Aberdeen Maternity Unit when she spotted the mollusc .

"If you are an actor or an engineer, you are more likely to be looking for casual sex than a long-term relationship, according to new research published by dating app Clover. The newly-published survey, which polled more than 33,000 of the app’s users, aged between 18 and 60, on their relationship requirements, revealed that the majority of professionals fall into clear career stereotypes when it comes to their sexual desires - and states exactly which industries tend to be focused on friendship and romance, and which are more interested in quick flings and one-night stands. While accountants, psychologists and nurses were deemed to be more likely to seek out long-term relationships, the app claims that actors and engineers aren’t often looking for anything more serious than a brief romantic encounter. Scroll down for video . Looking for love: Nurses (pictured in a stock photo) are seeking a long-term relationship, according to a new survey conducted by the dating app Clover . Other professions in the market for lasting love include pharmacists, designers and programmers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of doctors and lawyers, many of whom have commit to extensive training before even qualifying, included in the survey said they were only looking for friends. The most popular category to span the majority of professions was singles in search of a more casual relationship, with the majority of journalists, police officers, teachers, publicists, scientists, advertising professionals, construction workers and musicians, all falling under that same label. But despite the clear evidence proving that our relationships are influenced by our career choices, Clover CEO Isaac Raichyk told MailOnline that the app's researchers haven't come up with any concrete theories to explain the results. 'But we feel how much free time you have and income might play a role,' he said. 'The fact that a lot of users seem to choose the casual intention might also be a way of playing it safe in order to ensure the best odds of meeting the most people.' Friend zone: Clover's research suggests that doctors and lawyers are looking for something platonic, while actors and engineers are seeking hook-ups . Keeping it casual: A wide range of professionals, including journalists, police officers and teachers, admitted to wanting a low-key relationship . Lasting commitment: Pharmacists, psychologists and accountants were among those in the market for a long-term relationship . A second spokesperson for the app added that Clover's user base is 70per cent male and 30per cent female, and that respondents likely reflect that breakdown, though more specific demographics are unavailable. In an effort to gather more information on whether people's jobs might affect their dating preference, Clover has asked its Twitter followers to share their thoughts. Whitney Leigh Young echoed the poll's findings, tweeting: 'I'm an actor/journalist. And I'm looking for a casual hook-up.' Caitlin Mooney, who identifies herself as a 'writer and quintessential PR girl', meanwhile, noted that she has a boyfriend despite having a job in the 'casual' category, writing: 'Hahah @mikeyryan23 we defied the odds.' Clover, which launched in April, is a location-based dating app similar to Tinder in that users scroll through matches and indicate whether they're interested - but unlike Tinder, it allows users to revisit potential connections at a later time. .","Clover, a new dating app, polled 33,000 users between the ages of 18 and 60 on their relationship intentions .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge flew the flag for the UK today at an event to celebrate British creativity. William and Kate were attending a GREAT reception at NeueHouse, a creative work space in Gramercy, Manhattan, for media types. Wearing a black dress by maternity label Seraphine with a gold hooped Cartier necklace and her hair swept back in a funky pony tail, Kate chatted with guests including actor Sir Patrick Stewart. The list featured a host of representatives from the creative industries including  Glenda Bailey, editor-in-chief of Harper’s Bazaar, Amanda berry, chief executive of Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, media mogul Harvey Weinstein, and his Marchesa designer wife Georgina Chapman, and author Imogen Lloyd-Webber, daughter of the musicals composer Lord Lloyd-Webber. As they mingled, the throng dined on British themed canapes including mini Yorkshire puddings and Scotch egg bites washed down with PG Tips tea and Old Speckled Hen ale. Sir Patrick, accompanied by his wife, Sunny Ozell, said afterwards: 'I have met many members of the Royal family before but what a personable, pleasant and, may I say, attractive couple. 'Prince William told me he had never been to New York before which, I must say, surprised me greatly. I was even more surprised that the Duchess hasn't been. I urged them to come back again incognito. New York is the type of city that turns a blind eye and would allow you to do that. ' Sir Patrick said he had recently taken William's cousin, Princess Eugenie, who is currently working in New York, as his guest to his latest show on Broadway, Waiting for Godot. Scroll down for videos . The Duchess and the Sir: Kate Middleton chats with Sir Patrick Stewart and his wife Sunny Ozell at a luncheon on Tuesday .

The two also took some time to wave and greet fans from their car after they got stuck in traffic on the way out of the venue, something they had been dealing with all day thanks to the torrential downpour happening in New York City. Tuesday morning started off on a somber note for William and Kate as they made a visit to the 9/11 Memorial where they laid white roses and a handwritten note for the victims who lost their life in the tragedy. And though the weather was gloomy, gray and rainy, Kate provided a nice pop of color in a fashionable bright pink jacket from Mulberry. From there the two headed off to watch some young people from CityKids, a group that promotes leadership among inner city youth, perform a dance routine. William lead a standing ovation for the group, while Kate took some time to get in a selfie with some of the members.

Kate, in black skinny J Crew jeans and a Tory Burch coat, and William, in slacks and a casual shirt with his sleeves rolled up, got a chance to chat with Beyonce and Jay Z during the game, and afterwards spend some time with Cleveland Cavaliers player and NBA great LeBron James, who presented the two with cupcakes from his home town of Akron, Ohio, and a Cavaliers jersey for Prince George. James also committed a bit of a royal faux pas when he placed his hand on the small of Kate's back during a photo with the two. Prior to the game The Duke and Duchess met with political royalty, when they attended an event for The Tusk Trust alongside Hillary Clinton and her daughter Chelsea. Hillary and Kate bonded as they talked about children, and how much Hillary used to love to sing to Chelsea, and now her new granddaughter Charlotte.

"Facebook is developing artificial intelligence software to help users decide what they should and shouldn't upload to the social network. The software could even warn users if someone else uploads a snap of them, Facebook has revealed. It hopes the software will 'mediate' users interactions with their friends. Scroll down for video . The software would monitor everything a user uploads - and warn them if it thought they shouldn't upload a certain picture, for instance. Facebook hopes to create a digital assistant that will be able to analyse everything you upload. If it thinks something is embarrassing or even illegal, it will be able to warn users. It will also monitor other uploads, and spot when someone else uploads an embarrassing picture, for instance. 'Imagine that you had an intelligent digital assistant which would mediate your interaction with your friends and also with content on Facebook,' the head of the Facebook AI lab, Yann LeCun, told Wired. His project hopes to analyse everything uploaded to the social network, from video to pictures. 'You need a machine to really understand content and understand people and be able to hold all that data,' he says. 'That is an AI-complete problem.' He also envisions a Facebook that instantly notifies you when someone you don't know posts your photo to the social network without your approval. 'You will have a single point of contact to mediate your interaction but also to protect your private information,' he says. LeCun also revealed this team has discussed the project with Oculus, the Virtual Reality headset firm recently acquired by facebook, and was also thinking about working with robotics fimrs in the future. His team has been working on the project since 2013, when the social networking giant has teamed up with New York University to set up a research lab designed to learn about artificial intelligence. This could include things like ranking (the items in) news feeds, or determining the ads that are shown to users, to be more relevant,' LeCun said when the project was first announced. LeCun also revealed this team has discussed the project with Oculus, the Virtual Reality headset firm recently acquired by facebook, and was also thinking about working with robotics fimrs in the future. 'Then there are things that are less directly connected, like analyzing content, understanding natural language and being able to model users... to allow them to learn new things, entertain them and help them achieve their goals.' LeCun said the new artificial intelligence lab would be the largest research facility of its kind in the world, though he declined to provide numbers. 'We're limited only by how many smart people there are in the world that we can hire,' the French-born mathematician and computer scientist said. The lab is be based in three locations -- New York, London and Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California. LeCun, the founding director of NYU's Center for Data Science, is known for creating an early version of a pattern-recognition algorithm that mimics in part the visual cortex of animals and humans. LeCun's recent research projects include the application of 'deep learning' methods for visual scene understanding, driverless cars and small flying robots, as well as speech recognition, and applications in biology and medicine.","Facebook has spent a year developing the AI assistant .

"A Southwest Airlines flight from San Francisco to Phoenix had to make an emergency landing today after a woman went into a labor and gave birth to a baby just minutes after takeoff. The flight was diverted to Los Angeles International Airport after the heavily pregnant mother began having contractions at 10,000 feet. An emergency room nurse and a doctor who happened to be aboard the flight delivered the child - with the help of a very rattled flight attendant. There were 111 people aboard the plane at the time. A woman gave birth Tuesday aboard a Southwest Airlines flight shortly after it took off from San Francisco. The plane had to be rerouted to make an emergency landing in Los Angeles (stock photo) College football coach Charlie Reeve tweeted about seeing the delivery . A woman says her mother's friend helped deliver the baby - along with a nurse and doctor who happened to be on board . When the plane landed about an hour after it took off, the new mother and her newborn were met on the runway by Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics who rushed them to the hospital, according to KTLA. Mother and baby are said to be doing well. Southwest Airlines Flight 623 left San Francisco International Airport about 6.34am on Tuesday, bound for Phoenix Skyharbor International Airport - a flight of about two hours. Shortly after takeoff, the woman went into labor. The pilot immediately diverted the Boeing 737-700 to Los Angeles. However, before he could land the woman began giving birth. She delivered the baby minutes later with the help of medical professionals who were on board and a flight attendant. The plan landed at LAX about 7.41am. Charlie Reeve, an assistant coach at the University of Texas-San Antonio, tweeted about witnesses the incredible birth. 'So...a lady just delivered a baby mid flight to Phoenix. That was a first for me,' he wrote. A woman who says her mother's friend was working as a flight attendant aboard the plane said: 'My mom is flight attendant and a friend of hers just worked a trip today where she helped a passenger delivered a baby at 10,000 feet.

"This adorable puppy might look like the most chilled canine on the planet as he blissfully settles into bath time, but just two weeks ago he was close to death. The two-week-old was close to death when he was found abandoned in a dumpster with his two sisters - but now it looks like his troubles are a million miles away. They were found by Dallas Animal Service in Texas and referred to the DFW Rescue Me animal shelter where volunteer Claire Fowler was tasked with looking after them. Spa day: The puppy, who does not yet have a name, relaxed in a warm bath in a sink . Rest and recovery: The puppy almost died when he was dumped in a dumpster with his two sisters . The 21-year-old student said: 'When they were found they were covered in fleas and would not have survived without their mother. 'The little guys need round-the-clock care - they can't use the restroom by themselves or even regulate their own body temperature. 'I do everything for them and they need to be fed every couple of hours.' She added: 'I decided to film him in the bath because he was enjoying it so much and I really wanted to capture it. 'He just looked so content. Drying off: The puppy loves bath-time, unlike his sisters, and made sure to dry off in a towel afterwards . Lucky to be alive: The three puppies were thrown in a dumpster but were saved by the Dallas Animal Service . 'His sisters definitely do not enjoy bath time as much as this little guy but it needs to be done. 'Their mother isn't here to keep them clean so I have to do it and then blow dry them - they need constant care and attention.' Because they are so young the puppies are yet to be named. 'We are trying to think of some really strong names for the three of them,' added Claire. 'But they've only just opened their eyes and they do a lot of sleeping. Nap time: The three puppies have been getting plenty of shut eye to recover from the experience . Healthy appetites: The tiny canines are being looked after at the DFW Rescue Me animal shelter in Dallas . 'As they get older we will start to see more of their personalities and will have a better idea of what to call them.' With Christmas soon approaching Claire has some advice for anybody who is thinking of buying a puppy. She said: 'People should be looking to adopt puppies instead of buying them at Christmas time - there are so many puppies in shelters that really need a loving home. 'But that advice should be taken onboard all year round.' Playing coy: The little puppy has been keeping a low profile at the rescue center and getting plenty of sleep . Adopt me: The puppies about being looked after by volunteers but are looking for a new home .","Three puppies were abandoned in a dumpster and left for dead but are now recovering in Dallas .

"A Florida sheriff's department have launched an investigation after a deputy shot and critically injured an unarmed black man - who some witnesses say had his hands up. Cedric Bartee, 28, was rushed to an Orlando hospital in critical but stable condition following the shooting in Orange County early on Monday. The officer, Sergeant Robert McCarthy, has been placed on administrative duty during the investigation, which comes amid weeks of protests across the country against police violence. 'I ask everyone to not rush to judgment and allow the investigation to be completed,' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said at a news conference in Orlando, as he promised transparency. Scroll down for video . Shots: Cedric Bartee, left, was shot once by a police officer on Monday after he and a friend, Henry Chaney, right, were seen in a stolen police car. Chaney surrendered but Bartee would not, police said . Scene: The deputy shot three times at Bartee after the man allegedly kept on moving around inside the vehicle, pictured, which left the officer 'fearful for his life', police said . Deputies had been looking for a stolen car late on Sunday when they saw the empty vehicle - a white Honda Accord - parked outside the Timber Sound Apartments, WESH reported. The officers approached the car, but as they neared it, Bartee and another man, 28-year-old Henry Chaney, claimed in, according to authorities. When police ordered the two men to surrender, Chaney did, but Bartee remained inside the car and moved around, police said. McCarthy, who is white, said he was unable to see his hands and, fearing for his life, he fired three times, hitting the man once. No weapons were found inside the car. Witnesses said that Bartee did have his hands raised. 'They kept telling the boy to put their hands up,' witness Ernest Miles Jr. told WESH. 'Their hands were already up. There was no tint on the car, so you could see in the car and the police just kept saying, ""Put your hands up"". Before you know it, they shot three times in the car.' Questions: But one witness, Ernest Miles Jr., said the man in the car had his hands up when police shot . Probe: Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, pictured, said an investigation is underway and promised transparency in the case. It comes after racially-charged protests broke out across the country . The conflicting accounts are reminiscent of the case of Michael Brown, who was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in August. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old black man had his hands raised at the time, but police and other witnesses have disputed that. Last month, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, sparking massive protests across the Missouri city and the rest of the country. After that decision, another grand jury in Staten Island, New York said that another cop, Daniel Pantaleo, would not be charged in the chokehold death of a black man, Eric Garner, in July. Bartee has been arrested on 45 charges since 1999 but the deputy was not aware of his background at the time of the shooting, Demings said. Chaney has also been arrested 'multiple' times, police said. McCarthy has worked for the Orange County Sheriff's Office since 2007. He has never been involved in a shooting before, the Orlando Sentinel reported. See below for video .","Cedric Bartee, 28, and Henry Chaney, 28, were 'seen in a stolen car on Monday and when police asked them to surrender, only Chaney did'

"Detainee Majid Khan had pureed food rectally infused by CIA operatives while he was held in Kabul, Afghanistan . At least five terrorist detainees were subjected to rectal feeding while being tortured by the CIA, according to the highly controversial Senate report released on Tuesday. Marwan al-Jabbur, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Abu Zubaydah, underwent 'rectal rehydration' while being detained as a method of behavioral control at CIA secret locations and Guantanamo Bay. Detainee Majid Khan was placed in a forward-facing position, with his head lower than torso, and had a pureed lunch of hummus, pasta with sauce and raisins rectally infused. Khan, who joined al Qaeda after graduating from high school outside Baltimore, Maryland, admitted to plotting to blow up gasoline tanks in the U.S. In 2012, Khan struck a plea bargain and is serving 19 years in return for his full cooperation with authorities after pleading guilty to five war crimes, including murder, attempted murder and spying. However sentencing was delayed for four years, and if Khan fails to cooperate, he could receive up to 25 years, The Washington Post reported. He could be released around 2031, if he complies with authorities. He is reportedly still at Guantanamo after being held at a secret 'salt pit' location in Kabul, Afghanistan for several years. Khan has had a number of suicide attempts and incidents of self-harm while being held by CIA, the Senate report stated. The report stated that cables and records indicated that detainees had undergone the rectal methods of torture without it being medically necessary. Suspects Ramzi bin al-Sliibh, Khallad bin Attash and Adnan al-Libi were all threatened with the technique. Rectal feeding is an enema administered with the intent of providing nutrition when normal feeding is not possible. Scroll down for video . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (left) underwent 'rectal rehydration' along with Abu Zubaydah (right) while being held as CIA detainees over terror plots . Part of the redacted report including the gruesome details on the rectal torture of one detainee . It was a common practise in 19th-century medicine but has since been replaced in modern healthcare by tube feeding and intravenous feeding. CIA medical officers sent emails discussing rectal rehydration as a 'safe and effective' method of rectal control. One CIA officer described the process with the words: '[r]egarding the rectal tube, if you place it and open up the IV tubing, the flow will self regulate, sloshing up the large intestines'. He then added: '[w]hat I infer is that you get a tube up as far as you can, then open the IV wide. No need to squeeze the bag - let gravity do the work.' CIA leaders were aware of the excessive force used during two rectal exams on detainees at the detention site named, for the purpose of the report, as COBALT, - but the reports did not appear to be investigated. One of the detainees, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure and symptomaticrectal prolapse. Along with the horrifying details of the rectal probes, the CIA tortured al-Qaeda suspects with waterboarding, threats to harm their children and sexually abuse their mothers, according to the Senate report. One suspect died of hypothermia while naked and chained to a floor at secret locations known as a  'black sites' or the Guantanamo military base in Cuba. One interrogator told another detainee that he would never go to court, 'because we can never let the world know what I have done to you'. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat chair of the intelligence committee which prepared the report, said on Capitol Hill today that the torture was 'a stain on our values and on our history'.

"Pippa Middleton and American reality TV star Kim Kardashian are the proud owners of the most talked-about backsides in the world, and now the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has acknowledged their similarities. Pippa has written an article for the august political weekly The Spectator in which she compares her bottom with that of Kardashian, who posed naked and smeared in baby oil for a magazine. ‘The “Rear of 2014” award undoubtedly goes to Kim Kardashian, after her posterior exploded all over the internet last month,’ concedes Pippa, whose own backside was considered to be the rear of 2011 when she wore a tight-fitting bridesmaid’s dress to the Royal Wedding. Pippa Middleton (left) has conceded that her backside 'is not comparable' to that of Kim Kardashian (right) Pippa (pictured left kissing Nico Jackson) and her bottom became a hot topic in 2011 after the Royal Wedding, while Kim's backside (right) caused a stir when she posed naked and smeared in oil for a magazine . ‘I must say that mine — though it has enjoyed fleeting fame — is not comparable. But the Kim butt story did make me pause. What is it with this American booty culture? It seems to me to be a form of obsession.’ The fetishisation of the bottom has been a defining trait of U.S. pop culture. However Pippa, 31, adds with lofty condescension: ‘Kim’s aim, apparently, was to break the internet, but I’m not sure she’s going the right way about it.’ Kardashian, 34, declared this goal when she published the photographs of her posterior. Writing in Spectator, Pippa says the 'Rear of 2014' award 'undoubtedly goes to Kim Kardashian' (pictured left in February 2014 and right in June 2014) Kardashian, 34 (pictured with husband Kanye West in October) published photographs online of her posterior, intending to 'break the internet' Kim was pictured dressed in a black cocktail dress, balancing a champagne coupe on her derriere, and also posed for a full-frontal nude snap. Pictured: Arriving at a doctor's office yesterday (left) and in Melbourne in October (right) In one shot, the daughter of Robert Kardashian, OJ Simpson’s lawyer during his 1995 murder trial, was pictured dressed in a black cocktail dress, balancing a champagne coupe on her derriere. She also posed for a full-frontal nude snap. It is perhaps no coincidence that Pippa has written the article in the same week that Kate has been making her first official visit to New York with Prince William. Pippa (pictured left walking through Chelsea and right at the French Open in 2011) said her bottom has 'enjoyed fleeting fame' Pippa, 31 (pictured left at a wedding in May 2012 and right during a cycle across America) says the American 'booty culture' seems to be a 'form of obsession' Pippa compared the bottoms in Spectator magazine . Pippa is thought to be planning a TV career in America, with the NBC network reported to be considering hiring her as a correspondent on The Today Show. Last month she was filmed in the Mid-West on a ‘test shoot’, throwing shapes on the dance floor with a succession of male partners. Pippa and Kim have more in common than just their behinds. Both have influential mothers. While Carole Middleton is rumoured to have encouraged Kate to change her course at St Andrews University so that she would meet William, Kim’s mother, Kris Jenner, manages the career of her six children and is the driving force behind their TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Kim shot to fame in 2007 thanks to a sex tape with her former boyfriend Ray J, which has since been watched more than 93 million times online. Pippa, however, eclipses that number given her appearance at the Royal Wedding was seen by an estimated audience of two billion.","Pippa Middleton's backside became the talk of 2011 after Royal Wedding .

"An East Tennessee couple has been sentenced to 35 years in prison each for their role in the death of a 5-year-old girl forced to drink so much grape soda it caused her brain to swell. Randall Lee Vaughn, 41, and Mary Lavonne Vaughn, 58, of Surgoinsville were sentenced Monday in Hawkins County Criminal Court. Randall is the girl's biological father. Randall Lee Vaughn, 41, and Mary Lavonne Vaughn, 58, of Surgoinsville were sentenced to 35 years in prison each for their role in the death of a 5-year-old girl forced to drink so much grape soda it caused her brain to swell . Alexa Linboom was suffering from extreme brain damage when she was brought to an emergency room on January 1, 2012, by her father, Randall Vaughn and her stepmother, Mary . The Tennessean reports that the couple entered a guilty plea to second-degree murder and aggravated child neglect. Alexa Linboom was suffering from extreme brain damage when she was brought to an emergency room on January 1, 2012, by her father, Randall Vaughn and her stepmother, Mary. An investigation found the young girl had been forced to drink the water and soda in one to two hours as punishment after taking one of her stepmother's drinks. The huge intake of fluid caused her brain to swell and herniate, which led to her death on January 3, 2012. Attorney-general Berkeley Bell told the Times News that after allegedly forcing their child to drink an excessive amount of fluid, they failed to seek immediate medical help. The huge intake of fluid caused the girl's brain to swell and herniate, which led to her death on January 3, 2012 . 'Our position is it was a matter of several hours after the child started exhibiting serious symptoms, after the child was screaming out in pain, went into a paralyzed state, and became unconscious [that they sought help,' Bell said. After a two-year investiagtion it was found that Alexa was killed by acute fluid intoxication , which caused hyponatremic encephalopathy. Bell said there was no history of abuse on record at the Vaughan family home, but added: 'They did employ some alternative forms of punishment.' 'Allegedly the child, as a form of punishment, was forced to drink grape drinks, as well as a great deal of water, to the point that her body became water intoxicated,' Bell said. 'That led to her brain swelling and all of her systems shutting down, and to her eventual brain death.'","Randall Lee Vaughn, 41, and Mary Lavonne Vaughn, 58, of Surgoinsville were sentenced Monday in Hawkins County Criminal Court .

"Shot schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai's blood-spattered school uniform is being displayed  for the first time as a startling riposte to extremists around the world. The glass case has been established at the Nobel Peace Centre in the Norwegian capital Oslo, where the schoolgirl will accept the world's most famous peace prize tomorrow. It shows the blue tunic, white headscarf and white trousers, stained brown by dried blood, which the campaigning 15-year-old wore on the day she was shot by the Taliban on her school bus in Pakistan. Scroll down for video . Grim memento: The blood-spattered clothes worn by Malala Yousafzai on the day she was shot by the Taliban two years ago has gone on display for the first time in a glass case at the Nobel Peace Centre in Norway . Proud: The schoolgirl (left), now 17, asked specifically for the bloodstained uniform (right) to be included . Now 17, Malala is set to be handed the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Indian campaigner Kailash Satyarthi, 60, who has fought for 35 years to free thousands of children from virtual slave labour. The pairing of the two prompted hopes that it would help unite India and Pakistan, who have been in conflict for decades. But it was  Malala who dominated headlines due to her already global profile and her youth - becoming the youngest ever Nobel Laureate. Already known as an activist and winner of Pakistan's National Youth Peace Prize, she was on a school bus in October 2012 when it was stopped by a masked Taliban gunman. He asked for her by name and fired four rounds into Malala and her group of friends, two of whom were also injured. Difference: Aged just 15, an injured Malala is moved to an Army hospital for treatment after the shooting . Museum: The uniform is the most high-profile piece in an exhibition about this year's Nobel laureates in Oslo . The bullet which hit Malala in the head went through her neck and lodged in the muscle above her shoulder blade. After the shooting she was moved to Birmingham for extensive surgery and, later, to build a new life, where she has continued campaigning for girls' education. The exibition will last around two months, after which the uniform will be returned to the schoolgirl's family. 'My school uniform is very important to me,' Malala said. 'The day I was attacked I was wearing this uniform. I was fighting for my right to go to school. 'Wearing a uniform made me feel that yes, I am a student. It is an important part of my life. 'Now I want to show it to children, to people all around the world. This is my right, it is the right of every child, to go to school.' Celebration: Malala arrived today and met the chairman of the Nobel Committee Torbjorn Jagland (left) Joint prize: Malala has been awarded the prize alongside campaigner Kailash Satyarthi, 60 (left). He has fought for 35 years to free children from forced labour. He is from India, which has tensions with Pakistan . Bente Erichsen, executive director of the Nobel Peace Centre, added: 'Malala’s blood-stained uniform is a strong and heartbreaking symbol of the forces many girls are fighting for the right to go to school. 'The uniform has been kept by the family since the attempted murder in October 2012, and we are grateful that Malala has chosen to show it to the public in our exhibition.' Malala was honoured by the Nobel committee for the 'struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to an education'. She brought the two friends who were injured alongside her to Oslo so they could witness the Peace Prize ceremony. Shazia Ramazan, now 16, and Kainat Riaz, now 17, hugged their friend and posed for pictures with her today. The trio told reporters they were bound together in what they called 'Mission Malala' - joining with people around the world to make sure young girls have a chance to study. Special guests: Malala (fourth left) invited fellow campaigners (from left) Amina Yusuf from Nigeria, Kainat Soomro from Pakistan, school friend Shazia Ramzan, Syria's Mezon Almellehan and school friend Kainat Riaz . 'When you are educated, you are able to do everything,' Riaz said. 'If you are not educated, you can't do anything.' Both remained in Pakistan immediately after the attack and continued attending school as they recovered, despite being under police guard. They are now studying at UWC Atlantic College near Cardiff, south Wales, and have said they want to become doctors. 'The Malala mission is our mission. She's my friend,' Riaz said. 'And she inspired us. Inshallah, we will always support her.' Malala added: 'Though I will be one girl receiving this award, I know I am not a lone voice. 'These courageous girls are not just my friends, they are now my sisters in our campaign for education for every child.'","Tunic, headscarf and trousers stained brown by blood on show in Oslo .

"The parents of an Ohio teen who died from an overdose of caffeine powder are urging federal regulators to ban sales of the stimulant. Dennis and Katie Stiner, of LaGrange, Ohio, were in Washington on Tuesday on behalf of their 18-year-old son Logan, who was found dead at home in May after ingesting about 23 times the amount of caffeine found in a typical coffee or soda drink. 'Before May 27, 2014, we had never heard of ""caffeine powder."" Now we think about it every day,' the Stiners said in a meeting with lawmakers. Tragic: Popular Keystone High School student Logan Stiner died in May from a caffeine overdose . As little as a single teaspoon of the stimulant can be fatal. The Stiners said the Food and Drug Administration must do more to keep teens and young adults away from pure powdered caffeine, which is marketed as a dietary supplement primarily on the Internet and largely unregulated, unlike caffeine added to soda. Mrs Stiner reported she found caffeine powder bags in the family's home the day Logan died - but that she didn't even know he was using it. However, she said Logan told her he had been taking a 'pre-workout' mix. In July, the FDA cautioned consumers to avoid caffeine powder as it considers possible regulatory action. The powder remains available for sale online even as the agency acknowledges it often lacks adequate warning labels and that people can easily take a lethal amount. The Stiners met with Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and were joined by Jim and Julie Sweatt, the parents of Wade, a 24-year-old Georgia resident who also died after ingesting caffeine powder. 'We must do everything we can to get this product off the market and away from children,' the Stiners said. Brown and Blumenthal pledged to continue pressing the FDA to ban the product and said they will consider legislative action if necessary. 'While the dangers are not broadly understood, powdered caffeine is widely available online or in stores with little warning or guidance. That must stop,' Brown said. 'While it's too late to save Logan and Wade from this dangerous substance, we must act quickly before more lives are lost.' Lethal: A mere 1/16th of a teaspoon of powdered caffeine can be deadly, according to health officials . Popular: Logan Stiner was just days away from graduating from high school when he overdosed on caffeine . Blumenthal called the stimulant a poison. 'There ought to be a great big ""skull and bones"" on it, or it should be banned,' he said. In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said it was continuing its investigation and noted that since its July warning to consumers, some online retailers have discontinued selling caffeine powder. The agency did not indicate how long its review may take or what regulatory action it was considering. Because caffeine powder is sold as a dietary supplement, it's not subject to the same federal regulations as certain caffeinated foods. Users add it to drinks for a pick-me-up before workouts or to control weight gain, but it is almost impossible to measure with common kitchen tools, according to the FDA. A mere 1/16th of a teaspoon can contain about 200 milligrams of caffeine, roughly the equivalent of two large cups of coffee. In the case of Logan Stiner, a wrestler, an autopsy found that he had more than 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood in his system, as much as 23 times the amount found in a typical coffee or soda drink, when he died at his home. Symptoms of caffeine overdose or toxicity include rapid or erratic heartbeat, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea and disorientation. Stiner's parents described the teen, who died days before his high school graduation, as a bright kid who was looking forward to attending the University of Toledo to study chemical engineering. 'It was tragic,' his mother told senators. 'He had a busy week and he thought it wouldn't hurt.'","Dennis and Katie Stiner, of LaGrange, Ohio, met with lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday on behalf of their 18-year-old son Logan .

"Arsene Wenger's decision to name three reserve forwards in the Champions League simply gave his boo boys another reason to hurl abuse. Criticism of the Arsenal manager has reached fever pitch over the last few weeks, but nobody can fault the way he went about his business in Istanbul. Arsenal were truly rampant, and at the heart of it was Lukas Podolski. That the German forward is classed as a back-up is nonsense, and that he might be heading for the exit door at Arsenal is simply ridiculous. He's the best finisher Wenger has at his disposal. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Galatasaray 1-4 Arsenal . Lukas Podolski scored twice on an impressive night for Arsenal in their final Champions League group game . Podolski scored at the start and at the end of Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray to prove his worth at Arsenal . Arsenal had already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League, and so Olivier Giroud, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck were left to watch the game from home. Up stepped Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell, and the aforementioned Podolski with a chance to prove their worth at the highest level. And it didn't take long for the latter to strike gold. Whether he was seeking to impress his current manager or a prospective, future boss is unclear, but Podolski was certainly proving a point. Podolski scored his first goal with his left foot, and his second (pictured) with his right . Arsene Wenger would be making a mistake if he sold Podolski - he's the best finisher Arsenal have . With three minutes gone, the German rifled the ball home to put the Gunners 1-0 up, with the same boot that put Anderlecht to the sword in October. The German has now scored in each of his last four Champions League appearances. On 20 minutes, Podolski struck the bar, and eight minutes later he could have had a hat-trick when Sinan Bolat tipped his powerful shot into the side netting. Campbell and Sanogo came together midway through the first half too, when the former slotted the ball through to his teammate, before the attack was thwarted. Podolski slots the ball past Sinan Bolat (left) to seal Arsenal's impressive night in Istanbul . The Arsenal team - some regular, and some fringe - celebrate after Podolski made it four . In the dying moments, Podolski added to his tally when he drove into the box and slotted calmly past Bolat. Left foot, right foot. All he was missing was a header for the perfect night. Aaron Ramsey took the plaudits on an impressive evening for Arsenal, when he scored a goal that Paul Merson described as 'the best I've seen in all my years.' But Arsenal couldn't have done it without Podolski. Whether he has a future at the Emirates is as yet unclear, but if Wenger makes the decision to oust the forward, there will be a queue snaking around the London Colney car park of managers seeking his signature. Podolski is quite simply a natural-born finisher... and they don't come around all that often.","Arsene Wenger started Lukas Podolski, Joel Campbell and Yaya Sanogo .

"Read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield as the Reds crashed out of the Champions League . Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard pulled no punches as they admitted Liverpool deserve to be out of the Champions League. A dismal return to Europe’s premier competition ended as 10-man Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Basle at Anfield. They secured five points from their six games and are now condemned to the Europa League. Liverpool were poor for most of the game and deservedly trailed to Fabian Frei’s first half goal and their task looked forlorn when Lazar Markovic was sent off before Gerrard set up a grandstand finish with a free-kick. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-1 Basle . Steven Gerrard's free-kick gave Liverpool hope, but they couldn't find a second goal as they were eliminated . Gerrard admitted Liverpool have not been good enough during their Champions League campaign . They would have been fortunate to get through, however, and neither Rodgers or Gerrard were looking to make excuses. ‘The big game was away in Basle where we did not play well (and lost 1-0),’ said Rodgers. ‘We have no complaints. If you deserve to go through, you go through. We have not been good enough to go through. We have to take it on the chin. ‘When you don’t qualify everyone gets looked upon. We wanted to qualify. We have been analysed and for us the solution is we have to do better – manager and players – the expectancy was high but this is a different group of players and squad.’ Brendan Rodgers looks down in the dumps as Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League . Gerrard and Raheem Sterling look dejected after failing to qualify for the knockout stage . Gerrard added: ‘We haven't gone out of the competition because of our performance tonight, we've gone out because away at Basle we weren't good enough, in our last game we conceded a stupid goal towards injury time. ‘You always qualify over the six games and unfortunately we haven't been good enough. We need to get our main striker Daniel Sturridge back and get some more goals in the side. We need to get Mario Balotelli back and firing. ‘That is not to take away anything from the lads who have played tonight and have slogged their guts out. Rickie Lambert has ran himself into the ground tonight, but it has just been a game too far tonight and that has been because of a lack of numbers.’ Substitute Lazar Markovic saw red for aiming a flailing arm at Basle's Behrang Safari . It could be that Liverpool’s best hope of qualifying for the Champions League next season is to win the Europa League. Rodgers has vowed to take the competition seriously. Rodgers, who felt the red card for Markovic was a 'really, really poor' decision, added: ‘We want to do our best in the tournament. It is something we have to fight to do and something we will. ‘Of course it is managing expectation we have been out a long time and came in with a lot excitement and wanted to do well. 'There will be disappointment tonight because we did not qualify but now we have to look to the rest of the season and make it a success and then at the end everyone will look at it and see where it is at.’","Liverpool failed to qualify for the last 16 after being held to draw by Basle .

His tenure has come under intense scrutiny from disgruntled fans over the past few days; the defeat at Stoke on Saturday raising major question marks. Once more, though, he found answers - his side emphatically disposing of a poor Galatasaray side. The match will forever be remembered for Aaron Ramsey's wonder goal.

Player ratings by Sami Mokbel at the Turk Telekom Arena . Wenger may remember it for different reasons, however. When the chips were down, his players weren't. In reality, there was very little at stake for Wenger's side, with their passage into the knockout stages already guaranteed. Nevertheless, the manager will be glowing inside about how his side came through for him in Istanbul. They had two ultra slim hopes of finishing above Borussia Dortmund at the top of Group D going into the encounter. The first was beating Galatasaray and Anderlecht recording a shock win over Jurgen Klopp's men. The other seemed beyond the realms of possibility; Arsenal winning 6-0 and then a draw in Germany would have been suffice. Arsene Wenger played the percentages, leaving 12 first-teamers at home, though most other were injured, so not to risk any further problems going in to the busy festive period. There were rare starts for Lukas Podolski and Joel Campbell, while Mathieu Debuchy made his first appearance in three months since recovering from an ankle injury. The Frenchman's team selection raised a few eyebrows, though. Despite their minimal chances of finishing, another defeat would only serve to fuel the growing feeling amongst some fans that the manager must leave. Any early apprehension faded inside three minutes, though, when Podolski smashed them into an early lead. Ramsey, after an early season blip, is starting to reach last season's heady heights; and he provided further evidence of that as he strode through midfield before playing in Podolski down the left. The German still had plenty to do, but the sheer ferocity in his left-foot effort saw the ball speed past home goalkeeper Sinan Bolat at his near post. Podolski wheeled away like it was nothing. The quality of the finish begged a question, though. With that in the locker why is the World Cup-winner so far down Wenger's forward pecking order? It's a question Podolski, who has openly admitted he could quit Arsenal in search of regular football, wants answering next month. And Podolski once again stated his case for regular first-team football in the 11th minute as he played a key role in Arsenal's second. Under pressure from the Germany international, Tarik Camdal lost possession in midfield; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up the pieces before sliding a ball through to Ramsey who calmly rolled the ball past Bolati. It was the kind of unerring finish that became Ramsey's trademark last season. We've not seen so much of it this term, perhaps a key reason behind Arsenal's troubles.

The criticism levelled at the Wales midfielder is that he's been trying too hard to replicate the goalscoring exploits of last season; something that has been noted by Wenger. It seems, however, Ramsey is finally finding his touch; what was to happen later was testament to that. Podolski was in no mood to share the limelight, though, as he set about making a statement to his manager. From a similar position to where he open the scoring, Podolski hit the crossbar in the 20th minute, before hitting the side from an identical location a few minutes later. But Podolski could only applaud what happened next though as Ramsey had the home supporters clapping in admiration with a truly breathtaking strike. There seemed no danger when Joel Campbell's corner was half-cleared to Ramsey 35 yards out. However, after a quick touch to control, he unleashed an unstoppable half-volley that flew past Bolat and into the top right-hand corner. But for a small section of a few hundred travelling fans, the Turk Telecom Arena fell silent as they tried to comprehend exactly what had just happened. And, finally, as the realisation dawned on them an echo of applause rippled around the stadium. Suddenly the 6-0 scenario that had been dismissed before kick-off didn't seem so far fetched.

With their side unable to qualify for the knockout stages, the Turk Telekom Arena was largely empty . Had Campbell and Calum Chambers converted excellent chances before the break then it would certainly have been on the agenda. But Arsenal's momentum slowed when Wenger brought off Ramsey - due to a hamstring issue - and Mathieu Flamini in place of two youngsters: Gedion Zelalem and Ainsley Maitland-Niles at half-time. Even that decision looked the right one as news of Borussia Dortmund taking the lead against Anderlecht filtered through. The second half, compared to the first was a none event; Wesley Sneijder scoring a brilliant 88th minute consolation free-kick before Podolski added Arsenal's fourth with the final kick of the game.

"In the end, Gary Neville’s joke about the Dog & Duck turned out to be an insult to the Dog & Duck. The plan was to keep Fabian Frei, Marco Streller and Taulant Xhaka quiet for just long enough to give Liverpool a chance to progress into the last 16 of the Champions League. The reality is that this team cannot keep a clean sheet when it really matters. Matchday six, at Anfield, was win or bust. The lights are out on Liverpool’s Champions League dream and it will take a special person to solve the problems in this defence. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-1 Basle . Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson combine to block Marco Streller's goalbound shot . Dejan Lovren (centre) looks shocked as Lazar Markovic (right) is shown the red card . Skrtel attempts to stop Shkelzen Gashi's shot during a torrid night for Liverpool's rearguard . Liverpool have now gone seven Champions League games without keeping a clean sheet. That’s their longest run in the competition since November 2008. Basel scored here at Anfield because you always knew that they were going to score. Liverpool conceded in all six group games: ‘We just weren’t good enough,’ admitted Brendan Rodgers. In the aftermath, their gutsy second half performance is worth recording, but the brutal truth is that this team was pretty much done when Fabian Frei scored a beaut in the 25th minute. Rodgers admitted it was time to go back to basic when they conceded three at Crystal Palace on November 23. After this it is very much back to the beginning. Simon Mignolet? Timid. Glen Johnson? Wasteful. Martin Srktel? Chaotic. Dejan Lovren? Apprehensive. Jose Enrique? Forget it. If this is what £64million gets you these days then let’s hope Liverpool have kept the receipt. They are damaged, possibly beyond repair. Where is the guidance? Who is marking who? Who is the leader in that back line? No-one can really say for sure. Simon Mignolet was once again shaky between the sticks, but clings on under pressure . Jose Enrique desperately clears his lines under pressure from Derlis Gonzalez . Brendan Rodgers looks glum on the sidelines as Liverpool fall at the first Champions League hurdle . Steven Gerrard trudges off at half-time with Liverpool a goal down and staring down the barrel . Liverpool are out because in six group games - home and away against Real Madrid, Ludogorets and Basel - there isn’t a single player in their defence taking responsibility for marking and positioning when they are in or out of possession. ‘We have to be better, it’s simple,’ added Rodgers. Amazingly, when they were forced to play three at the back after the dismissal of substitute Lazar Markovic, there was a smidgen of improvement. The confidence has been drained from this Liverpool team and it has come to the stage where their credibility as top class players is being tested to the limit. Anfield is no place to hide. They have witnessed some of the great defenders over the years, from Alan Hansen, Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson, Ron Yeats to Jamie Carragher, walk through the Shankly Gates. The current group, including substitute Alberto Moreno, do not belong in that category. Using the surprise absence of Kolo Toure, a Champions League finalist with Arsenal in 2006, as a reason for Liverpool’s exit is stretching the imagination a little bit too far. Emlyn Hughes salutes the Kop after Liverpool reach the 1978 European Cup final . Alan Hansen tackles Norman Whiteside of Manchester United during 1983's Milk Cup final win . The warning signs were there when Liverpool conceded 51 times on the way to finishing second in the Barclays Premier League last season. Part of the answer was to spend £24m on Lovren and the poor fella has been an unmitigated disaster since his move from Southampton. To think Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho once paid £20m for Ricardo Carvalho a few weeks after Porto won the Champions League in 2004. For that they got the finished article. Lovren was booked, inevitably, in the second half when he shoved  Xhaka in the back just as the Basle winger was combing through Liverpool’s midfield. His first half performance was just as baffling and heaven knows what he was thinking in the opening minute when he demanded the ball from his keeper on the edge of the area. He’s not good enough for that. Over the next four days this Liverpool defence will need to address some fairly serious issues before they head on to their next fixture at Old Trafford against the Red Lion. As for the rest, it’s just pub talk.","When they needed composure, Liverpool's defence set a nervy tone .

"Louis van Gaal has baulked at suggestions Manchester United must bolster their defence in the January transfer window. Manager Van Gaal claimed United have 'more than enough' defensive cover and quality, despite Chris Smalling's groin problem further stretching resources. Robin van Persie's double sneaked United past Southampton 2-1 at St Mary's on Monday but they struggled tactically and defensively. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (left) was taken off injured against Southampton on Monday . Paddy McNair (right) was substituted late in the first half after a disappointing performance at St Mary's . Luke Shaw, Rafael and Phil Jones are out injured, as is Daley Blind, who could slot in as an emergency centre half. Van Gaal shrugged off criticism of his defensive stocks after switching England midfielder Michael Carrick into a makeshift defensive role midway through Monday's clash. 'When you have injuries you cannot solve the problem otherwise,' said Van Gaal. 'Do we have to buy players? No. We have more than enough.' Van Gaal's terse defence of his squad depth did little to mask United's continued rearguard shortcomings. Van Persie converted United's only two chances on the south coast as Van Gaal's men moved third in the Premier League with a fifth-straight win. Southampton pressed continually, pulling Van Gaal's systems and structures apart almost at will, though too often failing to deliver the killer blow. United boss Louis van Gaal believes he does not need to strengthen his defence in January . Fit-again Jonny Evans (right) replaced the injured Smalling during the opening period against Saints . Marouane Fellaini's inept performance forced Van Gaal to haul youngster Paddy McNair off before half-time, in the hope Ander Herrera could add midfield bite. That led to Carrick's rearguard shift, with fit-again Jonny Evans replacing Smalling after his groin injury. United are still missing Luke Shaw, Rafael, Phil Jones and Daley Blind, and that injured defensive quartet formed the foundation of Van Gaal's justification of his squad depth. United host Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday, with former defender Gary Neville predicting the clash could descend into pub-league standard. England coach Neville claimed United 'got away with murder' at St Mary's, before tipping the Liverpool clash to resemble 'The Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion'. The unimpressed Van Gaal warned Neville to 'pay attention to his words', asking reporters to interpret his comments however they saw fit. Midfielder Michael Carrick (right) dropped into United's defence after Van Gaal brought off McNair . Neville later denied talk of a rift with Van Gaal when asked about a 'feud' on social media.

'At the end of the day it was the result which counted,' Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said. 'That was our first aim of the season, to get through the group, and that's never easy. 'We fought well in the first half and then in the second we tried to score but without risking anything. But we're through to the last 16. Now we'll wait for the draw and focus on the league. Juve showed it can have a great Champions League campaign.' Atletico, were content to soak up the pressure and hit Juventus on the counter, had the best of the chances and also hit the post. 'We are happy. This is the second year in a row we are in the Champions League and for the second year in a row we go through as group winner,' Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. 'The first half was very intense, with more chances for us. Then in the second half it was a tighter game, we were waiting for the opportunity to counter attack. 'I am very happy with the work of my lads. The whole squad played well in both games against Juventus.' Olympiakos finished third in Group A, a point behind Juventus, with a 4-2 win over Malmo. Juventus were unbeaten in their previous nine European home matches but Atletico, last season's runners-up, had won five of its past six Champions League away fixtures. Claudio Marchisio was a late injury absentee, with the Juventus midfielder suffering from flu. Juventus started brightly and had a chance to take the lead after just two minutes when Carlos Tevez was brought down just outside the area. There was an expectant hush as Andrea Pirlo stepped up but he drove his effort into the wall. Shortly afterwards, Juventus almost gifted Atletico a goal but Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon pulled off a save to deny Koke after a flurry of defensive errors had seen the ball arrive with the Atletico midfielder, rushing unmarked into the box. Fernando Llorente just failed to get on the end of a tantalising Paul Pogba ball into the box and Juventus also had a strong penalty appeal turned down in the 19th minute when Tevez's shot crashed off Diego Godin's arm from point-blank range.

Buffon was again called into action at the end of the first half, diving smartly to his left to parry Mario Suarez's stinging effort. Atletico went close again minutes after the restart when Gabi's corner cracked off the outside of the near post.

"Arsenal swooped to ban the use of an anti-Arsene Wenger banner ahead of their clash against Galatasaray. The Gunners manager has been under huge pressure of late after a difficult start to the season. And supporters intent on making their feelings clear towards the Frenchman in Istanbul were told by Arsenal officials not to display the banner in the Turk Telecom Arena so not contravene stadium protocol.

Another Arsenal fan was seen demanding Wenger leaves the club during the match against West Brom . Wenger looks dejected as Arsenal came unstuck away at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday . The club were adamant the banner had not been confiscated. 'Wenger Out' banners have become a regular occurrence at Arsenal matches of late as ill-feeling towards the manager escalates. The Frenchman was heavily criticised by disgruntled Gunners fans, who want Wenger to leave the club, following Saturday's disappointing loss against Stoke City. Internet footage of furious Arsenal fans volleying a torrent of verbal abuse at Wenger as his side boarded a train back to London following their 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium went viral over the weekend. It has also been claimed fights erupted between pro and anti-Wenger fans on Saturday as tensions flared over the club's poor start. But on Monday, Wenger hit back at fans who gave him a tongue-lashing on Saturday, claiming he is man enough to take it. When asked if such abuse was wearing him down, the Gunners manager defiantly responded: 'No, not at all. We have to cope with that.'

"Mario Balotelli has been made Liverpool's featured player for January in their official 2015 calendar – saving them any embarrassment if he doesn't stay at Anfield for the rest of the year. The release of the club's official calendar could provide important clues into how Liverpool see the squad developing in the next 12 months. Each month is accompanied by a large picture of a particular player and nobody wants Liverpool fans to turn over to a new month later in the year to see a player no longer with them. Steven Gerrard, who is out of contract at the end of the season and hasn't decided whether he wants to stay, is featured as the main picture for March when he certainly will still be with his hometown club. Mario Balotelli (left) takes over January on Liverpool's 2015 calendar while Steven Gerrard is given March .

March – Steven Gerrard . April – Mamadou Sakho . May – Martin Skrtel . June – Philippe Coutinho . July – Jordan Henderson . HERE TO STAY . August – Dejan Lovren . September – Daniel Sturridge . October – Raheem Sterling . November – Alberto Moreno . December – Rickie Lambert . But, significantly, Raheem Sterling is held back until October. The 20-year-old has been linked to other clubs including Real Madrid following a blistering start to the season but he is tied down to a long-term contract at Anfield and his position in the calendar suggests the club will play hardball over his future in the summer and keep him, as they did when Arsenal bid for Luis Suarez in 2013. Balotelli, 24, has endured a torrid time on Merseyside since a much-hyped £16million move from AC Milan in August. He has yet to score a Premier League goal for his new club and is currently facing FA charges in connection with a social media post that allegedly contained racist and anti-semitic content, something the player strongly denies. Given the paucity of striking resources at Liverpool, manager Brendan Rodgers is prepared to give the Italian another chance when he returns from a groin injury and re-evaluate his future in the summer. But the reality is if Liverpool unexpectedly receive an offer in January that allows them to recoup their outlay, they would listen carefully.

Liverpool, Premier League runners-up last season, are currently in ninth position and need to beat Basle on Tuesday night to stay in the Champions League. The recent malaise at Anfield is underlined by the fact that three of the six players on the cover of the calendar – Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Sterling – are in contract talks, Balotelli's woes are well-documented and Daniel Sturridge has hardly played this season because of injury. The sixth player featured is Philippe Coutinho.","Mario Balotelli is the January player on Liverpool's 2015 calendar .

"Former Manchester United assistant boss Mike Phelan has blamed Louis van Gaal’s fitness regime for the catalogue of injuries at Old Trafford after Chris Smalling became the club’s 43rd casualty of the season. It is also the third time that Smalling has been sidelined since Van Gaal’s arrival last summer after he limped out of Monday’s win at Southampton with a groin strain. The England defender will be assessed further on Wednesday but is rated extremely doubtful for Sunday’s game at home to Liverpool. United are currently also without summer signings Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw, while Rafael and Phil Jones have just returned to training. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling (left) was taken off injured against Southampton on Monday . Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan has blamed fitness changes for the injury crisis . Phelan, who spent 12 years working alongside Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, believes that Van Gaal’s decision to bring in his own fitness specialist Jos van Dijk to oversee first-team training at the start of the season and give Tony Strudwick a broader role has led to the injury pile-up with so many players ‘breaking down’. ‘What’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time, so you have to look to the reasons why,’ said Phelan, who is now first-team coach at Norwich City. ‘I think Manchester United changed their thoughts on the fitness regime. They looked at it a little bit differently. ‘Tony Strudwick, who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first-team. He understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit, how to keep them ready for competition. United boss Louis van Gaal believes he does not need to strengthen his defence in January despite injuries . ‘Then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different. That may have had an effect. That one area has changed. ‘They’ve brought in new people with a different way of doing things. The intensity of training may be one thing – it may be too intense, or not intense enough – but obviously slight changes have been made with the present way of doing things. ‘I would have thought the squad is big enough at Manchester United, because they can go out and get players in, but obviously they keep breaking down and they don’t seem to be getting any better. They seem to get one back and lose another two.’ Phelan (left) enjoyed a trophy-laden spell as United assistant manager under Sir Alex Ferguson . Smalling went off after just 18 minutes at St Mary’s with what Van Gaal later said was a ‘suspected muscle tear’. The problem is understood to be in the player’s groin and he is set to go undergo further tests. The 25-year-old has already been sidelined for two months of the season after suffering a groin strain at Sunderland in August and then picking up a thigh injury in training in September just one game into his comeback. Smalling missed another match through suspension after collecting what Van Gaal called a ‘stupid’ red card in the Manchester derby. Robin van Persie, with Juan Mata (left) and Marouane Fellaini (right) celebrates their 2-1 win at Southampton . Smalling has already missed two months of this season through injuries and suspension . His future at United has been the subject of some speculation with Arsenal continuing to show an interest. However, United are unlikely to let any players leave – particularly centre-backs – while they continue to be plagued by injuries, and Van Gaal has ruled out trying to solve the problem by simply buying more players in the January transfer window. ‘When you have injuries you cannot solve the problem otherwise,’ said the United boss. ‘Do we have to buy players? No, we have more than enough.’ Head here to Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Aaron Ramsey's second goal against Galatasaray was so good it had one former player saying it was unlike anything he'd seen in his entire career. As the Turkish defenders headed an Arsenal corner clear in the first half, the Welshman ran to hit the ball, with his left foot on the half-volley. The ball flew in to the top corner from almost 30 yards out and pandemonium ensued, except, that is, among the home fans. VIDEO Scroll down fro Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Galatasaray 1-4 Arsenal .

Speaking to Sky Sports, he said: 'It's up there (with my best). I like the Norwich goal (better).' On reflection, though, Ramsey appeared to have changed his mind. He wrote on his Instagram account: 'Finished the group on a high, now can't wait for the draw.

"Languishing near the bottom of the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund are looking for something to spark their season into life. But perhaps Jurgen Klopp would be happier with a new signing who could offer a bit more on the pitch than the man his club have offered a job. The Champions League side took to Facebook to try and entice Robbie Williams to join them, after the pop star claimed he was looking for work in Germany. Jurgen Klopp's team have been struggling in the Bundesliga, but is Robbie Williams the answer? Robbie Williams says he is looking to move away from the pop star lifestyle and is looking for work in Germany . Williams claimed he was 'getting a little bit bored of the pop star/rock star thing' and wanted a 'proper job'. The former Take That star said he 'thought about soccer in Germany, and then I thought no, I'm too old,' before considering fashion or working with cars. And Dortmund stepped in to offer him all three, posting a picture of the Westfalenstadion underneath his video, and promising a relationship with Puma and Opel. Borussia Dortmund posted on the pop star's facebook with the offer of the Westfalenstadion as an office . 'Robbie Williams, to be honest: We got all of it!' the club wrote. 'If you don't want to play it yourself, at least you're able to watch some intense football in the most beautiful stadium of the world. 'On the fashion side, we got some nice PUMA jerseys (they come in various sizes) and, since you're obviously into it, some lovely Opel cars.

When I wrote in this column recently that Manchester United are on the brink of something very special under Louis van Gaal, I didn't expect it to happen this season. But right now they look like they're the only team capable of catching the top two and that means they are in the title race. Not many would have thought that possible after the 5-3 defeat at Leicester. But as I said after that game, United were brilliant going forward, and crumbled after a shocking refereeing decision gave Leicester a way back into the game.

Dutchman Van Persie pops up at the back post to convert Wayne Rooney's free-kick for his second goal . Van Persie raises his arm in celebration after giving United a 1-0 lead on the south coast . That experience built character. As Ronald Koeman pointed out after the final whistle, United handled mistakes and setbacks better than Southampton did on Monday night. United were atrocious at times, they could barely pass the ball to each other and yet they won the game. Their strengths are in their finishers – Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie don't need many chances - and that worked in United's favour at St Mary's. There were only three attempts on goal from United – the lowest in the Premier League this season. And the lowest number created by a United side in a game for 11 years. But they took two of them. That is impressive, and it gave them three points. With Sergio Aguero out injured for a while, Manchester City will need to answer questions. Chelsea need to show they can recover from a setback and respond positively. United's main strength is their finishers like Van Persie, pictured here scoring his first goal past Fraser Forster . Manchester City will need to cope without star striker Sergio Aguero after he was injured against Everton .

United's injury list could ease significantly soon – Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind in particular could make a difference. They are also set to spend another small fortune in January, which should improve them. Manchester United are not playing well, they are nowhere near their peak performance and yet they are third in the table, having won five games in succession, and having only lost once – to the champions – in 10 games, since that defeat to at Leicester. There are three men who I believe are chiefly responsible for United being in the title race. Van Gaal (left) admitted that Ronald Koeman's side were the better team on a chilly night at St Mary's . 1) Louis van Gaal . He's a class act, and he's always ready to make difficult decisions when necessary – like taking Paddy McNair off in the first half at Southampton when he lacked confidence and was making too many mistakes. That was bold and brave but it worked for United. At the same time it sent a message to the rest of the United players that they need to be totally on top of their game. Van Gaal needed to make the change, but he taught the United squad a lesson at the same time. United boss Louis van Gaal has inspired his team to five successive victories in the Premier League . 2) Wayne Rooney . A captain, a leader, and a man ready to do whatever it takes to get United back to where they were before Sir Alex Ferguson retired. He is proving himself to be a worthy talisman for club and country and it's clear the rest of the players respect him. His tireless running with the ball as the Saints game drew to a close took the pressure off United at the back and gave them an outlet in the opposition half. United captain Wayne Rooney has played a pivotal role for Van Gaal's side so far this season . 3) Michael Carrick . His calm and composure have been crucial during this winning run. Since he returned to the side he has relaxed everyone around him. He will always accept the ball, always be available and he never hides. That is exactly what an under-pressure defence needs. Carrick is a team-mate who will always help you out. Louis van Gaal must be so relieved to have him fit and in the side. The added bonus is that the manager knows he can also trust Carrick at centre-half. Michael Carrick (left) has brought a calming presence to United's midfield since returning from injury . Can Manchester United win the title? I wouldn't put money on it. But it would be the most impressive turn around in Premier League history if they did. To even be talking about United as title contenders shows what an amazing job Van Gaal has done already. While some are busy trying to convince themselves the loan deal for Radamel Falcao was a terrible error from Manchester United, Van Gaal has led them up to third in the table.

"Aaron Ramsey scored a stunning brace against Galatasaray as Arsenal ran out comfortable winners in Istanbul. Lukas Podolski also scored two as the Gunners won away from home in their final Champions League group game for the first time since 1999. Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. ARSENAL . Wojciech Szczesny 6 . The goalkeeper didn't have too much to do but came out for a cross which he missed, showing there was a little bit of rust present. Relatively composed on his return though.

Mathieu Debuchy 8 (Stefan O'Connor 77mins) Played excellently on his return to the starting line-up after three months out.

Put the weekend's horror show at the Britannia Stadium behind him. Composed in possession and won a few nice balls in the air so Arsenal could build from the back. Also made a crucial last-ditch block midway through the second half to keep Galatasaray out. Calum Chambers 7 . There will be far harder tests to come for Chambers if he is to play centre back regularly because he was barely tested by Yilmaz or Bulut until the 55th minute. The Gunners goalkeeper congratulates the former Cardiff City midfielder . Hector Bellerin 7 . Assured on the ball and calm for someone with so little first-team experience. You can see from his ability to fly forward why Arsene Wenger rates him so highly. Aaron Ramsey 9 (Maitland-Niles 46) Back to his best before being subbed to protect him at half-time. His first goal was a lovely placed finish across the keeper but his second was out of this world. Surely the best strike in the Champions League this season. Honestly, you must see this goal - Ramsey barely swings his left foot at it but he arrows a volley straight into the top left-hand corner. Magic. Mathieu Flamini 6 (Zelalem 45) Sometimes struggled to contain the industrious Wesley Sneijder but overall shielded his back four well. Will want a few more games as easy as this. Made way at half-time after getting booked. Arsenal's players react to the Welshman's brilliant volley to take the score to 3-0 in Istanbul . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain 9 . If Ramsey hadn't scored twice, Oxlade-Chamberlain would undoubtedly be man of the match. Everything he did was positive, particularly in the first half, and he drove Arsenal forward. Need to see more performances like the first 45 minutes though. Joel Campbell 7 . Will be a bit frustrated he didn't mark his starting appearance with a goal and looked a bit rusty. Caused a lot of problems down the right though. Lukas Podolski 8 . When he starts he tends to score. The German has a thunderbolt of a right foot and he used it to set the Gunners on their way after only three minutes and added another late on. Frustrates at times, but his finishing ability is without question. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had a good game and kept up his record of playing in every match this seasson . Yaya Sanogo 6 . Did not take his opportunity on this occasion. Caused a few problems but was the poorest of Arsenal's attacking trio. Still extremely raw and does not always hold the ball up well enough. SUBSTITUTES . Ainsley Maitland-Niles (replaced Ramsey 46) 6 - Unfortunately for Maitland-Niles Arsenal's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half. He still looked extremely confident for one so young though, and gave a couple of really nice through balls. Made one very important clearance too. Gedion Zelalem (replaced Flamini 45) 7 - Looks composed on the ball and can slot into the team nicely. Will not have been introduced into a game where there was so little to do before, mind. Young full back Hector Bellerin showed plenty of promise in the Champions League clash . Stefan O'Connor (replaced Debuchy 77) 6 - Very little time to make much of an impact but looked composed for the small period he was on the field.

"Cristiano Ronaldo surpassed former Real Madrid team-mate Raul's Champions League goalscoring total by claiming his 72nd in the competition to close in on record-holder Lionel Messi. The Portuguese superstar cut the gap on rival Messi to just two goals before Gareth Bale doubled Real Madrid's lead in the 38th minute when his headed effort flew past keeper Vladislav Stoyanov. Substitutes Alvaro Arbeloa and Alvaro Medran scored late on to pile misery on Ludogorets, who were down to 10 men after just 19 minutes.

Subs not used: Aleksandrov, Zlatinski, Borjan, Younes . Sent off: Marcelinho 19 . Referee: Clement Turpin (France) Attendance: 58,393 . The European champions dominated possession throughout the early exchanges but their opening goal came from the penalty spot after Marcelinho used his hand to stop a goalbound effort by Raphael Varane. Marcelinho was subsequently shown a red card by French referee Clement Turpin before Ronaldo converted the resulting penalty. Ludogorets were made to pay for Marcelinho's misdemeanour as Bale was allowed to leap above the Bulgarian outfit's defence to score his eighth goal of the season. The Welshman's effort nestled into the back of the net after hitting the underside of the crossbar shortly before the interval. Both Javier Hernandez and Bale had chances to add to Real Madrid's lead but their attempts at goal were easily saved by Stoyanov. Jese was handed the opportunity to make his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu since rupturing his cruciate ligament during a Champions League match against Schalke back in March. Substitute Arbeloa scored his first goal of the season in the 79th minute when his low drive crossed the line despite the best efforts of Stoyanov. Spanish starlet Medran, who replaced an injured Bale in the 83rd minute, netted his first Champions League goal with two minutes left on the clock when his effort was deflected into the net. Bale was forced off after sustaining a bloody nose during the final stages of the encounter when Georgi Terziev's hand caught him in the face. The win ensures Real Madrid ended the group stages with maximum points having beaten Basle, Liverpool and Ludogorets at the Santiago Bernabeu and away from home. They also won all six Champions League group games under Jose Mourinho in 2011-12, a feat previously achieved by four other clubs - AC Milan in 1992-93, Paris St Germain in 1994-95, Spartak Moscow in 1995-96 and Barcelona in 2002-03. Carlo Ancelotti's side also set a Spanish record having won their last 19 games since losing to rivals Atletico Madrid on September 13. Brazilian side Coritiba hold the overall record for most consecutive wins in all competitions, according to Guinness World Records. The South Americans won 24 straight games between February and May 2011 spread between the Paranaense state championship and the Brazilian Cup. Ludogorets, on the other hand, were beaten to a spot in the Europa League by Liverpool. Ancelotti said after the impressive win: 'I have an extraordinary group (of players) and I never tire of saying it. 'I could not imagine winning 19 games in a row after the defeat to Atletico.

"Vogue has unveiled the original casting Polaroids of three Victoria's Secret models, taken when they first tried to appear within the pages of the popular fashion magazine. In honor of this year's Victoria's Secret fashion show, which took place in London on December 2 and will be broadcast tonight on CBS, the magazine dug into its archives to reveal images of models Doutzen Kroes, Behati Prinsloo and Sigrid Agren, all of whom appeared on this year's catwalk. Taken between 2003 and 2007 and showcased on Vogue.com, the three Polaroids show each of the girls looking incredibly fresh-faced, wearing minimal make-up while modeling a plain black top or t-shirt. Scroll down for video . Supermodel in the making: Dutch model Doutzen Kroes, now 29, revealed that her agent said the appointment at Vogue would 'make or break' her career . Catwalk queen: Earlier this month, the model appeared in her eighth consecutive Victoria's Secret fashion show . The images clearly contrast to the three models seen strutting down the runway at this year's Victoria's Secret show, showcasing the brand's most extravagant and ornate underwear styles, while wearing an impressive array of angel wings, feather boas and sky-high heels. Speaking to Vogue.com about her first casting with the magazine at the age of 18, Dutch model Doutzen, now 29, recalled how nervous she was during the first meeting. 'It was hot and humid and I was sweating like crazy!' she said of the image, which was taken on August 28, 2003. 'I remember being thankful that the sweat stains weren’t visible. '... I remember my agent being very clear that I needed to be on time and that this appointment was either going to make or break me. I kept thinking, “Great! No pressure!”' Fresh-faced and carefree: Behati Prinsloo attended her first casting for Vogue at the very start of her career when she was just 16 years old . Ruling the runway: Now 25, the model has walked for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada . It seems she had nothing to be nervous about however. In the 11 years since the Polaroid was taken, the mother-of-two has gone on to appear in the last eight Victoria's Secret fashion shows and in May 2007 even appeared on the cover of American Vogue, on which she was hailed by the publication as one of the 'World’s Next Top Models'. Fellow Angel Behati Prinsloo has had a similarly illustrious career which has seen her model for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada, as well as appearing on the cover of Vogue. But when the 25-year-old, who  married  Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine earlier this year, first entered the hallowed halls of Vogue's headquarters in New York for her casting, she admits she was more than a little nervous about the experience. 'It was awesome - I just remember my agent making a big deal about it. I was kind of fresh, not knowing a lot about fashion,' the Namibian-born model said of her Polaroid, which she believes was taken 'about ten years ago' when she was around the age of 16. 'But with Vogue being such a big part of that world, when I found out I was going to the casting, I was obviously very nervous.' The baby of the bunch: Sigrid Agren, who made her debut in the Victoria's Secret fashion show last year, moved from Martinique to New York in 2007 when she was 16 . She's an angel: The 23-year-old, pictured at this year's Victoria's Secret show, put her career on hold in order to finish her education, before returning to work as a full-time model in late 2007 . The youngest Angel to feature in Vogue.com's Polaroid line-up is French-Swedish model Sigrid Agren, who attended her first casting with the publication in December 2007 at the age of 16. 'Being from Martinique, [moving to New York] was a big thing; it’s like going from a small city to the biggest one,' Sigrid, now 23, said of her casting. 'Then you’re told you have to go to a meeting for Vogue! I was very shy when I just started, I was just happy to be there and it was kind of unreal and surreal.' The fresh-faced model, who put her modeling career on hold in order to finish her schooling, which she did in 2007, shortly before her Vogue Polaroid was taken, made her debut as a Victoria's Secret Angel last year and has also walked for a number of high-end brands such as Calvin Klein, Yves Saint Laurent, Karl Lagerfeld and Louis Vuitton.","Doutzen Kroes, Behati Prinsloo, and Sigrid Agren all attended castings for the fashion magazine at the start of their respective careers .

"A mountain-sized asteroid which passes  Earth every three years has been discovered by a Russian scientist. Vladimir Lipunov, a professor at Moscow State University, said the space rock, named '2014 UR116', poses no immediate threat - although warned it could 'theoretically' hit Earth.. However, he said it highlights the damage an asteroid could cause - in this case an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus-sized meteor in Russia. Scroll down for video . Although the space rock, named '2014 UR116', poses no immediate threat.However, he said it highlights the damage an asteroid could cause - in this case an explosion 1,000 times greater than the surprise 2013 impact of a bus-sized meteor in Russia . Earlier this year the privately-funded B612 Foundation discovered that Earth is up to 10 times more likely than thought to be hit than previously thought. While the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the danger was still ever present. The findings were based on information released from the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation. This operates a network of sensors that monitor Earth around the clock listening for the infrasound signatures of nuclear detonations. But what these sensors found were not nuclear explosions, but rather asteroid impacts on a huge scale. Between 2000 and 2013 the network detected 26 explosions on Earth ranging in energy from one to 600 kilotons - all caused by asteroid impacts. At 400-metres (1,300 feet) in size, the space rock is about the same size as the Empire State Building is tall. Proffesor Lipunov said it is difficult to calculate the orbit of big rocks like '2014 UR116' because their trajectories are constantly being changed by the gravitational pull of other planets . 'We need to permanently track this asteroid, because even a small mistake in calculations could have serious consequences,' he said. Of 100,000 near-Earth objects which can cross our planet's orbit and are large enough to be dangerous, only about 11,000 have so far been tracked and cataloged. 'The exact path of the asteroid until 2014 UR116 is impossible to determine, but in theory it can collide with the Earth, and Mars and Venus,' the University said. However, Nasa said the discovery posed no risk. 'Some recent press reports have suggested that an asteroid designated 2014 UR116, found on October 27, 2014, at the MASTER-II observatory in Kislovodsk, Russia, represents an impact threat to the Earth,' it said. 'While this approximately 400-meter sized asteroid has a three year orbital period around the sun and returns to the Earth's neighborhood periodically, it does not represent a threat because its orbital path does not pass sufficiently close to the Earth's orbit.' Tim Spahr, Director of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge Massachusetts, has also re-computed this object's orbit after noticing that it was the same as an object observed six years ago. Using both sets of observations, the future motion of this asteroid was carried further forward in time using the automatic computations made by the Sentry system at Nasa's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. These computations rule out this object as an impact threat to Earth (or any other planet) for at least the next 150 years. Last week astronomers and rockstars alike are joined forces to warn the world of the threat posed to the planet by asteroids. More than 100 leading scientists and astronauts from Dr Brian May to Chris Hadfield have signed a declaration asking for increased action to tackle objects that could end life on Earth. And in an event scheduled for 30 June 2015, a Live Aid-style concert may be used to drum up support and tell the world just how much danger we are in - unless urgent measures are taken. At 400-metres (1,300 feet) in size, the space rock is about the same size as the Empire State Building is tall, shown here towering above the New York skyline . More than 1,600 people were injured by the shock wave from the explosion of the Chelyabinsk meteorite (trail shown) in February 2013, estimated to be as strong as 20 Hiroshima atomic bombs. It highlighted the threat Earth faces from incoming asteroids . Known as Asteroid Awareness Day, this global event is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of the Tunguska event in Siberia in 1908. This was the largest asteroid to impact Earth in recent history, and devastated an area about the size of a major metropolitan region - 800 square miles (2,000 square km). Live concerts, community events, lectures and other educational programmes are planned to call for the increased detection and mapping of asteroids. The signatories of the 100x Asteroid Declaration say that available technology should be employed to detect, track and defend Earth from asteroid impacts. They include British Astronomer Royal Lord Martin Rees, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and TV presenter Brian Cox. The experts are calling for a 100-fold increase in the detection and monitoring of so-called near Earth objects (NEOs). It is estimated that of the million or so asteroids that could cause major damage on Earth, we are aware of only about 10,000 - or one per cent. This means that at any moment an asteroid could enter the atmosphere and cause widespread destruction, without any prior knowledge. The possibility of this scenario has been repeatedly hinted at recently by meteorites and fireballs spotted in the sky. Most notably, in February 2013 more than 1,600 people were injured when a meteor exploded near the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia, the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century. The signatories of the 100x Asteroid Declaration say that available technology should be employed to detect, track and defend Earth from asteroid impacts. They include British Astronomer Royal Lord Martin Rees, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and TV presenter Brian Cox (pictured) 'The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it becomes that the human race has been living on borrowed time,' Dr Brian May said in a statement. 'We are currently aware of less than one per cent of objects comparable to the one that impacted at Tunguska, and nobody knows when the next big one will hit. 'It takes just one.' Events, to be organised by individuals and independent organisations around the world on 30 June, will lead discussions on solutions to protect all of humanity from future asteroid impacts. 'We have the technology to deflect dangerous asteroids through kinetic impactors and gravity tractors, but only if we have years of advance warning of their trajectories,' stated former Shuttle astronaut Dr Ed Lu. 'Now we need the resolve to go forward. It is the only natural disaster we know how to prevent.' Other experts pointed to the need to find hazardous asteroids through an accelerated search programme in order to prevent them causing destructive impacts on Earth. At the moment Nasa has a number of ground-based telescopes to detect objects that could cause widespread destruction, but experts have called for this to be significantly improved - including an infrared telescope between Earth and Venus to track incoming asteroids.","Mountain-sized asteroid passes Earth every three years .

"Stuart Lancaster is convinced Semesa Rokoduguni will cope with the searing pressure of an England debut against the All Blacks — aided by the perspective gained from his active service in Afghanistan. The national coach yesterday confirmed that Bath’s Fijian-born wing — a Lance Corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards — would line up on the right flank opposite New Zealand’s try-scoring phenomenon, Julian Savea. The collision between the tank-driving soldier and a fellow power-runner of Polynesian descent, known as the ‘Bus’, will provide a focal point at Twickenham on Saturday as England start their QBE autumn series against the world champions. Semesa Rokoduguni fires out a pass during England training at Pennyhill Park in Bagshot on Thursday . Rokoduguni will line up against powerful All Black winger Julian Savea at Twickenham on Saturday . The Fijian-born winger's aerial skills will certainly be tested by All Blacks fly-half Aaron Cruden . Such exalted visitors and a high-stakes occasion in front of a full house of 82,000 at HQ make for a daunting prospect for a newcomer, but Lancaster understandably believes the only uncapped player in his starting XV will handle a situation far removed from the life-and-death danger he faced on a tour of duty in Helmand Province. ‘He’s probably one of the least nervous players in the squad,’ said Lancaster. ‘In training we put the players under a lot of pressure, in various scenarios. I haven’t seen him make an error. 'The different experiences he has had — not just within rugby but outside the game — have given him that confidence to be ready for a game like this. You never really find out until you put them in the front line, but he’s got the necessary experience.’ Rokoduguni is a a Lance Corporal in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and has served in Afghanistan . Rokoduguni's performances for the Army on the Sevens circuit caught the eye of Bath coach Mike Ford . The front line is familiar territory for Rokoduguni, 27. The military life was a family tradition which he embraced from the age of 19 until, as he put it, ‘rugby started popping up’ — first with the Army, then with Bath and now with the country he has made his home and for which he has fought. Soon after being deployed to Afghanistan, a colleague on patrol stepped on a landmine and lost both legs. That memory stays with him and has spurred him on to chase his ambitions with gusto. ‘Every single time I join the camp, here or at Bath, I always think about this stuff — going back three or four years when that incident happened and that marine soldier was badly injured,’ he said. ‘It gives me a boost to make the most of every opportunity because you don’t know what’s going to happen next. It could be you. There could be a serious injury on the rugby field. You have to give everything you’ve got.’ Rokoduguni (left), in action against Toulouse in October, has been in superb form for Bath this season . Despite the vast contrasts between his burgeoning rugby career and the military one which has been placed on hold, Rokoduguni actually accentuates the similarities. He argues that both occupations require diligence, precision and a band-of-brothers commitment to teamwork and supporting mates alongside. It’s just that the consequences of mistakes vary wildly. Looking ahead to his Test debut, he said: ‘It is similar to the pressure I felt out there in Afghanistan, especially in the field. Out there in Afghanistan you had to be spot on with your drills, be punctual, dress correctly and be disciplined. You had to be alert every single moment. ‘That sort of mentality fits in well on the rugby pitch. You need all those key points out there on the field. The only difference is that here, there is always a next time. Next week you can come back stronger and better. Out in Afghanistan you have to be on top of your drills every single time because if you mess up that can cost someone their life.’ At this time of year, it was especially poignant to see a soldier wearing a poppy and reflecting on the prospect of national service of a different kind. Rokoduguni appreciates the significance of the timing, while the country has been marking the centenary of the start of World War One. Rokoduguni poses for a portrait in his England shirt on Thursday as he gets ready to earn his first Test cap . ‘It’s a massive thing, especially on Remembrance weekend,’ he said. ‘It’s not just representing England, my family and Bath; it’s representing the whole Armed Forces in Afghanistan, back in their units. I’m representing every single one of them.’ On a lighter note, the messages Rokoduguni has received have contained a few digs from Army colleagues whose hearts lie north of the border. ‘Some of the lads have said, ‘You deserve it, you’ve done well’,’ he said. ‘But my unit is a Scots unit, so some of my Army team-mates are saying, ‘Why are you playing for them? You should be playing for Scotland!’ England are glad to have him, in a rejigged back line. As expected, Kyle Eastmond’s scorching form for Bath earned him another shot at inside centre. He will form a midfield alliance with Brad Barritt, who has been recalled, according to Lancaster, to provide balance as a carrier who can get over the gainline and off-load. The head coach insisted that the untried 10-12-13 axis of Owen Farrell, Eastmond and Barritt has shown great cohesion in training. What the hosts can’t match is the All Blacks’ unrivalled experience. England’s line-up is far more youthful, as Lancaster jokingly acknowledged, saying: ‘We were watching a game the other day, I think it was from 2003 — before the World Cup and Richie McCaw was playing in it. Dan Carter was on the bench.

"With Arsenal's passage to the knockout phase of the Champions League already assured, Arsene Wenger has named six rising stars from the club's academy in his squad for Tuesday night's match with Galatasaray in Istanbul. Ahead of the match, we run the rule over the half-dozen hoping to make an impression out in Turkey. Chuba Akpom (19, striker, English) Akpom is probably the best known of the six, with Wenger commenting in Monday's press conference that the striker is 'close to the first team.' The 19-year-old, who comes from Newham, has already had plenty of exposure to the first-team picture, making his Premier League debut from the bench in a 3-1 win at Sunderland back in September 2013. Chuba Akpom celebrates completing his hat-trick in Arsenal Under 21s win at Brighton last week . Akpom takes on the Monaco defence during last summer's Emirates Cup tournament . He also played in the Gunners' League Cup win over West Bromwich last season and was named on the bench for further Premier League games at home to Liverpool and West Ham, as well as the Wembley FA Cup semi-final with Wigan. He spent time on loan at Brentford and Coventry City to gain experience last season and has been in fine form for Arsenal's Under 21s this campaign, scoring nine times. Akpom has represented England at every level from Under 16 to Under 20 and has been a reliable goalscorer at each age group. Gedion Zelalem (17, midfielder, German) Berlin-born teenager Zelalem was signed by Arsenal in the summer of 2013 after impressing scout Daniel Karbassiyoon while playing for American side Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match. He almost immediately progressed from the Under 16s to the Under 21s and in July 2013 accompanied the first-team squad on their Asian tour. Gedion Zelalem weaves his way through the Borussia Dortmund defence during a UEFA Youth League game . Zelalem is greeted by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during a training session this week . Though his selection came as a surprise to many, Zelalem seized his chance and his style even drew favourable comparisons in some quarters to Cesc Fabregas. He was expected to make his Premier League debut in the early portion of the 2013-14 campaign but injury held up his progress. In the end, he made his competitive debut in an FA Cup tie with Coventry City on January 24, replacing Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with 19 minutes to play. Though no additional first-team appearances were forthcoming, Zelalem is a regular in the Under 21 team and also the Under 19 side that plays in the UEFA Youth League. Zelalem has so far represented the country of his birth, Germany, to Under 17 standard. Ainsley Maitland-Niles (17, winger, English) Rapid winger Maitland-Niles was named on the bench for Arsenal's defeat at Stoke at the weekend and is now set for his first European trip with the senior team. The youngster started last season with the Under 18s but it quickly became apparent that he was more than competent at a higher standard with his pace and crossing ability. Ainsley Maitland-Niles takes on Anderlecht player Samy Bourard during a UEFA Youth League encounter . Flying winger Maitland-Niles tries to get the better of the Brighton defence in last week's match . He made 14 appearances in the Under 21 Premier League and was pretty much an ever-present in Arsenal's run to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Youth League. Maitland-Niles was also influential in Arsenal's run to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup, where they were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea. He has cemented his place in the Under 21 side this season, swapping between right wing and central midfield positions, and has also represented England at Under 18 level for the first time. Stefan O'Connor (17, defender, English) Commanding centre-half O'Connor has established himself in Arsenal's Under 21 side despite only being 17 years of age. He has always been ahead of the curve in that regard but has really pushed on in the last 18 months, establishing himself as a regular in the Under 21 team and the UEFA Youth League side. O'Connor scored his first goal at Under 21 level in a 4-3 win over Manchester City back in April. He has also been capped for England at Under 17 standard, playing in two matches against Belgium at St George's Park back in January. Stefan O'Connor holds off the challenge of Blackburn's Dean Rittenberg during an U21 Premier League game . O'Connor is tackled by Aston Villa's Courtney Wilden during an U21 Premier League match at Villa Park . Alex Iwobi (18, winger, born in Nigeria and plays for England) Born in Lagos, Iwobi is the nephew of national hero Jay-Jay Okocha and has been with Arsenal since the age of eight. The 18-year-old is equally adept playing on the left flank or in central midfield in support of the striker. His only involvement with the first team to date came when he was included in the squad for last season's Capital One Cup tie at West Brom, though he didn't make it off the bench. Last season saw Iwobi make regular appearances for the Under 21s and he also featured in the UEFA Youth League and FA Youth Cup, where he scored goals against Torquay United and Charlton Athletic. Having signed his first professional contract at the club, Iwobi is expected to kick on and reach greater heights. He has played for England up to Under 18 standard. Alex Iwobi chases the ball during Arsenal's UEFA Youth League game with Borussia Dortmund last month . Iwobi (left) celebrates with goalscorer Akpom during Arsenal's U21 win at Brighton . Iwobi is the nephew of Nigerian legend Jay Jay Okocha, seen here during his Bolton days . Glen Kamara (19, defensive midfield, Finnish) Kamara combines style and substance in the defensive midfield position and this will be his first taste of first-team involvement. Born in Tampere, Finland, Kamara joined Arsenal from Southend United in 2012, quickly establishing himself as a regular in all the youth competitions. This includes the Under 21 Premier League, where he made 12 appearances last season, and the UEFA Youth League, where he played in every game except the quarter-final with Barcelona. A Finland Under 21 international, Kamara has cemented his place in Steve Gatting's Under 21 team this year.

A SWAT team was forced to knock down the door of the apartment and, once inside, found a back bedroom door closed. When they sought to go into the room, they heard two more gunshots, police said.

"Michael Carrick is someone who refuses to waste, declines any sort of 50/50 and, ultimately, is the man to make Manchester United tick. A midfielder whose influence has been overlooked time and again has proven since his return what Louis van Gaal had been missing. It is no coincidence that United have won all five of their Premier League games since the 33-year-old regained his fitness and place in the starting XI. Because, when you look at the difficulties they previously endured, this is a season which threatened to peter out before it had even begun. Michael Carrick has vastly improved Manchester United's midfield since returning from injury . Carrick's inclusion in the United midfield since the start of November has yielded five straight wins . Louis van Gaal slaps the hand of Carrick after United's 2-1 win away at Southampton on Monday . Gone are the sights of United surrendering possession in the middle of the park, incapable of building any sort of momentum and failing to provide Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie with any sort of consistent service. And while nowhere near their best at Southampton on Monday night, the Red Devils are a side reborn with Carrick beating the drum. Since his first game of the season on November 5, United are on average: . The influence of Carrick cannot be understated and is finally yielding the recognition it deserves. ‘It might look like a really simple thing but Michael Carrick is a very good passer of the ball forwards,’ Gary Neville said on Monday Night Football. ‘People probably didn’t like it a few weeks ago when I was a little critical of Daley Blind but United have missed this – the passes around the corner and the difference this makes in setting up an attack is incredible.’ Opta stats showing the influence of Carrick since his return to the side at the beginning of November .

"Two bar workers have been fined for serving alcohol to a drunk footballer who could hardly stand up and was later found dead on the South Australian hotel premises. In the four-and-a-half hours Jason Short is shown on the pub's CCTV footage, he sways, staggers, dances in a 'disinhibited manner', is barely able to stand, and sits on a bench 'essentially comatose', a magistrate has found. Mr Short, who played for a local B-grade football team, was found dead in a bedroom at the Kingston Crown Inn Hotel, about 300km southeast of Adelaide, after drinking heavily on April 30, 2011. Alison Louise Selleck leaves the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Thursday after being fined $500 . The former barmaid was found guilty of serving alcohol to Jason Short, an obviously drunk SA footballer . Last month, Magistrate Paul Foley found Alison Louise Selleck, 21, Tom Gardner, 32, and Firstlite Pty Ltd, the holder of the hotel's licence, guilty of supplying liquor to Mr Short when he was a noticeably alcohol-impaired person. On Thursday, he imposed a $500 fine on Selleck, who is now studying law, but did not record a conviction, noting she was 18 at the time and is well-regarded in the community. He fined Gardner $9000 and Firstlite $6000, recording convictions against both. He said Gardner, a shareholder and director of Firstlite, had been 'the driving force behind the hotel' for some years and was heavily involved in the community, particularly with sporting groups. Mr Short was later found dead at the Kingston Crown Inn Hotel, about 300 km southeast of Adelaide . 'Mr Gardner, your role in what happened was quite different to Ms Selleck,' Mr Foley said. 'You were the person with specific responsibility of ensuring compliance with the Liquor Licence Act.' Since the death, the hotel had increased its training of staff and employed more workers in busy times. A doctor could not determine the cause of Mr Short's death, but said it may have flowed from his high concentration of alcohol combined with the medication he was taking for mental health issues.","B-grade footballer Jason Short died after drinking heavily on April 30 2011 .

"Breel Embolo will be the centre of attention at Anfield on Tuesday night should Basle decide to throw him in against Liverpool. The 17-year-old Cameroon-born forward has taken time off school to be with the Swiss side for their Champions League decider and more than 20 scouts are expected to be in attendance to see how he and his team-mates fare. Manchester United, City, Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid have already been alerted to the teenager's potential while Borussia Dortmund and Wolfsburg have watched him since he was 13. VIDEO Scroll down for Breel Embolo scores a stunning hat-trick for Basle vs Winterhur . Breel Embolo trains on the pitch at Anfield ahead  of Basle's crucial Champions League clash . The Cameroon-born forward has taken time off school to play for the Swiss side in the Champions League . Born on Valentine’s Day 1997, Embolo has quickly materialised as the object of affection for many a Basle fan. 'I love everything about him,' says coach Paulo Sousa. An exciting prospect who can play in attack or midfield, he is blessed with pace, power and skill. Sousa has already trusted him to lead the attack against Real Madrid and he caused consternation for Raphael Varane and Sergio Ramos. He started against Liverpool in Basle's 1-0 victory in Switzerland and became the sixth youngest scorer in Champions League history when he registered in the 4-0 win over Ludogorets last month. Although he was born in Cameroon, Embolo moved to Switzerland when he was six. He has been on Basle’s books for four years since joining from neighbouring Old Boys. Embolo started in the home game against Liverpool, which Basle won 1-0, and is in line to play again . The 17-year-old has been involved in all five of Basle's Champions League group games so far . He made his senior debut in March as a substitute in the Europa League match with Red Bull Salzburg and scored his first senior goal in his next game, a 5-0 defeat of Aarau. This season he has six goals in 16 games all scored with a range of skills exhibiting ingenuity, deftness and opportunism. Basle know they have an asset on their hands. How long they keep him will be determined by who wants to pay the asking price. Those who ask have been told it will take £7m to £10m to prise away the livewire teenager who is now a Swiss U21 star. It is not just Europe's super powers who are watching though. Everton have been told of his prowess by Samuel Eto'o, while Tottenham, Newcastle, Southampton will all be represented at Anfield. Embolo celebrates scoring against Ludogorets, one of his six goals in 16 appearances this season . Basle's young star goes down under a Ludogorets challenge during his side's 4-0 win in Switzerland . In their favour, if they can pay the money, is the greater opportunity to make their first team. That will be instrumental should Embolo choose England. A lesson is in progress with Mohamed Salah at Chelsea.

"Raul has been unveiled as a New York Cosmos player at a press conference on Tuesday. The Real Madrid legend, who scored 323 goals in 741 matches for Real Madrid, will make his bow in the North American Soccer league at the start of the 2015 season. The 37-year-old Spaniard has signed a multi-year contract, and will also serve as a technical director for the club's new academy, which is due to open next year. Raul was unveiled as a New York Cosmos player on Tuesday at a press conference at the Four Seasons hotel . Raul was pictured with head coach Giovanni Savarese (left) and chairman Seamus O'Brien (right) The trio were in good spirits as they spoke to the press ahead of the start of the 2015 season . The Cosmos play in the league below Major League Soccer, and Raul admitted upon signing that he was excited about the prospect of playing for the club and develop their academy. 'Everyone throughout the soccer world knows the Cosmos name and the legacy of the players that played for the team previously,' he told the club's website. Born: June 27 1977 (age 37) 1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls) 2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28) 2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11) 1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) 'They helped establish soccer in America and I'm honoured to follow in their footsteps. I believe in this club's vision and I'm excited to be a part of that.' 'I have a contract for two years. I will try to play those two years, but it might be one, maybe two, maybe even three years, Raul added. 'If the body says this is it in six months, I will be more involved in the academy. I moved here with something in mind – bringing my family to enjoy New York, which is one of the best cities in the world, and I’m committed to that. There are no limits and no deadlines. I will hopefully play for many, many, many years.' The Cosmos made their name in the original version of the North American Soccer League when the likes of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto signed up to play in the fledgling league. Pele now serves as the honorary president of the current Cosmos, a club reborn in 2010 with the intention of securing a place in Major League Soccer. However, in one of the most recent rounds of MLS expansion they were trumped by the newly formed New York City FC - a team backed by Manchester City and the New York Yankees that is due to begin play next year with another Spanish striker, David Villa, spearheading their attack. Raul won six league titles, three European Cups and scored the most Champions League goals for Real Madrid . Raul (right) appeared in good spirits as he looked at his name and number on the back of a shirt . Raul, celebrating scoring at the 2006 World Cup, played 102 times for his country over a 10 year spell . Brazil legend Pele spent two seasons at the New York Cosmos before retiring from playing in 1977 . PELE 1975-77 (56 apps, 31 gls) Brazil legend Pele played out the twilight of his career at the Cosmos. Following 18 sublime years at Santos, Pele headed to New York for two seasons, winning the 1977 NASL title. His number 10 jersey has since been retired by the club. FRANZ BECKENBAUER 1977-80 and 1983 (132, 21) Beckenbauer headed to New York Cosmos after a glittering career at Bayern Munich and West Germany. Having accumulated four Bundesliga titles and three European Cups, alongside winning the 1974 World Cup, Beckenbauer enjoyed two successful spells in the NASL with the Cosmos before retiring in 1983. GIORGIO CHINAGLIA 1976-83 (213, 193) The Italian forward actually started his career in Swansea before making his name in Serie A. His goal scoring exploits guided Lazio to the Serie title in 1974 before Chinaglia headed to New York. The striker scored for fun with the Cosmos and fired them to four NASL titles, prompting his number nine shirt to be retired when he left the club in 1983. But that has not dented the ambitions of the Cosmos owners, as the addition of Raul is intended to demonstrate. 'We're obviously thrilled to add a player of his quality to the team,' head coach Giovanni Savarese said. 'Raul's skill and ability is world renowned. He's a world-class player and he adds a whole new dimension to our attack. 'He also brings immense passion and knowledge that he can share with our team and with the next generation of Cosmos players in our youth academy. He'll help set the academy training curriculum, structure and establish our player development pyramid. 'His involvement from the beginning is that he will be helping the director, which we are going to add to our staff. The director will be full time, but Raul will be advising this director about building the curriculum, building the structure, and building the entire academy for us. We want to make sure that it is uniform, from the top to the bottom.' Raul's deal with the Cosmos allows for him to take over the running of the club's academy after his retirement from playing. Raul spent 16 years with Real Madrid, winning six La Liga titles, four Spanish Super Cups, and three Champions League crowns before moving on to Schalke and most recently Al-Sadd Sports Club. He remains the all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 71 goals. The long term likes with Madrid meant that even not even Raul could refuse an opportunity to return to Real should an opportunity arise. 'My plan is to build an academy, and work on this project with the Cosmos,' Raul said. 'It won’t take six months for this kind of big project, but I’m committed to being here with the Cosmos now. If I return to Spain at any given time, for obvious reasons it would probably be with Real Madrid. 'Whatever I’m doing here now with the Cosmos would be a great experience to go and apply with Real Madrid, or anywhere else. This is a great project that I’m embracing very much.' Cosmos chief operating officer Erik Stover said: 'Raul's long list of accolades speaks for itself. He's recognized worldwide as one of the greatest players of his generation and we are now thrilled to welcome him to New York.' The 37-year-old has had a trophy laden career, including three Champions League titles with Real Madrid .

"Alex Hales will be dropped by England for the must-win fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka as Alastair Cook returns as captain  following his one-match over-rate ban. With James Taylor a shoo-in after his sparkling 90 at in Colombo two days ago, England will omit Hales, whose two games so far have produced 27, 0 and a dropped catch – to say nothing of his part in the run-out of Moeen Ali in Hambantota. Another option would have been to rest Joe Root for the match in the picturesque hill-country of Pallekele  – so allowing him extra time to practise the ukulele he now carries around with him on tour. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Joe Root show off his skill on the ukulele . England captain Alastair Cook playfully grabs the shirt of bowling coach David Saker . The two grapple in the heat of Pallekele - but wear a smile as they go at it during a light-hearted session . Alex Hales is set to be the man to miss out after scoring 27 and 0 in his two innings . But, unlike Hales, Root is regarded as a certainty for the starting XI at the World Cup, and will be given as much match practice as possible here. Among the bowlers, the disappointing Ben Stokes will be fortunate to squeeze out off-spinner James Tredwell for a third successive match. If Tredwell’s omission in Colombo over the weekend suggested England had got into a muddle over their priorities, then they have no option here. It’s win or bust as England have to take three victories from the final three matches to clinch an improbable 4-3 triumph. Root, who played a vital part in England’s lone win in Hambantota last week but has otherwise failed to build on a couple of promising starts, had no hesitation in toeing the party line. Joe Root, walking off the ground after nets, said England weren't bothered by Senanayake's return . Root and James Taylor play-fight during the practice session at the Pallekele ground . ‘There’s no reason why we can’t,’ he said. ‘I think we showed in every game at some point that we’re capable of doing that. 'Now we have to put it into one complete performance. Even the game we did win we weren’t at our best, which is promising. ‘But we don’t want to talk about being promising all the time. Now is the time for us to step up and start putting in performances. 'This is a great opportunity for us to do it under pressure before a World Cup.’ The tour has taken an unexpected twist with the news that Sachithra Senanayake, the off-spinner who was banned for chucking in July, could make a dramatic return in Wednesday’s fifth one-day international. Cook (centre left) and Ravi Bopara (centre right) jump over Jos Buttler during a warm-up exercise . Buttler dives acrobatically as he tries to stop the ball in the field during training . Senanayake – who also caused a stir in the summer with the Mankadding of Jos Buttler – has been cleared by the ICC to resume his career after reportedly removing the kink in his action. The spinner had originally been pencilled in to make his return during Saturday’s sixth match here, but a hamstring injury to left-arm spinner Rangana Herath at Tuesday’s practice session could speed up his inclusion. For a bowler whose basic off-break was being delivered with 40 degrees of elbow flex – 25 more than the legal limit – it is quite a comeback. ‘He’s a tough character,’ said Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu. ‘He’ll be the same bowler, but maybe with a slightly different action. He’s been working hard on his action and was very keen to get back to international cricket as soon as he could.’ Bopara spins the ball out to the wing during a game of touch rugby . Asked about the incident with Buttler, who was run out by Senanayake backing up too far at the non-striker’s end during the one-day international at Edgbaston, Atapattu rightly refused to budge an inch: ‘The rules say he did nothing wrong, and I totally stick by that.’ New Zealand No 3 and part-time off-spinner Kane Williamson has also had his action cleared, but it is the transformation of Senanayake, from a bowler whose obvious kink so infuriated England to persona grata, that is sure to lend spice to the last two games here. While England were convinced during the summer of the illegality of his action – as well as outraged by the manner of Buttler’s dismissal in Birmingham – the Sri Lankans exploited the reporting of Senanayake to foster a them-and-us mentality that eventually helped them win their first Test series in England. On Tuesday, Root spoke diplomatically about the bowler's potential return. ‘That would be great,’ he said. ‘He’s a very good international player. If he comes back we’ll just have to find a way of combatting him.’ Sachitra Senanayake was suspended for an illegal bowling action this summer, but can now return .

The 33-year-old has poured scorn on the prospect of Chelsea winning another European crown, only seeing Bayern Munich and capital rivals Atletico as genuine challengers.

"England spirits may need lifting at some point in the coming months. With a World Cup on the horizon in which they aren't expected to pull up any trees in, Alastair Cook will be intent on needing an easy pick-me-up. And the skipper may just have found it, for Joe Root appears a dab hand at none other than the ukulele. In his hotel before England's fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka on Wednesday, the Yorkshireman showcased his concealed talent in front of the ECB cameras. Joe Root was videoed strumming along to Arctic Monkeys' Mardy Bum by the ECB website . The 23-year-old claims his ukulele skills are 'horrendous' and refuses to sing when playing . Arctic Monkeys' Mardy Bum was the song of choice as Root strummed along to the tune made famous by the band who hail from his home city, Sheffield. Cook may urge the 23-year-old to opt for something slightly more uplifting if he does indeed perform in front of the touring squad – but Root doesn't appear overly confident in his ability. 'I'm horrendous at it,' he said. 'I can't really sing, so I try to make sure I play loud enough so no one can hear that. 'It sounds horrendous at the minute. But I hope, one day, it might sound all right.' What Root is more bullish about are England's chances of resurrecting the series against Angelo Mathews' side. Arctic Monkeys (pictured at the NME awards in 2007) also hail from the Yorkshire city of Sheffield . Root will be part of the England squad to face Sri Lanka in the fifth one-day international on Wednesday . They trail 3-1 in the seven-match series, but the batsman sees this as a chance to show how they can perform under pressure. 'There's no reason why we can't,' he said. 'I think we showed in every game at some point that we're capable of doing that. Now we have to put it into one complete performance. Even the game we did win we weren't at our best, which is promising. 'But we don't want to talk about being promising all the time. Now is the time for us to step up and start putting in performances.

I'm not saying they're ready, or that they don't need a transitional period with us or a couple of loans, but the quality is much better. I have conditions to do it. 'Go to other clubs, it's clear to see it's not easy to bring kids from the youth competitions to the top level, but I think every one of us has the same feeling. We want to do it.' The Chelsea manager has hailed the match against Sporting Lisbon as their 'Academy Day' and believes that he finally feels the club have the quality of youngsters to have a real chance of breaking through.

'If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough, and you don't bring kids up, then close the door and use the money to buy players. 'You need to prove the academy works well and is worth it. It's only possible if the first-team manager stays for a long time, which in this club in the last 10 years, was not possible. Now I'm trying to format Ruben and other Rubens in relation to my ideas, to his position. 'Imagine next week if there's a different first-team manager with different ideas. Some product, almost an added product, becomes an empty product and you start everything again. In this moment, the relation between the first-team and the academy is changing based on this stability that, at this moment, we are having. 'The first time Ruben trained with me was 18 months ago. In this moment, in the last two or three weeks, he's been training every day. So, in 18 months, I think he remembers every word or feedback he's had in first-team development.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is set to be handed his Chelsea debut against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday night, is regarded as one of the country's brightest emerging talents. The 6ft 4in central midfielder, 18, has earned rave reviews for his composed play and passing in central midfield and looks well-equipped to make the step up. Hailing from Lewisham, south London, Loftus-Cheek first pulled on a blue shirt for the U8s team and is, as Jose Mourinho said, very much 'Made in Chelsea.' Graduating through the Stamford Bridge schoolboy teams, he was appearing for the Under-18s three years ahead of schedule and captaining England schoolboys in the Victory Shield. The maturity and energy he demonstrated in the box-to-box midfield role won admiring glances from a number of big clubs, including Barcelona, and prompted Chelsea to tie down his future . Ruben Loftus-Cheek lifts the FA Youth Cup after Chelsea beat Fulham in last season's final . The central midfielder in action for Chelsea's Under 21 team in a Cup match against West Ham last season . Loftus-Cheek is always a willing outlet for the defenders and, with head up pressing forward, is adept at picking the right pass. Tall and strong, he is rarely dispossessed either, but it is his composure on the ball that is most eye-catching. He never looks rushed and always seems to be in acres of space. The breakthrough season came in 2012-2013, when Loftus-Cheek played a starring role as Chelsea progressed to the final of the FA Youth Cup and the NextGen Series, though both ended in defeat. Selection for the Under 21 side soon followed and he started two post-season first team friendlies against Manchester City out in the United States. Loftus-Cheek helped Chelsea to victory in the Under 21 Premier League, playing in the 2-1 win in the final at Old Trafford. He also played a full part in Chelsea's FA Youth Cup success, captaining the team. This season, he has been a mainstay of Chelsea's Under 21 side and has also participated in the UEFA Youth League. Loftus-Cheek has been capped for England up to Under 19 level and has six goals in 10 matches at that standard. ADAM SHERGOLD .","Chelsea face Sporting Lisbon at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night .

The Frenchman limped off after injuring his groin but remains confident he will be fit to face Manchester United .

"Winter is officially here - but in future years, it could look very different, researchers have said. They have created a series of maps showing how climate change will change America's winters dramatically. Since 1970, the average winter temperature in the continental U.S. has warmed by 2.4°F. Scroll down for video . Warming winters across the US: Climate Central used NOAA data to map exactly how winters have changed since 1970. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. data was also used to see that winters are getting wetter in the Central US. 'In the big picture, the U.S. has seen a number of climate shifts in the cold season over the past 40 years or so,' said Climate Central, which created the maps. Since 1970, the average winter temperature in the continental U.S. has warmed by 2.4°F since 1970. 'That’s faster than the planet as a whole, which has warmed 1.1°F over that same period, due in large part to rising human greenhouse gas emissions.' The team's maps reveal that certain regions have seen heat rises far greater than the average. The Upper Midwest leads the charge as the fastest-warming region followed by the Northeast. The South and West, by contrast, have warmed relatively slowly. The only notable cold spots are in eastern Nevada and southern Wyoming. The Southwest has seen rises of just 2.3C since 1970 - whereas the upper midwest has seen a huge 7.5C boost to its winter temperatures. In America's West, a 3.0C rise was recorded, while in the Northeast a much larger 5.4C boost was uncovered since 1970 . The researchers also looked at rain. 'A large swath in the middle of the country from Texas to Michigan has seen an uptick in precipitation. 'The Rockies have also gotten wetter, which is good news to skiers (though that's tempered by rising temperatures). 'At the same time, the Southeast and Northwest have gotten somewhat drier.' Despite the current drought afflicting California, the long-term trend shows that winters have gotten wetter in a large chunk of the state. This wet season appears off to a better start than the past two, but with record heat baking soils to their driest levels in at least 1,200 years, a lot more rain is needed this winter to bust the drought. It comes as Heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades, according to scientists. The Rockies have also gotten wetter, which is good news for skiers, while the Ohio Valley has seen a 4.4C rise . America's south saw a rise of 4.0C since 1970, which equates to .88C per year, while the southeast saw a 2.9C rise . Researchers at the University of East Anglia  found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average. Meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record. Figures published by the Met Office  predicted that the global mean temperature for 2014 is 0.01 degrees C warmer than 2010, currently the warmest on record at 14.50 degrees C (58.12F) This is despite much of the northern hemisphere being plunged into temperatures well below freezing in January as North America was hit by an Arctic polar vortex. According to the latest findings from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere. Average global temperatures for 2014 have been higher than average and may even break previous records . Extreme heatwaves in Europe like the one that killed tens of thousands in 2003 could happen every other year by 2040s, the Met Office has warned. They claim that the chances of extreme heatwaves in Europe have increased from occurring once in every 1,000 years to around one a century. Extremely warm summers that would be expected to occur twice a century in the early 2000s are also now likely to happen twice a decade, according to the research in the journal Nature Climate Change. Dr Peter Stott, co-author of the study, warned that projections of future climate change suggest that by the end of the century summers like that seen in 2003 could be considered 'unusually cool'. He said: 'This paper shows how our vulnerability to heat extremes is rapidly changing and we expect that to continue going forward.' Professor Phil Jones, who led the work, said: 'Trends in extreme heat and cold are important because they have a large impact on water supplies, agricultural productivity and other factors related to human health and wellbeing. 'Improved understanding of the spatial patterns of change are vital for understanding the causes of recent extreme weather events.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Geophysical Review Letters, analysed monthly temperature records at set points around the world between 1881 and 2013. The found that on average through the 130-year period, periods of unusually cold weather increased in frequency more than extreme heatwaves. This led to a narrowing of the range of the Earth's temperatures, they said. However, in the past 30 years, the researchers found that the pattern has been reversed with incidences of hot weather increasing at a faster rate. Extreme weather can bring chaos to transport systems while causing billions of pounds worth of damage and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world each year. An estimated 31,000 people died in the UK as a result of bitter temperatures during the winter of 2012/2013. During December 2013 and January 2014, 200 million people were blasted by icy temperatures as arctic winds brought heavy snow to much of North America. Temperatures fell as low as -38°C (-37°F) in Babbitt Minnesota while Wisconsin saw its lowest temperature since 1979. The cold air reached as far south as Dallas that reportedly saw temperatures plunge below −9°C  (16°F). The conditions are estimated to have cost the USA more than $5 billion and saw widespread power failures across large swathes of Canada. In some areas, temperatures were so low that it led to residents being able to throw pots of boiling water and watching them freeze before the water hit the ground. By contrast, in 2003, around 30,000 people died across Europe during a summer heatwave, where temperatures in some areas reached more than 104°F (40°C). Professor Scott Robeson, from Indiana University, who also took part in the study, said: 'Arguably, these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society.' He added that the study could help to explain the 'pause' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year. The new study showed that while warming continued in most parts of the planet, it was offset by a strong cooling during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. Prof Robeson said: 'There really hasn't been a pause in global warming. There has been a pause in Northern Hemisphere winter warming.' It comes after separate research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the chances of heatwaves in Europe have increased in the past decade. The likelihood of Extreme heatwaves, such as the one in 2003,  have also increased tenfold, from being a one in 1,000 year event to occurring around once in a century. By the 2040s, such extreme heatwaves could happen every other year if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the researchers at the Met Office claimed.","Maps were created to show how temperatures has changed since 1970 in all US regions .

Mayweather was at the Staples Center for the Sacramento Kings-Los Angeles Lakers game on Tuesday - one night after watching the Clippers . Mayweather was out and about Monday evening just hours after he reportedly witnessed - or at least heard - the gruesome murder-suicide. The champion boxer was photographed as he attended the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix Suns basketball game Monday night. Hayes claimed Mosley had allegedly had an affair years earlier, and though Hayes and Moseley reconciled, he is said to have never gotten over her infidelity. Songz took to Twitter shortly after the tragedy, writing; 'R.I.P babygirl. Once an angel on earth, now watching over us from Heaven. You'll b missed but never forgotten. Love.' Police rushed to the couple's apartment early Monday morning after there were reports of gunshots and a woman screaming. A SWAT team was eventually forced to break down the door, and found the door to one of the bedrooms locked. They then heard two gunshots, and when they entered found both Hayes and Moseley dead. Good pals: Hayes and Moseley (right) were good friends with Mayweather (center), and Hayes was on his record label . Moseley was a well-known backup dancer and reality star . Police say she was shot multiple times by her husband while she was taking a bath at their Los Angeles home . Moseley was an actress who appeared on the VH1 series Hit the Floor as well as films including The Twlight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1, Mirror Mirror and Sparkle. She was also a successful backup dancer who had worked with artists including Usher and Chris Brown. Brown also posted a tribute to Moseley on his Instagram Monday, writing; 'RIP baby girl. Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family.' He later took the post down. Today it was revealed Hayes  recorded a song called Suicide about killing a girlfriend, according to TMZ. Lines included: 'I could just kill us both, go out with a smash. 'F*** the real life shoot it out and do your time on the spot. 'Make a family crying with your girl and their hearstses.'","Floyd Mayweather attended the Los Angeles Clippers basketball game Monday night hours after 'watching his friend commit a murder-suicide'

"Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has said she would like to see female nominees running from both parties in the 2016 Presidential race. Currently filming the second season of her reality show for the Sportsman Channel, Palin once again refused to be drawn on whether she herself is considering running for the White House. ‘2016 is a long time away… that's a big darn deal when it comes to family,’ she told Extra on Tuesday. Palin told Extra's Charissa Thompson that said she would like to see female nominees running from both parties in the 2016 Presidential race, but refused to be drawn on her own political future . When asked by the entertainment show’s Charissa Thompson if America is ready for Hillary Clinton as a possible Democrat nominee, Palin said she was all for female politicians standing for both parties. ‘I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot,’ she said. The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee was also asked if she had any aspirations to join The View. ‘I think it would be fun to be able to highlight more of the issues that they get to focus on, but when I have an opportunity like this though to do something positive and not necessarily so controversial…Something positive, encouraging and inspiring and not bickering sitting across a table or on a panel,’ she said. For now, Palin is focused on filming episodes for the second season of Amazing America With Sarah Palin, which is set to premiere on January 15 on the Sportsman Channel. Palin was also asked about her family and said they were 'awesome' before attacking the 'liberal media' and saying that she would not 'sit down and shut up' ‘There's so much to show… We're going to focus a lot on those who are reaching out and helping others…We're going to showcase a lot of these people who can inspire others to get out there and live vibrantly… It's about work ethic… But still keeping that connection between faith, family, and love of freedom. That's America!’ Palin was also asked about her family and said they were 'awesome' before attacking the 'liberal media' and saying that she would not 'sit down and shut up.' 'My family is awesome. Perhaps they have some kind of target on their back because the liberal media types they do not like constitutional conservatives… who are gonna call it like they see it and speak truth,' said Palin. 'So they'll do whatever they can to get you to sit down and shut up, but I'm not wired to sit down and shut up.' Currently filming the second season of her reality show for the Sportsman Channel, Sarah Palin once again refused to be drawn on whether she herself is considering running for the White House . Back in October Palin said there may yet be a presidential campaign in the future for her. In an interview with Fox Business Network she said she was invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics, and they make her 'want to get out there and defend the innocent, want to work so hard for justice in this country.' 'So, hey the more they're pouring on, the more I'm going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice, with the message, hopefully running for office in the future, too,' Palin added. Palin decided not to seek the presidency in 2012 and she hasn't held elected office since she resigned as governor in 2009 during her first and only term. She remains a fixture of the Tea Party, however, and is generally billed as the keynote speaker at influential conservative conferences.","Former Republican vice presidential candidate said she would like to see female nominees running from both parties in the 2016 Presidential race .

"Family: Kirstie Allsopp has two sons aged five and seven. She is pictured with them in 2010 . Kirstie Allsopp’s suggestions that young women should find a boyfriend instead of going to university and have a baby by the age of 27 are ‘rather patronising’ to teenage girls, a top headmistress said today. Jo Heywood, head of Heathfield School, a girls’ school in Ascot, Berkshire, said she applauded the property guru’s point that girls should consider their futures, but said it had been spoilt by her talk of ‘boyfriends and babies’. Location, Location, Location presenter Allsopp suggested that it was time to speak ‘honestly and frankly’ about fertility and the fact that it declines dramatically once a woman is in her mid-30s. The 42 year old, who has two sons aged five and seven with her partner, the property developer Ben Andersen, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘At the moment, women have 15 years to go to university, get their career on track, try and buy a home and have a baby. ‘That is a hell of a lot to ask someone. As a passionate feminist, I feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue.’ Allsopp later went on to say: ‘I don’t have a girl, but if I did I’d be saying “Darling, do you know what? Don’t go to university. Start work straight after school, stay at home, save up your deposit - I’ll help you, let’s get you into a flat. And then we can find you a nice boyfriend and you can have a baby by the time you’re 27.’ She added that women have time to work on their career after they have had children. ‘I don’t want the next generation of women to go through the heartache that my generation has,’ Allsopp said. ‘At the moment we are changing the natural order of things, with grandparents being much older and everyone squeezed in the middle. 'Don’t think “my youth should be longer”. Don’t go to university because it’s an “experience”. No, it’s where you’re supposed to learn something! Do it when you’re 50!’ Headmistress: Jo Heywood said she applauded the property guru's comments had been spoilt by her talk of 'boyfriends and babies' But Ms Heywood said that youngsters need to make the right choices at the right time for themselves. ‘Teenagers should always be encouraged to go to university or straight to work for the right reasons, and should be encouraged to choose the path which suits them - not the one that is likely to ensure they can buy property or have a baby by the most immediate route,’ she said. ‘I would never encourage a bright teenager to ditch their university prospects for fear they won’t “have it all” in the future. ‘I believe having it all is a total myth - it is more a case of doing what is right for you and making the right choices at the right time for you.’ Writing for the Independent School Parent website, Ms Heywood said she thought that a graduate with a good degree would be likely to be able to buy their first flat around the same age as someone who has worked from the age of 16 or 18, if not sooner. ‘I applaud what Kirstie is saying in principle - that girls should consider their future and security - but I think she spoils her point by suggesting abandoning university is the way forward and her talk of boyfriends and babies is rather patronising for the generation I am preparing for university and beyond.’","Presenter, 42, urges women to ensure they have children at a young age .

"A newborn baby has survived being flushed down a toilet by his mother shortly after she gave birth in north-west China . A passerby heard the little boy's cries from a sewer in Suide County, in Shaanxi Province, and called emergency services who found him lying in a pool of filthy water. The boy, nicknamed Xiaoxiao, meaning 'teeny tiny', survived the ordeal with just a few scratches, and is now recovering in hospital while police attempt to find his mother. Scroll down for video . Survivor: The boy, nicknamed Xiaoxiao, meaning 'teeny tiny', was flushed down the toiled by his mother shortly after she gave birth to him . 'It was really a race against time because somebody could have flushed something down the sewer again at any stage, or the baby might have turned over and ended up face first in the filthy water and drowned,' Suide County fire department squad leader Li Zhi said. 'But we didn't want to smash the pipe because we thought that might also hurt or even kill the baby. 'So we had to use a mixture of tools in order to ease him towards the opening and then pull him out. 'He still had the umbilical cord attached and it had obviously been clumsily cut.' The newborn was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was cleaned and fed, but otherwise did not need further medical care.

Police say they have started a search for the mother of the child, and added that it was not the first time that an unwanted child had been abandoned in such a way. They have launched appeal for help in tracking down the mother, who may be in need of medical care after the birth. However, if the mother is found, she will face possible child abuse and neglect charges.","Newborn baby boy discovered in sewer in north-east China .

Arjen Robben's 100th competitive goal for undefeated Bayern Munich extended their  lead at the top of the Bundesliga table to 12 points during a routine win over SC Freiburg. The Dutchman's header in the 41st minute gave Bayern a deserved lead, before Thomas Muller doubled their advantage  during their 11th win in 12 league games. Even Manuel Neuer was up to his old tricks, caught standing near the half-way line, while Pep Guardiola's men set a new Bundesliga record, having conceded just three goals after 16 matches.

Losing Xabi Alonso and Mehdi Benatia midway through the match due to injury was a blow, but it did little to stop them ripping through Freiburg. In fact, the visitors did not muster a shot until the 75th minute. Neuer and Bayern's clean sheet means they have now got a better record than VfB Stuttgart's efforts from 2003. It was  never in doubt. Bayern held 82 per cent possession and Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Burki, in all fairness, did well to not  concede before the 41st minute. He denied Mario Gotze what seemed a sure thing before Robben eventually beat him. The opening goal itself appeared simple. An Alonso chipped ball found Franck Ribery lying in wait at the back, who in turn nodded to a free Robben. The Dutchman was never going to miss, ducking low to head into the empty net for a 1-0 lead.

"The father of the two Boston bombing suspects will apparently travel to the U.S. tomorrow in order to seek 'justice and the truth'. Anzor Tsarnaev says he has 'lots of questions for the police' and is keen 'to clear up many things' when he arrives from his home in Makhachkala in Russia. He had previously said that he would return to America this week in the wake of the death of his elder son Tamerlan and the arrest of 19-year-old Dzhokhar. The suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, yesterday said that her husband would fly to the U.S. on Wednesday, adding that the family hoped to bring Tamerlan's body back to Russia. Scroll down for video . Parents: Anzor Tsarnaev, left, and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, right, insist their sons are innocent of the Boston bombs . Suspects: Dzhokhar, left, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of killing three people at the Boston Marathon . Both parents have strenuously denied their sons' guilt for the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 170 at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last Sunday. They have accused the U.S. authorities of framing Tamerlan and Dzhokhar - Mr Tsarnaev described the death of his son as an 'inside job, while Mrs Tsarnaeva claimed that the government 'wanted to eliminate' Tamerlan, 26. Mr Tsarnaev, 47, has said that he spoke to his sons in the aftermath of the bombing, before he knew they were responsible. They apparently reassured him that they were safe, saying: 'Everything is good, Daddy. Everything is very good.' He claims that Dzhokhar, who is in hospital after shooting himself in the head when he was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts, is not being allowed to talk to his relatives. 'They're not letting anyone from the family see him,' Mr Tsarnaev said. 'All we know is what we hear from television.' Widow: Katherine Russell, pictured left in her yearbook photo and right outside her house last week, has not spoken out after her husband Tamerlan was killed in a shoot-out with police . Mrs Tsarnaeva, 46, also spoke to the alleged terrorists after the attack - and Tamerlan phoned her moments before his death to say goodbye. 'The police, they have started shooting at us, they are chasing us,' he said, then hung up after adding: 'Mama, I love you.' She told the Daily Telegraph yesterday she was proud of her sons, and once again insisted that they could not be guilty of the atrocity. While she admitted that Tamerlan, who had become an increasingly strict Muslim, had dabbled in terrorist-related reading materials, she denied that he would act on the jihadist sentiments. 'Reading extremist materials does not make you a terrorist,' she said. 'Tamerlan told the FBI men, ""I read many things - I read Pushkin and Doestoyevsky too."" He was an erudite boy.' Mrs Tsarnaeva added that she thought the U.S. security service was responsible for the bomb, and had decided to frame her sons to justify monitoring them. 'It's a big show, a spectacle,' she said. 'Americans love a show.' Manhunt: Heavily armed police were on the streets of Watertown, Massachusetts last Friday looking for Dzhokhar after he escaped from the gun battle which killed his brother . Atrocity: Three people died and 170 were injured when the Boston Marathon was bombed last Monday . However, other family members have been less keen to defend the alleged terrorists - their uncle Ruslan Tsarni claimed that the pair had been pushed into radical circles by their 'controlling' mother. He told MailOnline: 'These kids, I thought she's not doing enough. She's not doing them right, especially when they grew up.’ And when they came under the influence of extremist preachers, Mrs Tsarnaeva did not attempt to dissuade them, he added. In contrast to the Tsarnaevs' steady stream of loud denials, the dead suspect's widow has not spoken out since her husband was implicated in the bombing. Katherine Russell, the mother of Tamerlan's three-year-old child, has kept a stubborn silence in the wake of his death in a shoot-out with police in the early hours of Friday morning. She has been co-operating with the FBI investigation into the attack, according to her lawyer. Amato DeLuca told CNN his client was 'a really good person', adding: 'Katie is just trying to bring up her daughter.' Tamerlan apparently wanted to bring his wife, who had converted to Islam, with him to Dagestan, the Muslim-dominated state where he grew up before emigrating to Boston.","Anzor Tsarnaev has 'lots of questions for the police' when he arrives in US .

"The real Winston Bright: Kwame Seku (pictured) says he is Winston Bright, a married father of three who disappeared 24 years ago from New York, and has been living in California after suffering from amnesia . A California man claims he suffered amnesia 24 years ago, which caused him to forget his life as a married father of three in New York. Now 65-year-old Kwame Seku is fighting with a court in New York to prove he is Winston Bright, a telephone-company worker who disappeared at the age of 42 on October 12, 1990. Seku's goal is to get the pension he earned during his years working at New York Telephone Company, which is now owned by Verizon. But since Bright was legally ruled dead in 2000, his $617-a-month pension payments have been going to the wife he left behind - and Leslie Bright say she's going to fight him on the claim. Leslie, now 61, remembers the last time she saw her husband on October 12, 1990. 'He kissed me on the cheek, called me at lunchtime like he always did and again when he was on his way home,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He never made it' She gave up hope he would return after a fruitless decade-long search. Seku told the New York Post that he first remembers waking up in San Diego without an ID card and just a few dollars in his pocket sometime between 1991 and 1992. He didn't remember his name, so he decided to take the African name Kwame after reading it in a magazine. As Kwame, he started a new life in California by earning his GED and teaching certificate - working in public schools until his retirement. Seku says he just recently remembered his true identity, with the help of the internet. 'Bits and pieces. You think of places you remember. I had dreams of this and dreams of that and I'd go and investigate it,' he said. About three years ago, he traveled back to New York where he had a happy reunion with his parents, siblings, three now-adult children and his grandchildren. The reunion was bittersweet though when he learned the destruction his absence had caused and the fact that two of his sons had served jail time. Retired life: The 65-year-old is petitioning a New York court to get his pension payments back from his former wife in New York and that he was a blood test to prove he's Bright . 'I talked to my daughter, they had a pretty good life when I was there but when I left it became hard times.' Leslie wasn't happy to see him, and relations with his kids soured too when he tried to get his pension back from his wife. 'Once this Verizon thing hit the fan, that's when it all went downhill,' Seku said. Initially Verizon started sending him payments, but abruptly stopped when they figured out his wife was also receiving payments. The company issued a statement, saying they will continue sending payments to Leslie until a court rules on whether Seku is Bright. A surrogate judge in New York initially threw out Seku's petition for his pension in September 2012 because he didn't have proof he was the legally-dead man. But in his new petition, Seku is armed with a blood test he says proves he's the son of his mother, Mary Bright, and that entitles him to the payments. Regardless of whether Seku is Bright, Leslie says she's going to continue to fight to keep the payments because he abandoned her. 'He hasn’t come back to me as his wife or to have a relationship with his children,' she said. 'I will go at him for back child support, cat support, everything! If he wants a fight, I’ll give him a fight!'","Winston Bright disappeared at the age of 42 on October 12, 1990 and was ruled legally dead in 2000 .

"A billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Apple is expected to continue  after a 65-year-old Massachusetts business consultant read about the plaintiffs' floundering case online and volunteered to represent consumers in the suit. A federal judge said she was tentatively satisfied with a proposal to add Barbara Bennett the new named plaintiff in the lawsuit over Apple's iTunes software and the price of its iPods. The case actually started with three plaintiffs suing Apple nearly 10 years ago, but two of them withdrew and the judge disqualified the last one, Marianna Rosen, on Monday amid indications that Rosen didn't herself purchase any of the affected iPods during the time frame covered by the suit. 'We were very scared': Video testimony from Steve Jobs recorded months before his death was today shown in court as Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market. Earlier this week, lawyers claimed it had deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods from 2007 to 2009. But, the tech giant has challenged the suit after presenting evidence suggesting the plaintiffs' models of iPod may be invalid . Apple is accused of abusing its monopoly position in the digital music player market, and only earlier this week lawyers claimed the firm deliberately deleted rivals' song from iPods. The case went to trial in California this month, after being filed a decade ago. Plaintiffs are claiming that Apple's restrictive software froze out competitors and allowed Apple to sell iPods at inflated prices. They are seeking $350 million (£224m) in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds Apple broke federal anti-trust law. Apple stopped using the particular software in question in 2009, which means the lawsuit only covers iPod models bought between September 2006 and March 2009. earlier in the trial, the prosecution told the court that  Apple deleted songs from iPods that had been bought from rival music stores. Each time an Apple user with non-iTunes music tried to sync their devices, between 2007 and 2009, the tech firm  urged them to restore the players to factory settings. And the lawyers claimed this was a deliberate move to wipe the rival files, and cause the users' music libraries to 'blow up.' But Apple insisted the move was a legitimate security measure. Now, Apple has said new evidence shows the two women named as plaintiffs may not have bought iPod models covered by the lawsuit. Bennett, who sometimes used her iPod to listen to music while ice skating, boarded a plane early Tuesday and flew to California at the request of lawyers who are suing Apple Inc. on behalf of an estimated 8 million consumers who purchased iPods between 2006 and 2009 in the latest twist in the trial. Bennett, who said she bought a special-edition iPod Nano in 2006 because she liked its striking red case, contacted the lawyers and offered to help after reading an online news account that said the case was close to collapsing for lack of a named plaintiff. Attorneys suing Apple have alleged that its use of restrictive software, which kept iPods from playing music purchased from competitors of Apple's iTunes store, effectively blocked rivals from the market and allowed the Cupertino, California company to sell iPods at inflated prices. Apple says the software was necessary to prevent unauthorized copying. The plaintiffs are seeking $350 million in damages, which could be tripled if the jury finds violations of federal antitrust law. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has repeatedly shown impatience with the plaintiffs' attorneys for not doing a better job of vetting the original named plaintiffs in the case, who are supposed to represent the class of affected consumers. 'We shouldn't have been here in the first place,' Rogers said as attorneys on both sides debated how to proceed Tuesday morning. A moment later, the judge sharply disagreed when plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick Coughlin suggested his side had suffered when Apple provided an incorrect list - which was later amended - of affected iPod models three years ago. 'You never checked' whether the last plaintiff had purchased the right models, the judge told Coughlin. 'So don't talk to me' about that,' she added. Bennett's answers to questions in court suggested she wasn't fully up to speed on the complex allegations in the case, but Rogers said she was tentatively satisfied that Bennett qualifies for the job of class representative. The judge said she won't rule until Apple attorneys have a chance to question Bennett more closely in a deposition outside court. Apple shares closed up $1.72 at $114.12 on Tuesday. The latest twist comes after than three years after his death, legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs held an Oakland courtroom transfixed as attorneys played a video of his testimony in a class-action lawsuit that accuses Apple of inflating prices by locking music lovers into using Apple's iPod players. Looking gaunt and pale, Jobs spoke softly during the deposition he gave six months before his death in October 2011. Despite this, he gave a firm defense of Apple's software, which blocked music from services that competed with Apple's iTunes store. 'We were very scared' of the prospect that hackers could break Apple's security system, Jobs said, because that might jeopardize Apple's contracts with music recording companies that didn't want their songs to be pirated. 'We would get nasty emails from the labels,' he added. Apple CEO Steve Jobs stands next to a projection of an iPod Nano at an Apple announcement in San Francisco. Dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs appeared impatient at times and swivelled in his chair during the interview session shown in court, which was recorded at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. Jobs was known for having a short temper. But he seemed unruffled when an attorney for the plaintiffs read part of an email in which the Apple CEO demanded that a record company executive publicly apologize for praising rival RealNetworks for producing software that would make songs from the RealNetworks store play on Apple's iPods. Dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and blue jeans, Jobs appeared impatient at times and swiveled in his chair during the session, which was recorded at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California. He said he didn't remember why he was upset with the recording executive. But he acknowledged that he had proposed language for an Apple press release that condemned RealNetworks as a 'hacker.'

"Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that Formula One's teams have signed contracts agreeing to help competitors which get into financial trouble by supplying a car to them. It is a particularly pressing problem. Sportsmail can reveal that the Marussia team notified London's High Court earlier this month that it intends to go into administration. It follows the collapse this week of F1's worst-performer Caterham. Eleventh hour talks are underway to save it and Ecclestone says another team may have to step in by supplying it with a car. The controversial rule is written into the teams' contracts with Ecclestone and it forces them to field a third car if the grid slips below a threshold of 20 cars. Caterham have gone in to administration as the team searches for a new owner . A security guard takes down a flag after the closure of Caterham's factory in Oxfordshire . It was thought that the teams would run the third car themselves but in fact it would be supplied to ailing rivals to stop them from going under. 'They would supply a third car to someone else so if, for example, Sauber disappeared, a team could do a deal with Sauber. Ferrari could say, ''we will give you a car, all that goes with it, and we want you to put this sponsor on it. You have your own sponsors but we want you to include this one as well and we want you to take this driver''. The team wouldn't have to go under then would they? If Red Bull decided they would give a car to Caterham for example that could solve their problem.' The reason for the clause is that Ecclestone's contracts with race organisers state that F1 'shall use its reasonable endeavours to ensure...that at least sixteen cars participate in the Event.' F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has revealed teams have contracts to supply ailing rivals with third cars . If it slips below that F1 could breach its contracts and risk losing the £300 million in fees paid by race organisers. Setting the threshold at 20 cars gives Ecclestone a buffer and he may need it. Annual F1 team budgets are now around £140 million on average and although Red Bull has one of the biggest, smaller outfits are struggling to keep up. On 7 October Manor Grand Prix Racing, the company which runs Marussia, filed a notice with the High Court saying that it intends to appoint an administrator. The team lies in ninth place with just two points and has made combined net losses of £140.6 million since joining F1 in 2010. Ecclestone said on Saturday that he expects Marussia and Caterham will miss next weekend's United States Grand Prix. It will put the grid at 18 cars but Ecclestone added that this won't trigger the third car clause because the teams' F1 contracts allow them to miss two races each year. 'We don't have to introduce a third car at this stage because they can miss a couple of races. They lose any money they would have got for those races but they don't lose their position in the championship. I have no idea if Marussia are going to make it in the long run. It's better if they didn't have to go into administration.' Marussia has filed a notice with the High Court saying that it intends to appoint an administrator . Marussia have struggled to recover from the horror crash that left Jules Bianchi seriously injured in Japan . It is too late to prevent that happening to Caterham. Earlier this month bailiffs seized equipment from its factory in Oxfordshire and the team's 220 staff have been locked out of the building by the administrator since Thursday. It languishes in 11th place, one behind Sauber which has failed to score any points this year despite having backing from sponsors owned by the world's richest man, Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim. If a team received a rival's car it would not need to spend money on research and development, manufacturing or buying engines. These are the three biggest costs for F1 teams, far exceeding spending on staff and drivers which would continue to be covered by the outfit which receives the third car. Lewis Hamilton will renew his rivalry with Nico Rosberg at the US Grand Prix, where both Caterham and Marussia have been granted special dispensation not to race . Marussia's latest company accounts are for 2012 and show that it spent £32 million on research and development which alone comes to 42% of its total £76.1 million costs. Manufacturing and engine expenses are estimated at a further £23 million. Wiping out these costs would transform bankrupt outfits into profitable ones which could attract investment and ultimately stand on their own two feet. Some teams raced with three cars in the 1970s though this was because there was freedom to do so not because the grid had hit a threshold stipulated in contracts. Although the teams have signed up to supply third cars now, several of them, including Britain's Williams, have long opposed a similar scheme where outfits would sell customer cars to rivals. 'We don't believe customer cars and three car teams to be in the DNA of our sport,' says Williams' deputy team principal Claire Williams. I think a more important question is why are we having those conversations and that's because there is talk that teams are in financial difficulty at the moment. I think we need to be addressing the cost issues in Formula One in order to support the teams that we currently have.","F1 teams have written deals to supply rivals in financial trouble with cars .

"Kirstie Alley is said to be 'livid' with her former friend Leah Remini after she ended her association with the Church Of Scientology last week. The 62-year-old actress looked unusually downcast as she headed out in LA's Los Feliz over the weekend following the King of Queens star's dramatic exit from the controversial organization. Scientology journalist Tony Ortega, who was the first to report Leah's defection on July 8 on The Underground Bunker, claims the long-time Scientology devotee spent hours in crisis talks with fellow celebrity Church members on July 10 after Leah made the decision to dissolve her union with the controversial organisation. Crisis talks? Actress Kirstie Alley was deep in conversation as she walked through Los Feliz over the weekend, following reports she's furious at friend Leah Remini's betrayal . Cryptic tweets: Kirstie posted these messages on July 10 . Huge furore: Leah is understood to have left the controversial Church . In a series of no-holds-barred, . cryptic tweets posted on July 10, Kristie appeared to slam her friend of 30 years for spreading . what she called 'malicious gossip'. 'When . faced w malicious gossip I take a moment to experience the loss of the . person I thought was my friend... Then I say f*** em..:)' she posted to . her more than one million followers. Six hours later, she followed up with 'the sweetest poison is often served with a smile...beware syrup' as she allegedly arrived at long-time Church member Melinda Brownstone's home for crisis talks. Melinda was said to have been Leah's oldest and best friend, having met when she first moved to LA at the tender age of 13, however, all members have allegedly been instructed to 'disconnect' from the star immediately. Former King Of Queens star Leah joined . the Church with her mother in the 1970s after relocating to Los Angeles . from Brooklyn to pursue her acting dream. The way they were: Pictured together on an episode of King Of Queens, Kirstie and Leah have known each other for years . Long history: Kirstie has been a very vocal supporter of the Church Of Scientology since discovering the organisation in 1979 . Leah . reportedly called time on her association following years of interrogation for questioning the . whereabouts of leader David Miscavige's wife, Shelly, who hasn't been . seen since 2007. In a statement released to People magazine on July 11, the 43-year-old thanked the public for supporting her decision to cut ties with the controversial church. 'I . wish to share my sincere and heartfelt appreciation for the . overwhelming positive response I have received from the media, my . colleagues, and from fans around the world. I am truly grateful and . thankful for all your support.' Meanwhile, deep in conversation on . her phone as she made her way to the Mustard Seed Cafe in Los Feliz on .

The mother-of-two appeared not to have ran a comb through her hair or put on a lick of make-up. A good distraction: The 62-year-old is currently busy working on a new sitcom, aptly titled Kirstie's New Show, which will premiere in the fall . Kirstie has been a very vocal supporter of the Church of Scientology since she became affiliated with them through a Narconon program that based its techniques on their beliefs and practices in 1979. She credits the Church with helping her overcome her cocaine addiction. 'To tell you the honest-to-God truth: without Scientology, I would be dead. So, I can personally highly recommend it,' she says . Other famous long-time celebrity Scientology devotees include Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Jenna Elfman and Juliette Lewis.

"A young health worker died after she took an overdose of slimming pills, each containing two-and-a-half times as much caffeine as a can of Red Bull. Cara Reynolds had bought Forza raspberry ketone ‘natural’ supplements from Amazon  to help her lose weight, even though she was a size ten, her family said yesterday. Unproven ketone pills have been marketed on Facebook using bogus endorsements from celebrities, although Forza says it has not used such endorsements. Tragic: Cara Reynolds, 24, suffered a heart attack after taking a large amount of Forza raspberry ketones - herbal slimming pills . Plight: In February, Miss Reynolds bought the raspberry ketones on the internet. Her father said: 'She was 5'4"" and a size 10 - she wasn't overweight at all. These pills are targeted at vulnerable, young women who already have body image issues.' Miss Reynolds is pictured right, aged five, on her first day of school . After splitting up with her fiance, Miss Reynolds, 24, swallowed a large number of the tablets, containing as much caffeine as 225 cans of Red Bull energy drink. Medics tried to restart her heart more than 40 times, but were unable to save her. A report submitted to the British Medical Journal said the tragedy highlighted the dangers of untested over-the-counter supplements. Miss Reynolds’s family yesterday called on retailers such as Holland and Barrett to stop selling raspberry ketones. ‘If the ketones had not been so readily available, Cara might still be here today,’ her father Michael, 55, said. ‘These pills need to be taken off the shelves.’ He said: 'My entire world has collapsed since I lost my Cara. Our beautiful girl paid less than £20 and bought these pills from a website. 'They are targeted at vulnerable, young women who already have body image issues.' A representative for Forza said: 'This is a tragic and understandably upsetting situation for her family and friends, but it could have been effected through the misuse of any supplement. 'Forza products meet vigorous health and safety standards and have clear labelling and directions for safe usage. 'It is regrettable to our client that an intentional overdose of a large number of capsules of a food supplement has potentially contributed to Miss Reynolds' suicide. 'The facts surrounding this incident are not yet wholly clear, but our client entirely rejects any implication that an inherent safety issue with its products is responsible.' In February, Miss Reynolds, a support nurse, bought the raspberry ketones on the internet. She told her parents she planned to take them to help her lose weight while working out at the gym. Her father said: 'She was 5'4"" and a size 10. She wasn't overweight at all. 'But we wanted to be supportive of her. She told us the slimming pills were made from natural ingredients, so we didn't think they were anything to worry about.' Devastated: Her father Michael, said many popular retailers should ban over-the-counter sales of slimming pills such as these. He said: 'If the ketones had not been so readily available, Cara might still be here today' After taking two pills, Miss Reynolds went to her father complaining of heart palpitations. He said: 'She'd only taken the recommended amount of pills but was scared because her heart was going 10 to the dozen. 'That's when she said she wasn't going to take them for weight loss any more - it had really worried her.' But a month later, on March 5, 2013, her mother saw her have a seizure and ran to her side. Miss Reynolds admitted she had taken most of the slimming pills and was vomiting and fitting for half an hour before falling unconscious. 'Raspberry ketones are the naturally occurring chemical compounds that give raspberries their scent. 'They are promoted as 'fat burners' although there is little evidence for this.' Raspberry ketone is a natural compound found in raspberries. It is the chemical that gives berries their signature scent. For years raspberry ketones were used primarly by the perfume and food industries, but the compound is also sold as a supplement. Raspberry ketone is a natural compound found in raspberries and the chemical that gives berries their signature scent . They have been touted as a miracle weight-loss drug, with manufacturers claiming they can break down fat, helping people lose weight. But there is no reliable scientific evidence that the ketones work to improve weight loss. Some studies, carried out on animals, show raspberry ketones increase some aspect of metabolism. And it is also thought to affect a hormone in the body, adiponectin. There is not enough scientific evidence to know if raspberry ketone is safe to take as a supplement. No human studies have been carried out to date. However, there are some concerns about the products. It is thought they could cause jittery feelings, increase blood pressure or a rapid heart beat. In a report into the death of Miss Reynolds, a doctor who submitted a case report on the tragedy wrote: ''Many slimming products have concentrations of up to 250mg of caffeine per tablet. 'This is equivalent to more than four cans of Red Bull or seven cans of Coca Cola. After finding his daughter unconscious on her bedroom floor, Mr Reynolds noticed evidence of raspberry ketones and called an ambulance. He said: 'I held my only daughter in my arms and before she became unresponsive she kept telling me she had made a mistake and that she didn't want to die. 'She'd broken up with her fiance of one year and was left devastated by the rocky relationship. 'In a moment of madness, she'd taken an overdose because she had the ketones to hand. 'It was the most heartbreaking moment of my life, and one I will never forget.' When paramedics arrived to rush her to the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, he told medics he had found the empty packaging by her body. Despite 44 attempts to resuscitate her, Miss Reynolds died five hours later from cardiovascular collapse because of the fatal dose of caffeine she had ingested. A case report of her death submitted to the British Medical Journal (BMJ)  said the high dosage of caffeine sent her heart into cardiac arrest. The report author stated: 'This case report highlights the dangers of increasingly popular over-the-counter slimming pills. 'Many slimming products have concentrations of up to 250mg of caffeine per tablet which is equivalent to more than four cans of Red Bull or seven cans of Coca Cola. 'Raspberry ketones are the naturally occurring chemical compounds that give raspberries their scent. They are promoted as ""fat burners"", although there is little evidence for this. 'In Cara's case, the cause of death was caffeine toxicity with a blood level of caffeine per litre which is within the fatal range.' Her family has now launched a campaign to make stores take the pills off their shelves. Raspberry ketones are advertised on Boots' website as a natural, fruit extract to help with weight loss. Mr Reynolds added: 'These pills are dangerous and need to be taken down by retailers. 'There also need to be age restrictions imposed on the purchase of diet pills and so called safe weight loss pills alike. 'These pills are not herbal or harmless like most people are led to believe.' As part of his campaign, he has written to the retailer informing them of his daughter's death and asking them to stop selling raspberry ketones. Mr Reynolds added: 'I lost my angel. I will never get to see her grow up, have children or get married. It's devastating.'

"Convicted: Maria Garcia-Pellon, pictured, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in her husband Matthew White's death . The wife of a former University of Pennsylvania basketball standout has been found guilt of stabbing him to death, even though she is mentally-ill. A suburban Philadelphia judge found Maria Garcia-Pellon guilty of voluntary manslaughter in Matthew White's death, The Delaware County Daily Times reported. Common Pleas Judge Kevin F. Kelly found her not guilty of both first-degree murder and third-degree murder, according to the media outlet. Defense lawyer Thomas Bergstrom referred to the judge's Tuesday's decision as 'an appropriate verdict,' the newspaper reported. Authorities say the 54-year-old Garcia-Pellon stabbed her 55-year-old husband in bed at their Nether Providence home in February of last year. According to The Delaware County Daily Times, Garcia-Pellon admitted to the crime, and using a kitchen knife as the murder weapon. White was the starting center on the Penn team that made it to the Final Four in 1979. He was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers and played in Europe. Philly.com reported that Garcia-Mellon first crossed paths with White in Spain during his time there as a professional athlete. During her trial, experts said that when the murder took place the defendant already had a schizo-affective diagnosis, the news outlet reported. According to the website, Garcia-Pellon told a friend in the wake of the slaying that her husband's viewing of child pornography was the reason she murdered him.

However, detectives said pornographic images were not recovered from the couple's computers, the website reported. Garcia-Pellon claimed to be afraid of her husband trying to murder her so as to stop her from warning of a Sandy Hook shooting-style attack, according to Philly.com. One day ahead of the murder Garcia-Pellon was released from a hospital and scheduled to later see a psychiatrist, after her husband took her in over her mental health issues, the website reported.","A suburban Philadelphia judge found Maria Garcia-Pellon, 54, guilty of voluntary manslaughter in Matthew White's death .

"The world's most expensive home is lying unused and abandoned because its billionaire owners believe moving in will bring them bad luck. The 27-storey, billion-dollar tower in Mumbai, called Antilia, is said to have fallen foul of vastu shastra - an obscure Hindu version of feng shui. Built for India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani - ranked by Forbes as the ninth wealthiest person in the world with a fortune of $27billion - Antilia has dominated the Mumbai skyline since being completed last year. Abandoned: The 27-storey Antilla, built by Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai, India, is still uninhabitated reportedly because it its billionaire owner believes it would be bad luck if he moved in . But speculation has grown as to why Mr Ambani, his wife Nita and their two children have not moved into their extravagant new home. Certainly the property - which has three helipads, six floors of parking and a series of floating gardens - is comfortable enough. According to reports, the Ambani family is concerned the building fails to conform with the ancient Indian architectural principles of vastu shastra, and has refused to move in for fear the home will curse them with bad luck. Expensive: The ancient Hindu tradition of vastu shastra emphasises the importance of facing the rising sun, but Antilla is said to not have enough windows on its eastern side . Opulent: Antilla cost $1billion to build and features three helipads, six floors of car parking and rising gardens, as well as a theatre and ballroom . Rival: Construction work at J.K. House in Breach Candy, Mumbai. The skyscraper is being built by the Singhania family, and is strikingly similar to Antilla . Bad luck? Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has a fortune of $27billion, but has not moved into his dream house a year after it was finished . Film screenings have been staged in its state-of-the-art theatre and dinners held in its grand ballroom, served by staff trained by the luxury Oberoi hotel chain. But its owners return at the end of each party to their former ancestral home, never staying the night. Vastu, a philosophy that guides Hindu temple architecture, emphasises the importance of facing the rising sun - and despite the staggering sum spent on Antilia the building's eastern side does not have enough windows or other openings to let residents receive sufficient morning light. Instead of moving into their dream home, the Ambanis continue to stay in the more modest, 14-storey apartment tower at the south end of the city that they share, on different floors, with the rest of their extended family. Tushar Pania, a spokesman for Mr Ambani's company Reliance Industries, dismissed questions about whether the family was reluctant to live at Antilia as idle gossip. Last year, as it was nearing completion, many Mumbai residents criticised the building as an ostentatious display of wealth in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day. Half a mile from Mr Ambani's 27-storey tower, a competing skyscraper is making its way into Mumbai's skyline. The building is being constructed by the Singhania family, which controls Indian suit maker the Raymond Group. Seen at a distance, the two buildings are strikingly similar, with soaring columns, large sea-facing windows and a nearly identical jigsaw puzzle facade. Each floor of the tower is made from different . materials to give an individual look. Numerous powder rooms and reception areas lead . off the lobby which has nine elevators . Glitz and glamour: Crystal chandeliers take up most of the ceiling in the ballroom. There is also a stage for entertainers and a kitchen which can serve hundreds of guests .

"The world’s largest safety inquiry into GM crops and linked pesticides has been announced. The $25million - £15.6m - project will involve feeding trials with 6,000 rats at laboratories in Western Europe and Russia. The research, which is being run under the banner of Factor GMO, involves a collaboration between European, American and Russian scientists. It is being organised by the Russian National Association for Genetic Safety, which describes itself as a non-governmental, non-profit organisation, and will be overseen by a board of neutral scientists. The largest safety inquiry into GM crops and linked pesticides is to held, using 6,000 rats to test the products . To date, most of the safety research on GM crops and farming systems has been conducted or funded by the biotech companies, such as Monsanto, or critics of the technology. Factor GMO says its research will be independent of vested interests and will finally give an answer to questions about the safety of GM crops and the associated weedkiller glyphosate. Some rat feeding trials have linked the two to an increased risk of cancer, however these have been dismissed by the industry and the European Food Safety Authority. Most GM crops, such as soya and maize, have been genetically engineered to withstand spraying with glyphosate, which is the active ingredient in the weedkiller sold as the brand Roundup. This allows farmers’ fields to be blanket sprayed with the chemical, which kills off the weeds but allows the crops to thrive. The scientific review board overseeing the research includes Dr Bruce Blumberg, the Professor of Developmental and Cell Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of California. He said: ‘The Factor GMO study has the potential to provide invaluable information on the health effects of a commercialised, herbicide-resistant GM food and its associated herbicide. ‘The cultivation of herbicide resistant crops is widespread in the US, and the use of the herbicides to which these crops are resistant has increased many-fold in the decades since they were introduced. ‘There is a notable lack of published, peer-reviewed data on their safety, as well as data on the safety of the increased use of herbicides with which they are grown. The Factor GMO study could be very useful in reducing the uncertainty about the safety of these products.’ Elena Sharoykina of Factor GMO said: ‘Food is the main source of energy for all living beings, and its safety is the key to their health and well-being, as well as to sustainable development. In order to prevent irreversible consequences, humankind must ensure the total safety of GM crops and their associated pesticides before they are planted even more widely.’ It is hoped the study will answer questions about how safe GM crops and linked pesticides are for humans . She said: ‘Comprehensive scientific safety studies on GM organisms and their related pesticides are long overdue. ‘All previous studies caused controversy for various reasons: choice of animal, insufficient statistics, duration of tests, research parameters, and researchers’ connections to the anti-GM movement or the biotech industry. ‘Factor GMO is intended to remedy the situation. The project organisers have considered all of the points of disagreement and distrust surrounding this subject. Factor GMO has in its arsenal a scientific protocol drawn up with all the necessary standards, an international scientific team of leading professionals with a neutral background, independent funding, and perhaps most importantly, full transparency.’ Dr Oxana Sinitsyna, who works in  Russia’s Sysin Research Institute of Human Ecology and Environmental Health and will sit of the governing board, said most rat feeding trials with GM food have been limited to 90 days and looked at two generations. This project will follow five generations of rats as part of a comprehensive study lasting two to three years. It will look at any changes to cancer rates or any birth abnormalities. Elena Sharoykina is part of Factor GMO and said the study was long  overdue and will be transparent, with independent scientists on board . She said: ‘There has never been comprehensive research investigating the effects of a GM food on reproductive function.’ Dr Fiorella Belpoggi, who is director and chief of pathology of the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Centre of the Ramazzini Institute, in Bentivoglio, Italy, said: ‘The concern over GM crops is largely due to the fact that plant breeders can construct synthetic DNA sequences and insert these into crop genomes, effectively adding new traits to the plant. ‘This raises enormous possibilities for developing benign products, but equally it has the potential to create products with unwanted traits and side-effects. ‘The long-term study design will reveal any effects that take time to show up. It could provide the detailed data needed for a scientific evidenced-based risk assessment of possible human health hazards from the GM crop and its associated pesticide.’ Funding for the research is to come from private donors, rather than the industry or campaigners. A list will be published. Biotech companies insist that many studies have already proved that GM crops and food and safe. Dr Julian Little, chairman of the industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, said: ‘The plant biotechnology industry takes product safety regarding biotech food and feed very seriously and is committed to the highest standards of testing for its products. ‘The Factor GMO study is far from the biggest ever study on the safety of GM, despite claims from its sponsors. ‘It falls a long way short of the European Commission’s report in 2011 when they released research from over 130 research projects, involving 500 independent research groups, over the period of 25 years, at a cost of €300m, which concluded that ‘there is, as of today, no scientific evidence associating GMOs with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms.’","The £15.6m project will involve using 6,000 rats to test safety of GM crops .

"The paedophile brother of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was told he had committed the greatest breach of trust imaginable as he was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter. Liam Adams, 58, from west Belfast, showed no visible sign of remorse as a judge passed sentence in Belfast Crown Court, shaking his head occasionally during the hearing and then smiling and laughing as he was led from the dock. As his crimes were committed at a time when offenders in Northern Ireland were still eligible for 50 per cent remission on jail terms - a policy that has since been reformed - Adams is set to be released after spending eight years behind bars. Liam Adams (left), the brother of Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams (right), arrives at Belfast Crown Court. He has been jailed for child sex abuse . The former youth worker was found . guilty last month of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child Aine . Dahlstrom when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and . early 1980s. The . 40-year-old, who has waived her right to anonymity, wiped tears from her . eyes as she watched on from the public gallery of court 14 as her . father found out the length of the jail term awaiting him. Handing . down the sentence, which comprised 16 years in custody and a further . two years on probation, Judge Corinne Philpott said Adams's continued . refusal to admit his guilt was still denying his daughter the closure . she sought. 'It has been . clear throughout that Mrs Dahlstrom simply wanted an acknowledgement . from her father that what he had done to her during her childhood was . wrong,' she said. 'He has always denied her this acknowledgement and continues to do so. 'However she now at least knows that the jury must have found her evidence compelling as they believed her.' The . judge added: 'This case involved the greatest breach of trust . imaginable where a father instead of caring for and protecting his . daughter himself abused her.' During the trial Ms Dahlstrom gave graphic details of the abuse, which started when she was aged four . Liam . Adams, from Bernagh Drive, was found guilty of 10 offences against his . daughter - three counts of rape, four of indecent assault and three of . gross indecency. The abuse was committed over a five-year period between 1977 and 1981. Bespectacled . Adams, dressed in brown jacket, jeans and blue checked shirt, supported . himself with a walking stick as he stood to hear his sentence. His . convictions have heaped pressure on his high-profile older brother to . explain why he did not alert the authorities to the abuse allegations . when he first learned of them. During . a first trial earlier this year, which collapsed, the Sinn Fein leader, . now a public representative in the Irish Republic, claimed he first . heard of the sex abuse claims in 1987 and, 13 years later, his younger . brother admitted his guilt to him while the pair were walking in the . rain. The former west Belfast MP faced criticism for not informing police about the alleged confession for another nine years. Leaving court: Aine Dahlstrom (third right), daughter of Liam Adams, is . supported by family and friends after the trial ended in October . Police . Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers recommended the Public . Prosecution Service (PPS) take no case against the Sinn Fein veteran. Northern . Ireland's police ombudsman is now investigating if detectives properly . examined whether Gerry Adams covered up the crimes and the PSNI has . pledged to review the case. Northern Ireland's attorney general John . Larkin is examining the role of prosecutors. Gerry . Adams, who was not in court today, instead attending the funeral of . well known priest Alec Reid in west Belfast, has insisted he committed . no offence and accused political rivals of exploiting a family issue to . attack him. Ahead of passing sentence, Judge Philpott outlined details of his brother's crimes. Three . of the convictions relate to an incident in May 1978 when he raped and . further sexually abused his daughter when her mother was in hospital . giving birth to her younger brother. The judge said Adams would warn his daughter that if she told on him he would be sent to jail. 'Mrs . Dahlstrom told the court in the evidence that even as a young child she . had an understanding that what was happening was wrong but that she did . not understand why her father was doing it to her,' she said. Ms Philpott said he committed the abuse when he was angry, sometimes drunk and sometimes sober. 'She remembers the smell of his breath when he had taken drink and he was pressing down on her chest,' the judge told the court. Mrs . Dahlstrom first brought the matter to police in 1987. This was in the . midst of the Northern Ireland Troubles and a time when many people in . republican communities distrusted and refused to co-operate with the . security forces. She did not . pursue the matter at that stage, claiming that detectives were more . interested to hear information about her famous uncle than about the . allegations she was levelling against her father. It . would not be for another 20 years before she went to police again, . after finding out that her father was working in a west Belfast youth . club that her children attended. As . well as spending two years on probation at the end of his prison . sentence, Adams will be placed on the sex offenders register . indefinitely and will be barred from working with children. Among . the aggravating factors the judge took into account when passing . sentence were the age of the victim, the horrific nature of the crimes, . and the continuing impact on Mrs Dahlstrom. She . said the victim had described how the abuse impacted on her education, . affecting her concentration and motivation in the classroom, while in . later life she has found herself being overprotective when it came to . her own children. Ms Philpott said the trial had also taken its toll on . Mrs Dahlstrom and recalled how her evidence had to be delayed at one . stage after she developed chest pains. Another aggravating factor was the major breach of trust committed, the judge said. Ms . Philpott added: 'The evidence has established in the view of this court . that he used this child for his own sexual gratification, whenever he . had the opportunity when her mother was not present in the house.' She . said the only mitigating factors were his poor health - he suffers from . both inflammation of the arteries (temporal arteritis) and . osteoarthritis, a lack of significant previous criminal record, and the . fact that no evidence of further sexual offending since 1981 had . emerged. Mrs Dahlstrom did not make a public comment on the sentence as she left the court.

"Police believe Alan Edwards, 46, deliberately drove his car into a parked big-rig off the 5 Freeway near Castaic, California, in the early hours of Monday . Police believe a 46-year-old father deliberately killed himself and his two young children by driving his car into a parked big-rig off the 5 Freeway near Castaic, California. Alan Edwards of Lancaster was killed, along with Erick Edwards, 9, and Alona  Edwards, 5, where their 1997 Honda Accord slammed head-on into the parked tractor trailer in the early hours of Monday morning. The incident happened just before 1 a.m. and investigators were immediately suspicious because the driver had had to intentionally maneuver in order to hit the back of the rig. ‘Because of this we don’t believe he fell asleep,’ Eddie Hernandez, a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department homicide detective, told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal. There was no evidence Edwards had braked, the lieutenant said, adding that he and his wife Sherri were going through a divorce and custody battle over the children after eight years of marriage. On Friday, Sherri had sold the family’s home in Lancaster but neglected to tell her estranged husband about the sale, she said. When Edwards arrived to collect the kids for the weekend, he found the home virtually empty and sold. Scroll down for video .

"Taylor Swift accepted an honor at the American Music Awards on Sunday night and used the spotlight to proclaim that 'music should be consumed in albums.' The speech highlighted views that put her at odds with the streaming service  Spotify, which she has stated before does not 'fairly compensate' artists. 'What you did by going out and investing in music and albums is you are saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in,' said Swift. Scroll down for video . Platinum: Taylor Swift accepted the Dick Clarke Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards and made a plea for music to be 'consumed in albums' 'That music is valuable and music should be consumed in albums and albums should be consumed as art and appreciated,' she continued. The remarks were similar to those she made after pulling her three albums from Spotify earlier this month. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Swift had put Shake it Off, the lead single from her new album 1989, up for streaming as she tried to stay 'open minded' about changes in the music industry. 'It didn't feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, ""If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it's theirs now and they don't have to pay for it.""' The criticism was expanded upon by Aloe Blacc, who stated in Wired that the song 'Wake Me Up,' which he co-wrote and sang for Avicii, earned only $12,359 from Pandora, in spite being played 168 million times. Swift opened the festivities Sunday with a fiery performance of 'Blank Space' that echoed her lampooning of the 'crazy ex' theme from her recently released music video. Jilted: Swift also performed 'Blank Space,' creating an even more outsized parody of the 'crazy ex' cliche than the music video for the single . Who's crazy now?: Swift pulled her entire catalog from streaming service Spotify earlier in the month and also became the first - and only - artist to have an album certified platinum in 2014 . She was later presented with the Dick Clark Award for Excellence, in the same month she became the first artist to go platinum in 2014. She was given the award by Diana Ross, and said she was 'so honored' to share the stage with the acclaimed diva.

"Lena Dunham has finally responded to claims she made up a story about being raped by an acquaintance in college, detailed in a passage from her new book Not That Kind of Girl, and she's sticking by her story. The star and creator of HBO's Girls, wrote an essay on Buzzfeed to address reports claiming to have identified a man named 'Barry' who matched the descriptions of the man who raped her after a party when she was attending Oberlin College nearly a decade ago. The man interviewed by Breitbart and the National Review denied the claims, saying he never even met Dunham during their time at the Ohio liberal arts college. Dunham has now clarified that 'Barry' was just a pseudonym she designed to protect the identity of her attacker, who she never meant to identify in the story.  Instead, she says she wrote the essay to bring comfort to other victims like herself and that she intends to continue raising awareness of the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. Scroll down for video . Not his name: Lena Dunham says she changed the name of a man who allegedly raped her, when she described the incident in an essay in her new book Not That Kind of Girl . In Not That Kind of Girl, Dunham describes the night she was walked home by the acquaintance  - a mustachioed Republican who hosted his own campus radio show. While Dunham admits her memory of the night is hazy, having been drunk and high on cocaine and Xanax, she remains steadfast that she did not consent to having sex with Barry, who was aggressive and twice tried to pull off a condom during the assault. However, she says it took her a long time to process the attack as a rape, and reach a point in her life where she was comfortable enough to write about it and share it in her book. Following the book's release, some publications, including conservative websites Breitbart and Nation Review, sought to identify the Oberlin alumnus who raped the writer, using details from the book to narrow down the list of possible attackers. Both Brietbart and National Review were led by their research to a man named Barry, who was a prominent campus Republican when Dunham attended the institution. They looked for men named Barry, since Dunham did not explicitly state that the attacker's name was changed, as she did for other stories in the book. The man Breitbart identified as 'Barry One' (to protect his real name) vehemently denied ever meeting Dunham, and says his reputation has now been tarnished because of the book. Scene: It is believed the rape Dunham describes in her book took place at Oberlin College in Ohio (pictured) in the winter of 2005 following a party . He told the National Review that the experience of being connected to the attack was the 'most unfortunate coincidence of my life'. But in the Buzzfeed article published Tuesday, Dunham confirmed that 'Barry' was not the name of her attacker, and that she's sorry someone else has been falsely tied to the crime. 'To be very clear, “Barry” is a pseudonym, not the name of the man who assaulted me, and any resemblance to a person with this name is an unfortunate and surreal coincidence. I am sorry about all he has experienced.' Dunham went on to explain her reason for writing about the rape, saying she never meant for her rapist to be identified and she does not plan to press charges. 'Speaking out was never about exposing the man who assaulted me. Rather, it was about exposing my shame, letting it dry out in the sun. 'I did not wish to be contacted by him or to open a criminal investigation. I am in a loving and peaceful place in my life and I am not willing to sacrifice any more of it for this person I do not know, aside from one night I will never forget. That is my choice.' While Dunham says she expected the story might cause controversy, she did not think it would lead to assassinations on her credibility. Dunham wrote Tuesday's response essay to stop the questions, which she believes have been 'used to cast doubt on other women who have been sexually assaulted'. Dunham finishes the essay by saying she will continue to fight for change on college campuses, where rising rates of sexual assault have become a national concern. 'Prevention and response on campuses is only a small part of the problem with how we as a nation are handling sexual assault. But it’s a good place to start. Educational spaces must be made safe, so that we leave them stronger and poised to enact change,' Dunham writes. Aaron Minc, the attorney for the man named Barry, said he had received a statement from Random House promising to make clear that Barry is not a real name in any form - although the publisher has not made any public statement itself. 'The statement ignores the fact they let my client hang out there for two months, he’s been damaged,' Mr Minc said. 'We are gratified that they put it out there my client isn’t that guy, but we're not completely satisfied, . 'We haven't heard from Lena herself, just the publisher and we want to hear from her at some point exonerating ""Barry"". 'Lena Dunham is the only person with first-hand knowledge who can truly clear my client’s name.' Mr Minc - who confirmed to MailOnline Barry had never actually met Ms Dunham - added: 'My client reached out to Ms Dunham's literary agent as early as October 6. He had three reporters contact him within a 48 hour period and he noticed his LinkedIn views skyrocketed into the hundreds. 'He was called at work and at home. He was told by Ms Dunham's agent 'let's not fan the flames', but then watched, to his dismay as she issued statements over Twitter fanning the flames in a so-called 'rage spiral', adding more ambiguity as to the identify of this alleged rapist.' He added: 'Until yesterday, we had really been treated with compete indifference. We are now in discussions with Dunham and Penguin Random House to remedy this situation. 'This book has already sold about 30,000 copies and will sell around a million copies, we need the book to be edited, so the confusion stops. 'I believe the publishers are amenable to doing something like that.' The publisher acted as soon as it became public that Barry, with the help of his lawyer, had set up a legal fund to defend his reputation and has already raised nearly $24,000. Random House has also offered to pay Barry’s legal fees accrued to date in the case. Today, Mr Minc released a statement saying while he welcomed Random House's offer to pay Barry's legal expenses, he found the publisher to have committed a 'grievous error.' And he added: 'Our work, however, is not complete. Random House’s offer to foot legal expenses already incurred fails to take into account the fact there are still ongoing legal expense because of their mistakes. 'We will continue to keep the GoFundMe campaign active to raise money for survivors of sexual assaults and for Barry’s ongoing legal expenses until we receive an apology from Ms. Dunham and both Ms. Dunham and Random House have taken all appropriate steps to clear Barry’s name and restore the damage caused to his reputation.'","Lena Dunham used her book to describe how 'Barry', a 'flamboyant Republican', raped her at Oberlin College .

"Shocked: Police are still investigating the mystery shock that killed Christian Lorinczy, 13, after he touched the fence at a middle school football game . A Michigan teen has died after being injured by an electrical shock at a middle school football game, authorities say. Christian Lorinczy, 13, of Ypsilanti, was playing catch with his friends during a middle school football game at the Ypsilanti Lincoln High School football field at around 8.30pm Tuesday when their football was thrown over a nearby fence,CBS Detroit reports. The eighth-grader went to retrieve the ball and was found, by his friends, lying near the fence. Authorities say that Lorinczy received an electric shock when he leaned against the fence on a metal ramp leading to the bleachers. Michigan Live reports that an off-duty Augusta Township firefighter and a nurse who were in the crowd immediately went to help the boy. Lorinczy was then rushed to C.S. Mott Children's Hospital where he was listed in critical condition. Lincoln Middle School administrators shared the news of Lorinczy's death Friday morning on the Lincoln Consolidated School's website: . 'Dear Lincoln Families, . We have some very difficult news to share. As all of you know, Christian Lorinczy, a student at Lincoln Middle School, was involved in a very serious accident on Tuesday night. We had hoped that he would fully recover, but unfortunately, this morning we learned that Christian has passed away... Our thoughts are with the Lorinczy family and the entire Lincoln community at this very difficult time.' After the incident, CBS Detroit reports, the stands were evacuated, the football game was cancelled, and power to the field was shut off. Authorities are still investigating what could have caused the fence to deliver an electric shock. Mystery: The mystery of what could have caused the fence to shock the boy is concerning parents and Ypsilanti community members . Ellen Bonter, superintendent at Lincoln Consolidated Schools, told Michigan live that Lorinczy's incident is the first she's heard of the fence being electrically charged. However, a Lincoln High School freshman told Michigan Live that numerous students knew the handicap ramp's railing could deliver an electric shock. Ellen Bonter, superintendent of Lincoln Consolidated Schools, said Tuesday night was the first she heard of the handicap ramp's fence being electrically charged . A DTE energy spokesperson also told Michigan Live that crews were called to the scene shortly after the incident, but it was determined that the Michigan-based company's equipment was not involved in injuring the boy. The mystery of what could have caused the fence to shock the boy is concerning parents and Ypsilanti community members. Parent Linga McClair expressed in an interview with Detroit Local 4 news her concern for her daughter and nieces who spend a lot of time at the school's football field. 'It just seems really strange,' McClair said. 'So, it's concerning and so we want to find out why.'","Christian Lorinczy, 13, died after being shocked by a handicap ramp fence at a Michigan middle school football game .

Tragic: Brooke Baures (pictured, left, and, right, in her gymnastics attire) was found dead in a restaurant's dumbwaiter - she died of severe head injuries after getting her head caught in a dumbwaiter, according to an autopsy report . Horrifying:The 21-year-old died after the dumbwaiter descended and her head was trapped (stock photo) Scene: Baures was working at a banquet on the second floor of WingDam Saloon and Grill when the accident happened on December 1 . Mork said the cook, who was located in the kitchen, heard the food elevator begin to descend to his access point on the first floor.' 'He [didn't] hear vocalizations of any kind. When the cab landed on the first floor he walked up expecting to see dirty dishes and immediately recognized that a person was trapped inside.' Fountain City Police say they believe Baures was the only person who could have pressed the control button on the second floor. The report notes that 'due to the absence of doors on the cab specifically, an operator must physically stay clear of the device as it ascends or descends to avoid injury.' 'It is our finding at this point that no crime occurred in this tragedy,' Mork also said. Accident: Police said Tuesday that ''It is our finding at this point that no crime occurred in this tragedy' According to the autopsy results, Baures sustained fatal crushing injuries to her brainstem and cerebellum after the dumbwaiter passed through the second floor. Mork said 'FCPD believes that Brooke's head was almost located almost entirely inside the cab of the elevator canted slightly to her right as the cab descended. 'When the roof of the cab passed the sill of the second floor access, Brooke sustained fatal crushing injuries to her brainstem and cerebellum,' the release said. Anyone operating the dumbwaiter had only about five seconds before the interior of the cab disappeared below the sill, police said. The dumbwaiter has since been permanently removed. Federal and state regulators have launched separate investigations. Speaking previously to the Winona Daily News, Mr Mork added: 'To explain more of her specific location, orientation or obvious injuries would require an extremely graphic explanation.'

'I think one of my co-workers got (caught) in, like, our dumbwaiter,' the co-worker explained through tears. 'But I'm not willing to look close enough.' The dispatcher then asked another employee at the Fountain City venue to look at Miss Baures's apparently contorted remains, according to the recording obtained by the newspaper. The employee confirmed: 'It's her. We need someone here like ASAP.' Miss Baures was twice named the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference gymnast of the week this year and documented her athletics career enthusiastically on social media.

"It is considered the villain of the animal kingdom - a pilferer obsessed with stealing trinkets. But it appears the magpie has been unfairly maligned all along. For despite its centuries-old reputation, new research suggests that the bird is not attracted to shiny objects after all. In fact, as animal psychologists have discovered, magpies are actually quite repelled by unfamiliar items. Psychologists from the University of Exeter discovered that, contrary to popular belief, magpies (stock image pictured) are actually frightened of new and unfamiliar objects, rather than attracted to them . The idea of the magpie as a pilferer that steals sparkly items for its nest is a common theme in European folklore. Rossini made it the theme of his 1817 opera The Thieving Magpie, in which a servant girl is executed for stealing silver jewellery that had been pinched by a bird. Suspicion of the bird is common in folklore and myth. In western Europe and North America magpies are often thought to be bearers of bad omens, and associated with the devil. Negative connotations surrounding magpies can be traced back to Shakespeare, when their 'chattering' was referenced, and moaned about. Other myths claim the birds were the only ones not to join Noah on the ark. Superstitious people will often salute and greet a magpie to avoid experiencing bad luck. The Tintin comic ‘The Castafiore Emerald’ has a similar plot, in which a prized emerald stolen by a magpie. But scientists at the University of Exeter have now debunked the myth, proving that magpies are not the flighty thieves we thought they were. The researchers carried out a series of tests on wild magpies and a group of the birds housed at a rescue centre. Under carefully controlled conditions, they were exposed to both shiny and non-shiny items and their reactions recorded. Lead researcher Dr Toni Shephard, from the university’s Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, said: ‘We did not find evidence of an unconditional attraction to shiny objects in magpies. ‘Instead, all objects prompted responses indicating neophobia - fear of new things. ‘We suggest that humans notice when magpies occasionally pick up shiny objects because they believe the birds find them attractive, while it goes unnoticed when magpies interact with less eye-catching items. ‘It seems likely, therefore, that the folklore surrounding them is a result of cultural generalisation and anecdotes rather than evidence.’ The research, published in the journal Animal Cognition, used shiny metal screws, small foil rings and aluminium foil. The researchers carried out a series of experiments with both a group of magpies which had come from a rescue centre, and wild magpies in the grounds of the university (pictured). Magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests. Both times a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded . Half the screws and rings were painted matt blue while the rest retained their original silvery shine. In the experiments, shiny and non-shiny objects were placed on the ground 11 inches (30cm) from a pile of food in the form of nuts. Wild magpies only made contact with a shiny object twice in 64 tests, the researchers reported. On both occasions, a silver ring was picked up and immediately discarded. Both the shiny and blue objects were either ignored or avoided. Often, the magpies exhibited wary behaviour by feeding less when the items were nearby. During the study with captive birds, no contact was made with any of the objects. Co-author Dr Natalie Hempel de Ibarra said: ‘Surprisingly little research has investigated the cognitive mechanisms of magpie behaviour. ‘Similarly to other large-brained members of the crow family with complex social systems, magpies are capable of sophisticated mental feats, such as mirror self-recognition, retrieval of hidden objects and remembering where and when they have hoarded what food item. ‘Instead of being compulsively drawn towards shiny objects, magpies decide to keep a safe distance when these objects are novel and unexpected.’","Psychologists from Exeter University carried out tests on magpie groups .

"Traditionally, a sandwich shop is a pretty good place  to work out where someone is from – do they order a roll, a bap or a barm? These days, however, it might not be such an accurate marker. Because wherever we live, more and more of us are now using ‘roll’, once a southern word. Roll, barm or bap? Participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers, a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll, and asked what word they would use for them . A survey found that while many regional divisions remain, they are slowly being worn away – particularly when it comes to the word for a soft piece of bread. Linguistics researchers at Manchester University surveyed 1,400 people from Moray in Scotland down to Cornwall. They ranged in age from ten to 87. The participants were shown a picture of everyday objects including a pair of trousers, a pair of shoes and what southerners would call a roll, and asked what word they would use for them. The researchers then compared their results with maps put together several decades ago. The results showed that the word ‘bun’ is still common in Tyneside, ‘barm’ and ‘muffin’ are used in the . North West, ‘tea cake’ north of Manchester and ‘cob’ in the Midlands. But the word ‘roll’ – which used to be used largely by those in the South East – is now used throughout the country, with more than a third of those who responded choosing it. The southern word trousers is also used across the country, whereas the word ‘pants’ is restricted mostly to the North. The words ‘pumps’ and ‘plimsolls’ are used across the country, but the former is more prevalent in the North and the latter in the South. Pronunciation is also becoming more southern. Dr Laurel MacKenzie, who led the study, said: ‘This research shows a clear North-South divide in many of the words we choose to use when describing everyday items, and the way we pronounce them. North/South divide: The southern word trousers is also used across the country, whereas the word pants is restricted mostly to the North. The words pumps and plimsolls are used across the country, but the former is more prevalent in the North and the latter in the South . ‘Variation is pervasive in language, and often correlates with social factors, like age, socio-economic status and a person’s place of origin. ‘However, we’ve compared our maps to those put together a few decades ago, and it looks like the southern pronunciation is slowly creeping northward.’ Despite that, there are still significant regional variations in pronunciation. For example ‘one’ and ‘gone’ typically rhyme when spoken by northerners, but not southerners. Those in the Midlands, meanwhile, could not make up their mind if they were northern or southern. Like northerners, they rhyme ‘one’ and ‘gone’, but follow the South in failing to rhyme the words ‘foot’ and ‘strut’. Dr MacKenzie added: ‘It’s not clear why different words are used to describe the same thing in different parts of the country. ‘There are sometimes anecdotal explanations – for instance, daps, the South West’s word for sports shoes, is said to be an abbreviation of Dunlop Athletic Plimsolls.’ The source of regional differences in pronunciation is often more clearly understood. Dr MacKenzie explained: ‘The northern way of rhyming the words ‘put’ and ‘cut’, for example, is faithful to how these words were pronounced centuries ago. ‘Speakers in the South moved away from this  pronunciation in the 1500s, but their way of saying these words didn’t make it to the North.’","Linguistics researchers at Manchester University surveyed 1,400 people .

"Warning: Lord Ashdown said today that British forces must withdraw from Afghanistan as quickly as possible before any more troops are killed . It is 'crystal clear' the war in Afghanistan is completely lost and is not worth wasting the life of one more British soldier, Lord Ashdown has said today. In the 11-year-conflict 438 Britons have died and the former Liberal Democrat leader believes that our armed forces should 'get out now' to avoid any more bloodshed. The Prime Minister wants to withdraw the 9,000 British troops by the end of 2014 as long as it fits with America's own plans. But Lord Ashdown says it should be much sooner saying 'the longer it takes, the greater the sacrifice' as more deaths are not in battle, they are at the hands of members of the Afghan police or army. Despite being trained by Allied forces traitors have killed 14 UK soldiers and 47 others so far this year. 'It is now crystal clear that we have lost in Afghanistan,' Lord Ashdown wrote in The Times today, adding: 'It is . not worth wasting one more life in Afghanistan. 'What can be done to stop Afghanistan internally unravelling into . chaos has already been done. The only outcome of staying longer is more . deaths for no purpose; most of them now caused not by the enemy in front of . our troops, but by the enemy among them.' The fourteen British troops who have been killed by their Afghan allies this . year account for almost one in three of all fatalities in the country, which is 61. The latest murder involved a British Army officer who was shot dead by an Afghan soldier as he played in a Remembrance Day football match. Dangerous: British Royal Marines patrl in Afghanistan but more and more soldiers are being killed by insiders rather than in battle . Captain Walter Barrie, 41, from The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was killed at Forward Operating Base Shawqat in the Nad-e Ali district. Capt Barrie, from Glasgow, was shot when the traitor opened fire with an AK47 assault rifle as UK and Afghan forces took part in the kickabout. The Ministry of Defence also confirmed that two troops shot dead last month – female Army medic Corporal Channing Day, 25, and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, a Royal Marine – were also killed by a renegade Afghan policeman. A British Army commander also warned last month that the threat from inside will continue to increase. Tragic: Captain Walter Barrie, 41, (pictured with his son Callum) who was shot dead by a rogue member of the Afghan army as he played in a football match on Remembrance Day . Mourning: Walter Barrie is carried at RAF Brize Norton airbase - and is one of 14 Britons who have died in this way this year . Brigadier Doug Chalmers says a proportion of Afghan forces will always be unreliable, leading to calls that they should be better vetted. Lord Ashdown says there is nothing that can be achieved in the war-torn country now. 'All that we can achieve has now been achieved,' Lord Ashdown wrote. 'All . that we might have achieved if we had done things differently has been lost. The only rational policy is to leave quickly, in good order and in the . company of our allies. This is the only cause for which further lives should . be risked. 'We have succeeded in only one thing; albeit the big thing we first said we . went to war for — driving out al-Qaeda. In almost all the other tasks we set . ourselves, especially the establishment of a sustainable state, we have . failed.'

"England will at last stage another major football tournament after Wembley was awarded the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 in Geneva on Friday. Munich withdrew from the final stages bid at the last moment making the choice of London and Wembley by UEFA's executive committee unanimous. The tournament is being staged in 13 cities across Europe – the brainchild of UEFA president Michel Platini. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch...

Baku, Azerbaijan . Munich, Germany . Rome, Italy . St Petersburg, Russia . THREE GROUP GAMES AND ONE LAST 16 MATCH . Dublin, Republic of Ireland . Glasgow, Scotland . Copenhagen, Denmark . Bucharest, Romania . Amsterdam, Holland . Bilbao, Spain . Budapest, Hungary . Brussels, Belgium . After the doomed bids to hold the World Cups in 2006 and 2018, this was the first successful campaign by the FA since the decision in Lisbon 1992 to award Euro 96 to England. FA chairman Greg Dyke said: 'We’re delighted it’s nice to win one. Wembley is a great stadium and What a good idea this is to play a tournament across Europe, congratulations to UEFA. 'Some of our England players will still be around. It can be a great of them to take us to Wembley. It’s a brave man who predicts the winners of tournaments.' The UEFA vote for Wembley – held in an eyesore exhibition building in Geneva – was regarded almost as a foregone conclusion with the big FA party including England manager Roy Hodgson, FA chairman Greg Dyke and past and present Ministers of Sport Helen Grant and Kate Hoey, London Mayor Boris Johnson’s Commissioner for sport. UEFA regard Wembley as their favourite stadium on the continent, especially with its money-making potential from the tier of 17,000 corporate seats. The ground has hosted UEFA’s flagship Champions League final twice in the last four years. It was a complicated secret ballot with the 17-strong voting UEFA executive, which includes Manchester United director David Gill not involved in any vote involving their own country. This much needed boost for Wembley also comes with the stadium starting next year the task of renewing the corporate seats sales that bankrolled the ground when they were sold as 10-year packages in 2007. Platini said 'It was a dream and now it has become a reality' as he opened the envelope with London’s name inside. The four cities chosen to host quarter-finals and three group stages were predictably oil-rich Baku, Munich, St Petersburg and Rome all of which have 60,000 capacity stadiums. Raheem Sterling is one of the young England players who could feature at Euro 2020 . Wembley beat Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena in the race to stage the prestigious matches . Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that Wembley would host the Euro 2020 final in exchange for England's support of Germany's 2024 European Championship bid . Copenhagen, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Dublin, Bilbao, Budapest, Brussels and Glasgow will host three group games and a round of 16 tie. The biggest losers were Wales who were expected to be chosen in front of Scotland with Glasgow the last city to be named by Platini in a zonal pair with Dublin’s Aviva Stadium. Wales had been fearful the night before the vote that UEFA politics would ensure an inferior bid was chosen to make for a better spread of venues across Eastern Europe. But they will be devastated at missing out by one vote to Glasgow, whose Hampden Park commercial plans were described as 'inadequate' by UEFA inspectors. Scotland FA chief executive Stewart Regan made special mention about the role played by former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in helping Hampden across the line. He said: 'Everyone saw that Glasgow was capable of with the Commonwealth Games and that really put Glasgow on the map. 'Sir Alex came in last week with a video in support of our bid and spoke passionately about it and I am sure that must have helped. 'We knew we had a strong bid . We focused on the fact that this is the 60th anniversary and we focused on the history and heritage of football. 'We knew Michel Platini is a football man and that’s why we played strongest on and that’s why we used Sir Alex.' Hampden Park in Glasgow will host three group matches and a round of 16 tie . The heritage of the stadium and its successful hosting of the athletics during the Commonwealth Games are also said to have played in part in them piping Wales by one vote. A statement from the Welsh FA, meanwhile, said: 'The FAW is obviously extremely disappointed by today’s news but would like to congratulate those cities that have been chosen as UEFA EURO 2020 host cities. 'We believed that the Millennium Stadium, with its 74,154 capacity and extensive Skybox and hospitality facilities, would have been an ideal venue for UEFA EURO 2020 and provide UEFA with significant revenues. 'In addition, we proposed strong transport and accommodation plans given that four international airports are located within two hours of Cardiff and that we secured accommodation for 41,000 supporters, all in areas covered by the FAW’s free travel commitment. 'We also proposed that any surplus generated from Cardiff hosting UEFA EURO 2020 matches would have been invested into community football projects throughout Wales. But we of course respect UEFA’s decision. 'The FAW would like to thank all the partners that worked so hard to support Cardiff’s bid. While they, like us, will be disappointed with today’s news, there is much to be positive about Welsh football as we look to the future.' The other cities that will host the first pan-European tournament across 13 venues– the 60th anniversary of the competition - likely to be played over four weeks in June 2020 are Copenhagen, Bucharest, Amsterdam, Bilbao, Budapest and Brussels. Baku, Azerbaijan - Baki Olimpiya Stadionu (68,000 currently under construction) Brussels, Belgium - Proposed new national stadium (50,000-60,000) Copenhagen, Denmark - Parken Stadion (38,065) London, England - Wembley Stadium (90,000) Munich, Germany - Allianz Arena (67,812 to be expanded to 75,000) Amsterdam, Holland - Amsterdam ArenA (53,052 to be expanded to 55,000-56,000) Budapest, Hungary - Puskas Ferenc Stadion (56,000 but new stadium proposed with 65,000) Dublin, Ireland - Aviva Stadium (51,700) Rome, Italy - Stadio Olimpico (72,698) Bucharest, Romania - Arena Nationala (55,600) St Petersburg, Russia - New Zenit Stadium (69,500) Glasgow, Scotland - Hampden Park (52,063) Bilbao, Spain - San Mames Barria (53,332) Dublin's Aviva Stadium will also host three group matches and a last 16 tie .","Wembley Stadium will host the final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 .

"A furious Harvard Business School professor has gone to extreme measures to recuperate $4 from a Massachusetts restaurant he claims overcharged him. Ben Edelman - an associate professor of business administration for the prestigious - ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from Sichuan Garden in Brookline on Friday, but was shocked when the pill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu. He emailed the restaurant, who admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing Edelman to send a barrage of threatening emails that have now been made public by Boston.com . 'Under Massachusetts law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price,' Edelman wrote. Angry emailer: Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard, has unleashed a string of angry and threatening emails to Sichuan Garden, claiming they overcharged him $4 and it was illegal . 'I urge you to cease this practice immediately. 'In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge. 'The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations. 'Please refund the $12 to my credit card. Or you could mail a check for $12 to my home.' Edelman recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden. 'We are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic Sichuan cuisine,' Duan wrote. 'I will honor the website price and honor you the $3.00.' However this only seemed to infuriate Edelman further. Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way . Scene: Edelman had ordered takeout from the Sichuan Garden in Brookline (pictured) 'It strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred,' Edelman wrote back. 'To wit, your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout. 'You did so knowingly, knowing that your website was out of date. 'You don't seem to recognise that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far-reaching resolution. 'Nor do you recognise the principle, well established in applicable laws, that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer, the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge.' Duan, who appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender', responded with an obvious question: 'You seem like a smart man. But is this really worth your time?' Again, Edelman came back firing. 'You're right that I have better things to do,' Edelman's replied. 'If you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund I requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it. 'The more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault, the more determined I am to seek a greater sanction against you.' Not happy: Edelman went to great lengths to get the restaurants to credit him $12 over the so-called mishap . Edelman 'passed the matter on to the authorities' in Brookline. Duan wrote back: 'Once again thank you for bringing it to my attention, I will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation. 'Once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you, we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on.. 'I will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill. 'I have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit. 'I hope you understand I want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly. 'I will keep you updated as soon as they contact me.' Popular: Duan was in GQ magazine last month and hailed as 'America's most imaginative bartender' According to Boston.com, besides Harvard, Edelman also operates a consulting practice that works at 'preventing and detecting online fraud (especially advertising fraud)'. His clients include Microsoft, the NFL, the New York Times, and Universal Music. Edelman sent a statement to Business Insider saying he believes how he handled the situation with Sichuan Garden was helping other people as well. 'We all rely on trust in our daily lives, that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant,' he told the website. 'We all take most of this for granted.'","Ben Edelman is an associate professor of business administration at Harvard who also runs a consulting firm that prevents online frauf .

"He might not have had the best of seasons by his standards, but Robin van Persie's two goals for Manchester United at St Mary's on Monday night demonstrated his enduring quality as one of the finest finishers in English football. They are a rare breed; not always the highest scorers or the most fearsome opponents, but the ones who find the back of the net with aplomb. Here are Sportsmail's top 10 most accomplished finishers in Premier League history. Robin van Persie is congratulated by team-mates Ander Herrera (left) and Ashley Young after scoring . 10. ROBBIE FOWLER . Another marksman whose sheer quantity of goals should not take away from their quality. When Fowler was in on goal, there was usually only one outcome and he did it 183 times for his boyhood club Liverpool. God, as they called him at Anfield, was clinical and deadly, but he also did it in style. Liverpool favourite Robbie Fowler curls home his second goal against Derby during a 4-0 win at Anfield . A young-looking Fowler raises his arm in celebration after netting a goal against Arsenal . 9. SERGIO AGUERO . Manchester City fans would vote him onto the list for one goal alone, but Aguero’s legend will extend well beyond an unforgettable day in May. A prolific striker who had already scored 20 times for the champions this season before being cruelly sidelined by injury, the Argentina striker is also a stylish finisher who on current form deserves those comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Sergio Aguero lashes the ball into the top corner during Manchester City's 4-1 against Sunderland . The Argentina striker celebrates after scoring the winner against Bayern Munich in the Champions League . 8. DIMITAR BERBATOV . Another former United and Tottenham star. Ask fans of either of those clubs, and they would tell you that he could frustrate the hell out of them for 89 minutes and then produce a moment of brilliance to light up the match. If explosive or hard-working is what you want, then Berbatov’s not the man. But when it comes to finishing, and finishing in style, there were few better than the Bulgarian. Dimitar Berbatov scores for Tottenham against Charlton at White Hart Lane back in December 2006 . 7. TEDDY SHERINGHAM . Another one who falls firmly into the category of Cavaliers rather than Roundheads. He wasn’t a battering-ram or a net-buster, but Sheringham possessed that flourish and demonstrated it on numerous occasions by scoring more than 360 goals in a career spent at Tottenham, Manchester United and, yes, Colchester. Teddy Sheringham lifts the ball over Aston Villa goalkeeper David James to score for Manchester United . 6. ROBIN VAN PERSIE . The Dutchman hasn't been himself since Sir Alex Ferguson vacated the manager's chair at Old Trafford, but he came to United's rescue in style against Southampton. The second, in particular, touching Wayne Rooney's deep free-kick past Fraser Forster with the outside of his left foot, was typical of the panache Van Persie has shown in front of goal over the years for Arsenal and United. Van Persie latches on to a poor back-pass from Southampton's Jose Fonte and prepares to shoot . The former Arsenal striker opens the scoring for Manchester United against Southampton on Monday night . The Dutchman popped up again in the second half to prod home Wayne Rooney's deep free-kick . Van Persie's second strike went through the legs of Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster in the second half . 5. LUIS SUAREZ . Suarez would feature in a lot of Top 10s, and not always for the right reasons. He left English football last summer with a rap sheet as long as his list of achievements. But at times during his eventful stay at Liverpool, the Uruguayan was simply unstoppable and his ability to score wonderful, spectacular and often audacious goals will live long in the memory. Luis Suarez nods home his second goal for Liverpool against Everton during a Merseyside derby in 2012 . 4. DENNIS BERGKAMP . By the time he had left English football in 2006 after 11 years at Arsenal, the Dutchman had earned his place in the pantheon of greats. Every Gooner will have his favourite Bergkamp goal, but none will forget his poise, panache and even the odd pirouette. No wonder there’s a statue of him at the Emirates. Dennis Bergkamp lifts the ball over Birmingham City goalkeeper Maik Taylor to score at St Andrew's in 2003 . 3. MATT LE TISSIER . At his imperious best, Le Tissier could fill up a Goal of the Season competition all on his own. Different to the others in the sense that he was an attacking midfielder rather than a striker, the Southampton legend was equally brilliant. He had an ability to dribble past players like they were training-ground dummies and an eye for the outrageous that few could match. Matt Le Tissier (left) scores Southampton's third goal against Manchester United at the Dell in April 1996 . 2. THIERRY HENRY . He started out life as a winger but at Arsenal developed into one of the most accomplished and stylish strikers in world football. Henry’s electrifying pace is what got him into goalscoring positions and, once there, the coolness of thought and precision of finish did the rest. Thierry Henry leaps into the air to score for Arsenal against Sunderland after returning to the Gunners in 2012 . Henry is delighted at the final whistle after helping Arsenal win the 2003 FA Cup final against Southampton . 1. ERIC CANTONA . When it comes down to style, no-one did it quite like Cantona. Maybe it was the upturned collar, the puffed-out chest or the sheer arrogance of the man, but he seemed to view the football pitch as a stage, his stage, and performed accordingly. The Frenchman scored goals with the air of an artist applying the final brushstroke to a masterpiece. Manchester United hero Eric Cantona slots home against rivals Manchester City at Maine Road in 1993 . 1. Charlton 1-2 Arsenal, 30 September 2006 . A sublime left-footed volley from Emmanuel Eboue's cross gave the Gunners all three points at the Valley. 2. Manchester United 3-0 Aston Villa, 22 April 2013 . Wayne Rooney was the provider as his lifted through ball dropped onto Van Persie's left boot for him to crash home from the edge of the box. It was his second goal of a hat-trick as United sealed the Premier League title. 3. Arsenal 3-0 Blackburn, 26 November 2006 . A fine individual run from the Dutchman ended with a brilliant curling effort beyond Brad Friedel late in the game. 4. Arsenal 1-0 Everton, 10 December 2011 . Latching on to a perfect ball over the top from Alex Song, RVP smashed a first-time volley past Tim Howard to give the Gunners a hard-fought win. 5. Chelsea 3-5 Arsenal, 29 October 2011 . Van Persie sealed his hat-trick and an emphatic win a Stamford Bridge with an unstoppable strike beyond Petr Cech and into the top corner.

"Premier League chief Richard Scudamore remains the front-runner to become executive chairman of English football’s elite division in the ultimate inside promotion. As many as 10 Premier League teams were said to be backing such a move before the last club summit in November, but the subject was not raised during discussions. However, the selection panel, led by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, are struggling to find suitable outside candidates to replace City financier Anthony Fry, who is too ill to continue in the post — leaving Scudamore as still the strongest option. Richard Scudamore could get an inside promotion to executive chairman of the Premier League . A final decision is not expected until the new year but the 20 top-flight clubs would be expected to endorse Scudamore as chairman if that is the recommendation. It would represent a remarkable turnaround for the 55-year-old, who was fighting for his job last summer after a puerile sexist-text exchange with Premier League lawyer Nick West was made public.

BBC insiders are agitated about falling behind rivals ITV, as well as subscription channels BT and Sky, in the making of sports documentaries. This has been sparked by the upcoming BBC Sport programme on the FA Cup, which is seen as trite and celebrity-obsessed. The two-hour documentary, commissioned by BBC3 for a New Year’s Eve slot, will be presented by Rio Ferdinand and singer Olly Murs, with Cup memories supplied by a varied cast including Russell Brand, Eliza Doolittle and boy band One Direction. It compares unfavourably with BT Sport’s film for Boxing Day about Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang, which will not be much edited despite the storm of protest from Plough Lane old boys — following a private screening — about how they are portrayed. BT Sport are releasing a documentary on Wimbledon's Crazy Gang (pictured) Beeb sources, who acknowledge, too, the work done for ITV’s acclaimed Keane and Vieira documentary, are also unimpressed that husband and wife Jo McCusker and Peter Small are involved in the FA Cup production. A Beeb spokeswoman said: ‘Jo and Peter are full-time employees of BBC Sport, so it is inevitable there will be projects they work on together.

"Raheem Sterling has been used as a No 10 by England but Rodgers put him on the wing against Basle where he made his name.

The remaining three starters were Jordan Henderson and Jose Enrique, both signed by Kenny Dalglish, and homegrown Steven Gerrard. There were as many Rafael Benitez (right) signings in the Liverpool team as there were Brendan Rodgers' It was a typically passionate Champions goal celebration at Anfield - from the away end. Basle fans have a reputation for being the only ones in Switzerland who 'get football' like we do and Fabian Frei's excellent 25th minute strike was greeted with noise, colour and even a smoke bomb to add to the atmosphere. Their non-stop chanting was in contrast to the Kop who were strangely quick to turn on their side in a disappointing first half. The Basle fans were in fine voice (pictured) but the same could not be said of the home support . Basle manager Paulo Sousa has the dubious distinction of being sacked by two Championship clubs and leaving a third by mutual consent. But maybe the 44-year-old former QPR, Swansea and Leicester manager has found his right level in the Champions League. The Portuguese  also has an 'English' lucky charm - goalscorer Frei has now netted at Old Trafford, White Hart Lane and Anfield. Paulo Sousa has been sacked by two Championship clubs, but guided Basle through to the knockout stages .","Raheem Sterling failed to impress in a wide role for Liverpool on Tuesday .

Weise says the owner had several photos of Gage to prove he's her pet.

"AFC Wimbledon will refuse to cash in on their dream FA Cup tie against Liverpool with a decision taken to fix ticket prices at League Two levels, between £4 and £25. It is a refreshing change in the world where prices at the elite level have smashed through the £100 barrier and adheres to the true spirit of the competition, in keeping with a fixture that will evoke memories of the 1988 final. Wimbledon are exploring the possibility of installing temporary seating at Kingsmeadow ground but there is very little scope to boost the capacity of 4,720. It means gate receipts after VAT will be around £60,000, which has to be shared with Liverpool and the FA. Goalscorer Sean Rigg (right) and George Francomb celebrate after beating Wycombe in round two . Rigg scored the only goal of the game at Adams Park to clinch a glamour tie with Premier League Liverpool . They will bank £144,000 if the game, to be played on or just after the weekend of January 3-4, is among the five selected for live TV broadcast. But more than the cash windfall, which will boost their transfer and wage budget of £1.1million, the tie marks an emotional step in the rebirth of a club lost when the FA sanctioned the former owners’ plan to move to Milton Keynes and rebrand as MK Dons. ‘It is a significant milestone in the development of the club,’ said executive Erik Samuelson. ‘You can look back to the time of our first trials on Wimbledon Common when we had no players or kit. When you think of where we’ve come from it makes the hairs on your neck stand up. AFC Wimbledon's Kingsmeadow home has a capacity of less than 5,000 . Liverpool fan Adebayo Akinfenwa helped Wimbledon win at MK Dons in the JPT back in October . ‘There was the first competitive game and our first game in the FA Vase, playing a Football League team in the FA Cup, promotion to the Conference, getting our own ground and getting back into the Football League and winning in Buckinghamshire.’ This is a reference to MK Dons. The relationship remains prickly, even after recent cup ties. The patrimony of the 1988 FA Cup win initially went to Milton Keynes with the team — but has since been passed to Merton Borough Council, following a campaign by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Club. A miniature replica of the famous trophy resides in a library. Wimbledon fans spilled onto the pitch after Jack Midson's goal at MK Dons back in 2012 . Occasionally it is loaned to AFC Wimbledon, who are attempting to move back into Merton. There are several hoops to get through but they hope to be there for the 2017-18 season. ‘This will be the first time we have had a competitive game against a Premier League team,’ added Samuelson. ‘It’s another tick in another box except emotionally, it’s much more than that. It is a significant step. It has huge resonance because of 1988, when a massive number of our fans would have been at Wembley or watching on television. Lawrie Sanchez scored the winner as Wimbledon stunned Liverpool in the 1988 final at Wembley . The Dons celebrate a famous win on the hallowed Wembley turf . 'Isn’t that great? To complete the circle would be to beat them, but this fixture alone puts the club into the spotlight and reminds everyone who we are. It’s what the FA Cup is all about.’ This sentiment is the main factor in the club’s determination not to fleece fans over tickets, even though they could sell perhaps 10 times the capacity. Adult prices will start at £16 for the terraces, up to £25 in the main stand, with £10 for concessions and £4 for U18s. ‘We will look into the possibility of expanding the capacity with temporary seats but the design of the ground makes it difficult,’ said Samuelson. ‘It is a challenge on and off the pitch. What we really need is a new stadium, somewhere in Merton. Wouldn’t that be nice?’ AFC Wimbledon chief executive Erik Samuelson is relishing the meeting with Liverpool .","Dons have fixed ticket prices at League Two levels for the third round tie .

"INXS bass player Garry Beers has hit back at 'hurtful' claims made by his 22-year-old daughter Lucy-Mae Beers that he abandoned his first family to chase a rock'n'roll lifestyle. Garry Beers has penned an open letter rejecting the claims, which is published in full below: . Scroll down for video . Garry Beers (right) has hit back at claims made by his daughter Lucy-Mae Beers (left) that he abandoned his Australian family to persue a rock'n'roll lifestyle after INXS . STATEMENT BY GARRY BEERS . I am deeply hurt and saddened to see the article written by my daughter Lucy Mae and the subsequent reporting of that story by other media outlets in Australia and around the world. Lucy and those who have published similar stories have chosen to misrepresent the truth about me and my wife, Jourdan. Lucy makes a series of hurtful allegations against me, each of which is untrue. She claims that I slept with a backup singer while my pregnant wife was at home with a brand new Harley Davidson she had bought for me. This is untrue. She claims that I am married to 'the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside'. This is also untrue. I did not meet my current wife, Jourdan, until five years after my first wife and I were divorced. Jourdan has never stood outside a gig while my family were inside. I didn't even know Jourdan at the time this supposedly took place. The last show that my ex-wife and the girls attended was the Stadium Australia concert in 2000 with Terrance Trent Darby. INXS at a hotel room in Glasgow circa 1988 - from left Michael Hutchence, Kirk Pengilly, Jon Farriss, Tim Farriss, Garry Gary Beers and Andrew Farris. I am not perfect and I am the first to admit it. Yes, I had an affair during the 1997 tour. This was the only affair I ever had, and I told my then-wife straight away. Lucy claims that I have been a neglectful father, and that I have been in contact with her 'less than a dozen' times a year. This is also untrue. I have always tried to maintain a relationship with Lucy and Matilda, but this was difficult in the years 2006 – 2009 when their mother's legal suit against me was on foot. During that period, meetings with the girls were often cancelled at the last minute and on more than one occasion I was met by a court process server instead. Up until 2013, I have been back and forth to Australia on average every 3 months during the year and I have always tried to make contact with my daughters. In 2011 Lucy and Matilda attended an INXS concert in Victoria and I spent a day with each of them over the next few days. In happier days: Garry Beers has hit back at claims Lucy-Mae Beers made, describing how her father (pictured with her as a child) did not accept it when INXS's fame 'fell to the wayside' Garry Beers says Lucy Mae's claims that she is only in contact with him via email is untrue . Lucy's claim that she was 'lucky to get an email on her birthday' is both untrue and extremely hurtful. In January this year I sent the girls 8 hours of video footage from their childhood on a hard drive that I painstakingly put together. They loved it. Lucy and I were sending each other long and detailed emails up until June this year. She was the one who mentioned that the INXS mini-series was to feature Hugh Sheridan and that she was excited as he was one of her favourite actors. She claims that I sent 'a lovely egotistical email' to her asking 'What did you think of Hugh Sheridan playing myself?'. This is an extract from the email she sent to me: . 'We have been keeping updated with the news on the INXS mini-series and have heard that Hugh Sheridan is playing you! He is on a great Aussie TV drama called 'Packed to the Rafters' and is a sensational actor (he's huge here) and we love him! So that's amazing.' My email to her when the mini-series aired was: . To . Lucy-Mae Beers . Feb 15 . Hey Lucy, did you watch the Miniseries..?? He refutes Lucy's claims that he is 'now married to the woman who used to wait for him outside of gigs while his family were inside' writing that he didn't meet his wife, Jourdan, until five years after he and his first wife were divorced . Lucy also claims that 'he told us he was packing up and moving to the United States to marry one of his conquests on the day we were moving house'. This is untrue. My divorce with my first wife had been finalized in 2001. In 2004 I sold the Mangrove property, where I had lived for 20 years and where my two recording studios were located. I did not meet my wife Jourdan until October 2005. I did not move to the United States until November 2006. Lucy claims that I 'thrived off a diet of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll'. This is untrue. Anyone who has met me will know that I am a decent guy and a good father. It is sad that my relationship with Lucy and Matilda has soured. I will take my share of the blame for that, but I will not take it all. Lucy also claims, sadly, that I have 'Peter Pan syndrome'. I can only assume that she means that I am immature, child-like and divorced from reality. This is untrue. Lucy-Mae Beers (left), with her sister, Matilda, told how her father is a 'stranger' to her. Garry Beers said he wishes Lucy had just picked up the phone instead of publishing the scathing article. Lucy's mother and I divorced 13 years ago. The INXS miniseries aired in February this year. I am saddened that my daughter has chosen now, as she seeks to embark on a career in journalism, to publish this story. If she really does believe all of these untruths about me, I wish she had just picked up the phone. Jourdan and I married in 2007. She has supported me through the lawsuit and in my attempts to stay in touch with Lucy and Matilda. She is a hard working, independent woman and the love of my life. She is a wonderful mother to our twins, Isla and August who were born in 2011. To have such cruel, blatant lies written about Jourdan and published around the world is devastating to us both. It is especially cruel for her as she lost her father suddenly a month ago. I find it inexcusable that the media has published these exaggerations and falsehoods without even attempting to contact me for comment. The fact that it has been reprinted around the world by many publications and websites, and still no one has had the decency to contact me, forces me and Jourdan to pursue my legal rights against the media outlets who have published these stories. Garry Beers . This is entirely untrue and will keep going around in circles. He is a master strategist, narcissist and bully and I stand by my piece.","INXS bass player Garry Beers has hit back at claims made by his daughter .

"Amir Khan will be wearing the most outrageously expensive shorts in sporting history on Saturday night but he will be fighting for the priceless yet simple pleasure of his infant daughter growing up proud of his exploits in the ring. The garb will be garishly in keeping with the Las Vegas Strip. Genuine 24 carat gold thread woven through a waist band supporting white nappa leather trunks with crocodile trim. Estimated cost – take a deep breath - between £20,000 and £30,000. The sentiment will be touching and homely, with Khan saying: ‘I want our baby to be able to say one day that her father was a great champion.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Amir Khan's 24 carat gold shorts worth up to £30,000 . Bolton-born boxer Amir Khan will fight Devon Alexander in Las Vegas late on Saturday night . Khan posted pictures on his Twitter feed of him shopping  in Sin City and (right) his shorts . Khan poses with Dolce & Gabbana staff ahead of his fight on Saturday night . The 28-year-old will wear shorts worth an estimated £20,000-£30,000 for the fight with the American . The trunks, made specially for the fight, have genuine 24 carat gold thread woven into the waistband . The shorts, which will be unveiled when he enters the MGM Grand Garden to face Devon Alexander, are certain to end up on display in a museum or a casino showcase. The paternal dream of ‘my little girl going to school and her friends saying her dad was a great boxer’ is not yet certain to be fulfilled. That depends on him defeating Alexander in style and then going on to do the same against one of two active icons, Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao. Khan admits that when, hopefully, tiny Lamaisa’s day comes ‘I will already be retired.’ As it happens, he passed his previously declared date for hanging up the gloves when he reached his 28th birthday this Monday.’ But now he says: ‘I feel better today than when I was 26. Physically and mentally. Healthier and stronger. Still coming to my peak.’ The gold waist band supports white nappa lamb leather trunks with a crocodile trim . Khan said that to truly have global recognition you have to have success on the other side of the Atlantic . The banner for Khan and Alexander's fight hanging on the side of the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas . His recently taken wife Faryal and their first-born child provide added motivation to box on: ‘Everything I do from here is for them.’ Part of Khan’s charm is that he is something of a paradox, without knowing it. He compares what he regards as a moderate life-style with the lavish excesses of Mayweather in this, his home town, saying: ‘Floyd has to earn big because he spends so much. I don’t splash out on things like he does. I don’t need to make billions, just enough to keep my family and give my daughter an education. I’m not a big spender.’ Yet he has a liking for fast cars…and then there are those golden trunks. The shorts may be supplied as a promotional tool for a company called Fight Label but they do not indicate restraint. Yet he is understated in his rebuttal of claims by master trainer Freddie Roach that Pacquiao used to deck him in the gym when they trained together. Khan has been put through his paces ahead of his welterweight showdown with Devon Alexander . The Briton doesn't seem to have indulged in any birthday cake on Tuesday, when he turned 28 . Khan beat American Luis Collazo in his last fight, which was also in Las Vegas, back in May this year . Khan insisted that everything he does and earns now is for the benefit of his wife, Faryal, and his daughter . Khan and Fayral got married in 2013 in the US and the couple had their first child, Lamaisah, in May this year . Khan says: ‘No way Manny outclassed me in sparring. Perhaps I should send Freddie some videos to remind him of that. But I don’t want to get into an argument about whether Manny knocked me down. ‘Perhaps Freddie said it because he was hurt that I left him for Virgil Hunter – who everyone says is making me a better fighter – but I want there to be respect when I meet him and Manny somewhere down the road.’ The Bolton boy is growing up, yet there is still something of the teenager in him when he gets wide-eyed at seeing his name up in huge lights on the Strip and as excited as a schoolboy at the prospect of topping the bill at the MGM for the first time. He has made that possible by relocating his fights to the other side of the Atlantic and building a fan base in America. He says: ‘I hope this will encourage young British fighters to take that risk. I could have earned more in England and there is a risk that you get beat and you come home to find the millions are no longer there. Khan refuted claims made by Freddie Roach that he had been knocked out by Manny Pacquiao while sparring . Khan talks to journalists, including Sportsmail's Jeff Powell, ahead of his upcoming fight . Khan said that he, unlike Floyd Mayweather, lived a modest lifestyle and didn't need to earn too much money . ‘But if you want global recognition you have to fight in America.’ Khan recalled that Prince Naseem Hamed blazed that trail and is now to be installed in the boxing Hall of Fame, even though he lost over here his biggest fight to Marco Antonio Barrera. He says: ‘Naz made his name in the US. That’s one reason why I sent him a message congratulating him on the honour.’ Apparently, Khan Is the only current British ring star to have taken that trouble and he doubts he will hear from many, if any, if he lands his super-fight with Mayweather – and then becomes the first to beat him. Yet he says: ‘I won’t be bitter if that’s the case. It will probably just be jealousy.’ If he does overthrow the pound-for-pound king he will probably be right. As would his daughter when telling everyone that her dad was the greatest. Khan v Alexander will be live on Sky Sports late Saturday night.","Amir Khan will face Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday night .

"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman was frustrated with his side's defensive lapses after the Saints crashed to a 2-1 defeat by Manchester United on Monday night. Robin van Persie's double meant Louis van Gaal's men took all three points from their trip to St Mary's. But Koeman seemed to have recovered by Tuesday, wearing his Christmas jumper before the Saints' festive bash and tweeting: Ready for the Christmas party at @SouthamptonFC I believe in the way we played.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronald Koeman: Everything is s*** because we lost . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman takes issue with a decision during the 2-1 loss to Manchester United . Koeman in a more positive mood as he wears his Christmas jumper before the Saints' festive party . Southampton striker Graziano Pelle, who scored against United, was also in his festive gear . Striker Graziano Pelle, who scored the goal against United also posted a picture of himself in seasonal attire with the words: 'All dressed up for our #SaintsFC Christmas Party @SouthamptonFC'. Koeman's men dominated the match against United for large parts but some costly defensive lapses handed the visitors the game with the Saints crashing to their third defeat in just over a week. 'We did everything, we created chances. But we also made mistakes,' said the Dutchman. 'Maybe they [United] made more mistakes than we did but they have players who handle those kind of mistakes and that was the difference today. Robin van Persie (top) intercepted Jose Fonte's poor pass to fire past Fraser Forster for the opening goal . Van Persie (right) pounced in the 71st minute to put United back in front and secure the points for United . 'At this level detail makes the difference in football. You can talk about who deserved it, who played offensively, who pressed, but everything is s*** because we lost. 'I said to my players, we did not lose against Man United tonight; we lost by ourselves.' Koeman remained upbeat despite his side's recent slump in form and insisted that his team would continue with their playing style that has yielded such positive results thus far. Van Persie is mobbed by his team-mates as they celebrate his strike in front of the away supporters . Despite three consecutive losses to Manchester City, Arsenal and United, Southampton hold o nto fifth place in the Premier League table, and Koeman believes there is still grounds for optimism heading into the Christmas period. 'I like to see my team playing football in the way that we've started this season,' he added. 'If we lose or we win, that's our way of playing because I believe in that way of playing even now when we've lost the last three games.

"BORUSSIA DORTMUND 1-1 ANDERLECHT . Dortmund earned some relief from their domestic woes on Tuesday as they qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League as group winners - but their 1-1 draw against Anderlecht told of a side still down on confidence and form. Ciro Immobile's splendid 58th-minute goal had looked as if it would be enough to give the already qualified Germans, who had only climbed off the foot of the Bundesliga at the weekend, a victorious finale in Group D. Yet Anderlecht, lively and with nothing to lose as they had already been eliminated, were finally rewarded for the threat they had offered at a nervous Westfalenstadion all evening when Serbian Aleksandar Mitrovic headed a thumping 84th-minute equaliser. It left Dortmund facing a nervous few last minutes, knowing that with Arsenal winning 4-1 at Galatasaray, another goal from the Belgians would deprive them of the advantage of finishing in top spot, but they were well worth their morale-boosting win. Borussia Dortmund earned some welcome relief from their domestic woes as they finished top of Group D . OLYMPIACOS 4-2 MALMO . Greek champions Olympiacos had to settle for a Europa League place despite a 4-2 win over Malmo in their final Champions League Group A match. Olympiacos finished third, a point behind Juventus who drew 0-0 with already-qualified group leaders Atletico Madrid to claim second apot and a place in the last 16. Kostas Mitroglou and substitute Ibrahim Afellay struck in the last three minutes for Olympiacos to down the Swedes, who had twice drawn level at the Georgios Karaiskakis stadium. The hosts had scored through David Fuster's opener and Alejandro DomÃnguez's stunning volley, either side of Simon Kroon's goal for the visitors, before Malmo's Rosenberg made it 2-2 in the 81st minute before the late push from Olympiacos. Olympiacos' Alejandro Damian Dominguez scores his side's second goal on their way to a 4-2 win . MONACO 2-0 ZENIT ST PETERSBURG . Aymen Abdennour and Fabinho's second-half goals helped Monaco beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 at home and send the principality side into the last 16 of the Champions League. Centre back Abdennour headed home in the 64th minute and Fabinho sealed victory with a low shot one minute from time as Monaco clinched top spot in Group C with 11 points from six games, although they managed a miserly four goals. Only Villareal in the 2005-06 season and AS Roma in 2002-03 qualified from the initial group phase scoring less goals, both teams netting only three. Monaco stole top spot in Group C after beating Zenit St Petersburg 2-0 at home . BENFICA 0-0 BAYER LEVERKUSEN . Bayer Leverkusen drew 0-0 at Benfica to advance in the competition but the Bundesliga side surrendered top spot in Group C to Monaco. The German club were already guaranteed a place in the knockout round, but needed a win in Lisbon to secure top spot and the prospect of facing a runner-up from another group as its next opponent. With five points from its six matches and bottom place in the group, Benfica recorded its worst ever Champions League group campaign.

"A Cambridge University educated research scientist is so desperate to live the life of a wheelchair-bound person she is prepared to pay a doctor help her become disabled. Since childhood, Chloe Jennings-White has made several attempts at injuring herself so she can finally climb into her own wheelchair. In 2010 she even found a doctor overseas willing to help her become disabled by cutting her sciatic . and femoral nerves, but she could not afford the £16,000 costs. Scroll down for video . Chloe Jennings-White adjusting her leg braces at her home on May 16, 2013, in Salt Lake City, Utah. She uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are fine, and has chosen to live as a disabled person, due to a rare condition . 'I might never be able to afford it, but I know, truly and deeply, I won't regret it if I ever can,' she said, referring to the doctor who might be able to help her become disabled. Chloe, 58, from Salt Lake City, Utah, suffers from a rare condition called Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Sufferers do not accept one of their own limb or limbs and seek to amputate them or become paraplegic. Able to stand: Chloe, 58, pictured out hiking in May this year in Salt Lake City, Utah. She wears leg braces and uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are healthy . Some experts believe it is caused by a neurological fault, in which the brain's mapping system cannot see a certain body part. The Cambridge graduate believes both of her legs do not belong to her and dreams of being paralysed from the waist down. 'Something in my brain tells me my legs are not supposed to work,' she said. 'Having any sensation in them just feels wrong.' For years she bandaged herself secretly, but now lives openly with her condition despite facing intolerance, insults, and sometimes online threats. Chloe first realised she was different at the age of four, after visiting her Aunt Olive, who was using leg braces after a bike accident. 'I wanted them too,' she said. 'I wondered why I wasn't born needing them and felt something was wrong with me because I didn't have them.' At the age of nine, Chloe even took action and pedalled her bike off a four-foot high acting stage on Hampstead Heath, north London, landing on her neck. 'I only wanted to stop my legs working but could have broken my neck or died,' she added. From then on, Chloe lived out her fantasy in secret, pretending to be disabled when alone, playing risky sports and climbing trees in the hope of hurting her legs. Without her leg brace on in her bathroom in Salt Lake City, US. Her distorted body image causes her to sit in a wheelchair even though she can stand and ski . Now, as an adult, Chloe enjoys the . excitement of downhill skiing and the possibility she might fall and . suffer serious leg fractures. 'I ski extremely fast, and aim for the most dangerous runs,' she said. BIID occurs when a person's idea of how they should look does not match their actual physical form. The condition affects just a small percentage of the population. The sufferer wants to have an amputation. In most cases, the limb that the person would like removed is healthy. Many psychologists and neurologists have tried to understand what the root cause of the condition is. The theory is that BIID occurs when the brain is not able to provide an accurate plan of the body. Some experts believe the cause to be psychological. One . theory is that a person with BIID may have seen an amputee at an . earlier age and this image has replaced their own thoughts about what . constitutes the ideal person. To become a better person they feel that a certain limb will have to be amputated. In severe cases, a person with BIID may harm the limb they wish to be removed or force doctors into removing it. Others manage to cope with the illness by using canes and prosthetic attachments to help them feel complete. 'Doing . any activity that brings a chance of me becoming paraplegic gives me a . sense of relief from the anxiety caused by the BIID. 'My . friends and family can get a little worried about me skiing, as they . know I ski very aggressively and they know that in the back of my mind I . actually want to get paralysed.' Chloe had a real skiing accident seven years ago, which left her with a minor back injury and a reason to get leg braces. She researched the braces online and came across BIID for the first time. She discovered there were others like her. 'It was a huge relief,' she said. 'I wasn't a freak - there were hundreds of others like me.' She took part in a BIID research study . with psychiatrist Michael First, from New York, who diagnosed her in . Spring 2008 and recommending she use a wheelchair. At first, she used the chair in private, but eventually gained the courage to reveal her secret to friends and work colleagues. 'The . chair gives me psychological relief, instead of physical,' she said. 'I . know it can be difficult for people without BIID to understand, but . it's what we feel.' In 2009 she was involved in a serious . 75mph car crash and suffered pre-concussion amnesia and cannot remember . the 15 minutes before the impact. It was not a deliberate act, according to police . reports, but she worries she might have subconsciously wanted it to happen. Now, . Chloe spends most of her time in a wheelchair, but has to get out for . various household tasks and walk down the steps to her car. With her doctor, Dr Mark Malan. He is helping her with her condition Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Chloe is a research scientist and graduate from Cambridge University . 'I can't afford to convert my home for disabled access so I just use the chair as much as I can,' she said. She fantasises about having a car crash without hurting anyone else just so she can damage her own legs. 'Any time when I'm driving I sort of conjure up accident scenarios in my mind where I will become paraplegic,' she admitted. Psychiatrist Dr Mark Malan, who treats Chloe, said: 'The question I often ask is, is it better to have somebody pretending to use a wheelchair, or to commit suicide?

Cambridge graduate Chloe outside her workplace, the University of Utah, US. She sometimes has to get out of her chair to walk up stairs or get into a car . 'One possibility could be to do some sort of nerve blocking so that that limb could not actually be used for a period of time, to let the patient test the reality of being physically disabled temporarily. 'It would give BIID sufferers a chance to change their minds if they wanted to.' Chloe believes it is important to raise . awareness about the condition and now writes for the BIID support group Transabled.","Chloe knew at 4 she was different and wanted to live as a disabled person .

"Conman Matthew Dobson, 25, (above) stole £28,000 worth of art from the Driftwood Gallery in Cornwall, including works by shamed sex offender Rolf Harris . A gallery worker has been jailed for stealing £28,000 worth of art from his employers including a book of paintings by Rolf Harris - which is now worthless. Conman Matthew Dobson, 25, stole cash and goods from the Driftwood Gallery in Falmouth, Cornwall, at the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013, before Harris was publicly shamed as a sex abuser who took advantage of young girls. The haul included Harris's book of paintings, A Portrait of London, worth £225 at the time, Truro Crown Court heard. Dobson also diverted the gallery's money into his own accounts and wrote fake invoices before bosses spotted him trying to sell the stolen art on eBay and reported him to the police. The court heard how Dobson had already served a 16-month jail sentence for swindling £34,000 from his previous employer. When he left prison he needed to raise £8,000 to repay his debts and decided target his new workplace. Terry Eastwood, defending, said: 'He decided, very unwisely, that he would steal from his employer again. He didn't stop however at £8,000.' Dobson's haul also included five works by leading Welsh artist Kerry Darlington. He pleaded guilty to 17 charges of theft and fraud between 2012 and 2013 and asked for 37 more to be taken into consideration. Recorder Jeremy Wright jailed him for two years and ordered him to pay a £120 victim surcharge. Experts say that Harris's artworks - which once fetched up to £70,000 each - are now worthless because of his crimes. He was jailed for five years and nine months for using his celebrity status to grope and abuse young women and girls over a 40-year period. In 2005 the former TV presenter had the rare privilege of painting a portrait of the Queen to mark her 80th birthday. After being unveiled in December that year, the portrait, which took Harris two months to complete, initially went on display at the Queen's Gallery in Buckingham Palace.

Sara Gardiner, 35, invested her life savings in Horses At The Lights months before he was arrested, The Sun reported. She said at the time: 'I'm sick that I bought the work of such an evil man and gutted that it's now not going to be worth the canvas it's painted on.'","Conman Matthew Dobson stole cash and paintings before Harris's arrest .

"Top lawmakers have agreed to a $1.1trillion spending bill - just two days before federal agencies were due to run out of money. The agreement, unveiled by the GOP-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday night following days of backroom negotiations, would likely avoid a partial government shutdown. It would also fund most of the government through next September and delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama's new immigration policy until the new year. 'This bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government, preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy, cost jobs and hurt middle class families,' said Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, and Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, a Republican, in a joint statement. Scroll down for video . Reaching an agreement: 'This bill fulfills our constitutional duty to fund the government, preventing damage from shutdown politics that are bad for the economy, cost jobs and hurt middle class families,' said Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski (right), a Democrat, and Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers (left), a Republican, in a statement . 'While not everyone got everything they wanted, such compromises must be made in a divided government,' they added, according to CNN. In an unexpected move, the Republicans and Democrats also agreed on legislation that will permit a reduction in benefits for current retirees at economically distressed multiemployer pension plans. Supporters said it was part of an effort to prevent a slow-motion collapse of a system that provides retirement income to millions, but critics objected vehemently. The spending bill will now go to the chamber's rules committee to be prepared for debate and a House vote by Thursday - the day the government technically runs out of money. Despite grumbling from conservatives that it is too big, the House and Senate are expected to adopt the measure. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to the bill. At 1,603 pages, the spending bill adheres to strict caps negotiated earlier between the White House and deficit- conscious Republicans, and is also salted with GOP policy proposals. President: The agreement would delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama's (pictured) new immigration policy until the new year . As described by unhappy liberals, one would roll back new regulations that prohibit banks from using federal deposit insurance to cover investments on some complex financial instruments. Elsewhere, there were trade-offs. Republicans won a $60 million cut at the Environmental Protection Agency, and said the agency's workforce would be reduced to the lowest level since 1989. Democrats emerged with increases for enforcement activities at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 'The federal government's going to run out of money in two days. ... We've been trying to work with Republican leaders to avoid a shutdown,' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said at midafternoon as final negotiations dragged on. Speaker John Boehner said he hoped for a vote on the measure on Thursday, and officials expressed confidence they could overcome opposition from tea party-backed Republicans and avoid a government shutdown. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement that said she was hopeful her rank and file could support the bill, but needed to review the final language. Senate approval would then be required to send it to Obama — one of the final acts of a two-year Congress far better known for gridlock than for accomplishment. Not only a two-year Congress, but also a political era was drawing to a close as the lights burned late inside the Capitol on a December night. For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have a Senate majority in January after their hugely successful midterm election, and newly elected GOP senators-elect participated in closed-door strategy sessions during the day. Before time runs out on his majority, Reid said he wanted to assure confirmation of nine more of Obama's judicial nominees and approve the appointment of Vivek Murthy as surgeon general. Breakthrough: The agreement was unveiled by the GOP-led House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday night following days of backroom negotiations. Above, Hal Rogers walks on Capitol Hill in Washington in June . Also on Congress' must-do list is legislation to renew a series of expiring tax breaks, and a bill to authorize the Pentagon to train and equip Syrian rebels to fight Islamic State forces in the Middle East. Proponents of campaign finance reforms decried a provision slipped in at the last minute that would sharply increase limits on the amount that an individual can contribute to various national political party accounts and committees each year from $32,400 to $324,000. That means individuals could give $648,000 per two-year campaign cycle, with a married couple capped at almost $1.3 million for an election cycle. The compromise spending bill will permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security. Funds for that one agency will run out again on Feb. 27, when Republicans are expected to try and use the expiration as leverage to force Obama to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 4 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Not all Republicans agreed with the strategy of postponing a fight over immigration. Some conservative lawmakers demanded a change deny the use of federal funds to carry out the president's new policy. Earlier in the day, House Republicans removed one obstacle to passage of the spending measure by announcing they would pass legislation separately to renew a requirement for the federal government to assume some of the insurance risk in losses arising from terrorism. In talks with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Republicans led by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas., agreed to the renewal, but said they wanted to roll back portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that tightened federal regulation on the financial sector. The stand-alone bill seemed likely to clear the House, but its fate in the Senate was uncertain. Speech: The spending bill will now go to the chamber's rules committee to be prepared for debate and a House vote by Thursday. Above Barbara Mikulski is seen speaking on Capitol Hill in Washington on November 12 . The pension-related talks between Rep. John Kline, R-Min., and George Miller, D-Calif., were designed to preserve benefits of current and future retirees at lower levels than currently exist, but higher than they would be if their pension funds ran out of money. 'We have a plan here that first and foremost works for the members of the unions, the workers in these companies and it works for the companies,' said Miller, retiring at year's end after four decades in Congress. The AARP, which claims to represent millions of retirement-age Americans, attacked the agreement as a 'secret, last-minute closed door deal between a group of companies, unions and Washington politicians to cut the retirement benefits that have been promised to them.' Also driving the talks was concern over the financial fate of the fund that insures multiemployer pensions at the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. The agency said in its most recent annual report that the fund's deficit rose to $42.2 billion in the fiscal year ending Sept, 30, up from $8.3 billion the previous year, and that the likelihood of its bankruptcy is 90 percent by 2025. Agency figures show as many as 1.5 million retirees could be affected by any change in law to permit a reduction. An estimated 400,000 of them receive benefits from the Teamsters' Central States Pension Fund.","Spending agreement was confirmed by House Appropriations Committee .

"He was just trying to watch the game, but instead he was dragged into a random couple's relationship drama. A man named 'Lye' has written about his experiences confronting a stranger at a Detroit Lions football game, after he claims he saw the man's very pregnant girlfriend 'romantically texting' another man throughout the match. At the end of the game, Lye handed the man a note revealing the alleged adulterous text messages, and later posted a picture of the note and the pair he claimed to be the couple to Facebook. Those images have since gone viral and are now sparking a heated debate online about whether it's appropriate to wade into a complete stranger's relationship. Scroll down for video . Drama: A man named Lye took this picture of a pregnant woman who he alleges was texting a man named 'Jason' while seated next to another man who appeared to be her boyfriend at a recent Detroit Lions game. Lye decided to intervene and hand this note (right) to the fellow spectator . According to Lye's post on Facebook, he was attending a Detroit Lions game last month when he was seated behind a couple who appeared to be dating. Throughout the game, he claims he saw the woman casually texting a contact in her phone named 'Jason' apparently making comments like 'I wish I was with you all day' and 'I will see you as soon as I am done with him'. Meanwhile,he claims the woman kept the phone screen tilted out of eyesight of the man seated next to her, and would even shut it off and put it away when he engaged her in conversation. Feeling sympathetic for the man seated in front of him, who he believes was being cheated on, Lye got up near the end of the game to find a pen and piece of paper to write the stranger a note. When the man got up to leave, Lye handed the piece of paper to him and said to read it when he got home. Lye later took to Facebook to post an image of the note and the woman who was was seated in front of him, showing the back of her head with her phone out, writing a text. No regrets: The photo of the woman and the note has since gone viral online, after Lye (left) wrote about the experience on Facebook (right). Some have criticized him for interjecting himself into a stranger's relation or for putting the woman at risk for physical abuse. But Lye says he would make the same decision again . The pictures have since gone viral online and many have called Lye out for interjecting himself into the stranger's relationship. Lye has since defended his actions to Mad World News, saying he usually likes to stay out of other people's business, but overheard a few rude comments the woman made to the man she was with that made him pity her partner. He says at one point in the game, another spectator commented on the size of a portion of fries saying: 'Wow! For the price they charge for fries here, that's pretty small. They barely give you anything.' The woman in question allegedly quipped back: 'It's okay, I'm [used] to small things'. Others criticized Lye for possibly putting the pregnant woman in harms way, pointing out that her boyfriend could have been abusive. 'I doubt any woman who fears getting beat by her husband will speak that way and degrade him like she did or spend over 20 minutes texting the next man RIGHT BESIDE her ""abusive"" man,' Lye responded. Others argued the man could have been a brother or a friend, but Lye said that his judgement of the situation was that they were a couple and that the man even seemed suspicious of her texting, as he 'kept trying to look at her phone from the corner of his eyes'. Despite the backlash, Lye says he would make the same decision again. 'I don’t regret a damn thing, well except the fact that I didn’t leave anything for him to be able to contact me on.'","Man named Lye witnessed the woman sending the seemingly-adulterous texts while attending a recent Detroit Lions football game .

"A man who killed a cop nearly two decades ago was executed Tuesday night, in a highly controversial death penalty case. Robert Wayne Holsey was sentenced to death for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy, Will Robinson, in 1995 while he robbed a store in Milledgeville, Georgia. He died just after 10:51pm local time, after having a last meal of eight pieces of fried chicken. When a corrections official offered him sedatives to help him 'relax', Holsey declined, according to the Los Angeles Times. Just before his death, Holsey said a prayer and made a final statement, apologizing for killing Robinson and taking full responsibility for the crime. Robert Wayne Holsey (pictured left) was executed Tuesday night for shooting dead a sheriff's deputy in Georgia in 1995, Will Robinson (right) Holsey's death was controversial since it later emerged that his original defense attorney had been drinking a quart of vodka a day during the trial and afterwards admitted that he was in no  state to represent anyone at the time. Holsey's new legal team has argued that because his lawyer was an alcoholic, he never received adequate representation at trial. The jury did not hear about Holsey's intellectual disability or his horrific childhood during his 1997 trail, according to NBC. The killer's trial attorney was disbarred in 2006 because of his drinking problem and also for stealing from a client. Holsey's latest defense team made every effort to stop his execution, requesting to stays from the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Both were declined, but it was noted that Justices Stephen G Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor would have voted in favor of staying the execution. The killer shot 26-year-old Deputy Robinson once in the right arm and once behind his right ear during a traffic stop following the robbery. He was arrested three hours later. The suspect was found guilty of all charges in February 1997 and sentenced to death. Deputy Robinson is survived by his parents and two brothers. The family issued a statement Tuesday saying they were glad to see justice being served. 'William was a leader and true hero, evidenced by the years of outpouring of support to our family by all who loved and respected him,' the Robinson family said.","Robert Wayne Holsey was executed just after 10:51pm Tuesday .

"A deranged homeless man has admitted to pushing a student in front of a commuter train in the New York City suburbs last year. Howard Mickens, 40, pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted murder in Westchester County District Court on Tuesday, and will be sentenced next month. The South Carolina native was arrested on September 25, 2013, when he pushed Hunter College student Maya Leggat, then 21, onto the train tracks at the White Plains Metro-North train station. Justice: The homeless man who pushed Maya Leggat (pictured) onto commuter rail train tracks last year, pleaded guilty to attempted murder in court on Tuesday . Guilty: Howard Mickens, 40,  admitted to shoving the Hunter College student on to the tracks at this station north of New York City on September 25, 2013 . The English major was waiting to catch a train into the city for class when she looked up from her e-book reader to see a man staring at her. She looked back down as a train was coming into the station and just moments later felt the stranger grab her by the waist and shove her onto the tracks. Leggat survived the incident, but she suffered a broken back, two broken legs and a severed finger in the random attack. Mickens, who was living in a homeless center in Valhalla, is expected to be sentenced to the maximum of 25 years in prison, five years probation and an order to stay away from Leggat at his next hearing on January 20. In court on Tuesday, Mickens admitted he pushed Leggat on the tracks and that it was an unprovoked attack. Leggat was not present in the courtroom to hear Mickens' admission. Survivor: Mickens is expected to be sentenced to 25 years in prison at his next hearing on January 20. Above, more pictures of Leggat who survived the incident, but suffered several broken bones and a severed finger . He remained calm and quietly answered questions from Judge Barbara Zambelli and Assistant District Attorney Timothy Ward. Mickens' behavior was a sea change from his first hearing last year, when he went on a rant in court, pleading he was 'guilty with an explanation' and that people were out to kill him. The judge ordered Mickens held for a psychiatric evaluation, and doctors said he was unfit to stand trial. However, psychiatric experts for the prosecution said he was responsible for his criminal actions. He is now taking medications including the drug Risperdal, which is prescribed to those  who suffer from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 'I think the medication has helped you a lot, Mr Mickens, to understand what is going on here today,' Judge Zambelli said. Mickens has a lengthy criminal record dating back twenty years.  He has been incarcerated in state prison three times, for convictions on robbery, assault and drug possession charges, records show.","Victim Maya Leggat survived the random attack, but suffered several broken bones and a severed ring finger .

"Shedding light on the woes of the upper middle, the 'Overheard in Waitrose' Facebook page took the internet by storm. Infants were heard pining for star fruit and lychees, as mothers barked: 'Noah! You've had enough Manchego for one day!' But now, as hard-up families turn to budget rivals, a version has been made for the cut-price alternative: Aldi. Scroll down for video . Not quite: Aldi may offer everything from chips to soya milk on the cheap, but this shopper seems confused . Change: After internet users flocked to read Waitrose shoppers comments, an Aldi version is becoming a hit . Poking fun: The page pokes fun at the bargain supermarket that has been snapping up shoppers from its rivals . Winning shoppers: The cut-price supermarket has become a hit with the ethos 'spend a little, live a lot' Instead of poking fun at the cushioned lives of Waitrose customers, Overheard In Aldi's collection of comical comments depict a more downmarket shopper. One post on the site, which has more than 2,000 'likes', reads: 'This place is fantastic value for money, I got a shopping trolley that was on display outside for £1. Bargain.' Another adds: 'Chantelle put that f****** vodka back you already got a bottle for ya 16th birthday last week!!' The company, with its no frills approach and low prices, has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent, massively outpacing the big four of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Aldi has made huge efforts to attract Middle Britain shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits, to coffee, olive oil, Aberdeen Angus steaks and even fresh goose for Christmas. The group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores, fewer staff and charges for plastic bags. Confused: Compared to the Waitrose version, quotes on the Aldi page are not littered with elaborate words . Shoppers: One commenter used the format of Flo-Rida's song Low to describe the typical Aldi shopper . Dialect: While most of the Waitrose quotes have a posh air, Aldi's shoppers  speak in local dialects . Significantly, . it does not stock any of the big brands, like Kellogg’s and Heinz, . however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat . versions. Its . approach has proved popular because of the resulting low prices which . appeal to a nation suffering the longest and deepest cut in incomes and . living standards ever recorded. The . low prices do not mean poor quality or taste. Just last week the . supermarket won 16 gold medals and another 10 silvers in an annual test . to find the nation’s best own-label supermarket foods. The . webpage also features a conversation between two shoppers who struggle . with simple maths and get confused by half price offers. There . is also a conversation in which a youngster asks their dad to buy them . cigarettes, but he replies: 'Nah forgot my fake ID'. Another post about an aubergine sees a boy ask his mum if the vegetable is a cucumber, to which she answers: 'No, it’s a courgette dumb s***.' It is a stark contrast from Overheard in Waitrose, which paints a picture of shoppers whose wealth has left them out of touch with everyday lives. Popular: It seems the group is a response to the Waitrose page as Aldi continues to soar in popularity . Cut-price: Aldi has gained a name for winning customers with bargains - and it seems that's all they come for . One child was overheard asking his mum if they were 'doing shopping for the boat as well'. Another . parent was reported telling her son: 'Lucas put that falafel down, you . already chose olives with Manchego for your treat.' According . to the Facebook page, one couple in the Newark branch in . Nottinghamshire who spotted another customer with an Asda shopping bag . said to each other: 'Should she be walking around in here with that?' And after a Waitrose butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead, she replied: 'Topside? Why on earth would we feed Winnie topside?

Children in Waitrose clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets .

"South African prosecutors have won their bid to appeal the culpable homicide verdict handed down to Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius for killing his girlfriend and will now seek a murder conviction. 'I cannot say the prospect of success at the Supreme Court is remote,' said Pretoria High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa in granting the appeal. Prosecution lawyers applied for leave to appeal after Judge Thokozile Masipa in October sentenced the Paralympic gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest. The state lost an application to challenge that sentence - although it could still petition that decision. Scroll down for videos . Judge Masipa has ruled that prosecution lawyers can appeal against the decision not to convict Oscar Pistorius of murder after he admitted shooting Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year . Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013, insisting he thought she was an intruder. After a seven-month trial, Judge Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide, equivalent to the UK crime of manslaughter, after throwing out a more serious charge of murdering Miss Steenkamp. State prosecutor Gerrie Nel said in his application to appeal on Tuesday that the judgement was 'shockingly inappropriate' and requested permission to seek a murder conviction, which would carry a minimum 15 year jail term. South Africa's State Prosecutor Gerrie Nel arrives at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, today . Nel argued that even if Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was behind the door when he fired, the athlete showed intent to kill whoever was in the small toilet cubicle. Pistorius's jail term will not be extended unless the state convinces the Supreme Court of Appeal to overturn the original culpable homicide verdict. Tiaan Labuschagne, of South African law firm Greyvensteins, said an appeal court will decide whether or not Judge Masipa made a mistake in her interpretation of the law when she handed found Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide. If the panel decides Judge Masipa did err, they will look back at the facts presented in the original trial and could then convict Pistorius of murder if they decide the facts of the case support that, Mr Labuschagne said. Nathi Mncube, the prosecution spokesman, said he hopes the appeal will be 'expedited' but acknowledged that the process can take a long time. In arguing for an appeal, the prosecution said the judge incorrectly interpreted a legal principle. Under that principle, a person should be found guilty of murder if he foresaw the possibility of a person dying because of his actions and went ahead anyway. 'We're happy,' Mr Mncube said after the hearing. Pistorius now faces the prospect of a murder conviction. Once prosecutors appeal the conviction, the appeals court will review the case to determine if the verdict was appropriate. Pistorius could be out of jail and serving out the rest of his five-year sentence on house arrest by the time prosecutors can appeal his conviction, an expert said today. Terry Price, a top South African criminal advocate, said the appeal wasn't likely to be heard until summer 2015. Pistorius was sentenced to five years in jail on October 21, but according to South African law he can be eligible for release to house arrest after serving just one-sixth of that sentence, equivalent to 10 months. That means that if the Commission of Prisons agrees he's no longer a risk to the public Pistorius could be out by August 21. Mr Price said the appeal was likely to be heard by South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. 'There's a big question mark over the meaning of dolus eventualis,' he said, referring to the legal principle the interpretation of which lies at the heart of the appeal. 'Whether she (Judge Thokozile Masipa) applied it correctly or not is the issue. 'The Supreme Court of Appeal will want it because they want to clear up exactly what it means.' Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria courtroom where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel yesterday said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law. He told her: 'There is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this, my lady, is shockingly inappropriate.' Ahead of the application, Miss Steenkamp's mother, June, said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter's death. She told Alex Crawford from Sky News: 'I wanted the truth (at the trial), but it seems some of the puzzle is missing. 'There's only two people who know what happened. One of them's my daughter and she's not here anymore.' She said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family. Mrs Steenkamp added: 'What difference is it going to make to me? I wanted to see him go down the steps [to the court cells]. 'So it doesn't really matter how long - he's going to know that he can't go around hurting people.' Mrs Steenkamp and her husband Barry previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder. In a bizarre twist, Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials, said Pistorius could apply for bail even though it 'would cause a public outcry'. He told MailOnline: 'They could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence. 'The prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down.' 'Shockingly inappropriate sentence': Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria court where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law . Judge Masipa (above) granted the appeal and the case will now be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital . Another lawyer said the decision to throw out the Shrien Dewani murder trial in Cape Town yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued in appeal papers filed last month that Judge Masipa misinterpreted the law when she ruled Pistorius did not intentionally shoot Miss Steenkamp, describing the sentence as 'shockingly light' and 'inappropriate'. Pistorius, a South African athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able-bodied runners in the Olympics, can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars, which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls. Should Judge Masipa grant the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital. Reeva Steenkamp's parents Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder, bit found guilty of manslaughter . Hood said that with the decision of a Cape Town court yesterday to throw out the Shrien Dewani case - another high-profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - South Africa's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair. 'From a perception point of view, both public and internationally, we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system.' Pistorius, who celebrated his 28th birthday last month, has been serving his sentence in a Pretoria prison. Behind bars: Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day last year, telling the court he thought she was an intruder . 'He's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners. There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed,' said his older brother Carl, in an interview with You magazine, a South African tabloid. Pistorius has been accused of receiving special treatment in South Africa's notoriously corrupt prisons, where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars. Yet Carl dismissed claims his brother is living the good life, saying Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks, including baked beans and canned pilchards. 'He now lives moment by moment,' said Carl. 'There's no fairytale.'","State lawyers applied for appeal after athlete was acquitted of murder .

"Aldi could soon overtake Waitrose in market share as more middle class families choose to shop at the budget chain. Sales at the German-owned discount store rose 32.2 per cent in the 12 weeks to July 20. This means 4.8 per cent of shoppers now visit Aldi, up from 3.7 per cent this time last year and rapidly approaching Waitrose’s 4.9 per cent share. German invasion: Budget supermarket Aldi now has 4.8 per cent of British food shoppers coming through their doors - up from 3.7 per cent last year . This means 4.8 per cent of Britain’s food shoppers now walk through its doors, up from  3.7 per cent this time last year and a hair’s breadth away from Waitrose, which commands 4.9 per cent of the market. Edward Garner, a director at Kantar Worldpanel said: ‘Aldi’s 32 per cent growth rate has lifted its market share to 4.8 per cent; this is a new record for the retailer and means it has nearly caught up with Waitrose.’ Sainbury and Asda held on to their market share, recording growth of 1.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. But the rise of the discounters has struck at the heart of the Big Four grocers. Aldi’s arch-rival Lidl, also German-owned, recorded sales growth of 19.5 per cent and saw its market share rise from 3.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent. Tesco has been struggling to turn around its troubled UK chain and last week ditched chief executive Philip Clarke after the latest in a string of profit warnings. Up-and-coming: Also is now closing in on Waitrose, which has a 4.9 per cent share of the British market . The data also shows Tesco has suffered its worst sales decline in at least two decades, with a fall of  3.8pc. That is its steepest decline since comparable records began in 1994. Tesco’s market share fell to 28.9 per cent from 30.3 per cent a year ago, despite investing £1bn in cutting prices, improving service and staff numbers, and refreshing stores. The market has become polarised with the biggest growth found at the discounters and at the upper end, while the mid-market players have been squeezed. Tesco and Morrisons have both been forced to respond by investing hundreds of millions of pounds in a price war. Aldi’s joint managing director Roman Heini told the Mail he was glad he didn’t run Tesco: ‘I’m glad we don’t have huge complex beasts with online, banking, huge ranges and am thankful what we have is simple. This has enabled us to be close to the market.’ Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said: ‘This price war magnifies our offer. Everyone talks about narrowing the gap on Aldi, highlighting that we have the best offers. ‘Plus it spells out to shoppers that if they are only narrowing the gap it means that they don’t want to match us on price.’ Aldi has a finely-honed model, selling a limited range of 1,500 lines instead of the 40,000 stocked in the mainstream supermarkets, of which 90 per cent are own brand. It stocks just three different types of olive oil compared with the 20 or so found in a Tesco. Aldi’s olive oil buyer is able to know the supplier and the three products inside out because the range is so small. Mr Barnes says: ‘This allows us to concentrate our efforts on making this product the best olive oil on the market. It also means we buy a higher volume (per line) than our competitors do. This allows us to offer incredible value to our customers.’ In a recent Daily Mail taste test Aldi’s olive oil at £2.69 for 500ml was given 10/10 compared to the 7/10 given to Waitrose’s extra virgin olive oil at £14.99 for 500ml. It also uses checkouts that were developed and patented by its German parent, where the conveyor belts are longer to accommodate the entire contents of a trolley load. The items have bigger bar codes in three different positions which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned. Aldi claims this enables customers to pass through the tills 40 per cent faster, meaning shorter queues. Waiting times are also shortened because shoppers are not allowed to pack their bags at the tills – they have to reload their trolleys and bag up their items a shelf at the back of the store. Kantar said its measure of price inflation for the industry fell to 0.4 per cent - the lowest level since its records began in October 2006. Overall market growth for the latest period fell to 0.9 per cent – the lowest figure for 10 years.","Aldi now has 4.8 per cent of the British food shopping market .

Within one week, the test results appear on the user's profile, where they can be compared with the results of other users.

"Questions emerged today over the reasons behind the departure of ITV weathergirl Sian Lloyd from the channel after 24 years. Ms Lloyd, who at 56 was Britain's longest-serving female forecaster, has not presented the ITV weather since February. Despite having done the job for the broadcaster since 1990, the year after the ITV National Weather Service was created, she left quietly and without any announcement. Scroll down for video . Why did she go?  Sian Lloyd, 56, quietly left her job of 24 years presenting the weather for ITV in February . That same month, she wrote an online blog about ITV's weather service commenting on 'this age of blatant lookism' in the world of television. Viewers have taken to online forums to ask what has happened to the popular presenter. One wrote:'Any ideas where Sian Lloyd has vanished to? 'She hasn't been on ITV for around six months now but is still very active on her weathergirl website. 'Perhaps long term sabbatical? Or has she left ITV altogether? Another questioned whether ageism was an issue, with one writing on a popular television forum: 'Surely this is not an ageism issue? 'I would have thought senior and experienced presenters would be just what a broadcaster would want, not kids fresh out of school.' In February, the month Ms Lloyd left her weather job at ITV, the Welsh star wrote a blog for Huffington Post that now reads like a swansong for her career at ITV. Paying tribute to veteran presenters Martyn Davies and Alex Hill, she wrote: 'They taught me so much...' Ms Lloyd had a well-publicised engagement with Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, right, which ended in 2006 . 'In this age of blatant lookism, they were totally themselves. 'They had no interest in polishing their egos, only in focusing on delivering the most accurate forecast possible... 'ITV will never see their likes again. 'As a compatriot of mine once sang: Those were the days my friends...'' In an article written a couple of years previously, Lloyd referred to herself as a 'survivor' in a world where ageism was 'prevalent', and insisted she would work 'til I drop'. She wrote: 'There is no doubt that ageism is prevalent in TV, way more so than in society at large. 'As for me, I intend fighting fire with fire and working till I drop. I shall be happy when they start calling Michael Fish a Weather Boy, and when they dare put a female with as big a belly as Bill Giles on the National Weather.' Her heyday: Ms Lloyd, pictured presenting the weather in 1999, became a popular and experienced presenter . Today, a spokesman for ITV was quick to deny that Ms Lloyd's departure from ITV had anything to do with her age. He said: 'As both ITV and Sian have stated, she has moved on to pursue new opportunities. 'To claim that her departure has anything to do with her age is complete nonsense.' Ms Lloyd's agent Seamus Lyte told MailOnline that Ms Lloyd, who was engaged to Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik before marrying motor-racing entrepreneur, Jonathan Ashman in 2007, had 'moved on'. He said: 'Sian has been busy filming for a number of shows on ITV, BBC and S4C and doing a number of corporate and charity related events so that has been keeping her very busy. 'S4C and BBC Scotland are also working with Sian.' Ms Lloyd has been happily married to motor-racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman, pictured, since 2007 . He added: 'Sian has been a long-standing Met Office presenter, and is now moving on from presenting the weather on ITV, after more than 20 years to pursue these opportunities.' But Mr Lyte did not respond to questions over whose decision it was for the veteran weathergirl to leave ITV, or whether her age had been a contributing factor. Ms Lloyd also runs her tvweathergirl.com website and does corporate work.","An ITV weathergirl since 1990, she's UK's longest-serving female forecaster .

"Police are investigating Ched Evans' family today because CCTV footage of his victim was published on his official website. The woman, now 22, is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans, who was released from prison last week. North Wales Police told MailOnline they are 'looking into' the post named: 'Too drunk to consent, too drunk to remember?', which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Police are probing the decision to publish CCTV showing the victim of Ched Evans, pictured yesterday with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, on the night of her rape . Website: Evans, who despite his conviction maintains his innocence, has a website demanding justice and on it the woman he raped is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked . The police, Crown Prosecution Service and Premier Inn have said they did not give permission for the film to be used. Evans' website, which is run by his family, has asked viewers to 'judge for yourself' if she was drunk when he attacked her. Her face is obscured in the film. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years after the jury unanimously agreed  she had been too drunk to consent to sex with him. Two years ago she had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012, but now may have to do the same again. The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. Police put her ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. Evans, right, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission . Anger: Twitter uses have reacted to the news that Evans' victim may have been named again by trolls . But Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. Detective Superintendent Jo Williams said: 'The victim in this case has been in regular contact with officers responsible for her care and she is receiving appropriate support at this difficult time. She has been fully appraised of all her options.' Victim: Ched Evans' victim's  new identity has apparently been published by trolls. She moved away from her friends and family, because of the abuse she suffered after being raped but may have to take on a third identity . Yesterday Ched Evans was seen smiling in public as he went shopping with his loyal girlfriend Natasha Massey in Cheshire. The footballer, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence and is looking for a new club, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It normally takes 18 months to examine a miscarriage of justice claim but Evans’ application will be considered ‘within weeks’ after fresh evidence was put forward by his legal team. The Commission said its decision ‘does not in any way represent a judgment as to the merits of the case or its chances of being referred to the Court of Appeal’. The move has caused concern among rape campaigners. Rape Crisis England and Wales said: ‘We’re concerned that survivors’ voices and feelings [should] not be lost or overlooked in the furore surrounding one high-profile rapist’s release.’ Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB) said: ‘Rehabilitation requires remorse. Evans has continuously denied that he committed rape.’ An appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the court of appeal in 2012. In an interview in the Sunday Mirror, the former Sheffield United and Wales footballer – who hopes to resume his career – failed to apologise to his victim but praised his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25, for standing by him. ‘I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock,’ he said. ‘I am very lucky my girlfriend Tasha has stood by me. She knows I am not capable of rape. ‘I want to play football again, but I am determined to prove my innocence. ‘I really thought it would have been thrown out of court. I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong.’ Some fans at Sheffield United are asking the club to re-sign Evans saying he has served his sentence and should be rehabilitated. But more than 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back. TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy last week by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’ during a panel discussion on ITV’s Loose Women. Her comments caused a wave of outrage and abuse on social media and also sparked threats against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe, wishing rape on her. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Evans'  website has used the footage with the title: 'Too drunk to consent?'

"As Saturday night's show came to a close and the X Factor crowd erupted into applause for Ben Haenow's rendition of Hallelujah, the 29-year-old contestant couldn't hold back his emotion. Not only was it the pinnacle of Ben's X Factor journey, but as Ben explains to the MailOnline, it also felt like the culmination of years of hard slog in the music industry. 'It was  emotional,' Ben says from his tour bus. ‘For me it all came to a head, thinking back over what I’ve been through and the reasons I entered the competition.' Ben Haenow couldn't hold back his emotion on Saturday night's show: 'For me it all came to a head, thinking back over what I’ve been through and the reasons I entered the competition' This week Ben is riding up and down the country in his very own tour bus with friends and family on board . 'For me, it's about trying to succeed in an industry that for I've been trying to making it in for years, to the point of nearly giving up.' Ben has sung in bands with his big brother, Alex, since they were children, and for the best part of a decade has been playing gigs up and down the country, hoping to break into the industry. 'We used to play gigs around the South East. When you're spending money on petrol and not being paid anything to cover costs, it becomes hard slog. 'I started thinking, ""I’m playing to five or ten people and I've travelled all this way. What for?"" People are just there to drink – not really to listen to your band anyway.' Ben won enthusiastic reviews for his first song on Saturday night, Please Come Home For Christmas . Left: Ben feeling good after his first performance on Saturday night; Right: On stage with Simon Cowell receiving the news that he was through to this week's final . Vote for Ben! Just to hammer the point home, Ben stood in front of some very important words . 'No one's ever said, ""You're not good enough"" but then again I haven't always had the best feedback. I've been heckled on stage with people saying ""get off"" and stuff like that. 'It's no different to the rubbish gigs that countless other musicians will have experienced. But when you're not getting the recognition you want to, it does start to get to you,' admits Ben. Who do you want to win X Factor 2014? Who do you want to win X Factor 2014? Now share your opinion . As he sang the last few notes of Leonard Cohen's melancholic tune, those experiences were whirring round his head. Not all the judges were complimentary of Ben's rendition but Simon said: 'I am going to remember that performance. Your voice broke in places because you're emotional... you've earned your place in this final.' Ben explains: 'At that moment, that stage felt like an amazing place to be  and everything was going through my head. I was also thinking how much that moment could change mine and my family's life.' So what would it mean to the van driver from Croydon to win? 'Jeeees,' Ben says. 'It would make my life! 'It would help get us, my family, in a better place. We live in a council estate and me, my mum and brother live together. So I'd like to sort my family out with somewhere else to live.' Ben with fellow finalists Fleur East (left) and Andrea Faustini (right) after the Sunday night results show . 'I just want to make my mum’s life a bit easier. I'd like it if she didn’t have to worry as she gets older and for her not to have to work quite so hard,' he adds. The other important women in the singer's life is his girlfriend of six-and-a-half years, Jessica Jones, who the singer plans to propose to in the near future. But for the moment, what's on Ben's horizon is going on tour with his X Factor buddies. 'It's going to be the most amazing experience,' Ben says. 'It'll be a taster of what want to do for rest of life – to make make music and play gigs.' This week Ben is  riding up and down the country in his very own tour bus with all his friends and family on board. Left: With girlfriend of six-and-a-half years, Jessica Jones, who the singer plans to propose to in the near future; Right: Ben in boots and skinny jeans - a look he says he's picked up from being on the show . 'I can’t believe there’s a bus with my face on it – it’s a massive coach full of people that mean everything to me. That's the most important bit. 'It’s going to be the busiest week of my life but I’m looking forward to it and Simon Cowell may even pop on.' The music mogul, Ben says, has been a great source of support and advice. 'He's always told me to stay focused and try to be true to the musician you want to be in the real world. 'He’s lovely - he’s had all that success but he’s just a normal guy. 'I respect all the judges, which is why I don't mind the criticism. On the X Factor you put yourself up on that platform to take on people’s opinions and be judged. But it's lucky to be in a position to get a critique from these people who have been in the industry for years.' Before appearing on the show, Ben says he was 'jeans and T-shirt guy' but says he'll take away some style tips. Going well, then? The 29-year-old heart throb gave a big thumbs up as he arrived at London's Global studios . Ben on stage in the quarter final - throughout the live shows, the finalist has won rave reviews for his rock voice from judges and X Factor fans . 'I've always worn trainers, so wearing boots and skinny jeans is new to me. There have also been a lot of leather jackets. Leather jackets weren’t exactly what I would have worn previously. 'Obviously being caked in makeup is not what I'm used to either but I won’t be taking that into my daily life. 'But having a team of people working with you and styling you have been great. At least I haven’t had to wear any sequin onesies or anything like that!' Contrary to rumours, Ben confirms the boys in the house haven't been ordered to lose weight by X Factor bosses. 'There's no truth in that,' he says, but does admit: 'There's been a biscuit and chocolate ban in the house since I got here. They don’t want everyone gorging themselves on choc and sweets, which is understandable. 'But there's been no specific message for me and Andrea to stop eating and go on a diet. 'Anyway, you want to look after yourself when you're on stage - you want to look good and feel confident.' But one area Ben says has been slipping is his fitness. X factor madness has meant he doesn't have time for his regular hour and a half daily swim and has spent less time in the gym. 'My brother is big into the gym and he’s in great shape so he usually spurs me on,' he admits. Can Ben reveal what audiences have in store this weekend? 'I can't give anything away,' he says. 'But everyone’s in for something really special?

"On the face of it, it sounds like any wealthy car collector's dream - a 1930s vehicle in pristine condition, its past brimming with stories, up for sale for £400,000. But any buyer will have to come to terms with the fact that this was the very vehicle that used to transport infamous Nazi Heinrich Himmler around during World War II – when he was the architect of the Holocaust. The military Wanderer W11/1 was the S.S. and Gestapo chief's official transport as he inspected the concentration camps and the killing fields of Russia, where he witnessed mass executions of Jews and partisans. Nazi mass-murderer Heinrich Himmler's car, the military Wanderer W11/1, is going up for sale for £400,000 at a vintage car dealership in Germany . Michael Fröhlich, who is selling the car, said he has already had some interest from neo-Nazis, to whom he refused to sell it . Now it is being offered for sale by vintage car dealer Michael Fröhlich, whose Oldtimer Agency has been running for 40 years in Germany. He has previously sold the Rolls-Royce of the Moroccan king and a host of vehicles owned by celebrities. The four-seater with a three-litre, 65 horsepower engine was acquired by Himmler in 1939. It has 63,500 miles on the clock and was used in conjunction with his private fleet of limousines, mostly in the European territories conquered by the Nazis. Fröhlich says he acquired the vehicle through a financial consulting firm. The four-seater, three-litre vehicle, which has a 65 horsepower engine, was used by Himmler as he went about his  business in the European territories conquered by the Nazis . Some interested parties have already called seeking to buy it, but he considered them neo-Nazis and refused to sell it. The car has been authenticated by Second World War historians as being the one that transported the Third Reich's angel of death on his sinister travels. The car was built by a company in Chemnitz, eastern Germany, which became Karl Marx Stadt under the communists. The firm moved to Munich after the war and went bust in 2010. In 1991 the vehicle was recovered from a museum in Riga, Latvia, which was also going bankrupt. It is now in a storeroom between a McDonald's  restaurant and warehouses on an industrial estate in Mettmann in North Rhine-Westphalia. Hitler's henchman Himmler was overlord of the S.S., chief of the Gestapo and planner of the Holocaust which killed six million Jews . Its steep price and dark past means it might be stuck up in a warehouse for some time more, but Frölich is hopeful that a rich American collector might snap it up. Himmler killed himself with a poison capsule in May 1945 after he fell into the hands of a British army patrol as he wandered with a band of compatriots dressed as an ordinary German soldier. Last Friday his devoted daughter Gudrun 'Puppi' Burwitz celebrated her 85th birthday in a Munich suburb with a speech to former S.S. men. She is one of a handful of people in modern-day Germany who believes her father was a great man. The son of a school teacher, Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich on October 7, 1900, and went on to become the architect of the Holocaust and one of the Nazi party's most dreadful chiefs. His first involvement with the Nazis was in 1923, and he was their propaganda leader between 1926 and 1930. He was made head of the S.S. - the Schutzstaffel - a major  organisation and Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard, which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the Third Reich. Himmler developed it from a 290-man battalion to a huge group with its own military. He became president of the Gestapo (Secret State Police) once the Nazis had come to power in 1933, and set up the very first Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, the same year. Himmler was obsessed with the idea of the Germans as the Aryan race and racial purification - he encouraged Aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up. During the Second World War, after Hitler had successfully invaded Poland, he was able to force out more than a million Poles and 300,000 Jews out of the west of the country. In 1941, Himmler was present at the shooting of 100 Jews by firing squad in Minsk. He deciding that having to witness such killings might affect the mental health of his S.S. men, and declared that alternative methods of genocide be found. In 1942 he was charged with control of 'the final solution to the Jewish problem' - the Holocaust. He was given control of the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and by the spring of that year it was greatly expanded to include gas chambers. In total, close to six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. When it became clear that the Nazis were going to lose the war, Himmler attempted to bargain with the Allies, and Hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties. After the surrender he used a fake identity to try and escape, but was captured. He committed suicide while being held by the allied forces on May 23, 1945, by swallowing a poison capsule.","Military Wanderer W11/1 on the market for £400,000 at German dealership .

"Auction website eBay has refused to list a World War II-era Mercedes Benz once owned Hermann Goering, a Nazi leader who commanded the German air force, citing a policy prohibiting the sale of offensive items. The 1941 Mercedes Benz 540 K Cabriolet B, custom built by Daimler-Benz for Adolf Hitler's close confidant, is currently in pieces in a high-end south Florida automobile shop, where owners said they plan to spend about $750,000 to restore it to working condition. 'We've located all the replacement parts and we can make parts,' said High Velocity Classics co-owner David Rathbun. Needs work: The 1941 Mercedes Benz 540 K Cabriolet B, custom built by Daimler-Benz for Adolf Hitler's close confidant, is currently in pieces in a high-end south Florida automobile shop, where owners said they plan to spend about $750,000 to restore it to working condition . eBay, however, asked the owners to take down the auction after learning it would go live in early July. 'eBay has policies in place that prohibit the sale of offensive materials and content, which includes listings that promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial, sexual or religious intolerance,' spokesman Ryan Moore wrote in an email. the car was considered a trophy of allied victory after it was captured at Hitler’s villa at Berchtesgaden at the close of the war. It was used by Colonel Heintges, the commander of the 7th Infantry who captured the vehicle, as his personal vehicle, which it remained during the Allied Occupation of Germany. Prized possession: Goering often rode through the streets in the open-topped Mercedes (right) as he waved to crowds in Nazi Germany before it was captured at Hitler’s villa at Berchtesgaden at the close of the war . Evil: Hermann Goering founded Hitler's Gestapo secret police and was a prime architect of the Nazi Holocaust . After the war it became army surplus and was eventually sold by the head of a psychology institution in Heilbronn to Master Sergeant Sam Hosier, who drove it in occupied Germany. Hosier brought it to the United States and in 1955 sold it to a North Carolina man, who owned it until this year. The owners would not say how much they paid for the car, only that they hope it will sell for $5 million to $7 million. No hate: eBay says its policies prohibit listings that promote or glorify hatred, violence or racial, sexual or religious intolerance . Another of Goering's cars, a . convertible Mercedes 540 K nicknamed the Blue Goose, was auctioned in . 2011 in Italy by Ontario, Canada-based RM Auctions for about $2 million. The owners lamented having to turn to traditional high-end auto sales auctions to sell the stretch coupe once work is finished.

Following Hitler's suicide in 1945, Goering surrendered to the U.S. Army in Austria. He was found guilty of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials and was sentenced to death. However, he cheated the hangman's noose by killing himself in his cell aged 53 with a phial of hidden cyanide. He was known as a Nazi 'magpie' and amassed a personal fortune through the confiscation of Jewish property. His collection included paintings, tapestries, jewellery, hunting ornaments, altarpieces and rugs.","Hermann Goering had Mercedes Benz 540K Cabriolet B custom built in 1940 .

"The daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus’ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey. Not only were they stepping into the unknown to find a home, but a new study suggests they may have also suffered from scurvy while sailing across the Atlantic. The scurvy killed many of the early colonisers, researchers claim, causing the ultimate demise of the La Isabela settlement within just four years of it being founded. Historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic suggests the early colonisers suffered from severe scurvy . This is according to historic documents and analysis of 27 skeletons buried at Columbus' settlement in what is now the Dominican Republic. Researchers believe the colonisers beat most of the scurvy by the time they died, but the disease may have contributed to a wave of deaths in the early colony. La Isabela, the first permanent European town in the Western Hemisphere, was abandoned within just four years of being established amid sickness and deprivation. Bones of sailors and colonists from graves behind the abandoned village's small churchyard have been unearthed from the site since the 1980s. The daring seafarers who went on Christopher Columbus¿ second trip to the New World in 1493 had major obstacles to overcome in their journey. Pictured is an artist's impress of the landing of Christopher Columbus . La Isabela was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile. Pictured is the first landing of Columbus by Thomas Worth . La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. It was one of the first European settlements in America. It was founded by Christopher Columbus during his second voyage in 1493 and named after Queen Isabella I of Castile. Hunger and disease is thought to have soon led to mutiny, punishment, disillusion, and more hunger and disease. A group of settlers, led by Bernal de Pisa, attempted to capture and make off with several ships and go back to Spain. La Isabela's demise took place in 1496 when Columbus decided to abandon it in favour of a new settlement, which is now known as Santo Domingo. ‘They were still encased in earth when we started the study. We had to clean the bones to proceed,’ study author Vera Tiesler told National Geographic. Historians have blamed smallpox, influenza, and malaria for the town's failure, but the latest study by Mexico's Universidad Autonoma de Yucatán argues scurvy was the main cause. At least 20 of the 27 skeletons had signs—ridges carved in the outer lining of bones—of what the study describes as 'severe scurvy.' Scurvy, caused by one to three months of vitamin C deficiency, plagued seafarers until the 18th century. Symptoms included lethargy, anaemia, and, the re-opening of old wounds. Researchers suggest the voyagers might have avoided scurvy if they'd sailed directly from Spain to La Isabela - a journey of two months or less. When Columbus and his companions reached the Americas, they landed at a Hispaniola outpost first. ‘It was especially long, this trip - three months. And that's exactly the time scurvy needs to be in full bloom,’ Professor Tiesler said. La Isabela was established in what is now the Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.

"Heinrich Himmler pictured with his wife Marga, daughter Gudrun (centre), adopted son Gerhard and a friend of his daughter . At first glance, the letters read like those sent by any other travelling businessman to his much-loved wife and daughter. ‘In the next few days I’ll be in Lublin, Zamosc, Auschwitz, Lviv and then in the new headquarters,’ writes the 41-year-old chief executive officer of a massive pan-European corporation. ‘I’m curious if and how I will be able to phone, as it will probably be around 2,000 kilometres to Gmund. All the best, have a nice trip and enjoy your days with our little daughter. Many warm greetings and kisses!’ There is one word that immediately leaps out in this otherwise banal missive. That word is, of course, ‘Auschwitz’. For the writer of the letter is no ordinary executive on the road. It was in fact written by one of the most notorious mass murderers in history — Heinrich Himmler. As head of the dreaded SS, Hitler’s Nazi guard, Himmler’s ‘business’ was to orchestrate the mass shootings and gassings of millions of Jews and other ‘undesirables’. When he wrote the letter to his wife Marga, a nurse, and their daughter Gudrun in July 1942, Himmler was about to embark on a tour during which he would personally oversee the repellent and horrific ‘work’ that he ordered his men to carry out. Just a few weeks later, while watching a massacre in Minsk, the face and coat of this proud family man were spattered with the blood of a Jew who had just been shot. ‘He [Himmler] wasn’t actually sick,’ one witness recalled, ‘but he was heaving and turned round and swayed and then I had to jump forward and hold him steady and then I led him away from the grave.’ This chilling contrast between the public, murderous life of Himmler and the affectionate details of his private, domestic life came to light yesterday with the publication by the German newspaper Die Welt of a cache of hitherto unseen letters written by the SS leader to his family. Their release has been timed to coincide with today’s Holocaust Memorial Day. The papers had lain hidden for several decades in Tel Aviv, having been bought by an Israeli Holocaust survivor called Chaim Rosenthal in the final days of World War II. In 2007, Rosenthal sold the collection to a film-maker called Vanessa Lapa, who will shortly release a documentary about the letters, which she is calling The Decent. The title is an ironic reference to a notorious speech Himmler made in October 1943, in which he spoke openly about exterminating the Jews. ‘Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other,’ he told a Nazi gathering, ‘when there are 500 or when there are a 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person — with exceptions due to human weaknesses — has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of.’ The notion that Himmler, despite ordering a genocide, could have remained ‘decent’, is clearly absurd, but as the letters show, the SS leader continued to believe himself to be a loving family man. The letters reveal Himmler as seemingly able to separate the two sides of his personality. These letters reveal Himmler as seemingly able to separate the two sides of his personality . As head of the dreaded SS, Hitler's Nazi guard, Himmler's 'business' was to orchestrate the mass shootings and gassings of millions of Jews and other 'undesirables' Just a few days before Nazi Germany’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Himmler spent a few halcyon days with his family in an idyllic part of Upper Bavaria. As the three of them explored the beautiful countryside, Himmler did not mention to either his wife or daughter that his beloved SS and the German armed forces were about to mobilise on an epic scale in order to try to defeat Stalin. Himmler’s wife only seemed to have learned about the attack later when the news became public. ‘Now we are at war again,’ she wrote to her husband on June 22. ‘I knew it. I didn’t sleep well at all.’ While millions suffered the privations brought about by the war, the Himmlers continued to have a taste for the high life. ‘There is still one can of caviar in the fridge,’ Marga told her husband. ‘Take it.’ The collection of documents also contains Marga’s wartime account book, which shows that she was spending extravagantly — about ten times more than the average household. However, while his wife concerned herself with domesticity, it seems that Himmler’s daughter, Gudrun, then 11 years old, was more perceptive in her analysis of the political situation. She too wrote to Himmler on June 22 that year. ‘It’s terrible that we are going to war with Russia,’ she declared. ‘They were our allies after all. Russia is sooo big. The struggle will be very difficult if we want to conquer all of Russia.’ It is not known whether Himmler replied to that letter, but it seems likely that he did not, as a few days later, he wrote to Marga, apologising for forgetting their wedding anniversary ‘for the first time’. ‘There is quite a lot going on these days,’ he admitted. ‘The fighting is very hard, especially for the SS.’ Although Himmler and his wife still appeared to be on good terms, the newly uncovered letters provide a fascinating insight into how the couple’s relationship had, in fact, deteriorated. Their early correspondence from the days of the courtship in the late Twenties is romantic — and even sometimes sexual — in tone. This photograph, from May 1944, shows Adolf Hitler shaking hands with Himmler . Himmler, who was in charge of the entire complex of concentration camps throughout Europe, is seen here inspecting a Russian prisoner of war . Himmler would call himself a ‘roughneck’, and he referred to himself as a ruthless street fighter. He was proud of this roughness in the bedroom. ‘I am so lucky to have such a good bad man who loves his bad wife as much as she loves him,’ Marga wrote. The couple would speak of sex as being ‘revenge’. ‘I’m for nothing but “Revenge” all the time,’ he wrote to Marga in January 1928 when he was on a train to Munich. ‘Remember “Revenge”,’ Marga insisted in April that year. ‘My black soul is thinking up the most impossible things.’ But over the years, the couple’s passion cooled to such an extent that, by 1938, Himmler had found himself a mistress — his secretary — with whom he had two children. Himmler also adopted a son, Gerhard, with Marga, though the boy did not take his surname. Instead of addressing Marga as ‘my dear sweetheart’, he started to write to her — somewhat bizarrely — as ‘Dear Mummy’. Nevertheless, Himmler did still care for his wife and daughter. Throughout the war, he would send them luxurious treats. In May 1942, for example, he sent Marga and Gudrun 150 tulips from Holland. ‘Striped, jagged, two colours, one colour,’ he wrote. ‘The kind you cannot find here.’ Even when the couple drifted apart, there was one belief that they continued to share fiercely: their hatred for the Jews. In her early letters, Marga complained about how ‘Jewish scum’ scared her, and how she resented having to deal with a Jewish doctor, Bernhard Hauschild, with whom she co-owned a clinic in Berlin. ‘This Hauschild!’ she exclaimed in May 1928. ‘A Jew will always be a Jew!’ ‘Don’t get worked up about the Jews, dear, dear woman,’ Himmler replied, ‘if I could only help you.’ Himmler is seen here with his daughter, Gudrun . A decade later, her husband’s fellow Nazis would indeed ‘help’ the likes of Marga, by organising the brutal Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, in November 1938, which saw 90 Jews killed, and thousands of synagogues and Jewish businesses destroyed. Marga was delighted, but, like her husband, believed the SS could  go further. ‘This thing with the Jews,’ she wrote, ‘when will this scum leave us so that we can lead a happy life?’ But apart from these references to the Jews, what is remarkable about the letters is that they make so little mention of Himmler’s murderous day job. The letters show no sense of remorse or regret. What they do reveal is that Himmler displayed what some psychiatrists call ‘doubling’, in which people are able to commit extraordinarily evil acts while all the time believing themselves to be essentially good, or in Himmler’s own self-deluded word, ‘decent’. The letter that captures this best is a short one. It simply states: ‘I’m off to Auschwitz. Kisses, Yours, Heini.’ For the head of the SS, heading off to Auschwitz was no more remarkable than a day trip to visit a regional branch of the office or a factory floor. The notion that Himmler, despite ordering a genocide, could have remained 'decent', is clearly absurd, but as the letters show, the SS leader continued to believe himself to be a loving family man .","At first glance, letters read like those sent by a businessman to his wife .

"A mother-of-three died after a gallstone removal operation was cancelled twice because she had head lice, an inquest heard. Lindsay Swanson, 34, was sent home by staff at Leicester General Hospital because the parasites could have increased the risk of infection, and because she had a high heart rate. Her partner told an inquest Ms Swanson was 'very upset' at the decision - but doctors have stood by it, insisting the operation would not have saved Ms Swanson's life. Death: Lindsay Swanson was sent home from two operations because she had head lice, an inquest heard . The inquest at Leicester Town Hall heard Ms Swanson was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas, in October 2012. Her illness was triggered by gallstones and its severity put her among the worst-affected 20 per cent of patients - half of whom die, the hearing was told. She was kept in hospital for a week before being discharged and told an operation would take place within six weeks. But it was only in February 2013, after her weight had almost halved from 20st 13lbs to 12st 2lbs, that she returned to the hospital for a pre-operative assessment. There she was told she could not have the operation the next day as planned because of her head lice and high heart rate, the inquest was told. Treatment: Staff at Leicester General Hospital defended the decision and said it could have caused infection . Her distraught partner Lee Dunning, who lived with her in Leicester, said: 'The doctors told us they were not going to operate because Lindsay had head lice. 'She was very upset. We went home. I treated her hair and it started to fall out. She was not well at all and going downhill slowly.' She returned to the hospital a month later but the operation was again cancelled, he said. Then, on April 1, she was taken to A&E at the Leicester Royal Infirmary with severe pain. She was transferred to Leicester General Hospital a month later but died on a high dependency unit on June 6. One pre-operative assessment unit medic, whose name was given only as Dr Yazdiwe, said staff wanted to discuss the head lice with Ms Swanson's GP but she refused to give them permission. Dr Clare Brown, who was a senior surgeon at Leicester General Hospital in 2013, added: 'It is less than ideal to operate on somebody with severe lice infestation.' She said the condition could have led to the scalp of having microscopic cuts from scratching, which could lead to infection. Hearing: Ms Swanson's partner told the inquest at Leicester Town Hall she was 'very upset' at her treatment . Matthew Metcalf, a consultant bladder surgeon at the hospital, said the operation would not have saved Ms Swanson's life. He said she was among the 20 per cent of patients in the high risk category who suffer severe pancreatitis. 'Half of those 20 per cent die and she was one of those,' he said. 'I don't think there was anything that could have been done that would have affected the outcome.' He said it was the correct procedure for the hospital to have kept Lindsay in for a week after she was first admitted in October 2012. She was treated for pain and after a scan showed she had gallstones, she was given painkillers and discharged. Metcalf said there was no cure for severe pancreatitis, and all that could be done was to help the patient feel as comfortable as  possible. The inquest continues and is expected to finish tomorrow.

"Andrew Lansley, the then health secretary, said he was ‘staggered’ by the cost and pledged to cut it by 40 per cent over the next four years . The NHS is being held to ransom by management consultants who charge up to £4,000 a day, a top academic has warned. Professor David Oliver compared the outside experts to ‘arms dealers’ and ‘racketeers’. The health service’s expenditure on such advisers has more than doubled to £640 million from £313 million in 2011/12. This is enough to employ an extra 2,000 nurses, 700 senior doctors or run three medium-sized hospitals. The increase comes despite the Government promising to ‘slash’ the amount the NHS spends on consultants shortly after coming to power in 2010. Andrew Lansley, the then health secretary, said he was ‘staggered’ by the cost and pledged to cut it by 40 per cent over the next four years. But an investigation by Professor Oliver, a former Department of Health adviser, has concluded that it has only got worse – leading to ‘yet more taxpayers’ money diverted from already struggling health and social care services’. The City University professor, who now advises the King’s Fund think-tank, said there was a ‘constantly revolving door’ of bureaucrats moving between the Department of Health and other NHS bodies, No 10 and consulting firms. Some charge between £3,000 and £4,000 a day – the same amount a well-paid senior doctor earns in two weeks – and told Professor Oliver they would not be taken seriously if the bill was any less. The academic, a former national clinical director for older people, said he himself had been offered ‘obscene’ amounts to advise the NHS, but had declined, suggesting he do so for free. He also pointed out that many of these so-called experts have no ‘coalface experience’ of the NHS bodies they are meant to be advising and have come straight from university. Writing in the BMJ online journal, he likened them to those who profit from war, making ‘similar spoils’ from chaotic hospitals and trusts. The NHS is facing an unprecedented financial crisis as it struggles to meet the demands of the ageing population. Simon Stevens (pictured left) recently warned the NHS needs an extra £8 billion of public money by 2020. Labour’s Andy Burnham (right) said the figures show that ministers 'were throwing money like confetti' Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, recently warned the health service needs at least an extra £8 billion of public money by 2020 to maintain the same standards of care for patients. Dr Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist at South Tees Hospital, Middlesbrough, and member of the National Health Action Party, said: ‘This Government’s disastrous and wasteful NHS reorganisation has enabled management consultants to cash in on our NHS and syphon off millions that should be spent on patients while hiding behind a cloak of unaccountability.’ He added: ‘It’s disempowered those best placed to make decisions about how to run the NHS … doctors and NHS staff on the frontline, and it’s speeded up the revolving doors culture between civil servants, politicians and management consultants, which perpetuates the problem.’ Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘These figures show that ministers were throwing money like confetti at private consultants at the same time as cutting nursing posts and cancer care.’ Earlier this year it emerged the struggling Medway hospital trust in Gillingham, Kent, was paying a management consultant nearly £200,000 a year to work just one or two days a week . Earlier this year it emerged the struggling Medway hospital trust in Gillingham, Kent, was paying a management consultant nearly £200,000 a year to work just one or two days a week. Barts and the London NHS trust in east London spent nearly £1million in just ten months on a management consultant acting as a ‘turnaround director’. Donald Muir, an executive at the Surrey-based firm Global Titanium Solutions, charged £935,000 for his expertise from October 2013 to June 2014. Many consultants profiting from the NHS come from the largest firms – including McKinsey, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and KPMG.","Professor David Oliver compared the outside experts to ‘arms dealers’

"It's the stuff of nightmares: A dig at a macabre graveyard has revealed a Bulgarian vampire pinned to his resting place by a metal spike. The ancient skeleton, identified as a 35 to 40 year old male, is only the second ever skeleton with a spike driven near its heart in this way, after one that was found last year in the southern town of Sozopol. It is thought the man, considered to be a vampire by his medieval contemporaries, was pinned to his grave using the ploughshare - the metal end of a plough - to prevent him from leaving at midnight and terrorising the living. The ancient skeleton, identified as a 35-40 year old male, was discovered with a large metal ploughshare (pictured in rusty orange, top right) driven through his left shoulder . The discovery was made at the Perperikon site, in the east of the country, during a dig led by the ‘Bulgarian Indiana Jones’ Professor Nikolai Ovcharov. Last year, a group heading by Professor Ovcharov unearthed another 700-year-old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the Black Sea town of Sozopol. The skeleton, which quickly became known as the ‘Sozopol vampire,’ was pierced through the chest with a ploughshare and has his teeth pulled out before being put to rest. Professor Ovcharov has said described the latest finding as the ‘twin of the Sozopol vampire’ and said it could shed light on how vampire beliefs in the Pagan times were preserved by Christians in the middle ages. The man, thought at the time to be a vampire, was pinned to his grave using the plough to prevent him from leaving at midnight and terrorising the living . The discovery was made at Perperikon in a dig led by the 'Bulgarian Indiana Jones' Professor Nikolai Ovcharov . Coins found with the body have been dated it to the 13th and 14th century. In other cases Professor Ovcharov said he had found skeletons ‘nailed to the ground with iron staples driven into the limbs’ but this was only the second case were a ploughshare was used near the heart. ‘[The ploughshare] weighs almost 2 pounds (0.9kg) and is dug into the body into a broken shoulder bone,’ he said. ‘You can clearly see how the collarbone has literally popped out.’ This is the latest in a succession of finds across western and central Europe that shed new light on how seriously people took the threat of vampires. Last year, a group heading by Professor Ovcharov unearthed another 700-year-old skeleton of a man pinned down in his earth in a church in the Black Sea town of Sozopol . Professor Ovcharov has said described the latest finding, discovered at Perperikon (pictured) as the 'twin of the Sozopol vampire' and said it could shed light on how vampire beliefs in the Pagan times were preserved by Christians in the middle ages . According to Pagan belief, people who were considered bad during their lifetimes might turn into vampires after death unless stabbed in the chest with an iron or wooden rod before being buried. These 'vampires' were often, intellectuals, aristocrats and clerics. A skeleton found last year, which quickly became known as the 'Sozopol vampire,' was also pierced through the chest with a ploughshare . 'The curious thing is that there are no women among them. They were not afraid of witches,’ said Bulgaria's national history museum chief, Bozhidar Dimitrov. The string of plagues which ravaged Europe between 1300 and 1700 helped cement an already growing belief in vampires. Gravediggers reopening mass graves following a plague would sometimes come across bodies bloated by gas, with hair still growing, and blood seeping from their mouths.The shrouds used to cover the faces of the dead were often decayed by bacteria in the mouth, revealing the corpse's teeth, and vampires became known as 'shroud-eaters.' According to medieval medical and religious texts, the 'undead' were believed to spread pestilence in order to suck the remaining life from corpses until they acquired the strength to return to the streets again. ‘In my opinion it's not about criminals or bad people,’ said Professor Ovcharov. ‘Rather, these are precautionary measures that prevent the soul from being taken by the forces of evil in the 40 day period after death.’ Over 100 buried people whose corpses were stabbed to prevent them from becoming vampires have been discovered across Bulgaria over the years. The belief in vampires was widespread throughout Bulgaria and other parts of central Europe throughout the Middle Ages. The word vampire is derived from the original Slavic term opyrb or opir which later appears as vipir, vepir, or vapir. Drunkards, thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires. John van Eyssen prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of vampire. The scene was in 'Horror of Dracula' Appearing completely normal, they would arrive at a town and live amongst the people often even marrying and fathering children. But at night they would wander the countryside in search of blood. These types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart. One account maintains that a vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or along a country road, and whose corpse is eaten by crows, wolves, or some other such scavengers. Because such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the blood of anyone who comes by. Another account states a person who died a violent, unnatural death or whose corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial, can become a vampire. In such cases during the first 40 days after burial, the bones turn to gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night  - releasing animals from their pens, scattering house hold items, and suffocating people. During the first forty days it can be destroyed by a Vampiridzhija - a professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively devoured by a wolf. However if not destroyed in this time period the Vampire would develop a skeleton and becomes even more fierce.","The skeleton is of 35-40 year old male from the 13th or 14th century .

"A man had his nipples cut off by a vicious gang who carved insults into his flesh and held him prisoner for hours. Cameron Gable had 'pedo' cut into his brow and the words 'dog' and 'rat' carved on his back by three criminals who thought he owed money to a friend. The trio, who are all drug addicts with a history of homelessness, were today jailed for at least seven years each over the attack. Mr Gable, 35, apparently met Joshua Manneken at a casino in Melbourne last October, then went with him to a nearby flat. Attack: A man was tortured by a vicious gang who thought he owed them money in Melbourne (pictured) The pair smoked cannabis and crystal meth with Phat Tuan Truong, Joshua Bryant-Dawson and a female friend, until the woman accused Mr Gable of owing her money for drugs. The three men then set about him, tying him up with leather belts and stuffing his mouth with a towel and turning the radio on so that neighbours could not hear him screaming. They tortured him for 10 hours - slicing off his left nipple, setting his hair on fire, cutting the corner of his mouth with scissors, and causing him to pass out when his penis was burnt. At one point he managed to make it to the front door of the flat, but was dragged back into the kitchen and stabbed in the thigh with a kitchen knife. 'Blood spurted out like a hose,' Mr Gable said in a victim impact statement. 'They started to panic at how much blood there was.' The next morning, the attackers poured disinfectant on his injuries and threw him out of the flat, where he was found by a passer-by. Truong, 35, Manneken, 25, and Bryant-Dawson, 19, were convicted of intentionally causing serious injury, unlawful imprisonment and theft. In his statement, Mr Gable testified that he feared the men would kill him and said he had been permanently traumatised by the assault. 'The level of aggression shown told me I wasn't going to be leaving alive,' he said. 'My personality has been changed. I don't go outside sometimes for days. I have recurring nightmares of that night.' Judge David Beach said the length of the attack contributed to the severity of the crime, despite acknowledging that the defendants had shown remorse for their actions. Truong was sentenced to 10 years and three months in prison, Manneken to nine years and two months and Bryant-Dawson to seven years.","Cameron Gable met man in a Melbourne casino and took drugs with him .

The cycling champion and Britain's most successful Olympian will receive a lifetime achievement award . 2013: Sir Alex Ferguson (football) 2012: Lord Coe (athletics) 2011: Sir Steve Redgrave (rowing) 2010: David Beckham (football) 2009: Steve Ballesteros (golf) 2009: Sir Bobby Charlton (football) 2007: Sir Bobby Robson (football) 2006: Bjorn Borg (tennis) 2005: Pele (football) 2004: Sir Ian Botham (Cricket) The 38-year-old retired last year after capping his cycling career with a fifth and sixth Olympic gold at London 2012. It was following a hat-trick of medals at the Beijing games in 2008 that he was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The awards are being hosted in Scotland for the first time this year. Rory McIlroy and Lewis Hamilton will battle it out to win the prestigious title at the SSE Hydro after being confirmed among the shortlist of 10 contenders. Sir Chris, from Edinburgh, said: 'It's a huge honour to be receiving the lifetime achievement award. 'I never thought I'd see my name alongside the likes of Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Seve Ballesteros and others who've received this incredible honour, and it makes it even more special to be receiving the award in Scotland.' BBC Sport director Barbara Slater said: 'As a former BBC Sports Personality of the Year winner, Sir Chris Hoy has been a tremendous ambassador for sport and, although he has retired from cycling, continues to be an inspiration to young athletes.

McIlroy is odds-on favourite to become the first golfer to win the award since Nick Faldo in 1989 after helping Europe to Ryder Cup success. Hamilton's second Formula One world title in Abu Dhabi makes him another strong contender. Real Madrid star Gareth Bale, boxer Carl Froch, world gymnastics silver medallist Max Whitlock and multiple European and Commonwealth Games swimming gold medallist Adam Peaty are also up for the title. Winter Olympic gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold, veteran European athletics champion Jo Pavey, dressage rider Charlotte Dujardin and Britain's first Winter Paralympic champion Kelly Gallagher - with her guide Charlotte Evans - complete the nominations.

"Cases of scurvy and other illnesses caused by poor standards of living have been piling pressure on already-overburdened A&E wards, Labour has claimed. The party’s health spokesman, Andy Burnham, told the Commons that the ‘economic climate’ under the Coalition had led to a sharp rise in conditions including scurvy, rickets, malnutrition and hypothermia – putting greater strain on the NHS. Mr Burnham also insisted too many older people are in hospital who should not be there, adding they were trapped and unable to get the right support to go home. Greater strain on the NHS: Labour health spokesman, Andy Burnham said the 'economic climate' under the Coalition had led to a sharp rise in conditions including scurvy, rickets, malnutrition and hypothermia . But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt contested Labour’s claims that illnesses such as scurvy were driving congestion in A&E. He told the Commons that figures show eight people were admitted to hospital - not just A&E - for scurvy in 2011/12 and 18 people in 2012/13. Mr Hunt also dismissed claims there had been a winter crisis in A&E - and claimed the Government’s record was actually better than the Opposition’s had been. Introducing the opposition day debate on the NHS, former health secretary Mr Burnham said attendances to A&E increased by a ‘staggering’ 633,000 between 2010 and 2013 under the coalition and questioned what is happening. Historic: Scottish physician James Lind is seen giving citrus fruits to sailors with scurvy. His recommendations for changing the diet of seamen in the 18th century resulted in the wiping out of scurvy from the British Navy . He told the Commons: ‘It is all too easy to reach for simplistic answers to this picture. In truth, it is complex and a range of factors have contributed to this rise. But it’s possible to point to two underlying causes. 'Speak to A&E staff and they will tell you that there has been a rise in people arriving at A&E who have a range of problems linked to their living circumstances' Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary . ‘One of those is clearly the general economic climate. People have been living under greater pressure and struggling with the cost of living. A&E has become the last resort for people who are not able to cope for a whole range of reasons. ‘Speak to A&E staff and they will tell you that there has been a rise in people arriving at A&E who have a range of problems linked to their living circumstances. ‘From people with severe dental pain because they can’t afford to pay to see the dentist, to people suffering a breakdown or in crisis, to people who can’t afford to keep warm and are suffering a range of cold-related conditions.’","Andy Burnham warns of rise in rickets, malnutrition and hypothermia .

"Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal has rubbished speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United. The Chilean was strongly linked with a transfer from the Italian champions, with Louis van Gaal's new-look Red Devils mooted as a potential destination.

Arturo Vidal (right) has pledged his future to Juventus after a summer of speculation . The Chilean midfielder insists he was only focused on recovering from a knee injury last summer . Vidal told Italian newspaper Tuttosport: 'The truth is I was calm and relaxed this summer, only focusing on my knee. 'I never once asked my agent or Juventus if something was happening.

"When the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in navy blue  in New York last night, it offered yet more evidence of her growing penchant for the LDD - or Little Dark Dress. Chic in a flowing Jenny Packham gown worn with show stopping jewels and an elegant up-do, the Duchess looked every inch the princess as she made her way inside on the arm of husband Prince William. But her embrace of darker hues is a far cry from the early years of her marriage, when the fledgling royal opted for inky colours by day but picked show-stopping gowns in pale shades of cream, lilac and nude by night. Scroll down for video . Looking good: The Duchess wore a navy Jenny Packham gown for last night's St Andrew's 600th Anniversary Ball in New York . Dark side: The gown was the latest in a series of inky gowns sported by the Duchess since announcing her pregnancy . Now, however, the Duchess is rarely spotted in dresses that don't come in her favourite dark navy and black - both of which she has worn almost without exception for evening appearances since announcing her pregnancy in September. Last night's floor-length navy gown wasn't even the first time the Duchess turned to the dark side in New York, with Kate making her Big Apple debut in a delicate lace dress by eco-label, Beuhlah London. The brand, a favourite of the Duchess', is run by her old school friend Lady Natasha Rufus-Isaacs, and is famous for its flowing, body-skimming dresses - all of which comes in handy when there's a bump to conceal. With the exception of the bright pink Mulberry coat worn to visit the 9/11 memorial, most of her day wear came in dark shades too, most notably the glamorous £680 Goat coat worn for a visit to the Northside Child Development Centre in Harlem. But it is her embrace of dark partywear that has garnered the Duchess the highest number of headlines, beginning with the stunning Diane von Furstenburg gown worn to meet stars - among them One Direction's Harry Styles - at the Royal Variety Performance late last month. Second time around: The gown was on its second outing this year, having been worn to the Portrait Gala in London in February . Good look: The Duchess began her tour of New York in black Beuhlah (right) but chose Hobbs and Jenny Packham for a reception last month . With its pretty lace sleeves and sweetheart neckline, the dramatic number added a shot of demure glamour to the night - and eclipsed the more colourfully dressed A-listers who also attended. A day later and Kate was back in black, this time for a Kensington Palace reception. This time though, the Duchess dispensed with designer in favour of High Street staple Hobbs, teaming a sheer polka dot blouse by the brand with a skirt by Jenny Packham. And the Duchess certainly isn't alone in her love of an LDD. Both Little Dark Dresses and the classic LBD have long been a party season staple, with sales of the dresses increasing by 29 per cent as December approaches, according to department store Debenhams. 'The garment that the majority of clients have said they want is that elusive little black dress,' commented a spokesperson for the store. 'The perfect one will take you from a cocktail party to an opera, from a Michelin starred restaurant to a night club, without missing a beat. A dress that can do that is certainly worth the effort.' Glamorous: The Duchess concealed her tiny bump in a gorgeous Diane von Furstenburg gown for the Royal Variety Performance in November . Stunning: Kate's love of black lace reappeared once more at last year's SportsAid ball when she chose a Temperley cocktail dress . Dazzling: Kate opted for Jenny Packham  on her final night in New Zealand and picked black for a London charity gala earlier this year . Like the rest of us, the Duchess' love of the LBD and the LDD has been a lengthy affair. Already a fan of inky day wear, since giving birth to Prince George in July 2013, black and navy have become an increasingly important part of her evening wardrobe. After wowing the crowds in red and navy during the day, Kate opted for a £2,145 bespoke Jenny Packham dress - complete with a glittering crystal fern - for a reception on her final night in New Zealand. Then, there was a glamorous knee-length Temperley cocktail dress, once again made from her favourite black lace, which she wore to a SportsAid ball in late 2013. Although the majority of her pre-pregnancy gowns came in vibrant shades of red or nude, black did manage the odd appearance, most notably at the London premiere of Warhorse in 2012. Dramatic: The Duchess loves a black lace gown for evening and opted for this show-stopping number at the War Horse premiere in 2012 . Early outing: Despite her youthful penchant for brights and whites, the Duchess did occasionally embrace black in her pre-royal days . It isn't only her clever way with LDDs that has made the Duchess a sartorial sensation during her tour of the Big Apple - her chic maternity style has made headlines as well. This, says style expert Lisa Haynes, is all down to her embrace of the coat-dress which manages to combine formal glamour with space for the royal bump. 'The Duchess of Cambridge has toured the world's style capital wearing a succession of winter dress coats,' she explains. 'It's clever one-piece dressing that doesn't overtly draw attention to her bump. 'Note that we've barely caught a glimpse of the outfit underneath - Kate's chic coat choices do all the work. She's even kept accessories to a minimum.' But it's not only pregnant women who can benefit from a tailored coat. 'As Kate demonstrates, these tailored coats are surprisingly versatile whether you're pregnant or not,' adds Haynes. 'For a formal vibe, she teamed her monochrome Goat crepe coat with black opaques and heels but gave her Tory Burch bouclé coat a more relaxed spin for the basketball layering it over a pair of skinny trousers. 'Her overcoat collection struck the perfect balance for the couple's royal tour duties. Floaty maternitywear and stretch waistbands could have looked too casual, while clingy bodycon would have been inappropriate.'","The Duchess of Cambridge has embraced the LDD - Little Dark Dress - since becoming a mother in 2013 .

"Would your marriage work better if you lived separately? Claire and David Burke, a married couple from from West Yorkshire, argue yes. They've been together 14 years and never lived under the same roof. The perks (they say) you too could have if you live separately from your spouse: You don't take each other for granted, you spend more quality time together rather than drift off to different parts of the house to text, read or watch telly and you have better sex because it's easier to see each other as sexual beings when you're not over-familiar. Scroll down for video . It has been argued that by living in a separate house to your partner could mean you make an effort spend quality time together and don't become over-familiar . There isn't a long-term couple alive who won't deny there's a part of them that stirs and thinks 'Hmm. That could work!' A part of him thinks 'Brilliant! I could invite my mates over whenever I fancied it, drink on Monday nights, watch porn 24/7 in my pants and vest, sleep in late, eat crap without being lectured about my high cholesterol, never make the bed or do the dishes.' A part of her thinks 'Brilliant! No more picking up his sodding socks, pretending to like his mates and that I don't know that 'catching up on emails' in the office at 10pm means he's watching porn. I'd have more time to read and I bet I'd stick to that 5:2 diet if I didn't have to watch him scoff bangers and mash when I'm starving.' Of course, when most men think it through, they realise not only would they be living in a pigsty, they'd closely resemble a bleary, bloated pig with any motivation for anything simply sliding under the sofa and seeping into the floorboards, lost forever. Claire and David Burke have been together 14 years and never lived under the same roof . She soon realises the 5:2 diet is even more dreary when there's no-one around to see how good you're being, that she actually quite likes the 'crap' TV he 'makes' her watch and doesn't really relish having that needy, clingy girlfriend who stays away because 'the man of the house' wouldn't want her dropping in announced, permanently parked on the sofa. There are huge sexist, generalisations there but I'd suggest women do motivate men and lots of men provide a sensible sounding board for our insecurities. Well-matched couples provide the 'yin' to each other's 'yang' regardless of which sex plays the traditional 'female' role of nurturer or fulfils the logical 'male' relationship function. Quite apart from the fact that most couples couldn't afford to maintain two homes, most couples choose to marry and live together because it works. It's a balancing act. You give each other kicks up the bum when you need it. Dispense cuddles and soup and sympathy when it's TLC that's required. Tracey says that well matched couples balance one another out in the home . Independence is healthy in relationships but commitment and intimacy are higher on the list. If your partner's sick, are you going to feel comfortable waving goodbye and jumping in your car to go 'home' when they're feverish and talking in tongues? What about when you're both old and doddery and something as simple as having a shower becomes risky? Living together might just save your lives. Yes it's tough sharing your life and your space - especially at the start. Everyone thinks it's all going to be lovey-dovey and you can't wait for them to arrive and then the moving van pulls up and all their stuff is plonked in your living room and everywhere you go and turn, they're there and instead of it being romantic you feel like an animal that's been cornered and trapped. Those first few weeks and months are hell, even for compatible couples, because it's absolutely true that it's not until you live with someone that you truly know them. We're weird creatures, human beings - we all have our little secrets that no-one really should see. Fishing the half-eaten chocolate bar out of the bin, drunk at 2am, and polishing it off. Sitting on the sofa picking our toe-nails and lining up the bits on the coffee table. Things that make you go 'Ewwww' are in abundance at the start. But then so are the endearing things. The super-confident career girl who can't sleep without her teddy. Him reaching his foot out to touch yours in the middle of the night 'just to check you're there'. Is there anything nicer than snuggling up to someone you love on a cold winter's night or waking up from a heart-stopping nightmare to someone cuddling you and telling you 'It's OK, it's just a dream'? If you don't live together, you not only don't develop the skills to negotiate challenges, I'd suggest you don't actually know each other. Don't get me wrong, I've had plenty of relationships where the thought of living apart was mighty appealing and plenty of circumstances (working day and night) when it felt necessary. But now I'm with the right person, a home without him in it would feel cold, lonely and soulless. A major study recently revealed that the two key factors to long-term couple happiness were kindness and generosity. You need buckets of both to make living together work but if you're getting it back by the bucketload, isn't that rather a nice place to be? Fancy giving someone the gift of good advice this Xmas?

"George Clooney has taken striking British barrister Amal Alamuddin – who represents WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange - to meet President Obama at the White House, MailOnline can reveal. In a move that will provoke yet more questions over his close friendship with the human rights lawyer, Oscar winner George, 52, took Miss Alamuddin to the private screening of his latest movie Monuments Men last week, in a group that included his parents Nick and Nina Clooney. The stunning brunette is currently representing Assange - who has made no secret of his anger at President Obama's White House - in his extradition proceedings with Sweden. Cosy: George Clooney stands next to British barrister Amal Alamuddin at the Willard Hotel's exclusive Round Robin and Scotch Bar in Washington D.C. after they both attended a private screening of his latest movie, Monuments Men, with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday, February 18.

The Oscar winner and the lawyer were . said to be looking extremely close at the event, and although it's not . known whether Miss Alamuddin met President Obama, Clooney is pictured . standing by the Commander-in-Chief. Just hours after the small screening on . Tuesday, February 18, Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were pictured . standing intimately together at the Round Robin and Scotch Bar at the . Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. in a group that included Clooney’s pal and . co-star Matt Damon and his wife Luciana, and fellow actor and co-star Bill Murray. An onlooker at the bar told MailOnline: 'They looked very much together, George had his arm around her and she appeared to be a girlfriend. 'They were in a small group of about 10 people, it's really a small venue and there were maybe only about 30 people in the bar, and they were sitting at a table off to the side. Bizarrely, the group can all be seen wearing mardi-gras style necklaces in the snapshot. Striking: British barrister Amal Amaluddin speaks three languages and was last year voted London's 'hottest barrister' Miss Alamuddin was not on the official White House guest list that was issued last week. However, in pictures seen by MailOnline, Miss Alamuddin - who donned a slinky black dress for the night - beams as she sips on champagne while having her hair done ahead of the screening, with Luciana Damon and Lysa Heslev looking on. The presence of Julian Assange's lawyer . in the White House, even on a movie star's arm for a private screening, . is bound to have put the White House on tenterhooks. Last June, Assange attacked President Obama and the White House in an open letter over its treatment of fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden. When asked about Miss Alamuddin's presence at the screening, the White House press office had no official comment. However, . two White House sources told MailOnline that Miss Alamuddin came to the . event with Clooney, according to their colleagues who were present. One said she and Clooney were the . talk of the junior staff on the next day since they had been seen . cozying up to each other as they arrived, walking behind the star's . parents, Nick and Nina Clooney. The film follows an allied group, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, tasked with finding and saving pieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by Hitler during World War II. And the official guest list from the White House shows just what an intimate screening it was. Invited were Clooney, his parents NIck and Nina, Bill Murray, Matt Damon, Grant Heslov, Robert Edsel, writer of the book The Monuments Men and Harry Ettlinger, a surviving member of the original Monuments Men group. Bill Burns, Deputy Secretary of State, was on the list as was Heather Higginbottom, Deputy Secretary of State and David Wade, State Department Chief of Staff. They were joined by Richard Stengel, Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Evan Ryan, Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs and Bill McHugh, Secretary of the Army. Sara Bloomfield, Director the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, was invited as was Rabbi Jack Moline, Agudas Achim Congregation, Susan Hildreth, Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services and David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States .

He later denied a romance with the striking lawyer . Cosy dinner: George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin smile as they're caught leaving the Berners Tavern. The actor took the raven-haired barrister to the White House last week . No romance, really? George Clooney denied dating Amal Alamuddin after the couple were pictured together at dinner in London in October. His spokesman said: 'He wants Amal to be able to prosecute cases without being hassled because she had one dinner with George and four others'. Miss Alamuddin, who works from . London's Doughty Street Chambers, specialises in international law, . human rights, extradition and criminal law.  She speaks three languages - . French, Arabic and English - and was voted No. 1 on London's Hottest . Barrister list of 2013. She . has been appointed to a number of UN commissions including as adviser . to Special Envoy Kofi Annan on Syria and her high profile human rights . cases have included representing  former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. She . is currently representing Assange in his extradition proceedings with . Sweden. The Australian hacker and rogue online publisher is currently wanted for questioning in Sweden in a sexual assault case. When . the UK’s Supreme Court turned down his appeal of an order to enforce . the European arrest warrant against him, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian . embassy in London. Ecuador granted him political asylum in June 2012. If . he should leave the embassy, the British government will likely send . him to Sweden. From there, Assange fears, he could be extradited later . to the United States to face even more fearsome charges. His . U.S. criminal case stems from his 2010 decision to publish a collection . of American diplomatic cables – the largest cache of classified . documents ever made public at once – on the WIkileaks website. Assange . received the material from Bradley Manning, an American soldier who was . later convicted of violating the federal Espionage Act. A judge . sentenced Manning last year to 35 years in Fort Leavenworth military . prison, although he could be paroled in just eight years. Representing: Human rights barrister Amal Alamuddin (on the right) leaves London's High Court with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange following a court hearing on July 13, 2011 . The . day after his sentencing, the disgraced Army private announced that he . had changed his name to Chelsea, and that he wanted to live as a woman. From . his sanctuary in the Ecuadorian Embassy, Assange wrote an open letter . last June on the occasion of his first anniversary in hiding, slamming . the Obama White House for its treatment of the fugitive NSA leaker . Edward Snowden. 'The word ""traitor"" has been thrown around a lot in recent days,' Assange wrote. 'But who is really the traitor here?' 'Who . was it who promised a generation ""hope"" and ""change,"" only to betray . those promises with dismal misery and stagnation? … Who is it that . promised to preside over The Most Transparent Administration in history, . only to crush whistleblower after whistleblower with the bootheel of . espionage charges?’ Oscar winner Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were first pictured together after enjoying dinner at the Berners . Tavern in London last October and then seen sharing a cab as they left . the restaurant. However, . just days later, Clooney was at pains to stress he was still single . after splitting with long-time love Stacy Keibler last summer. After . being linked with actress Katie Holmes and Croatian model Monika Jakisic as well as Miss Alamuddin, . Clooney told People magazine in October: ‘Three different stories in three weeks. I . should be an athlete.

"Stephen Hawking recently said that the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. Now, Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt has weighed into the discussion, arguing that there is no need to fear AI, and it could even be the making of humanity. 'These concerns are normal,' he said onstage during the Financial Times Innovate America event in New York this week. 'They're also to some degree misguided.' Google chief executive, Eric Schmidt, says there is no need to fear AI, and it could be the making of humanity . The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars, also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted. 'There's lots of evidence that when computers show up, wages go up,' he said, according to a report by Issie Lapowsky in Wired. 'There's lots of evidence that people who work with computers are paid more than people without.' He argues that machines are far more simplistic that people believe. He used the example of an experiment Google conducted a few years ago on a computer 'neural network'. The Google chief, who is involved in the development of AI in applications such as self-driving cars (pictured), also says that the fear of robots stealing human jobs is unwarranted . Eric Schmidt's comments (right) following a warning by Professor Stephen Hawking (left) that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment . During the test, company's scientists used and artificial neural network and inputted 11,000 hours of YouTube videos to see what it could learn, without any training. 'It discovered the concept of ""cat"",' Schmidt said. 'I'm not quite sure what to say about that, except that that's where we are.' With Google at the forefront of AI development, Eric Schmidt has a lot to gain from public acceptance of the technology. Our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self-driving vehicles could bring about our demise. Professor Stephen Hawking has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC that: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argues that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. 'Looking further ahead, there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved,' continued Professor Hawking. 'There is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains.' Google's DeepMind start-up, which was bought for £255 million ($400 million) earlier this year, is currently attempting to mimic the properties of the human brain's short-term working memory. By combining the way ordinary computers work with the way the human brain works, the artificial intelligence researchers hope the machine will learn to program itself. Described as a 'Neural Turing Machine', it learns as it stores memories, and later retrieve them to perform logical tasks beyond those it has been trained to do. The acquisition of DeepMind followed Google's recent purchase of seven robotics firms, including Meka, which makes humanoid robots, and Industrial Perception, which specialises in machines that can package goods, for example. In August, Google also revealed it had teamed up with two of Oxford University's artificial intelligence teams to help machines better understand users. 'It is a really exciting time for AI research these days, and progress is being made on many fronts including image recognition and natural language understanding,' wrote Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind and vice president of engineering at Google in a blog post. But despite these projects, and Schmidt's comments, Google is also aware of the dangers involved with AI and machine learning. So much so that in January it set up an ethics board to oversee its work in these fields.

Average global temperatures for 2014 have been higher than average and may even break previous records . Heatwaves and prolonged spells of freezing weather have become more common over the past three decades, according to scientists. Researchers at the University of East Anglia found that extreme weather conditions have been occurring more frequently in the past 30 years compared to a 130 year average. It comes as meteorologists have said that 2014 is on track to the be warmest year on record. Figures published by the Met Office predicted that the global mean temperature for 2014 is 0.01°C warmer than 2010, currently the warmest on record at 14.50°C (58.12°F) This is despite much of the northern hemisphere being plunged into temperatures well below freezing in January as North America was hit by an Arctic polar vortex. According to the latest findings from the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, temperatures in the northern hemisphere have been more volatile than in the southern hemisphere. Professor Scott Robeson, from Indiana University, who also took part in the study, said: 'Arguably, these cold extremes and warm extremes are the most important factors for human society.' He added that the study could help to explain the 'pause' in global warming since 1998 that was reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year. Many developing nations, for instance, want a target of . cutting world greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050. Opec nations, worried about loss of income from a shift to . renewable energy, favour much vaguer long-term goals. A recent IPCC report found that global warming is already here, man-made and increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible. Global warming, it says, is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans,' and further pollution from heat-trapping gases will raise the likelihood of severe impacts for mankind. The report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it's likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer.

"Defiant: The star said he will 'continue to co-operate with police' after detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month . Sir Cliff Richard has vowed to 'clear his name' after thanking fans for supporting him in his second statement since sex assault claims were made against him. The star, 73, has reiterated that the historic allegations are 'completely false' but said he will 'continue to co-operate with police' during the investigation . Detectives swooped on his £3.1million apartment in Berkshire last month amid accusations he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago. Police launched a probe after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985. In a statement on Facebook, Sir Cliff said: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press. 'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name. 'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again. 'Once again...many thanks!' It is the second statement he has made in relation to the investigation having first denied the accusations on Facebook on August 14 . Then, he wrote: 'For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are completely false. 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen. 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press. 'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me. 'Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say anything further until the police investigation has concluded.' Detectives swooped on the apartment while Sir Cliff was on holiday in the Algarve, Portugal. Officers spent five hours inside the property searching for evidence. Second statement: The singer thanked his supporters and reiterated that the allegation is 'completely false' Earlier this week, one of the country's most senior police officers was accused of 'sheer incompetence' over his handling of the raid, which was aired live on the BBC. The corporation and South Yorkshire police clashed in Parliament over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month. The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault. Mr Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert said it was a 'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'. But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.

"The Ebola fighters have been named as TIME magazine's Person of the Year 2014. As TIME's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, made the announcement on the Today show on Wednesday, she said the men and women who have been battling the worst outbreak of Ebola in history were chosen for their 'exceptionally great amount of courage and kindness and bravery'. The Ebola Fighters beat the Ferguson protesters to the prestigious title, which honors the 'person' who most influenced the news, for better or for worse throughout the year. In third place came Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by Masoud Barzani, the acting president of the Iraqi Kurdish Region, and English teacher-turned-Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Gibbs also revealed five covers featuring different Ebola fighters across West Africa, including doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers. Scroll down for video . On Wednesday, 'the Ebola fighters' were named as TIME's Person of the Year 2014. The magazine is putting out five front covers to honor the fighters, including Dr Kent Brantly, left, and Dr Jerry Brown, right . Announcement: Time's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, revealed the winner on the Today show on Wednesday . Dr Kent Brantly, an American Ebola survivor who contracted the virus while working with patients in Liberia, features on one of the covers. 'I think it's fitting that we acknowledge that most Ebola fighters are themselves West Africans,' he told the Today show. 'It's an honor for me to have been considered part of that group.' The covers also feature Foday Gallah, an ambulance driver who survived the infection, Médecins Sans Frontières nurse Salome Karwah and Dr Jerry Brown, a Liberian surgeon who turned his hospital's chapel into the country's first Ebola treatment center. In an article for TIME, Gibbs detailed the magazine's reasons for its choice, explaining that this year, 'an outbreak turned into an epidemic' across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, before traveling to Europe and the U.S. 'Anyone willing to treat Ebola victims ran the risk of becoming one,' she wrote. But at a time when there seemed no end to the disease, which has killed 7,000 people in West Africa, a group stepped forward despite the dangers and the incompetencies of their governments. Heroic: Other covers for the special edition of the magazine feature Médecins Sans Frontières nurse Salome Karwah, left, and Foday Gallah, an ambulance driver who survived the infection, right . Second place: Ferguson protesters had been leading the Person of the Year poll at the start of the week . 2000: George W. Bush . 2001: Rudolph Giuliani, who was New York City's mayor on 9/11 . 2002: The Enron Whistleblowers . 2003: The American soldier . 2004: George W. Bush . 2005: The Good Samaritans - Bono and Bill Gates . 2006: You - represented by the Internet . 2007: Vladimir Putin . 2008: Barack Obama . 2009: Ben Bernanke . 2010: Mark Zuckerberg . 2011: The Protester . 2012: Barack Obama . 'The global health system is nowhere close to strong enough to keep us safe from infectious disease,' Gibbs wrote. 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight. 'For tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving, the Ebola fighters are TIME’s 2014 Person of the Year.' Each year, the magazine names the 'person' who most influenced the news, for better or for worse. Last year, the Pope narrowly beat pop star Miley Cyrus to the title for his transformative changes to the tone of the Catholic church on social issues. In 2012, President Barack Obama took the title and in 2011, the magazine awarded it to 'The Protester', in recognition of their revolutionary role in the Arab Spring that year. This year, the runner up was the Ferguson Protesters, who 'built a movement that revived a dormant national conversation about race and justice', according to TIME. The protesters first took to the streets in August after 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, was shot dead in broad daylight by police officer Darren Wilson. Witness accounts varied over whether Brown had raised his hands or if there had been a scuffle, but a grand jury ultimately decided not to indict Wilson. Runners up: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Masoud Barzani, right, the Kurdish politician who has led the Iraqi Kurdistan Region since 2005, were also in TIME's top five . Record breaking: Billionaire Jack Ma's company, Alibaba, became one of the world's most valuable tech companies after raising $25 billion from its IPO in September. He was a TIME runner up . The officer has since resigned but the grand jury's decision sparked massive, continued protests across the country as demonstrators called for justice and an end to police violence. The protests became even louder when another unarmed black man, Eric Garner, died after a white officer, Daniel Pantaleo, held him in a chokehold when he was caught selling untaxed cigarettes. Pantaleo was also not indicted for the July incident, which was caught on video. More recently, a 12-year-old black child, Tamir Rice, was fatally shot by rookie cop Tim Loehmann in a park in Cleveland, Ohio after the officer mistook his fake gun for a real weapon. A grand jury is now considering that case. 'Protest is a performance that can make the unseen visible,' Alex Altman wrote in TIME. 'In this angry epic, thousands found a role.' In third place, the magazine named Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Crimea this year and in doing so, restored Russia's honor and saw his approval ratings soar, TIME reported. He was followed by Masoud Barzani, the acting president of the Iraqi Kurdish Region, and Jack Ma, who founded Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that debuted a $25 billion IPO this year - making it one of the world's most valuable tech companies. Shortlisted: Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift (pictured performing last week), who has recently released her fifth studio album, 1989, was among the eight names announced in Monday's shortlist . Center of attention: Roger Goodell (pictured), the National Football League Commissioner, who has recently come under the spotlight for indefinitely suspending footballer Ray Rice, was also on the list . On Monday, Gibbs also appeared on the Today show to reveal the magazine's shortlist of eight names ahead of Wednesday's announcement. Taylor Swift, who has recently released her fifth studio album, 1989, was also in the final eight following her monster record sales and her battle with Spotify. She pulled all of her records from the streaming service and argued that it should compensate artists more. Apple's CEO Tim Cook was also on the list after not only making headlines for the company's new gadgets - the iPhone 6, Apple Watch and Apple Pay - but also for his personal life, after he became the first openly gay Fortune 500 CEO. The beleaguered Roger Goodell, the National Football League commissioner, was also named. His league came under scrutiny over how it dealt with domestic abuse arrests of its players, including Ray Rice.","Each year, the magazine names the 'person' who most influenced the news, for better or worse, throughout the year .

"The inexorable tick of time moving forward is something that has puzzled scientists for more than a century. But now a new theory has been proposed that may help answer some questions - at least with regards to the beginning of time and what happened in the 'past'. They say that at the moment of the Big Bang a 'mirror universe' to our own was created that moves in the opposite direction through time - and intelligent beings in each one would perceive the other to be moving backwards through time. Since the Big Bang the universe has given rise to planets, stars and galaxies (illustration shown) as time ticks forward and matter clumps together. But a new theory suggests that at the same time a second universe is moving in the opposite direction, with a 'backwards' arrow of time to us . The radical theory was proposed by Dr Julian Barbour of College Farm in the UK, Dr Tim Koslowski of the University of New Brunswick in Canada and Dr Flavio Mercati of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, also in Canada. Their research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘arrow of time’ - which is the concept that time is ‘symmetric’ and everything moves forwards. They say that at the time of the Big Bang not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time, but opposite to each other. ‘Time is a mystery,’ Dr Barbour told MailOnline. ‘Basically, all the known laws of physics look exactly the same whichever way time runs, and in the world in which we live everything goes in one direction. In 1927 British astronomer Arthur Eddington first devised the ‘one-way direction’ or ‘asymmetry ‘ of time. He said that by studying the organisation of matter, it was possible to make a 4D map of the universe. The so-called ‘arrow of time’ supposedly points to a move spread out and ‘random’ future, toward which everything is moving. This is also known as entropy, which tends to increase with time. Entropy, a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, will increase as energy dissipates and matter and energy disperse. This means that entropy will always increase in the universe. Some say this may lead to a ‘heat death’ future where everything is spread so thinly that nothing can exist any more – a scenario famously postulated in Isaac Asimov’s short story The Last Question. However, owing to the law of gravity, some think such a future is not a possibility. ‘The universe is expanding, we get older, the order seems to grow - at least in our immediate vicinity.’ Dr Barbour gives the analogy of an ice cube melting in a glass of water as the universe moving from structure to disorder - known as entropy. He says at the end of the 19th century this caused concern - as people thought the universe would end in a ‘heat death’ where the temperature in the universe was the same everywhere, just like the ice cube. But when gravity is taken into account it seems the theory no longer holds true - and it may also explain a dramatic start for the universe. Lee Billings, writing for Scientific American, said: ‘Thus, the sheer force of gravity sets the stage for the system’s expansion and the origin of time’s arrow.’ By assembling a simple model with 1,000 particles, the researchers say their theory shows that as you move backwards through time - to disorder - you eventually come out the other side after the Big Bang in order again - a ‘mirror’ universe. The new research attempts to answer questions that remain about the ‘arrow of time’ – which is the concept that time is ‘symmetric’. They say that at the time of the Big Bang not one but two universes formed – both moving equally in each direction through time, but opposite to each other, like two one way systems . While time moves forwards for us, intelligent beings in the 'mirror universe' would think that we are actually moving backwards. However, we would both have come from the same beginning - the Big Bang. It should also be noted that the universes are not identical, but simply time-symmetric . This universe would not be exactly the same as ours, though; it would have evolved and changed in its own way, completely separate to our own. However, it would be subject to the same laws of physics, so it would likely have planets, stars and galaxies just like in our version of the cosmos. Explaining the model as a swarm of bees, Dr Barbour says that as time increases, the universe moves from an initial chaotic ‘swarm of bees’ to a more structured and ordered cosmos. ‘If you look at a simple model with a swarm of bees in the middle [the Big Bang] but breaking up in either direction, then you would say there are two arrows of time, pointing in opposite directions from the swarm of bees,’ he said. ‘One arrow would be forwards, and one backwards. ‘If you define time as the direction in which order is increasing, you always get two arrows in opposite direction from the central chaotic region.’ He continued that it is opening up a new way to think about the Big Bang. ‘At the moment when people talk about the Big Bang, they more or less throw their hands up in despair and say they can’t say what happened. ‘Now our work is beginning to suggest we can actually say more than people thought.’","Scientists have proposed a radical new theory of time for the universe .
UK physicist Dr Julian Barbour and others say there are two arrows of time .
These move in opposite directions and both formed at the Big Bang .
This means at the Big Bang there were two universes that formed .
Observers in either universe would view the other as moving backwards ."
"Ed Miliband attempted to lure back Ukip voters yesterday, saying he understood concerns about eastern European migrants and care workers ‘who don’t speak English’. The Labour leader acknowledged immigration ‘has been changing communities fast’ and that voters want politicians to ‘do something about it’. His speech came hours after Tony Blair, speaking in an interview, urged him not to give in to ‘nasty and unpleasant’ rhetoric from Ukip. Ed Miliband said he understands voters' fears over immigration - but has ruled out giving voters an in-out EU referendum despite growing pressure from backbenchers in the wake of last week's European elections . Nigel Farage's success in the European and local elections has increased pressure on all three Westminster party leaders. Labour's Ed Miliband today refused to overhaul his party's immigration policy - or offer voters a say on leaving the EU, despite UKIP's success . At the risk of further alienating . disillusioned Labour supporters who transferred their vote to the . anti-EU party, Mr Blair called the rise of Ukip a ‘regressive and . reactionary’ movement. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme . about the march of Eurosceptic parties across Europe: ‘We are . confronted by what I think are these very reactionary forces. We have to . confront them, expose them and take them on … these parties have no . actual solutions to the problem of the 21st century.’ He added: ‘By all means have rules . and controls, but the idea that the problems of Britain are about . immigrants is a backward and regressive step. I think we should contend . every inch of that argument.’ But yesterday Mr Miliband was at pains to claim that people who worry about immigration are not prejudiced. He described former die-hard Labour . voters who have turned to Nigel Farage’s party as ‘people who work hard . to provide for their family, people who love our country, but feel left . behind’. Tony Blair this morning urged Ed Miliband to 'stand up, to lead' by tackling Nigel Farage on Europe and immigration. He said the Conservatives had not achieved anything by offering voters an in-out poll by 2017 . He told an audience in Thurrock, . Essex – a seat Labour is hoping to win back next year – that many people . there had talked to him about ‘immigration and the changes [they] have . seen’ in the area. He said: ‘Builders from eastern . Europe, care workers from overseas who sometimes don’t speak fluent . English. Big changes are happening to this community … that are . reflected across the country.’ Ed Miliband declined a challenge to describe his leadership in a word, replying: ‘One Nation’. He was asked to use one word after accusations from within the Labour Party that he is ‘too wordy and academic’. But Mr Miliband, who shook his head and tutted after being asked the question, said: ‘I’ll give you two – One Nation.’ He then used 111 words to explain what he meant by the phrase. Aides said he was not ‘unable’ to define himself in one word, but ‘chose not to’. The One Nation slogan was adopted in 2012 as Mr Miliband sought to rebrand his leadership. But his image has been attacked in recent weeks. One shadow cabinet member told a newspaper: ‘It’s not just that people think he is weird. They think he’s a joke, and that’s even more dangerous.’ Mr Miliband said the decline of the . docks in the area had left communities without a decent wage and fearful . about their children’s job prospects. He added: ‘Over the last decades, . there were big changes happening in our country, and fewer and fewer . working people thought that anyone in politics was getting those . changes, that anyone in politics could do something about it.’ Although senior Labour figures have . advised Mr Miliband to do more to address concerns about immigration, he . offered no new policies on the issue. His current proposal is to better . enforce the minimum wage so firms cannot undercut local people with . cheap labour from abroad, and improve controls at borders. Instead he stressed Britain would be . better off in the EU, and that creating secure jobs, building more . housing and the cost of living were his priorities for the next . election. When accused by a Labour member, . during the question and answer session, of ‘lurching to the Right’, he . said: ‘It’s not right-wing for us to talk about immigration … We have . got … to talk about immigration in a progressive way.’ But Mr Miliband insisted voters . should not accept Ukip’s ‘easy answers’ and said Mr Farage’s party . wanted to blame all the UK’s problems on ‘Europe and foreigners’. Yesterday John Kent, former leader of . Thurrock council – where Labour lost overall control in last week’s . elections – said the party had made a ‘fundamental mistake’ by not . offering an EU referendum. But Mr Blair – whose government . opened the doors to eight eastern European countries in 2004 – urged Mr . Miliband against offering one, saying: ‘I’d advise him to stay firm.’","Labour leader 'understands concern about non-English speaking workers'

"Israel and the Palestinians were on the brink again today after a Fatah cabinet minister died shortly after an altercation with the Israeli military during a West Bank protest. Ziad Abu Ain was hit in the chest with a rifle butt and grabbed by soldiers, who also fired tear gas at the demonstrators, witnesses said. Shortly after the attack, the 55-year-old minister without portfolio began to look faint and fell to the ground clasping his chest, according to people at the scene. He died on the way to hospital. His death was condemned by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who described the attack as 'a barbaric act which we cannot be silent about or accept.' Scroll down for video . Ziad Abu Ain joined dozens of protesters carrying olive tree saplings during a protest against land confiscations by Israeli settlers near the village of Turmus Aya . After being told by Israeli soldiers that they could not proceed, witnesses said Abu Ain tried to tell them it was peaceful protest . After Israeli soldiers blocked the path of Abu Ain and his fellow protesters scuffles broke out between them . In a bid to disperse the crowd the Israeli soldiers fired stun grenades and tear gas. A stun grenade explosion is seen here . Clash of sides: The spokesman for Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the circumstances leading to the death of the minister were being investigated . Abu Ain, pictured in the centre of the fracas, was grabbed by Israeli soldiers, before one of them reportedly hit him in the chest with a rifle butt . Shortly after he was hit with a rifle butt Abu Ain began to look faint and fell to the ground clasping his chest, according to people at the scene . Abu Ain was taken for medical treatment, before being rushed to hospital in an ambulance. He died en route . Announcing three days of national mourning, the Palestinian leader added that he would take 'necessary steps' after an investigation. The Israeli military said it is looking into the incident and had no immediate comment, while the Arabic language spokesman for the country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the circumstances leading to the death of the minister were being investigated. The incident began with a march by several dozen Palestinians who headed to agricultural land near the village of Turmus Aya to plant olive tree saplings, said one of the participants, Mahmoud Aloul, a senior member of president Abbas' Fatah movement. The land belongs to Turmus Aya, but is close to an Israeli settlement and mostly off limits to the village's farmers, he added. As the approached the area Abu Ain's assistant, Kamal Abu Sassaka, Israeli soldiers began firing tear gas and stun grenades at the group. Abu Sassaka added that his boss tried to explain to an Israeli officer that the protest was peaceful, but he was told they could not proceed. Pushing and shoving ensued between the marchers and soldiers, before tear gas was fired towards the legs of the Palestinians, he said, before one soldier hit Abu Ain in the chest with his rifle butt. The account confirmed by other witnesses, according to Reuters. An autopsy will be conducted on the body of Abu Ain, a spokesman for the Palestinian Health Authority said . Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas described the attack as 'a barbaric act which we cannot be silent about or accept' After he collapsed shortly afterwards, Abu Sassaka said Abu Ain was given first aid by a soldier before being taken to the village clinic and from there by ambulance to Ramallah Hospital. He didn't make it. Abu Ain headed a Palestinian Authority department dealing with Israeli settlements and the Israeli separation barrier and was a vocal opponent of Israel's settlement building in the West Bank. The continued growth of big Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem remains a sort point for many Palestinians, who feel that their land is slowly being taken. Convicted of killing two young Israelis in a bomb attack in 1979, he was released as part of a prisoner swap in 1985. He had also served as the Palestinian deputy minister for prisoner affairs. Osama Najar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Health Ministry, said the cause of death would be determined at an autopsy. It follows months of violent unrest in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and the Israeli-occupied West Bank as tensions in the region continue to simmer around boiling point. Palestinian assailants have killed 10 Israelis and foreign visitors in just three months while more than a dozen Palestinians, including most of those who carried out those attacks, have died. Recriminations continue from both sides following the seven-week conflict between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip earlier this year. A combination of Israeli bombardment, Palestinian rocket attacks and ground fighting claimed 2,200 lives, the vast majority of them Gazans, according to UN figures. Thousands more were left homeless. An attempt by the Americans to revive a peace process failed, despite energetic diplomacy missions from the US Secretary of State John Kerry. While president Abbas has said many times he is against the use of violence, his Islamist rivals Hamas have gone to war three times in the last five years.","Ziad Abu Ain died shortly after the incident  near the village of Turmus Aya .

"At around 20 weeks scan new parents often succumb to the temptation to discover the sex of their unborn baby. But for Beverley Winter and Ben Platt, the mezmerising 3D image of their son, revealed more than they imagined. The shocked couple were taken aback at their son's heart-shaped head. 'It was a shock,' said Miss Winter, from Stockport. 'I looked at my fiancé Ben and we both asked if it was going to stay like that.' When Beverley Winter and Ben Platt had a scan to discover the sex of their unborn baby they were shocked to discover he appeared to have a heart-shaped head . Maternity staff on hand quickly reassured the worried couple - their baby's head had not yet developed properly. Little Logan was born safely in September, and the ultrasound image has now become a treasured memento. 'We had the scan done to see what sex the baby was,' Miss Winter said. 'A heart-shaped head is not something you see everyday, it was actually my mum who spotted it first. But I love it. 'It is so amazing and makes him so unique, he is Britain's most loved baby. 'The scanners said it was because the head hadn't developed properly. I was just relieved he was a healthy baby.' By the time Logan was born on September 8, his head had formed properly, much to Miss Winter and Mr Platt's relief. Sadly, the pair had suffered a miscarriage the previous year. And they faced a tense few days when Logan was born with an infection. But after a week in hospital he was back at home with his  family. Miss Winter, added: 'After our miscarriage I was so frightened of losing Logan. Maternity staff quickly reassured the couple, from Stockport, that their son's head was still developing. Baby Logan was born on September 8 with a normal-shaped head . 'We had been trying for a baby for so long. The heart-shaped head thing is very fitting as we wanted him so much. 'We have put all the scans and photos in a book for him when he is older. 'He is really good now, and is a smiling, healthy baby boy.' It is thought that the heart-shape was due to the angle the scan was taken at, and possibly fluid covering part of Logan's head. The heart-warming image comes just weeks after other proud families showed off 4D ante-natal images which appeared to show babies laughing and smiling in the womb. It was revealed last month how little Leo Hargreaves appeared to be chuckling away in his mother, Amy Clegg's tummy. Amy and partner Leighton Hargreaves, from Accrington, shared the image after being bowled over by the 31-week scan.","Beverley Winter was shocked when a scan showed her baby's head .

"It's the age old debate: which day is best for booking flights to ensure you get the best deal? And it may have just been settled. According to new research from Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), it's best to buy tickets on a Tuesday - and ideally, more than 21 days in advance - to take advantage of the best possible rates. To take advantage of the best prices, book your air travel on a Tuesday and at least three weeks in advance . Travellers who are able to fly on a Thursday and return on a Monday will enjoy the greatest savings on a long weekend away. Alternatively, those booking a Saturday to Tuesday short-haul weekend flight can save up to 25 per cent, particularly when compared to the more expensive Sunday return. Expedia recommends booking your flights at least seven weeks in advance. For domestic routes, the lowest fares are usually found 50 to 100 days before departure, with the absolute lowest fares found around 57 days prior. Cheers to that! According to Expedia's research, it will be cheaper to fly premium in 2015 . The report is predicting a general price drop across Europe and North America . When it comes to international flights, the lowest fares were found even farther in advance - between 150 and 225 days - with the lowest price around the 171 day mark. And package deals are another way to save cash. By booking the flight and hotel at the same time, you can save up to US$540 (£344) across all destinations. In big resort destinations, like Mexico or Hawaii, you can actually save a whopping US$1,100 (£700) simply by bundling. For the best deal on a short-haul domestic flight, the lowest rates can be found about 57 days in advance . The findings are contained in a report, Preparing for Takeoff: Air Travel Trends for 2015, which highlights all of the changes that passengers can expect in upcoming months. And there's good news for travellers. Expedia and the ARC predict that many ticket prices will decrease overall. This can be attributed to an increase in scheduled flights and a drop in fuel prices, which will mean a general price drop across Europe and North America. For international flights, booking anywhere between 150-225 days ahead will offer the best deal . Tuesday remains the best day to book a flight, with the lowest prices across the board . In Europe, another major factor will be the rise of low-cost carriers, which 'unbundle' amenities and force the big-name carriers to do the same to compete. Not only that, but it's going to be cheaper to fly in the premium cabins. The research indicates that the gap in fares between flying premium and coach will continue to narrow - and ultimately, could even get to a point where premium-class tickets aren't that much more expensive than tickets in coach. This may not hold true for all flights, but it won't hurt to check the price of first- and business-class seats before you book an economy ticket.","Expedia and the Airlines Reporting Corporation expect ticket prices to fall .
Tuesday remains ideal day to book flights, 50 to 100 days in advance .

"From chocolate to pickles, many women experience intense cravings during pregnancy. But Jade Sylvester, 25, began to experience an even more bizarre urge: eating toilet paper. The full time mother, of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, first developed the bizarre snacking habit while she was expecting her youngest son Jaxon. The mother-of-five now eats as much as an entire loo roll's worth every day. Scroll down for video . Jade Sylvester, 25, began to experience a bizarre craving for toilet paper when expecting her youngest son Jaxon. More than a year after giving birth she still cannot resist the cravings, and eats up to a loo roll a day. She is pictured left and right with some toilet paper . She suspects she suffers from Pica, a condition in which people eat objects which are not suitable to be consumed and have no nutritional value. People have been known to eat dirt, glass, pain and sand, as well as household objects like carpets, candles and sponges. Miss Sylvester said: 'Two months into the pregnancy, I started craving toilet roll. I still don't know why. 'I like the feeling of the texture in my mouth, rather than the taste. I like the dryness. 'My family tell me it isn't very good for me - but I can't help it.' Pica can cause a range of serious complications if the person eats something that is poisonous or indigestible. It is not known why some women develop Pica cravings during pregnancy, but there may be a connection to an iron deficiency, according to the Journal of American Dietetic Association. And eating non-food substances is potentially harmful to both the mother and the baby, the American Pregnancy Association warns. This is because eating non-food substances may interfere with the nutrients from healthy food being absorbed and cause a deficiency. Thankfully, Miss Sylvester's son Jaxo was born healthy and is developing normally. Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value. These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt. It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy. It can cause a range of serious complications if the patient is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible. These include being poisoned by toxic ingredients and having a part of the body obstructed (which is often seen in people who eat hair). It can also lead to excessive calorie intake or nutritional deprivation if the person eats a substance with no nutritional value instead of nutritive foods. Parasitic infections and dental injury can also occur. But despite the fact it has now been a year since she gave birth, she still can't break the habit of ingesting loo roll. She said: 'I thought the cravings would stop after I gave birth but they haven't. I can't quit. I keep coming back for more. 'It can't be doing my insides any good, but it hasn't caused me any health problems or any illness.' She waits until she needs to go to the toilet where she will eat a few sheets of toilet tissue in private, chewing and swallowing up to a roll a day. 'While I was pregnant I went to the loo and looked at the toilet roll and thought 'I have to eat that' - I know it sounds silly. 'Today I try and hold off going to the bathroom because I know if I go I will eat the paper. 'I usually eat around eight pieces per visit - sometimes I go to the bathroom just to get some toilet roll. 'It does fill me up quite a bit. At first I used to eat a couple of squares at a time, but I keep eating more and more.' Her favourite types are the supermarket-own brands, rather than more expensive products like Andrex. She said: 'Different brands taste different. I have one roll in the bathroom for eating and one to be used normally.' Miss Sylvester has five children - four boys called Billy, eight, Mayson, six, Harrie, five and Jaxon, one, and a daughter called Harlow, five. Miss Sylvester said: 'I try to hide it from my kids, if they spot me eating toilet roll they tell me off. 'If my daughter sees me she says, 'spit it out Mummy, spit it down the toilet'.' Last month MailOnline reported on a teenage girl who can resist chocolates and crisps, but can't fight the urge to snack on sponges . Rosie Skinner, 18, from Surrey, has suffered the addiction since she was five years old. She cuts the sponges into small pieces and sucks on them throughout the day, getting through at least two large sponges a week. Miss Skinner, who attends Reigate Sixth Form College, said: 'I have always loved the smell of a wet sponge. 'I crave that damp taste and feeling in my mouth. 'I like the texture as well, it's a bit like eating cake. 'I might try one with some icing on one day. If I have a stressful day I love to treat myself to snack on a sponge to relax.' Her habit has resulted in her being admitted to hospital. When she was 13, she had to have an operation to remove a large ball of sponge from her stomach. Last month MailOnline reported on the story of Rosie Skinner, 19, who craves eating sponges. She gets through around two a week. 'I have always loved the smell of a wet sponge. I crave that damp taste and feeling in my mouth,' she says .","Jade Sylvester, 25, started craving loo roll during pregnancy .

"Federal officials 'warned' Sony that their planned film about an assassination attempt on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could provoke retaliation from the hermit state. It is claimed that officials in the Department of Homeland Security held a secret off-the-record briefing with senior executives from the film company about the comedy 'The Interview'. Sony has been the victim of a number of high profile cyber attacks in recent weeks with some of their movies leaked online, while confidential information on employees and stars has also been placed on the internet. Scroll down for video . James Franco, left,  and Seth Rogen right, are starring in the movie 'The Interview' as a pair of American journalists who have been recruited by the CIA to assassinate the North Korean leader . The comedy which features the planned assassination of Kim Jong Un will be released on Christmas Day . However, North Korea has denied any involvement in the sophisticated cyber attack on Sony . According to the Los Angeles Times  the Department of Homeland Security told Sony that the film could inflame tensions with North Korea. However, both Sony and the Department of Homeland Security denied knowledge of any such meetings. Although, Federal investigators are currently investigating a string of cyber attacks on the entertainment company . North Korea has also denied any involvement on the attack on Sony. One New York based diplomat told Voice of America the story was 'another fabrication targeting the country. Cyber attackers breached Sony's computer network on November 24. North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite their anger over Sony's planned movie 'The Interview'. Hackers released online several upcoming Sony movies including the family hit Annie. The personal details of thousands of employees were also released. Hackers also revealed the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity. Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were released - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. 'My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy.' Sony Pictures is planning to release the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen on Christmas Day. The pair play two American journalists who are hired by the CIA to kill the North Korean leader after they are granted an interview with him. The entertainment company's computer network was breached on November 24. The company does not yet know the extent of the information stolen, although are series of highly embarrassing emails and documents have been leaked online. Cyber security experts believe the company could be hit with costs in excess of seven figures. FBI Director James Comey admitted the investigation has still to identify who is responsible for the attack. He said: 'Anything cyber is very complicated, tracing back malware and signatures especially,"" Comey told reporters at a briefing. It is complicated business and I want to make sure before we make an attribution that I have high confidence in it.... I'm not prepared to attribute it to any particular actor.' The attack on Sony is believed to the be the worst of its type on a company on U.S. soil. Jim Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the breach could have a longer term impact on the company's reputation. He said: 'Usually, people get over it, but it does have a short-term effect.' In one of the highly embarrassing emails leaked by the hackers, Hollywood producer Scott Rudin, right, described Angelina Jolie, left, as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' Mr Lewis admitted the attack could cost the company in the region of $100 million. Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, estimated costs could run up to $70 million. Losses in that range would not mean a big financial setback to Sony Pictures Entertainment, which reported operating profit of $501 million for the fiscal year through March. But other effects, such as the loss of trade secrets, will be difficult to measure, Rasch said. Hackers have released a trove of documents that include contracts and marketing plans that could influence competitors' strategies. Costs could mount if Hollywood stars, producers or financiers decide to take projects to Sony's competitors. He said: 'Will they be able to attract high-name stars if those stars believe their personal information will not be protected? 'How do you know what business opportunities are lost? It's hard to put a dollar figure on it.'","A report claims Federal officials warned Sony over potential cyber danger .

"The glamorous side of Charlene of Monaco is back in the spotlight courtesy of a stunning new exhibition. The royal, who is believed to have welcomed her twins this morning - a boy and a girl - stars in a series of portraits by Julian Lennon, son of the Beatle John and his first wife Cynthia. The photographs, all of which were taken in the days leading up to her 2011 wedding, are titled 'Charlene Wittstock', and features 19 black and white snaps, among them a series of intimate shots of the now-princess having her make-up and hair done. Scroll down for video . Striking: Julian Lennon's portraits of Princess Charlene were taken ahead of her 2011 wedding . The striking pre-wedding photos, which have gone on show at the ArtCube Gallery in Paris, aren't the only time rock and real royalty have come together. May 2013 saw the princess and the photographer mingle in a more sociable environment when the two both attended a glamorous yacht party during the Cannes Film Festival. Charlene, who looked every inch the Hollywood star in a tailored black jumpsuit, happily posed for photos with Lennon as she boarded the yacht and earlier as both stepped onto the red carpet at the LOVA World Images Exhibition. Gorgeous though she looked, it is Lennon's softly-lit images of the princess that really catch the eye, offering a snapshot of royal wedding preparations and an unusually relaxed Charlene. Beautiful: The softly-lit black and white shots show the South African royal looking impossibly glamorous . Resemblance: In several of the photos, Charlene bears a strong resemblance to the late Grace Kelly . Joyous: One striking shot shows Charlene beaming broadly as she enjoys a glass of champagne . In one gorgeous photo, the 35-year-old bears a striking resemblance to her mother-in-law Grace Kelly, staring towards the camera as her hair is pinned into soft curls. In another, she smiles broadly and raises a glass of champagne, clearly excited at the prospect of exchanging vows with now-husband Prince Albert. The princess, who was last seen on the balcony of the Palais Princier in Monaco during the country's National Day celebrations in November, is believed to have welcomed her twin babies - a boy and a girl - this morning. According to local reports, the princess was admitted to the Princess Grace hospital this morning, where she delivered the twins by caesarian section. The babies are the first children born to the 36-year-old South African and her 56-year-old husband Prince Albert II, although he has two children born during earlier relationships. It is thought that Charlene knew the sex of the twins, while Prince Albert had asked to be kept in the dark until the babies are born. The children are already unusual given the rarity of royal twins, in Europe and elsewhere. Intimate: The behind-the-scenes photos also show Charlene having her hair and make-up done . Happy: The 35-year-old princess looks unusually relaxed in the stunning black and white portraits . Creative: Photographer Julian Lennon is the son of the late Beatle John and his first wife Cynthia . In the UK, only one set of royal twins has ever been born - to King James I of Scotland and his wife Joan Beaufort in 1430. Elsewhere in Europe, twins are more common with Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, and his wife Princess Sophie of Isenberg producing a pair of twin boys last year. Also parents to twins are Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and his wife Mary, who welcomed Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine into their family in 2011. Prince Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou is yet another royal father of twins, and was with his wife Maria Margarita Vargas Santaella when she gave birth to Prince Louis, Duke of Burgundy and Prince Alphonse, Duke of Berry in 2010.

"It's an agonising dilemma faced by every bride-to-be around the world: just what to wear on her special wedding day? But spare a thought for the women of Siberia, where harsh winters can last for up to nine months of the year. And while those preparing to walk down the aisle in the UK or the US pray the rain keeps away, in this part of eastern Russia they simply hope they get a nice 'warm' day -- with temperatures even a little milder than minus 40C. Scroll down for video . What to wear on your wedding day takes on a different dimension when temperatures are -40 degrees . Serbian brides are forced to wear thermal leggings and thick boots under their dress to protect them . Photographer Vera Salnitskaya recommends grooms use make-up on their noses and ears to hide the red . Winter's in this part of Russia typically last nine months and warmer -40 is considered a good temperature . Now the secrets behind keeping the frozen snow brides of Siberia happy have emerged from one of the region's top photographers. From recommending their footwear - definitely no high heels - to hiding thermals under their dresses, Vera Salnitskaya has perfected the art of helping Russian women realise their dream of becoming a real-life ice princess for a day. 'Why do couples choose to marry in winter here? Well, what choice do they have in a place where winter may last for nine months,' the 30-year-old, from Novosibirsk, told The Siberian Times. 'The first couple I ever took pictures of were called Ekaterina and Sergey. 'It was December and it wasn't very cold, only about minus 20C perhaps, but still when the bride was taking her coat off to pose with her naked arms and shoulders I was shaking my head and hurrying her to get dressed. 'I told her, 'You'll get cold' but she answered back, 'Never mind that - I want to look beautiful'. 'Oh that brides' desire to be beautiful. The thing is, the coats that are offered in wedding dress shops are made from teddy bear skin. They are pure synthetics and, frankly, I think that it would be warmer without them than in them. 'The coats are usually short with the neck open to every wind. 'And no, you can't put an ordinary coat above the 'princess dress', and it is often too expensive to buy a luxurious real fur coat.' As well as the dress, Serbian brides must consider their wedding coat, with this bride opting for a bold red which contrasts beautifully with the surrounding snow . Vera Salnitskaya has perfected the art of helping Russian women realise their dream of becoming a real-life ice princess for a day . Not a typical aisle, but Russian citizen's are used to marrying against a backdrop of thick snow . Vera says that brides' desire to look like a princess in their wedding photos often see them brave the arctic weather . Vera advises staying well covered up to the neck, but still struggles to keep couples outside for longer than 10 minutes . Vera warns that many of the coats available at bridal shops are simply not warm enough . So what to do? Many years experiencing the harsh winters has helped Vera come up with the answers - techniques seldom needed in Europe and America. 'On their legs you can put warm thick tights or thermals under the dress,' she says. 'I am very strict with my brides in saying that they can choose anything they like - as long as their legs and feet are warm. So traditional Russian Valenki [felt boots] or Uggs are good. 'Typically the wedding dress is long and it is more important to keep their legs warm than to catch a fever after posing in high heel shoes in the middle of a snow drift. 'They do usually listen to me, but sometimes that desire to be beautiful wins over common sense. 'I remember a bride called Natasha whose wedding was in January, when it was minus 30C. I spoke to her a day before the wedding day about warm shoes, and as we left the house I asked her again if she had taken the boots. 'She said 'yes' but when we come to the park she jumps out of the car in her delicate shoes and thin white tights into the snow. 'I'm standing with my camera, in warm Valenkis, thermals, three pair of trousers above the thermals, a thick coat, gloves and a very warm hat. t is crucial for the brides to keep their feet warm and dry - and this groom is clearly keen to help out . Ideally, Vera says a thick real fur coat should be worn, but she says many can not afford them . Vera herself dresses up in multiple layers to capture the shots, and the shoots tend to be brief! Despite the challenges that the extreme cold poses, it makes for a dramatic backdrop for the stunning shots . 'The absurdity of it is that the dress is so long the pictures don't even show what kind of footwear the bride has on.' Vera continues: 'I am always asking my brides to be take something warm with them. It doesn't matter what it us, just as long as they can have it when we are walking from the car to the area where they'll pose for me. 'I also ask them to wrap something around their necks. I think the person that invented the typical style of wedding coats have only seen real snow in American Christmas movies. Born in a village near Novosibirsk, Vera graduated from the electromechanical faculty at Novosibirsk Technical University before starting her working life as a designer. But she is now one of the Siberian city's top photographers, working with a number of local newspapers in addition to her weddings. What perplexes her most is the fact that people in this part of the world expect long and harsh winters, yet forget how cold the weather might be on their big day. 'I think often winter weddings are planned in the house, without going out and feeling what it would be like to pose barely dressed,' she laughs. Wanting to look beautiful can win over common sense as one bride shuns Uggs for heels and thin tights . 'Of course when discussing their ideal images all couples promise that they will be ready to run around in the snow, make snowmen, go ice skating, you name it. 'But you are lucky if you can take them for longer than ten minutes out of the car. They get immediately cold and start shivering, and their noses, ears and hands get bright red. And then naturally there is no point in taking pictures.' Surprisingly Vera says the grooms do not fare any better than their brides. 'Unlike the brides they have to wear shoes,' she explains. 'I remember one wedding, of Anastasia and Anatoly, on February 15. She is happily jumping about in her comfortable Uggs, and he is turning into an icicle in his fashionable shoes. 'He says to me, 'She's lucky, she's got her feet warm. But I am getting frozen here'.' Vera says she now has to pass on her words of weather wisdom to the Siberian men before they go for their photo shoots, with some unusual fashion tips thrown in. She says: 'I tell them to take good hats as their ears go bright red within seconds of being outside. Also the make-up shouldn't only be about the brides, and grooms too should put some tone on their noses and ears. 'We also take tea with brandy, or tea with ginger and lemon -- it helps, but not for long.' And with another laugh she adds: 'The best way to protect yourself against the freezing temperature is a beautiful skiing costume But no bride would go for that.'","Winter in Siberia lasts for nine months and is bitterly cold .

"Flirting with cabin crew is one way of passing the time on board a flight - but research has revealed it's often in vain as only 6 per cent of cases develop into something more meaningful. Surprisingly only 14 per cent of Britons who have been on a plane in the past two years have attempted to flirt with a member of the cabin crew. While 37 per cent of these felt that the cabin crew member flirted back with them, 11 per cent said they were ignored by the person for the remainder of the flight and only six per cent said it actually went somewhere after the journey. According to a survey, 14 per cent of Brits have admitted to flirting with cabin crew on board their flight . Of the 14 per cent of Britons who admit to flirting, 37 per cent said they received the same back . Jetcost.co.uk conducted the research as part of an ongoing study into the way airline passengers keep themselves entertained and interact with fellow passengers during a flight. A total of 2,749 respondents from the UK, all of whom were aged 18 and over and stated that they'd been on a flight in the last two years, were quizzed about their flying experiences. When the 14 per cent of 'flirters' were asked why they did this, they stated that they had 'found them attractive' (37 per cent), 'heard stories about flight attendants' (21 per cent) and 'I was dared to' (18 per cent). Only 6 per cent of those who had flirted with a member of the cabin crew admitted that their efforts had lead to the pair swapping contact details and meeting at a later date. 1. Listen to music – 73 per cent . 2. Talk to fellow passengers – 68 per cent . 3. Watch in-flight movies – 56 per cent . 4. Sleep – 49 per cent . 5. Read a magazine / book – 35 per cent . 6. Flirting with cabin crew – 14 per cent . Those who had admitted to flirting with flight attendants were also asked how the cabin crew member had responded at the time, with 37 per cent of them stating the person had flirted back, while 23 per cent admitted they'd looked a bit taken aback and 11 per cent said the flight attendant had tried to avoid them for the remainder of the flight. Men were twice as likely as women to flirt with cabin crew staff, according to the findings. In order to determine if this was purely a UK trend or something that was becoming popular with all those around Europe, 1,000 people from European countries outside of the UK were polled. When asked 'Have you flirted with a member of the cabin crew on a flight before?' 36 per cent of respondents from Spain said 'yes', with a further 22 per cent from Germany, 15 per cent from France and only seven per cent from Italy saying the same. Spain topped the polls for the greatest number of people admitting to flirting on planes . Furthermore, only 13 per cent of those from Spain and four per cent from France admitted that the flirtatious behaviour had carried on past the flight. Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'Hooking up with a flight attendant seems to be a bit of a fantasy for many Britons; it makes you wonder if this is because of how they're portrayed in the movies. 'Either way, it's not particularly nice for the cabin crew team when it happens, and it must happen to them on such a regular basis they see it coming before you even get chance to speak to them. 'If you think about it, it's not the wisest idea either because you're then trapped on a plane with them for a few hours, so if it goes horribly wrong or you don't get the reaction you expected, you're stuck in a confined space with them until the flight lands.'","Less than half of flirting Brits say they receive any signals back .

"Giant US businesses Disney and Microsoft have been dragged into the Luxembourg tax avoidance scandal engulfing Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker after a slew of confidential documents were leaked. The Grand Duchy is accused of allowing multinational firms to pay virtually no tax on massive profits – draining resources from countries forced to make drastic cuts to reduce their deficits. The scandal has dragged in Mr Juncker - Luxembourg’s former Prime Minister. The new president of the European Commission, Brussels' most powerful official, is under mounting pressure to explain the complicated tax deals struck while he was leader. Protesters campaign against European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels yesterday . Among the new companies exposed in secret tax documents leaked to the Guardian are Disney, FTSE 100 firm Reckitt Benckiser and Skype – now owned by Microsoft. There is no suggestion that the tax schemes are illegal. The documents were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Dozens of multinationals implicated in the latest leaks engineered complicated tax schemes which helped cut their tax bills. The new revelations will step up the pressure on Mr Juncker who praised Luxembourg’s tax policies. In 2005, when Mr Juncker was both prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg, he said: ‘Skype will remain based here … this is partly because of the favourable fiscal environment we’ve created here in Luxembourg.’ Since being appointed to the top job in Brussels Mr Juncker has brushed off allegations that Luxembourg, under his leadership, engaged in ‘industrial scale tax avoidance’. He said: ‘I am not the architect of the Luxembourg model because this model doesn’t exist.’ But according to the Guardian about 340 companies – including Fedex, Pepsi, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Icap and Ikea – secured special tax deals with Luxembourg. Last week, Germany, France and Italy demanded a clampdown on Luxembourg-based tax avoidance. They said: ‘Our citizens and our companies expect us to cope with tax avoidance and aggressive planning.’ Luxembourg is accused of allowing multinational firms like Disney to pay virtually no tax on massive profits – draining resources from countries forced to make drastic cuts to reduce their deficits . Parliament’s spending watchdog chief Margaret Hodge said the revelations raised serious questions over Mr Juncker’s suitability to head up the European Commission. She said: ‘Since I have uncovered all this I have questions about if Mr Juncker is fit to be the president of the European commission. ‘I think if this had been around during the period of his appointment it might well be a different decision.’ The companies named in the leaked documents said they had done nothing wrong. Koch Industries said: ‘Like all Koch companies, Invista conducts its business lawfully, and pays its taxes in accordance with applicable laws. As the Guardian has previously acknowledged, all of our activities in these matters are legal.’ Microsoft, Skype’s parent, said: ‘Microsoft’s acquisition of Skype was finalised in October 2011, so we can only speak to activities after that date.’ Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the revelations raised serious questions over Mr Juncker’s suitability as EU Commission President . The statement added that Microsoft had since changed Skype’s business model: ‘As a global business, Microsoft adheres carefully to the laws and regulations of every country in which we operate.’ It comes after Washington’s ambassador to the UK defended Google, Facebook and Amazon amid claims they were no playing by the rules on tax. Matthew Barzun leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies, saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments. David Cameron warned in October that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying UK taxes would be made to ‘damn well pay’. The Treasury will today publish details of a new ‘Google tax’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the UK pay at least some tax here. But Mr Barzun told journalists in Westminster it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ despite the fact they pay little, if any, corporation tax in this country. ‘I’m not the spokesman for any of those great American companies,’ he said. ‘These companies and other companies… are clever about using international rules that exist, as written, by the way, by all of us – that’s US government, British government – we make these rules and they are playing by them. ‘And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.’ Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years. Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax. And Amazon, which sold goods worth £4.3billion in the UK last year, paid just £4.2million. The firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules. But their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the UK. Chancellor George Osborne announced last week that the UK will impose a new ‘diverted profits tax’ on corporations that seek to artificially shift their profits to low tax regimes abroad. He said it would raise £1billion over five years. But experts warn that the so-called ‘Google tax’, whose details will be unveiled today, could prove fiendishly difficult to enforce.","Grand Duchy accused of allowing multinational firms to pay virtually no tax .

"The last remaining French citizen held abroad by a terrorist group was given a hero's welcome on his return home after he was freed by Al Qaeda militants in Mali. But questions remain over whether a ransom was paid for Serge Lazarevic's freedom or if he was released as part of a prisoner exchange after spending three-years in captivity. 'Being a hostage is a bit difficult, it's not easy,' Lazarevic told reporters shortly after he touched down on the tarmac of Villacoublay airport near Paris. 'But life is beautiful, to be freed again. Scroll down for video . A smiling Serge Lazarevic disembarks the plane that brought him back to his homeland. The french citizen was freed by Al Qaeda militants in Mali after being held in captivity for three-years. Questions remain over whether he was freed in a prisoner exchange . Lazarevic's daughter Diane (left) campaigned tirelessly for his release, urging French president Francoise Hollande to do everything he could to secure his release by Christmas. She flew back to France with her father after meeting him in Niger's capital Niamey . Lazarevic was greeted by French president Francoise Hollande (right) at the Villacoublay airport near Paris. Hollande credited credited cooperation of the governments of Mali and Niger, but French authorities provided no details of the liberation . 'I forgot what freedom is, don't ever forget,' he added. 'Be careful because freedom is the most priceless thing.' During his time in captivity, he said he had lost around three stone, before going on to thank the people and president of Niger who worked with France to secure his freedom. Hollande also credited the cooperation of the governments of Mali and Niger, but French authorities provided no details about the liberation. Worryingly for some, Lazarevic may have been freed in a trade. A few days before his release, two fighters from the group known as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb were freed from imprisonment in Mali, a security official in Mali told the Associated Press . They had been jailed for Lazarevic's kidnapping and that of his colleague, Philippe Verdon. The fighters were transferred to mediators in Niger on Saturday, before rejoining their colleagues in the terrorist group, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety. Hollande has denied that France any pays ransoms for hostages but Lazarevic's sudden liberation will once again raise accusations that France has paid ransoms to have its citizens freed. Countries like Britain and America oppose this, arguing that it funds terrorism and encourages further kidnappings at a later date. After Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter Diane urged the French President to do everything possible to secure his release . During his three years in captivity, Lazaravic appeared in several videos released by Al Qaeda . But former anti-terrorism judge Alain Marsaud was far more sceptical on the subject of a paid ransom. 'There is no reason for heated debate. We pay, we pay and that is all,' he told RTL radio. 'There is no release if there is no payment. Someone paid, if not the government, a business or insurance company.' While tight lipped on the details, Hollande was nonetheless jubilant at the return of his countryman. 'We've been waiting for you for three years,' he said with the ex-hostage at his side. 'Three years you've suffered. You're back. It's a joy to welcome you back.' Warning French citizens to avoid risky zones, he mentioned Verdon, who along with Lazrevic, was kidnapped from a hotel in Hombori in northeastern Mali in November 2011. Their families have said they were doing a feasibility study for a cement factory. Verdon, who suffered from an ulcer and tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - was found shot dead last year, and those close to his family suggested he had been executed as he was unwell. 'Make sure you don't go where you can be kidnapped, Hollande warned. We're in a dangerous world. There are zones where you shouldn't travel ... we know the risks.' Lazarevic is the last of more than a dozen French citizens taken captive in recent years, with those held in Africa reaching a high of 15 last year. He was met by his daughter Diane in Niger's capital Niamey before making his way back to France. During his three years in captivity, he appeared in several  videos released by Al Qaeda. The most recent emerged in November and showed Lazarevic claiming to be so gravely ill that he believed his life was in danger. Fears spiked for the safety of the towering Frenchman of Serbian origin in September after hiker Herve Gourdel was abducted in neighbouring Algeria and beheaded  by ISIS-linked militants. After Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter urged Hollande to do everything possible to secure his release in time for Christmas. Failed rescue: Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers (left) was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen after U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation rather than make a ransom payment to the terror group. South African teacher Pierre Korkie (right) was also executed . He was accused, alongside Verdon of being a French intelligence agent by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Their families have always denied these allegations. The pair were in the hands of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as it and other hardline Islamist groups launched a takeover of vast areas of northern Mali in 2012, and as they were in turn ousted by the French army who intervened in January the following year. Uncertainty remains over the fate of another French hostage, Gilberto Rodrigues Leal, whose death was claimed by an Al-Qaeda splinter group but whose remains have never been found. 'We have the grimmest information concerning him. His family knows this. But, France has no more hostages, it must have no more hostages,' Hollande said. While the details of Lazarevic's release were not given, France has repeatedly denied paying ransoms despite being accused of using back-channels to do so by other Western nations. 'France does not pay ransoms, nor does France engage in prisoner exchanges,' Hollande said in September. But he added: 'This does not mean that countries do not do it. It has happened that some countries, to help us, do it. That I concede.' Francois Hollande (pictured) said France does not pay ransoms but a Malian official said two Al-Qaeda fighters who had been imprisoned in Mali for Lazarevic's kidnapping were freed days before his release . The majority of foreign nationals held by the likes of Al Qaeda and ISIS have been freed, with the terrorist groups themselves claiming Britain and the United States are the only countries who do not make secret payments. Some estimate that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have earned at least £79 million from kidnappings since 2008, of which £42 million was paid in 2013 alone. Four French journalists held by Syrian jihadists were released earlier this year. Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen while U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation. The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists had on Thursday threatened to kill photographer Luke Somers, 33, within 72 hours unless a ransom was paid. Another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by captors in the midst of the raid, US officials said.","Serge Lazarevic, 51, kidnapped by Islamist militants in November 2011 .

"A 35-year-old woman has been confined within the walls of her home for 20 years, trapped by a painful condition which causes her skin to crack into agonising wounds at every movement. Shabana Islam, from London, was forced to give up her career as a fashion designer and some days struggles to get out of bed. The debilitating condition has yet to be diagnosed by doctors. Specialists believe it could be chronic actin dermatitis - a condition where the skin becomes inflamed after being exposed to light. Shabana Islam, from London, has suffered an agonising undiagnosed skin condition for the last 20 years. She is pictured here before the devastating condition took hold . The 35-year-old was forced to give up her career as a fashion designer and is largely confined to her house because of the excruciating pain. It causes her skin to crack into painful wounds with every movement, right . Specialists believe the condition may be aggravated by the light, but various treatments have failed to work . Miss Islam's skin is constantly dehydrated, and cracks into painful wounds and sores with every movement. She covers her body in steroid cream and emollients - non-cosmetic moisturisers designed to combat dry skin - before bandaging her body up. But despite her attempts to ease her pain, nothing has worked. 'It's like I'm being burned by hot flames and at the same time splinters of glass are being injected into my skin,' she said. 'Even when the cream has soaked in my body I often wake in the middle of the night to find the bandages fused to my skin. Chronic actinic dermatitis is a rare condition that tends to affect men over the age of 50. Those with the condition suffer itchy, red, inflamed and thickened dry skin, mainly in areas that have been exposed to sunlight or artificial light. The rash develops in areas like the neck, upper chest, the backs of a person's hands. The lesions are ususally red and inflamed, with a scale-like appearance. A rash can appear after as little as 30 seconds in daylight and patients are even at risk on dull days and through glass windows. Some will also react to artificial light sources. 'My skin is so hot to touch, I feel like a human reptile. 'I can't even cry because my tears sting my eyes and face because of the cracks in my skin, it's relentless.' For more than 20 years Miss Islam has lived with the condition which has driven her to drastic measures to relive herself of the constant agony she is in, she's even contemplated suicide. She said: 'To take away the pain I would boil some water and pour it into a hot water bottle, which I then pressed against my skin. 'I would even hold my arms up against hot radiators to ease the pain. 'I could not take the pain my skin was causing, but I could tolerate the heat from the radiators and the burning it caused. 'The four walls of my home became a prison for me rather than a place where I can relax.' Despite the horrendous pain the 35-year-old goes through on a daily basis she has used her time trapped in her home to start up her charity; Skin Deep Behind the Mask (SDBM). Her charity aims to help and support people with skin diseases and raise awareness of conditions unknown to people who don't suffer from the illnesses. She said: 'SDBM was born out of my personal experience with my skin. It turned my world upside down and I've been robbed of my face, my identity, my independence and my time. 'SDBM's mission is ""providing education, guidance and support to skin disease sufferers and carers alike"". 'This means we aim to provide practical help to patients no matter what skin disease they have. 'For a lot of sufferers of skin disease their ailments are a way of life, something that has to be managed at every moment, of every day without a cure in sight. And their physical turmoil is just part of the suffering.' To find out more visit the charity's website here. She regularly smothers herself in steroid cream and emollients - designed to treat very dry skin - but her skin feels as though it is being burned by a hot flame or injected with glass splinters, she said .

"Hundreds of fighters from the Russian republic of Chechnya have formed their own 'Death Battalion' to join the insurgency in east Ukraine. The 300 or so volunteers say they are mostly former state security troops in the mainly Muslim region, where Moscow has fought two bloody wars since the fall of the Soviet Union. Reuters reported seeing dozens of the armed men in camouflage uniforms chanting 'Allahu Akbar' as they trained in the snow in their camp outside Donetsk, east Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Seasoned fighters: Pro-Russian separatists from the Chechen 'Death Battalion' walk during a training exercise in the territory controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, eastern Ukraine . Well drilled: The fighters hold their weapons in formation at their training camp just outside Donetsk . Seasoned Chechen fighters, whose combat experience often dates back to the 1994-96 and 1999-2000 wars, fight on both sides in Ukraine, adding to the complexity of a conflict taking on the character of a Cold War proxy war. The West says regular Russian troops are involved in the fighting, while Russia accuses Europe and the U.S. of engineering a coup in Kiev and supporting its new pro-West regime. 'This is volunteer battalion Death,' said the deputy commander of the group, who only gave his nickname 'Stinger'. He spoke to Reuters at a former tourist camp outside the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, east Ukraine, which he and his men have turned into their base. 'There are about three hundred of us in Donetsk region. We have battlefield experience from 10 to 20 years starting from 1995,' said the man, in his forties, a pistol fixed to his thigh. He had a little Chechen flag in green, white and red stitched to his cap and spoke Russian with a strong Caucasus accent. Several cars with Chechen registration plates were parked in the camp. In training: Seasoned Chechen fighters, whose combat experience often dates back to the 1994-96 and 1999-2000 wars, fight on both sides in Ukraine, adding to the complexity of the conflict . Divided region: In Ukraine, Stinger's men are sworn enemies with another group of Chechens who fight on the opposite side of the conflict and support the Kiev government troops . 'This is volunteer battalion Death': The deputy commander of the group, who only gave his nickname 'Stinger', told Reuters the unit was made up of around 300 Chechens with 10 to 20 years battlefield experience . Russia sides with east Ukraine's rebels but denies sending troops to reinforce them. Some fighters on the ground admit to being former Russian servicemen, or 'on leave'. Moscow says any Russians fighting there are volunteers. Chechnya's own separatist insurgency, in which the republic sought independence from the Russian Federation, was eventually squashed after two bloody wars, but unrest still simmers among Caucasian Islamist groups. Gunmen attacked a police post and captured a building in the regional capital of Grozny last week and at least 20 people, including ten police and ten suspected militants, were killed in gunbattles that ensued. Violence erupted hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin had been due to give a major speech in Moscow, a symbolic challenge to the man credited for the Russia's victory in the second Chechen war. Re-establishing Moscow's control over Chechnya and then introducing an uneasy peace under Ramzan Kadyrov, whom critics and rights campaigners accuse of heavy-handed tactics and human rights violations, is seen by Mr Putin's supporters as a key achievement. Hand to hand combat: Two Chechen fighters practice their wrestling in the snow while their comrades watch . Physical training: The men jog along the snow-covered roads of the war-torn region . Phew... But by this point they seem to have slowed slightly to rather less than a jog... Lots to work on: The formation appears to break up as the faster fighters speed off around the corner . In Ukraine, Stinger's men are sworn enemies with another group of Chechens who fight on the opposite side of the conflict and support the Kiev government troops. Some of them have Western passports after fleeing Russia following the two wars. They say Moscow is theirs and Kiev's joint enemy and that Chechnya is occupied by Russia. Stinger, however, said Chechnya was being destroyed in the wars of 1990s and became peaceful again only when some local leaders allied with the Kremlin. Some of those in the 'Death' unit said they had initially fought against Russia in Chechnya but later switched sides and were amnestied by a former Kremlin-allied head of the region, Ramzan's father, Akhmet Kadyrov. 'Now we are (former) soldiers and officers of the Russian army, of Russian special forces, mostly veterans of war campaigns,' Stinger said.","Deputy commander says he has about 300 men in his volunteer battalion .

"A billionaire Russian mining tycoon has been revealed as the buyer of American scientist James Watson's Nobel Prize medal - and says he plans to hand the award straight back. Alisher Usmanov, whose mining and telecoms companies have earned him $15billion according to Forbes, paid a record $4.1million for the medal when it was auctioned in New York last week. But now he says he will hand the medal back to Watson, who was awarded it in 1962 alongside Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins after discovering the double helix structure of DNA. Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, worth an estimated $15billion, bought the Nobel Prize medal from James Watson (right) at auction last week for $4.1million, but plans to had it back . James Watson won the prize in 1962 with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering the double helix structure of DNA, but said he was forced to sell it after losing his income following racist comments . Usmanov said: 'In my opinion, a situation in which an outstanding scientist has to sell a medal recognising his achievements is unacceptable. 'James Watson is one of the greatest biologists in the history of mankind and his award for the discovery of DNA structure must belong to him.' Watson became the first living recipient of a Nobel medal to auction the trophy when he lost most of his income and reputation after claiming that white people are smarter than black people. In a 2007 interview with The Sunday Times, he said he was 'gloomy about the prospect of Africa' because 'all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really.' Those comments lead to him being dropped from  company boards, forced him to retire from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and reduced his income to his academic work alone. Before selling the medal Watson said he wanted to use the money to re-enter public life after becoming an 'unperson', and buy a Hockney painting. He said he also planned to donate part of the windfall to the universities of Indiana, Chicago and Cambridge which helped 'nurture' him. Watson (far right) is applauded by Sweden's King Gustaf Adolf after receiving the Nobel Prize. He became the first living recipient to auction the medal when it sold at Christie's in New York last week . Mr Usmanov, who was named as Britain's wealthiest man in 2013, added: 'Dr Watson's work contributed to cancer research, the illness from which my father died. 'It is important for me that the money that I spent on this medal will go to supporting scientific research, and the medal will stay with the person who deserved it.' Crick and Watson won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine after discovering the double helix structure of DNA, though their research would prove controversial. Their discovery drew heavily on the work of Rosalind Franklin, whose DNA crystallography photographs of the double helix were shared with them without her permission. Her work is widely accepted to have greatly helped the pair map the double helix structure of DNA, and explain how genetic information is coded on to it. Franklin, who was working at University College London, died of ovarian cancerin 1958, four years before the Nobel Prize was awarded, discounting her from the selection.","Alisher Usmanvo bought Nobel medal at auction in New York last week .

"Real Madrid’s noisy neighbours were at it again in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Spanish capital. Last season Diego Simeone’s side pipped Real Madrid to the La Liga title, now they have beaten them in the Spanish Super Cup. Money might buy a club the best players from the last World Cup but Atletico Madrid’s motivation and organisation continues to be absolutely priceless and it was too much for Carlo Ancelotti’s confused European Champions who were behind after 80 seconds and never found a way back. Clinical: Atletico Madrid's Mario Mandzukic makes it 1-0 against Real Madrid in the second leg match of the Spanish Super Cup . Goal hero: Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic lifts the Super Cup trophy after beating Real Madrid on Friday . Glory boys: Atletico have started the season as they ended the last, by eclipsing their illustrious neighbours and picking up a trophy . Atletico Madrid: Moya; Juanfran, Godín, Miranda, Siqueira; Tiago, Gabi; Koke, Raul García, Griezmann (Jiminez 73); Mandzukic . Subs: Oblak, Suarez, Rodriguez, Ansaldi, Niguez, Gimenez . Goal: Mandzukic 2 . Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Varane, Ramos, Coentrao (Marcelo 70); Modric, Kroos (Ronaldo 45), Xabi Alonso; James (Isco 65), Benzema, Bale . Subs: Navas, Pepe, Arbeloa, Illarra . With the league season due to start this weekend all is not as it should be for Ancelotti. Midfielder Sami Khedira went to watch his brother play in Germany, Angel Di Maria was left out of the squad completely and Cristiano Ronaldo was left on the bench not fit to start. With no Ronaldo or Di Maria the onus was very much on Bale who has been Real Madrid’s best player in pre-season but before the Welshman could have an impact a defence strangely missing the benched Pepe was embarrassed by Atletico’s first attack. Their big summer signings Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic must find the goals that Diego Costa scored last season – the hope is that the Croatian will hold the ball up and the Frenchman will feed off him but it was the other way around inside two minutes and Atletico Madrid were in front courtesy of Mandzukic’s first goal for the club. Atletico’s incredible knack of replacing the strikers they are forced to sell has seen them go from Diego Forlan to Sergio Agüero and Radamel Falcao to Diego Costa. Mandzukic has started well with a goal against the old enemy that wins a Cup final. Delight: Atletico's Mario Mandzukic (centre) celebrates his second-minute strike against  Real Madrid at Vicente Calderon on Friday . Real Madrid forced their first corner and from it Luka Modric sent a shot over and they were then given a brief one-man advantage by referee David Fernandez. Fabio Coentrao clashed with Juanfran and as the Atletico full-back was waiting to come back on after having treatment, James almost equalised for Real with a shot parried by Miguel Moya. Simeone was fuming at the delay in Juanfran being allowed back onto the pitch and after some figure wagging and a tap on the back of the fourth official’s head he was sent off. It is hard to think of another coach in world football at the moment who has the same communion with his supporters and the dismissal only increased the volume in the Calderon. Best of enemies: Atletico coach Diego Simeone (right) greets his Real Madrid counterpart Carlo Ancelotti (left) before the match . On the ball: Gareth Bale of Real Madrid takes on Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid at Vicente Calderon on Friday . Madrid’s next chance came after Bale was bundled over by Godin and from Rodriguez's free-kick, Xabi Alsono fired a shot just wide. Modric then crossed for Rodriguez to head wide of Moya’s far post. The Colombian was everywhere for Madrid and he fed Bale who shot just wide as Madrid continue to press. But Atletico Madrid are a hard team to break down once they are in front and with Raul Garcia threatening at the other end they almost doubled their lead. First he shot from distance forcing a corner and then he headed Koke’s kick just wide. Ronaldo replaced Toni Kroos at half time as Real Madrid switched to a 4-2-3-1 but it was Atletico Madrid who started the brighter with Siqueira drawing a yellow card from Modric and Raul Garcia crashing a shot off the underside of the crossbar. The midfielder who got the all important equaliser in the first leg sent another shot whistling past Casillas’ post as Atletico did far more with less possession than their rivals. Roanldo finally tested Moya but his shot was comfortably held and when Bale tumbled in the box spinning away from Siqueira as the referee waved away the appeals for a penalty. Head over heels: Bale takes a tumble after going close with an effort during second leg of Spanish Super Cup . Unhappy: Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale complains to the referee during the second leg of the Super Cup . Up for it: Atletico's Koke, centre, tangles with Real's James Rodriguez, left, in an aerial duel . For Atletico Madrid Koke shot just over and Griezmann had the chance of the second half but dragged his shot wide. He was taken off to be replaced by Raul Gimenez who signed this summer from Mexican club America and got himself in trouble with his new supporters after an old allegiance to Real was revealed. Raucous nights like this one will soon clear him of any doubts he is at the wrong Madrid club. Atletico fans took a deep breath when the board for injury time showed four added minutes but it was in stoppage time that Modric picked up a second yellow and so Real were reduced to ten men. Atletico held out to win their first trophy of the season with the dismissed Simeone celebrating in the front row of the main stand with supporters - it seems news of his team’s decline in light of the sale of Diego Costa and the return of Thibuat Courtois have been greatly exaggerated.

"Russian elder statesman Mikhail Gorbachev today warned of the threat of Armageddon if Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin fail to rapidly 'defrost' their icy relations. The architect of glasnost also demanded that Moscow and the European Union end what he sees as the start of a new Cold War between east and west triggered by the Ukraine crisis. Fearing 'terrible consequences', he warned: The catastrophic fall in the level of trust in international relations came as a result of the events which took place in the last few months. Grim warnin: Mikhail Gorbachev, pictured in front of the Brandenburg Gate, warned that the new Cold War could last years unless Obama and Putin defrost their relationship . 'Judging by the recent declarations, diplomats of both sides are preparing for many long years of confrontation. 'This is extremely dangerous. 'With such emotions running so high, as we have now, we may not survive through these years. Somebody may just loose control of himself. 'We must do our best to overturn this tendency.' The man who changed the world in the 1980s insisted: 'We must urgently defrost relations.' Writing today in the Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta, Mr Gorbachev, 83, warned that current international efforts to diffuse the Ukraine crisis were 'unequal to the danger that threatens us all.' 'I suggest that the leaders of Russia and the United States think about holding a summit on a broad agenda, without preliminary conditions. 'The same kind of summit must be prepared between Russia and the European Union.' The man who bridged the ideological gap to forge working relationships with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher said that nuclear giants US and Russia 'carry special responsibility'. 'When they walk away from it, the world sees terrible consequences,' he said. Mr Gorbachev - who has warned before that the mutual animosity between Mr Obama and Mr Putin should not cloud their dealings - declared: 'We shouldn't be afraid that someone will 'lose face' or someone will win a propaganda victory. That should all belong in the past. We should think about the future.'

On the bloodshed in eastern Europe, he stated: 'Both sides in the Ukrainian conflict are breaching the ceasefire. 'Both sides are guilty in using especially dangerous types of weapons and breaching human rights'. He warned today's world leaders: 'War until the victorious end is impossible... It's time to stop.' All sides must urgently abide by a peace deal signed in Minsk in September, which has so far lamentably failed to halt the fighting. 'There isn't any other one,' he said. Gorbachev has been at odds with the West by backing Putin's annexation of Crimea saying it correct an historical error made in Soviet times. It 'should be welcomed instead of imposing sanctions over it.'","Gorbachev demands Moscow and EU settle differences over Ukraine .

"Chilling new images released by ISIS militants show a group of fighters throwing a man off the roof of a building  for being gay - as others pictures emerge of bloodied 'rapists' being strung up in the streets of the same town. Moments before he is flung to his death, a mob of at least eight men can be seen atop of the building that is believed to be somewhere in northern Iraq. The images were posted on a jihadist website just hours after US senate report - described a ‘a stain' on American values - revealed the sadistic abuse of CIA detainees in a network of secret prisons around the world. After dragging the man to the top of a building the mob threw him to his death after he was found guilty by an Islamic court of being gay . Heavily armed, balaclava clad Islamic State fighters read the judgement which said the man who was found guilty of being gay, should be thrown off the highest point in the city, which is believed to be somewhere in northern Iraq . It is not known whether the man died instantly after being thrown from the roof. The Islamic court ruled that he should also be stoned to death . Three men who were said to be 'rapists', were tied to a bridge on a street corner and left for dead . Pictures have also been posted online that show three men, whose faces are bloodied and swollen, being tethered to a fence on a street corner. One man is blindfolded while the other two are gagged. But while there has been soul searching in the US and demands in the UK for a full inquiry into the Blair government’s involvement in the CIA’s shameful torture programme, the ISIS fighters have tried to justify their brutal execution. 'The Islamic court in Wilayet al-Furat decided that a man who has practised sodomy must be thrown off the highest point in the city,'  they said in a statement accompanying the images, adding that he would also be 'stoned to death.' Wilayet al-Furat refers to an area stretching across the Syrian-Iraqi frontier, where the Euphrates river flows from Syria into Iraq. It is not known whether the man died instantly after being thrown off the roof. It is the third time in less than a month that the jihadist group has used the brutal execution method for alleged homosexuality. After claiming they found videos on his mobile phone showing him 'practicing indecent acts with males,' a 20-year old man was stoned to death in the Syrian province of  Deir Ezzor in late November, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The London based activist group also claimed that an 18-year-old man was subjected to the same punishment in a separate incident. Public executions are popular with the group who rule parts of northern Iraq and Syria with an iron fist, meting out harsh punishments for actions they see as violating their interpretation of Islamic law, such as adultery, stealing and blasphemy. They have also killed a smaller number of foreign captives. With children watching in the crowd, the group beheaded a man in northern Syria after accusing him of 'offending Allah' yesterday, reported the Observatory, which tracks the conflict using its own sources on the ground. A statement posted on a jihadist website said the man admitted to blasphemy before being killed in the countryside of Raqqa province, which the hard line group controls. Graphic images showing each man, and the location where they were tied up, were published online . One of the tethered men was blindfolded while the other two were gagged; their clothes were all soaked in blood and their faces were bloodied; one man's eyes were swollen shut . Al Qaeda in Yemen commander Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi . A senior commander of Al Qaeda in Yemen has blasted his ISIS rivals for carrying out beheadings calling them 'very barbaric' and 'unacceptable' in the name of Jihad. Although his group is suspected a number of executions, including the beheading of 15 Yemeni soldiers in August, Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi claimed that the executions were were 'individual acts' and not endorsed by the leadership. 'Filming and promoting it among people in the name of Islam and Jihad is a big mistake and not acceptable whatever the justifications are,' al-Ansi said in a video response to questions by reporters posted on one of the group's Twitter accounts. 'This is very barbaric,' he added in the video which appeared to have recorded the interview before British born hostage Luke Somers and  South African teacher Pierre Korkie were killed by militants during a rescue attempt by US special forces. The Yemeni branch of the terror group is, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is seen by the US as the group's most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate globally. The group has criticized ISIS before for trying to expand its territory. Al-Ansi went on to say that the drone strikes stoke popular outrage that boosts al Qaeda's popularity. 'While they kill some of the jihadis, the U.S. drone strikes increase the sympathy of Muslims with us,' he said, adding, 'thanks to the blood of the martyrs, the call for jihad spreads.'","An Islamic court ruled that he should be flung from the highest building .

"Long gone are the days of the office Christmas party being a lacklustre affair with soggy sausage rolls and being stuck in a corner with Boring Brian from accounts. Now, the festive shindig with colleagues has blossomed into a high point of the festive season. Indeed, companies often try to outdo each other and their previous years' events, with elaborate themes, gourmet food and swanky locations. The office Christmas party has blossomed into a high point of the festive party season for many . However, an open bar and socialising with senior colleagues can (and often does) spell disaster for many, with potentially very real consequences for your career. As the office party season gets into full swing, FEMAIL is here to help you sidestep the hidden faux pas and avoid any embarrassing situations. The photobooth . It's  important to visit the photobooth before and after hitting the bar, that way you at least have a respectable set to show people . Now a must-have at every party and wedding, photobooths can be a focal point for a good event. Avoid the inevitable queue by heading to the booth early on in the evening. This also hopefully will avoid you entering after one too many beverages and ending up with a permanent reminder of that time you licked your boss's face. Elliot Gold, manager at  Mega Booth, which supplies photo booths all around the country, says they have seen demand over double in the past year alone, with increasing numbers of businesses and corporations embracing the booths. While  they offer a huge source of fun at parties as well as a hilarious mementos of the evening, Elliot warns that hitting a photobooth drunk with colleagues can be problematic. 'I can't tell you how many times I've seen crazy stuff. People are always asking if they can flash in the booths!' Offering advice for the best photos he says: 'Don't peak too soon! With our booths you get four pictures each time and you'll often see people being really enthusiastic with the props in the first shot and by the last they're just standing there looking confused. 'It's also important to do a ""before"" and ""after"" hitting the bar, that way you at least have a respectable set to show people. 'Before you do anything stupid or too wild make sure the pictures aren't being projected live up on a big screen at the party. And don't get naked!' His top tip? Moustaches. 'Any kind of fake moustache, on both sexes, is always a sure fire winner,' he says. Victoria's pose will disguise any extra chins . Celebrity photographer Max Cisotti gives FEMAIL advice on how to work the photobooth like a red carpet. 'The most important thing is your posture. Make sure you sit up straight. 'Your pose will depend on your face shape so try and learn your angles. 'Celebrities like Victoria Beckham have perfected their poses. 'She always leans forward ever so slightly and arches her back. 'This stretches out your jaw and hides any potential second chins! 'Of course in photobooths what is fun is taking pictures with more than one person. 'The important thing is that faces are on the same focal plane. 'This is because the booth will be set to focus perfectly on the person on the stool. 'So try not to have people too far forward in the booth or and  too far back. 'Also pay attention to where the machine tells you to look. Make sure everyone is on eye level when the shutter goes.' The open bar . A major key is not to drink too much alcohol. With 23 per cent admitting to dancing inappropriately at the office bash in the past and 20 per cent accidentally kissing a colleague under the influence, there is good reason to be wary! Cocktail and party expert BarChick tells FEMAIL: 'The open bar is all about playing the long game. 'There's no need to go in too hard, it's about quality not quantity. The joke is on anyone kicking off their night with shots; don't be that guy. 'Assess what the bar has to offer and work out what you're drinking. Too much mixing will lead to trouble, so get tactical and plan the night ahead. 'Kicking off with champagne never hurt anyone, but stick with it all night and you’re in for trouble. When it comes to shots, opt for 100 per cent agave tequila to save your head the next morning . 'Think long drinks. A decent G&T is a good staple – especially if you’re going for singles. 'Time for shots? Don’t be afraid to be the know-it-all asking for a good quality 100 per cent agave tequila - your head will thank you in the morning. Or sip on some Jägermeister, it is herbal after all, so probably a better choice than the full of sugar sours being pushed your way. 'Less sugar the better. Margaritas your thing? Make it a Tommy’s and you’ll cut out the sugar and lessen the booze content. 'Just remember to keep it simple; if the barman looks like he doesn't know what he's doing, don't give him the opportunity to make you a bad drink, simplicity is key. 'Treat your night like an athlete might and stay hydrated. Sure we might sound like your mother but drink water, they do know best after all. Every drink you have should be matched with a glass of water. This will not keep you sober but it will help you last later, so you can party all night and still look fabulous, that is the end game after all right?' Conversations . From having an argument with an office rival to inappropriately asking for a raise by the bar, cringeworthy conversations at the office bash lead to 20 per cent of revellers having apologised to a boss or colleague for what they said research from music streaming service blinkbox Music. From flirting to having an argument, conversations at the office party lead to 20% of us having to apologise . One in ten people have asked for a raise at the office party and regretted it while 14 per cent have been left red faced the next day by flirting with the boss. Similarly, seven per cent have ended up in a fight with their office rivals. Along with not getting too drunk, which loosens the tongue and lowers inhibition, a good rule of thumb is to steer clear of discussing work related matters. Sticking to neutral topics such as co-workers family and holiday plans is a safe bet. Preparing a set of topics that are interesting but not contentious before the party may seem extreme, but can be a lifesaver when it comes to a boss or senior member of the company. Romance . Seeing co-workers in their glad rags and looking all dolled up can play strange tricks on the mind. Add alcohol, mistletoe and low lighting into the equation and many can find themselves perturbed by their sudden romantic feelings towards colleagues. In fact, 20 per cent have snogged a colleague at a work Christmas party, leading to 14 per cent admitting calling in sick the next day simply to avoid having to face them. If you know you are partial to an ill-advised drunken kiss, it is best to appointed a trusted office friend as 'chaperone' for the evening. Tell them to keep an eye out for anything looking too steamy and give them permission to swiftly (but subtly) intervene. The problem becomes more complex if you in fact are already seeing a colleague. Many end up in inter-office relationships, and large numbers choOse to keep it secret, both to avoid awkwardness and to protect their professionalism at work. It can be difficult deciding at what point you should 'announce' your relationship to co-workers, however the office party is almost certainly not the place. Drunken people can easily misconstrue things and explaining how your coupling will in no way influence your work performance over loud cheesy music is probably not the best idea. If you are both attending and worried your passion may get the better of you and blow your cover, try and set ground rules. Designate areas of the party to each of you and try your best to stick to them. Or you could even decide that one of you will remain sober all night to ensure a professional distance is maintained.","20% of revellers have apologised to a boss or colleague after Xmas party .

"A prestigious Massachusetts academy once attended by Senator Ted Kennedy has revealed two black teachers have been on the receiving end of race hate letters from 'someone inside the private school'. Milton Academy has said that it has launched an investigation into the letters which were sent in late October after a meeting during which staff discussed diversity. One of the letters was sent to Milton's K-8 multicultral director and the other was left for the academy's lower-school director. Controversy: School officials say the Milton Academy's Multicultural Director discovered a race hate letter  a meeting in October to discuss diversity . The contents of the letters have not been revealed, not has the identity of the sender or senders been discovered. It has not been disclosed yet if the perpetrators are staff or students at the historic school. 'I believe this was perpetrated from the inside,' said Milton Police Chief Richard G. Wells Jr. to the Boston Globe. 'It’s a sensitive investigation.' Head of the academy: Todd Bland the head of Milton Academy has said that he hopes to discover the culprits during an internal investigation . At the beginning of the week, Todd Bland, the school's head, decided to reveal to parents the letters had been sent, but told them the author remains unknown. It is assumed the letters were handwritten because their origin remains a mystery, 'despite a thorough investigation.' In his e-mail to parents, who pay upwards of $50,000 a year to send their children to the private school, Bland said he had decided to reveal the incident now because rumors were getting out of hand. Bland wrote, 'this fall we learned of an act that occurred in our K-8 community that directly conflicts with the culture and values we work hard to cultivate at Milton. 'Two adult members of Milton K-8 received an anonymous letter that included hurtful and hateful sentiments targeted at them.' He continued, 'this act angers and saddens us all. . . . This event should stimulate each of us to acknowledge our responsibility to speak up for inclusion and against both large and small expressions of hate, ignorance, or intolerance.' Bland appeared keen to avoid embarrassment and told parents not to share the email disclosing the race hate letters. 'In keeping with our guiding principles of upholding our institutional responsibilities while respecting the needs and wishes of those individuals involved,' he wrote according to the Boston Globe. 'I ask that you do not share this message more broadly.' Alumni: Senator Edward Kennedy attended Milton Academy and so did Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick . Speaking to the Boston Globe, Bland said that the school, 'responded immediately in ways that both honored the individuals’ personal wishes and upheld our institutional responsibilities, legal and ethical'. Sensitive to the racial tensions tightened by the failure of grand jury's to indict in the cases of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, the school said they are keen to handle the situation with care. 'This fall has been tough in K-8, at a time in our nation that also feels very hard. But we will make our way through this and emerge stronger and more inclusive as a community,' wrote Bland. Indeed, despite its history, of Milton's 1,000 students, black students make up 37 perent of the K-8 pupils and 43 percent in the upper school. The elite school boasts Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and Senator Edward Kennedy as former students.","Letters sent in late October after historic school held diversity meeting .

"A prosecutor intends to seek the death penalty for an Indiana man who has confessed to fatally stabbing his girlfriend, cooking her body and eating some of her organs. Clark County Prosecutor Steve Stewart filed his intent to seek the death penalty for Joseph Oberhansley in Clark Circuit Court late last week. Oberhansley, 33, of Jeffersonville, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the stabbing death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton September 11. Scroll down for video . Capital crime: Joseph Oberhansley, 33, charged with murder and abuse of a corpse after he allegedly fatally stabbed his girlfriend, mutilated her and ate parts of her body is expected to face the death penalty . Couple: Officers found Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso, according to a police affidavit. Above, Mr Oberhansley is pictured with the alleged victim . During his initial hearing in days after his arrest, Oberhansley interrupted the proceeding by announcing his name was 'Zeus Brown' and told the judge, 'You have the wrong guy.' Attorney Mike McDaniel told the Evening News and Tribune that he expects he will take over as Oberhansley's counsel if the death-penalty enhancement is permitted. McDaniel said Tuesday that he had a 90-minute meeting with Oberhansley earlier in the day and that they had a 'calm discussion.' He said it was too early to talk about any defense strategies he might pursue. Oberhansley is being held in the Clark County Jail. His trial is set to get under way February 16. Authorities say Oberhansley was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in suburban Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son. Utah discharged him from parole on July 23, and on July 31, Blanton posted $500 bond for him on charges of criminal recklessness and resisting law enforcement stemming from a car chase. On September 11, Tammy Jo Blanton called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit cited by the Louisville Courier Journal. 'Cannibal': Police claim Joseph Oberhansley (pictured above), 33, admitted to killing and eating his girlfriend . Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside. At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after the 46-year-old woman failed to show up for work. When police returned to Blanton's house, they found that the back door had been forced open. Inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated. The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her. Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. .","Joseph Oberhansley, 33, confessed to killing Tammy Jo Blanton, 46, in Jeffersonville, Indiana, in September .

"A Canadian who filmed himself driving a lap around Manhattan in just 24 minutes has been jailed for a year by a New York court in his absence. Adam Tang, 31, posted a video of his trip around the island, where he drove at speeds in the region of 100 miles per hour, in August 2013. Tang, who posted the video on YouTube under the name AfroDuck Productions, failed to turn up to court for his sentencing hearing. Convicted and in Canada: Convicted driver Adam Tang aka Afroduck who lapped Manhattan in 24 MINUTES has fled to country and is living in Canada . Need for speed: Adam Tang, seen here at his 2013 arrest, is allegedly Afroduck--the YouTube user who recorded and uploaded his reckless and record-breaking 24-minute race around the island of Manhattan . According to the New York Daily News Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ann Donnelly criticised Tang for not having any respect for the laws of New York state or city. She said: 'This is a person who sped around our city as fast as he could, reaching speeds of almost 100 miles per hour at some points and for what? So he could indulge some juvenile fantasy about who could drive the car the fastest around New York City.' Prosecutors claimed Tang's credit card details showed he spent two nights in Vermont before crossing the border to Canada. Tang, it is alleged, drove around Manhattan in a 255bhp BMW Z4 3.0 convertible at an average speed of 69 miles per hour. On some stretches his car almost hit 100 miles per hour. During the loop, he is forced to stop at six sets of red lights. The stunt is similar to a 1976 film shot in Paris by Claude Lelouche called Rendezvous. In the movie - which is shot in just one take - Lelouche drives through Paris on an early Sunday morning at break-neck speeds to meet a woman. However, unlike Lelouche's classic, Tang stops at red lights and never crosses to the wrong-side of the road. French director Claude Lelouche, pictured, shot the ultimate race movie through Paris in 1976, where he drove through the city centre at break-neck speed in order to arrive in time to meet a young lady . The ride: Prosecutors portrayed Tang, 31, as a dangerous daredevil who put lives at risk by circling Manhattan in a BMW Z4 convertible at an average of 69 mph . Self proclaimed: Tang flaunted his speeding in a YouTube video that has drawn more than 875,000 views . In Tang's video, he starts recording from the 116th Street on the FDR heading downtown, before using the Henry Hudson Highway and back onto 116th Street in just 24 minutes. During the summer of 2013, a record was set for the fastest loop around Manhattan starting from 116th St. on the FDR heading downtown, up the Henry Hudson Highway, and back down to 116th St. in just 24 minutes. 'The city's roadways are not a racetrack,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. But defense lawyer Gregory Gomez suggested that while Tang might have pushed the envelope on traffic regulations, he didn't commit a crime, reports NBC. Gomez said Thursday he respected the verdict and would focus now on getting Tang to court, arguing for 'an appropriate sentence' and determining whether to appeal. Tang — known to the YouTube world as 'AfroDuck' — was arrested in September 2013, after the video appeared and police traced him through his computer's Internet address. 'I am a car fanatic,' Tang told officers when they arrived, according to a prosecution court filing. The stock trader said he'd wanted to break unofficial speed records for looping Manhattan, but he insisted he didn't do it recklessly, the document said. 'I put a lot of esteem into driving and being a conscious and aware driver,' he said. The nighttime footage captured a car zooming along highways and streets that ring Manhattan, weaving around other cars as brake lights flash at its approach, but also stopping for six red lights. In March, Tang rejected a plea offer that would have entailed two months in jail. His lawyer said then that Tang, married to an American woman, wanted to avoid any criminal record because of possible immigration complications. Tang was arrested again in April, after police said they found him driving in the Bronx although his license had been suspended because of his earlier arrest. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving, a traffic infraction, and paid a fine, Gomez said then.","Adam Tang filmed his loop of Manhattan where he drove up to 100 mph .

Winner: Timothy Poole, a registered sex offender, who $3million from a scratch-off ticket . In 1999, Poole was arrested following allegations that he sexually abused a 9-year-old boy. According to WKMG, Poole was accused of sleeping in the same bed as the boy and waking him up while he was sleeping to perform sex acts. Poole pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery in 1999 after a 9-year-old boy claimed he was molested by the man in his bed . He eventually pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery after accepting a plea bargain and being required to serve ten years of sex offender probation. Four years later, in 2003, he has his probation revoked and was sent to prison for three years after he missed four of his required group sessions. Poole maintains that he is innocent.

"Sleepless nights could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Scans showed that brains of people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta-amyloid. A hallmark of Alzheimer’s, it interferes with brain function, disrupting memory, mood and behaviour. Sleepless nights could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Scans showed that brains of people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta-amyloid; pictured is a stock image of a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease . Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked 98 people aged between 50 and 73 to fill in a questionnaire about their quality of sleep.The volunteers also underwent brain scans. Those who tossed and turned at night or were sleepy during the day had more beta-amyloid in parts of the brain ravaged by Alzheimer’s. More research is needed to work out if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. Or if, in fact a lack of rest actually feeds the disease. If this is the case and loss of sleep is damaging the brain, finding ways of improving people’s quality of sleep could help keep the brain healthy into old age. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050 as the population ages. With no cure for dementia and existing drugs of limited use, the Prime Minister David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’. Dr Clare Walton, of Alzheimer’s Society, said it wasn’t known if the amounts of beta-amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss . The study, presented at the American College of Nueropsychopharmacology’s  annual conference, is one of several recent pieces of research to link lack of sleep with beta-amyloid levels. Dr Clare Walton, of Alzheimer’s Society, said it wasn’t known if the amounts of beta-amyloid found in the scans would be enough to trigger memory loss. She said: ‘Some elderly people have amyloid plaques in their brains but never go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease, so it is far too early to say whether the amount of sleep you regularly get is important in the development of dementia and those who have a bad night’s sleep should not worry. ‘Take regular exercise, eat a healthy diet and avoid smoking to help keep your brain healthy.’","People who were  sleepy during the day had higher levels of beta-amylouid .

"Parliament is set to be recalled on Friday for MPs to vote on launching air strikes on Islamic State fanatics in northern Iraq. David Cameron is today holding talks in New York with his Iraqi counterpart Haider al-Abadi, who is expected to make a formal request for help. MPs are expected to be summoned for an emergency session debate in the Commons on Friday morning to approve the action, with British Tornado bombers in action by the weekend. Scroll down for video . Aerial warfare: British Tornado bombers could be hitting ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq this weekend. File picture . Interviewed on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the IS group posed a direct threat to Britain. 'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.' The move comes amid growing Tory criticism of Britain's cautious response to the threat posed by IS, which has murdered three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning. Mr Henning's brother-in-law Colin Livesey last night appealed for air strikes to be called off, arguing that the raids would reduce the chance of him being released alive. But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Britain had to take the fight to the extremists – and suggested bombing raids should be extended to IS strongholds in Syria. The PM will offer the services of the RAF during talks  with his Iraqi counterpart Haider al-Abadi . Mr Fallon told the Spectator magazine: 'We've had attacks on the streets of London, on our transport system, at Glasgow Airport, the murder of Lee Rigby – how much more evidence do you need that this is a very clear and dangerous threat to our way of life and to all the democracies of the West. 'This is a new Battle of Britain. 'Iraq is under attack not just from terrorists inside its own borders but from terrorists in the north of Syria. 'If Syria continues to be unwilling or unable to deal with IS then at least the question arises as to whether we shouldn't assist Iraq in doing so.' Downing Street remains nervous about Labour's stance on the issue after Ed Miliband yesterday called for a UN resolution sanctioning military action against IS. A British source pointed out there had already been two resolutions condemning IS – with a third expected today on the issue of foreign jihadis. But the source said there was no prospect of a resolution on military action because of Russian opposition. However, today Mr Miliband insisted his party was 'open to the possibility' of UK forces joining air strikes in Iraq but would not commit in advance of seeing detailed proposals. He said he would 'look very seriously' at any proposal to meet a request from Iraq for British involvement, but action in Syria was a 'more complex' question. 'Isil is a threat that can't be turned away from,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'We've said that we need an alliance which is not just a military alliance but a political and diplomatic alliance. 'How will I judge any proposal? Whether Britain can have an effect, whether we can succeed and whether it is legitimate and lawful. But I am open to the possibility.'

He said he had not spoken to Mr Cameron about the issue or the potential recall of Parliament. Britain was caught flat-footed yesterday when the US carried out its first air strikes on IS positions in Syria, in conjunction with five Arab countries. Downing Street is understood to have been given a 'courtesy call' by the Pentagon shortly beforehand. But the UK was notably absent from a list of allies praised by Barack Obama yesterday for standing 'shoulder to shoulder' with the US. The guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in the Arabian Gulf yesterday . Syrian children hold up debris as they check a damaged house, reportedly hit by U.S.-led coalition air strikes, in the village of Kfar Derian in the western Aleppo province . Mr Cameron last night insisted Britain would play its part in the assault. Asked about the possibility of British bombing raids, he said: 'We're looking carefully at what role we can play in this coalition. 'We've already taken a number of steps so far. We've also armed the (Kurdish fighters). And we will keep looking at what more we can do.' But Tory former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said it was becoming a 'national embarrassment' that the UK was not taking part. He insisted: 'We should be standing shoulder to shoulder with the US and our allies against this utterly brutal group, not sitting on the sidelines.' Liam Fox, the former defence secretary and standard-bearer for the Tory right, said: 'We risk exacerbating the idea, first achieved by the Syria vote, that we have opted out of any leadership role in global affairs.' Mr Cameron will today plead with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani for his support in the fight against IS. It will be the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy.","Prime Minister will offer air support to his Iraqi counterpart today .

"Abercrombie & Fitch's longtime CEO Michael Jeffries is retiring, effective immediately, as the once-hip teen clothing chain's sales continue to decline. Jeffries, 70, is also retiring from the retailer's board of directors. He has served as CEO since February 1992, according to CapitalIQ. 'I believe now is the right time for new leadership to take the company forward in the next phase of its development,' Jeffries said in a statement. Out: Abercrombie & Fitch's longtime CEO Michael Jeffries is retiring, effective immediately . Abercrombie & Fitch's sales have slumped as its target shoppers have turned to the runway-inspired styles of fast-fashion brands such as H&M, Zara and Forever 21. The company has even worked on stripping its once-prized Abercrombie logo off products as teens are now seeking more individuality in their clothing. For the fall season, the company reduced its logoed merchandise by half and previously announced plans to try and have a very minimal North American logo business in the spring. In another bid to boost its image, the company recently launched its first collection featuring the color black, which Jeffries had previously banned, deeming it too 'formal.' The brand has also suffered due to criticism of its policy of not carrying women's clothing in XL or XXL sizes and for controversial comments Mr Jeffries made in 2006, which resurfaced last year. 'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he told Salon at the time. 'Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.' Flagging sales: The Abercrombie & Fitch flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City . He added: 'Those companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, old, fat, skinny.' Abercrombie & Fitch has taken other measures to alter its reputation this year. In May, the company announced that it would ease up on the fragrance that is sprayed throughout the stores and get rid of the heavy, daylight-obscuring shutters on the windows in 240 stores around the U.S. Abercrombie & Fitch has also increased its emphasis on online shopping as it looks to reshape itself. In other moves, the chain said that current Non-Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez will become executive chairman. He has served as non-executive chairman since January. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. also said that its board has created an Office of the Chairman that will include Martinez, Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Ramsden, Christos Angelides, Brand President of Abercrombie & Fitch and Fran Horowitz, Brand President of Hollister. The Office of the Chairman will be led by Martinez and will oversee Abercrombie & Fitch's strategic direction. It will also be responsible for managing the company's day-to-day operations until a new CEO is appointed. The retailer - whose brands include abercrombie, Hollister Co. Gilly Hicks and its namesake - said that it has started a search for a new CEO. Abercrombie & Fitch had 834 stores in the U.S. and 166 stores across Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East at the third quarter's end.
