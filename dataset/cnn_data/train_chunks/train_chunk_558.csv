The daughter of former Doctor Who star Colin Baker had a lucky escape when her car span off the road and smashed into a tree after hitting a pothole. Lally Baker, 22, said she 'thought she was going to die' when her car hit the tree on a busy road in Buckinghamshire on Wednesday night. Miss Baker, whose father played the 6th incarnation of Doctor Who between 1984 and 1986, was travelling home along a 50mph stretch of the Amersham Road towards High Wycombe when the crash happened. Lucky escape: Colin Baker and daughter Lally pictured with her wrecked car after she spun off the road and hit a tree because of a pothole . Although her blue Nissan Micra was a write off following the smash, Miss Baker was fortunate enough to walk away with just a bruised nose. She said: 'It was very scary. The first thing I thought was I was going to die. 'There was blood on my face and I didn't know where that was coming from. 'The pothole came out of nowhere. I think the wheel got stuck in it and just spun me around. 'I just spiralled off the road and that's where I met a tree. 'I'm okay but I've got a very blue nose. Thankfully the airbag and seatbelt did their job.' Her relieved father Colin, who recently went into the jungle as a contestant on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, added: 'She walked away but if you look at the car you wouldn't think that was possible.' Miss Baker, who lives in the village of Cadmore End and works for a charity in London, said a small section of the road was coned off with a sign saying 'Slow - Failed Road Surface', and she drove round this at about 40mph. It was then that she hit the pothole. Wrecked: Lally Baker's blue Nissan Micra was a write-off following the crash on Wednesday evening . After helping recover the crashed car yesterday morning she said the coned area had now been widened to cover the hole. She said: 'It's a lot bigger than I thought it was. It's about one-and-a-half or two inches deep, but it's just very wide and covers a long length of road. 'Perhaps the council could have done more and put the cones around a wider area to be 100 per cent sure.' A spokesman for Buckinghamshire County Council, said: 'We are very sorry that someone has had an accident. 'We had this road defect called through on Friday afternoon as a two hour call out and our Amersham depot gang went out to make it safe. The area has been coned off as a result of the request.' She added that repairs on the road will be carried out later this month.","Lally Baker, 22, was travelling home on a busy road in Buckinhamshire .

Hundreds of thousands of parking fines may have been wrongly issued because councils have ‘made up’ signs not approved by the Government. The number of tickets issued by wardens has soared in recent years with drivers now hit with penalties of up to £80 every 4.6 seconds. Many of those fines are given to motorists in spaces that have been suspended to allow for road repairs or other works. Investigation: Almost 350,000 fines in 16 council areas of London may have been issued unlawfully because the local authorities did not have authorisation for their signs, according to a BBC Inside Out probe (file picture) But an investigation has found . thousands of ‘suspended parking bay’ notices have not been cleared with . the Department for Transport. That means in London alone almost . 350,000 parking fines – totalling £23million – may have been unlawfully . issued because of the invalid signs. Neil Davies, a motoring solicitor at . the law firm Caddick Davies, said: ‘From a legal perspective councils . are on very shaky ground, because the signage they used is effectively . made up. ‘They may be relying on the fact many people don’t challenge parking notices.’ The DfT provides a ‘book’ of designs for road signs that authorities must follow. But it has not yet produced a . template for a ‘suspended parking bay’ sign, meaning councils must get . each individual notice cleared by the DfT before it complies with . Traffic Signs Regulations. A typical London council suspends more than . 1,500 parking bays a month and at least 28 authorities had not applied . for clearance for their signs before 2012. No loading or waiting: There is no template for a suspended parking bay sign, reported BBC Inside Out . In January 2010, motorist Suzanne . Campbell defeated London’s Camden Council at a Parking and Traffic . Appeals Service hearing after being ticketed in a suspended parking bay. Adjudicator Edward Houghton said: ‘In . the absence of a compliant sign the vehicle was not in contravention . and the appeal must be allowed. ‘No doubt the council will give consideration to obtaining the Secretary of State’s authorisation.’ Motorists fined years ago might find it hard to claw money back because there is a time limit of 28 days for appeals. But Mr Davies said both councils and . the Parking and Traffic Appeals Service could use their discretion to . hear historic appeals, adding: ‘There’s certainly a strong moral . argument for councils to refund those monies.’ A BBC investigation found there was a . rush of applications for authorisation from London councils after the . Suzanne Campbell ruling but at least 14 local authorities still have no . clearance. Local authorities raised an estimated . £411million from parking charges last year, but a quarter of the . 6.8million parking tickets given out in 2011 were disputed with 39 per . cent of challenges succeeding. The DfT was yesterday unable to say how many had applied for approval for ‘suspended parking  bay’ signs. Legal wranglings: Three years ago a female motorist won her appeal against a ticket issued in a Camden Council suspended parking bay because the transport secretary had not approved the signage .","Almost 350,000 fines in 16 council areas of London may have been illegal .

Road safety: The Olympics and a 'Bradley Wiggins effect' may have contributed to an alarming rise in child pedestrian and cyclist casualties . The Olympics and a ‘Bradley Wiggins effect’ may have contributed to an alarming rise in child pedestrian and cyclist casualties last summer as youngsters strived to emulate their sporting heroes, road safety experts said today. Deaths and serious injuries among children, cyclists and pedestrians soared on Britain’s roads amid a summer of sporting spectaculars, school holidays and unseasonal wet weather. The worrying new figures from the Department for Transport show that the number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose eight per cent last summer, in the months July, August  and September, compared to the same quarter in 2011, an increase of 30 incidents from 390 to 420. Pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose by six per cent, an increase of 75 incidents from 1,315 to 1,390. Pedal cyclists killed or seriously injured increased by seven per cent, an increase of 64 from 976 to 1,040. For cyclists, the figures also showed in the 12 months up to September last year, 3,270 cyclists were killed or seriously – a rise of eight per cent on the previous year and 29 per cent higher than the average rate between 2005-9. By contrast, the number of car occupants killed or seriously injured last summer dropped by six per cent, a fall of 135 incidents from 2,365 to 2,230 compared to the same quarter in 2011. And motorcyclists killed or seriously injured were down two per cent, down by 28 to 1,670. AA's . president Edmund King said: ‘Youngsters do like to go outside and try . to emulate their sporting heroes, especially after major events like the . Olympics. ‘There may be less traffic on the roads but there are potentially more children playing out on the streets. ‘The worry is that they switch off to dangers they would normally look out for.’ Mr King added: ‘A contradictory trend of . fewer road deaths overall in the summer but more child pedestrians . killed during a period of sporting excellence makes uncomfortable . reading.’ ‘The roads were certainly quieter during . major sporting events like the Olympics but that can lull people into a . false sense of security. We have long campaigned for greater driver . awareness of children in the street during high-profile sporting events, . such as the World Cup and Euro 2012. Cyclists killed: Pedal cyclists killed or seriously injured increased by seven per cent, an increase of 64 from 976 to 1,040 according to the new figures from the Department for Transport . Children beware: The number of child pedestrians killed or seriously injured rose eight per cent last summer compared to the same quarter in 2011, an increase of 30 incidents from 390 to 420 . ‘We also had one of the wettest . summers on record. This could have contributed to the severity of some . of the accidents, making stopping distances worse.’ ‘Drivers . need to slow down in residential and urban areas and be prepared to . expect the unexpected at all times, but particularly during the school . holidays. ‘We have also called for more road . safety training for children in schools to stress new dangers such as . crossing roads while listening to music on headphones or texting . messages on a phone while on the move.’ 'Emulate sport heroes': AA boss Edmund King worries that children 'switch off' to road dangers they would usually look out for . With serious cyclists casualties up, David Davies, the executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) said: ’This could well be the Bradley Wiggins effect.’ It has prompted calls by campaigners to demand urgent action to protect vulnerable road users. Road safety campaigners said the figures should be a wake-up call and demanded more 20mph zones. Ministers insisted they were ‘not complacent’. People killed or seriously injured – known as ‘KSI’ – is used as the official measure for determining road concerns. When the rises among vulnerable road users are balanced against the falls among motorists and motorcyclists, the KSI numbers overall remain relatively static at 6620 – an increase of just 20. The provisional Government figures show that overall there were fewer deaths on the roads last summer than in summer 2011. Some 470 people killed in reported road accidents- a 5 per cent dip on the figure of 494 for the same period in 2011. The latest provisional figures mean that the number of people killed on the roads in the 12 months ending September 2012 totalled 1,760 - a seven per cent drop on the figure for the 12 months ending September 2011 but the numbers killed or seriously injured in the 12 months ending September 2012 were up two per cent to 24,860. Campaigners called for more 20mph zones to cut the carnage. Tony Armstrong, chief executive of the charity Living Streets said: ‘We deplore the six per cent increase in the number of pedestrians killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions. ‘This should be a wake-up call to the Government. ‘Introducing 20 mph speed limits where we live, work, shop and play has been shown to reduce child pedestrian deaths by 70 per cent and creates a safer environment for everyone.’ Jason Torrance, policy director of green transport body Sustrans, said: ‘The Government must act now to put an end to the increasing number of pedestrian and cyclist casualties on our roads.’ Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘We are not complacent about the safety of anyone using the roads, whether they are walking, cycling, riding or driving.’","The Department for Transport has released new figures on the number of people killed or seriously injured (KSI) on the roads .

When it was first built Queen Victoria was on the throne and the Great War was still 15 years off. But, a team of British motor enthusiasts are attempting to get an iconic 114-year-old Panhard et Levassor back on the road and make it pass its MOT. The dark-blue French-built machine was commissioned and made for motoring pioneer Charles . Rolls, who went on to co-found the world-famous Rolls-Royce company. Team Panhard at Gressenhall with their restored Panhard et Levassor. They have been working on the vehicle for more than 20 years . Chief engineer Ken Hilton drives the Panhard. The team believe it will pass its MoT within a month . It was made in 1899 and is one of the oldest working cars in Britain, having spent 77 years in this country. The engineers have been working since 1991, and are now based at Gressenhall Farm and Workhouse, near Dereham. They believe the car may be road worthy again in less than a month. The leader of Team Panhard, Phil Waltham, wants the car to be kept in full working order so . that the public can see a rare, genuine Victorian car in all its glory. He said: 'We feel it's a great . privilege to be involved with the car and to play a part in preserving . it for the future'. 'When the car is going along the road it is nothing like a model, so we think people should get the chance to see it.' Charles Rolls, co-founder of the Rolls Royce, at the wheel of the 1899 Panhard et Levassor in 1900. The Panhard et Levassor is one of the oldest cars still working in the Uk . Built in Paris, the Panhard was the . first vehicle of its kind to have its engine positioned at the front of . the car, putting it at the cutting edge of 19th century technology. The biggest obstacle for the team has been the discovery of a cracked chassis last year, which threatened to finally stop . the classic car after well over a century of running smoothly. But the team have invested more than 200 hours of work to repair it and ensure the car passes next month's MOT. The . splintered chassis was replaced with ash heart wood by 53-year-old . Andrew Curtis, from Herts, who said that above all, the team do not want . the Panhard to become a relic.

The Panhard has been based at Gressenhall since 1996 when it was moved from Strangers Hall Museum in Norwich. But chief engineer Ken Hilton, from Norfolk, believes that the project was worth pursuing so that the public could continue to witness a piece of history. The 89-year-old said: 'It's so much better to keep her working so people can see a very early vehicle on the road. 'The car is only 25 years older than me.' An 1895 Panhard motor car after having taken part in an obstacle race in Paris in 1928. the company set the standard for the industry . The French based Panhard et Levassor was established as a car manufacturing company in 1887 by by René Panhard and Émile Levassor. Their first car launched in 1890. While their cars set many standards, using front mounted radiators and chain driven gear boxes, each one was a one off design. In 1891, the company built their first all-Levassor deign, creating a state of the art machine that sold for 3000 Francs. It became the standard in the industry until the late 1920s. Panhard is credited with creating the first modern transmission in 1985. In the post war era Panhard used alumium to circumvent steel-saving government regulations. The result was light, moveable cars such as the Dyna X and PL 17. The last Panhard passenger car was produced in 1967, as the company began to focus on armoured vehicles used by the military. Panhard lost a competition to produce vehicles for the French military to Auverlan in 2004. Auverland then purchased Panhard, but with Panhard's name being more famous, the new Auverland military vehicles will bear a Panhard plaque.","The Panhard et Levassor is being restored by a team of British enthusiasts .

Not a bird, not a plane, and no longer a reporter - comic book hero Superman has quit his day job. The fictional superhero's alter ego Clark Kent, who has been working as a reporter on The Daily Planet since the 1940’s, leaves the newspaper business after becoming discontent with the state of 21st century journalism. Instead Clark Kent is expected to start the next big online blog as a roving citizen journalist, according to writer Scott Lobdell. Hacked off: Superman, seen here saving The Daily Planet's logo, has quit his newspaper job after an argument with his editor about the state of modern journalism . In leaked pages from the forthcoming Superman issue, Clark Kent is getting an earful from Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White about not filing enough Superman stories. This in combination with pressures from the multimedia corporation Galaxy Broadcasting, which now owns The Daily Planet, leads to Clark Kent walking out on his job. ‘This is really what happens when a 27-year-old guy is behind a desk and he has to take instruction from a larger conglomerate with concerns that aren't really his own,’ Superman writer Scott Lobdell explains. ‘Superman is arguably the most powerful person on the planet, but how long can he sit at his desk with someone breathing down his neck and treating him like the least important person in the world?’ Loyal employee: Brandon Routh as Clark Kent in 2006 movie Superman Returns, carrying out his reporting duties for The Daily Planet where the fictional hero has been working since the 1940s . Mr Lobdell said he doubts Superman will be offering his journalistic services at another Metropolis publication, but delve into the world of online blogging and citizen journalism. ‘He is more likely to start the next Huffington Post or the next Drudge Report than he is to go find someone else to get assignments or draw a paycheck from,’ Lobdell added. The leaked pages from Wednesday's edition sees Superman's alter-ego having a discussion about the state of modern journalism with his editor Perry White and ex-wife Lois Lane, who is a producer for Galaxy Broadcasting. New story: The cover and a sneak-preview from the new issue of Superman which goes on sale tomorrow . Clark Kent says: ‘Why am I the only one who sounds like an ink-stained wretch who thinks news should be about, I don’t know, news?!’ His editor Perry White replies: ‘Go easy on us mortals, Clarke. Times are changing and print is a dying medium.' After his editor delivers a line about giving the reader what they want, Clarke turns on his heel and walks out of the Daily Planet. There was no immediate confirmation from Superman publisher DC Comics, itself part of the Time Warner multimedia empire, but Lobdell posted a link to the USA Today article on his Twitter account. This is reportedly not the first time Clark Kent has left his reporting job, when Galaxy Broadcasting bought The Daily Planet in 1971, he had a short stint as a broadcaster before going back to his Superman beat for the paper. The new plot twist is one of many to appear in Superman issue 13 which goes on sale tomorrow in both digital and hard-copy forms.","Clark Kent leaves reporter job in new edition of the popular comic book .

The family embarked on a massive fund-raising campaign to raise £400,000 for antibody treatment in the U.S., which gave Jamie 18 cancer-free months, during which time he started school. But in March last year, he relapsed. His family were told that the only treatment options open to him at Leeds General Infirmary were chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Doctors said that Jamie's chances of fighting off the cancer for a second time were slim because chemotherapy weakens the immune system, leaving it incapable of fighting the disease. Then Jamie's parents found out about a new treatment being trialled at the University of Tubingen, near Stuttgart, which involved stem cells from a healthy parent being injected into the patient to boost their immune system. So brave: Jamie endured round after round of hospital treatment in his fight to beat cancer . Brother and sister: Jamie and his younger sister, Poppy, while he was undergoing treatment . A mother's love: Vicky Inglis never stopped fighting for her adored son . Doctors there said the treatment might increase his survival chances by up to 75 per cent, but Jamie's local primary care trust wouldn't fund the treatment as it was still being trialled, so his  parents decided to embark on a second fund-raising effort. Mr Inglis, who was an environmental health technician with the Royal Medical Corps for 22 years before giving up his job to spend more time with his children, said: 'If it makes a difference to your child, it's your duty as a parent to do it.'

This image shows a mysterious dark cloud in distant space, which scientists from the European Space Organisation have decided looks just like a gecko. Taken by the Wide Field Imager at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile it shows the bright star cluster NGC 6520 and its neighbour, the dark cloud Barnard 86. The cosmic pair is set against millions of glowing stars from the brightest part of the Milky Way — a region so dense with stars that barely any dark sky is seen across the picture. The Gecko nebula: Astronomers at the European Space Organisation released this image of dark could Barnard 86 today. They have decided that it looks like a gecko . This part of the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer) is one of the richest star fields in the whole sky — the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud. The huge number of stars that light up this region dramatically emphasise the blackness of dark clouds like Barnard 86, which appears at the centre of this new picture, which was released today. This object - a small, isolated dark nebula known as a Bok globule - was described as 'a drop of ink on the luminous sky' by its discoverer Edward Emerson Barnard. Bok globules were first observed in the Forties by astronomer Bart Bok. They are very cold, dark clouds of gas and dust that often have new stars forming at their centres. These globules are rich in dust that scatters and absorbs background light, so they are almost opaque to visible light. In a paper published in 1947, Bok and E.F. Reilly hypothesised that these clouds were 'similar to insect's cocoons' that were undergoing gravitational collapse to form new stars. More recently near infrared observations confirmed that stars were being born inside them. They remain a subject of intense research. An exceptional visual observer and . keen astro-photographer, Barnard discovered and photographed numerous . comets, dark nebulae, one of Jupiter’s moons, and was the first to use . long-exposure photography to explore dark nebulae. Through a small telescope Barnard 86 looks like a dearth of stars, or a window onto a patch of distant, clearer sky. However, this object is actually in the foreground of the star field — a cold, dark, dense cloud made up of small dust grains that block starlight and make the region appear opaque. It is thought to have formed from the remnants of a molecular cloud that collapsed to form the nearby star cluster NGC 6520, seen just to the left of Barnard 86 in this image. NGC 6520 is an open star cluster that contains many hot stars that glow bright blue-white, a tell-tale sign of their youth. Open clusters usually contain a few thousand stars that all formed at the same time, giving them all the same age. Such clusters usually only live comparatively short lives, on the order of several hundred million years, before drifting apart. Judge for yourself: What a real gecko looks like . The incredible number of stars in this area of the sky muddles observations of this cluster, making it difficult to learn much about it. NGC 6520’s age is thought to be around 150 million years, and both this star cluster and its dusty neighbour are thought to lie at a distance of around 6000 light-years from our Sun. The stars that appear to be within Barnard 86 in the image above are in fact in front of it, lying between us and the dark cloud. Although it is not certain whether this is still happening within Barnard 86, many dark nebulae are known to have new stars forming in their centres  — as seen in the famous Horsehead Nebula, the striking object Lupus 3 and to a lesser extent in another of Barnard’s discoveries, the Pipe Nebula. However, the light from the youngest stars is blocked by the surrounding dusty regions, and they can only be seen in infrared or longer-wavelength light. As we gear up for the one day of the year dedicated to lovers, it seems that even the Universe has a romantic side. Planetary . nebula Sh2-174 gives the appearance of a red rose but is actually the . remains of a dying star some 1,000 light years away. Astronomers from the U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory released the image on the eve of Valentine's Day. Our love is in the stars: The rose-like planetary nebula Sh2-174 . A planetary nebula is created when a low-mass star blows off its outer layers at the end of its life. The core of the star remains and becomes an immensely dense white dwarf. Usually the white dwarf is found right at the heart of the nebula, but in the case of Sh2-174 it is shifted to one side. In the image, it is the blue star near the right hand edge of the nebula, where the gas turns from red to blue. The image was taken using the Mayall four-metre telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. Observations were made through four different colour filters.","Image was taken by ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile and released today .

If you thought the perfect holiday meant relaxing by the pool with a handsome man and the latest Hilary Mantel blockbuster, then think again. While the gorgeous likes of David Gandy are invited, high brow Mantel is not, researchers have found. Instead, the perfect holiday read is Fifty Shades of Grey, ideally perused during an 11 day trip in a sunny location five hours flight from the UK. Holiday heaven: The perfect break would include plenty of time on the beach and the chance to get a golden tan . Well read: The ideal holiday would also involve a copy of 50 Shades of Grey, as well as a hunky Christian Grey type like David Gandy in tow . The dream location also includes a 20 mile private transfer from the airport and direct access to the beach from the accommodation which boasts a private pool. But the ideal jaunt won't come cheap - with the average adult expecting to pay around £2,500 per head for the pleasure. Researchers polled 2,000 adults to uncover the elements that made up an indulgent annual break. Ordering room service, upgrading to first class and paying for a sunbed instead of lying on the sand were also declared elements of a perfect holiday. Two thirds of those polled said peace and quiet was the most important aspect of a dream break away. Sorry Easyjet! Budget travel doesn't feature on anyone's holiday wishlist . Sunshine, camera...pose! Striking a pose poolside also proved popular as did hiring a private butler . The Azores .

One of Greece's most unspoilt islands, Santorini is the most southerly member of the Cyclades island chain and benefits from year round sunshine, crystal clear water and spectacular white sand beaches. The Perivolas hotel, a luxury hotel that used to be a cave, should fit the bill for romantics. Flying time: 5h, 30 mins . Marrakesh, Morocco . Not only is the Moroccan city wonderfully warm all year round, it's the perfect spot for a little retail therapy.

'When we are used to such cold and miserable weather here it is understandable how we long for sun and a bit of luxury. 'We work very long hours so rest and relaxation combined with a touch of sight-seeing and shopping is the perfect way to spend a holiday."" The study also revealed the formula for a perfect break also includes the holiday being taken in July with the location being drenched in sunshine for nine hours a day. Perhaps unsurprisingly, eight out of ten Brits would want to go abroad for their perfect holiday, and flying first class would be a must. Ideally, once settled into the accommodation, the average holidaymaker would then love to spend at least three of the 11 days lounging by the pool. A further three days would be spent on the beach, soaking up the sun and occasionally participating in water-sports or swimming in the sea. Another day would be spent sightseeing and experiencing the local culture and tourist destinations. And a couple of days would be dedicated to shopping in the local markets and shopping malls. Travellers surveyed also said that they would need spending money of at least £834 and would particularly enjoy having a private butler at their beck and call. Other popular holiday extras include having a meal on the beach, a daily massage and regular sunrise yoga classes. Collett added: 'Flying first class really does seem the ultimate in luxury travel according to this poll. 'Many people may only dream of upgrading their flights but other things that people would want from a holiday are perfectly achievable. 'Depending on what country you are visiting, things like room upgrades, spa services and private transfers can be relatively affordable.

Oprah Winfrey is hoping her hotly anticipated confessional interview with Lance Armstrong will boost the lackluster ratings of her network, OWN. With the interview now spread over two nights and not one as originally planned, OWN is selling advertising space at premium prices and expects record viewing figures. Launched in 2011 to poor ratings, this interview marks a step up in Winfrey becoming more involved in programing such as the Armstrong interview which appears on her weekly 'Oprah's Next Chapter'. Scroll down for video . It has been reported that Oprah Winfrey is hoping the success of her interview with Lance Armstrong will lead to a rise in ratings at her OWN network . The network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc, expects to sell all of the remaining commercial time for the two-part version of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' OWN President Erik Logan said in an interview late on Tuesday. Both current and new sponsors have been calling to secure ad time during the telecast, which airs in primetime on Thursday and Friday, said Logan. 'We are seeing a great demand in the marketplace,' he said. Winfrey confirmed on Tuesday that Armstrong, who she interviewed on Monday, admitted to using banned performance-enhancing drugs during his professional cycling career that included seven Tour de France titles. The cyclist had vehemently denied doping for more than a decade. OWN planned to air one episode with Armstrong but expanded the program to two nights after the cyclist talked with Winfrey for more than two hours.

In 2012, OWN's primetime ratings rose 32 percent over the previous year among its target audience of women aged 25 to 54, according to data from the network. OWN averaged 147,000 viewers aged 25 to 54 during primetime in 2012, according to Nielsen data provided by Horizon Media. A chunk of ad time for the Armstrong interview was pre-sold to regular advertisers of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' a weekly show where she sits down with big-name stars and newsmakers such as reality TV's Kardashian family and rapper Usher. The remaining commercial time is being sold in the final days leading up to the telecasts in the 'scatter' market, which commands higher prices than the pre-sold rates. Thanks to growing interest in Armstrong's comments, OWN is securing a premium over the usual scatter rates for 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' Logan said. OWN planned to air one episode with Armstrong but expanded the program to two nights after the cyclist talked with Winfrey for more than two hours . 'We are seeing the premiums' on ad rates, he said, but declined to provide specific figures. The network is giving priority to advertisers who have bought time on the show in the past and those that will also commit to other shows, he said. Ongoing OWN sponsors include General Motors Co, Target Corp, and Kellogg Co . OWN scored some of its biggest audiences with Winfrey's celebrity interviews. Her March 2012 talk with Whitney Houston's daughter shortly after the singer's sudden death drew 3.5 million viewers. Singer Rihanna's appearance in August 2011 grabbed 2.5 million viewers.

He was also ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £2,000 in costs. The 25-year-old had faced up to three years in prison after being convicted for his part in a brawl at a petrol station in Guildford. The court heard during a nine-day trial how the pop star had sparked the fight after becoming angry when two teenage girls 'disrespected' him by refusing to get into his car to go to a party at his recording studios.

The rapper is comforted by a friend as he leaves court today having been spared an immediate jail sentence . Jailed: Dappy's co-defendants Alfred Miller, left, and Kieran Vassell, right, were sent to prison for 19 months and 14 months respectively . During the trial, Dappy's lawyer argued that Miss Cochran and Miss Burton were 'unreliable witnesses' as they had sent Twitter and BlackBerry (BBM) messages saying they intended to sell their stories to the national newspapers. Victim: David Jenkins told the court he suffered broken teeth after being punched during the fight . Miss Burton also sent a message saying that she could not remember what happened and that she would ""b*******' when she gave evidence. The court was told that Dappy had previous convictions for assault and possessing a bladed weapon. Paul Greaney, defending Dappy, said a prison term would bring an end to his career as a singer. He said: 'It is inevitable now that he will not be able to visit or work in America. 'Furthermore, as a result of the convictions, certain important radio stations will not play his records. 'His earning capacity now is extremely limited and those responsible for his management believe a period of custody will bring his career to an end.' He added: 'People depend on Mr . Contostavlos, I mention not only his family, his mother and brother and . his partner and children but a number of people who work for him. 'He . is terrified, in particular, not of what will happen to him but that he . will not be able to provide financially for his family and others. That . is a genuine concern he has expressed to me.' He . continued: 'These proceedings have had a quite massive impact on Mr .

Relieved: The singer broke down in tears and shouted 'Yes' as he found out he would not be jailed . Pleading: Dappy's lawyer said if he was jailed his career as a rapper would be over . Dappy, pictured left with his N-Dubz bandmates Tulisa and Fazer, said he has already been punished because he can't go to America to work due to his conviction . Praying as the verdict was announced, Dappy, wearing a white shirt and black tie, broke down in tears and shouted 'Yes' as Judge Neil Stewart announced that the prison term would be suspended. He was ordered to pay compensation of £2,000 to Mr Jenkins, £1,500 to Mr Gibson and £1,500 to Mr Billson and was also ordered to pay £2,000 towards court costs. Judge Stewart told Dappy he had spared him an immediate prison term because of his remorse at his actions. He said: 'The report I have on you suggests you do not present overtly criminal attitudes and this offence has been a wake-up call for you.' He added: 'Spitting at someone is a repulsive action and is more serious because you have done something similar in the past. 'Even on that aggravation, the offence would not be so serious as to merit a prison sentence. 'It is clear that this spitting triggered these events that culminated in the affray but was not part of the affray.' The judge added: 'The sentence I have decided on is not affected by any consideration of whether a person is well-known to the public.' Witnesses: The fight was sparked after Grace Cochran, right, and Serena Burton, left, refused Dappy's advances at a petrol station in Guildford . Brawl: The victims were left with facial injuries including missing teeth and a broken nose after the fight . Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, west London, was also found guilty at trial of affray and was jailed for 14 months, ordered to pay £1,500 compensation and £500 costs. Judge Stewart said his actions were so serious that they could only be punished by a prison sentence. The court heard that Vassell had several previous convictions for supplying class A drugs and was also jailed for nine months in 2010 for theft of a car and dangerous driving. Miller, 28, a songwriter, of Brentford, west London, pleaded guilty to affray and was sentenced to 19 months imprisonment and ordered to pay £4,500 compensation and £1,000 costs. Sentencing Miller, Judge Stewart said: 'You used the greatest violence in the incident. 'Nothing other than an immediate period of custody can be justified'. The court heard he had previous convictions for possessing an offensive weapon, burglary and racially aggravated harassment. A fourth defendant, Kalonji Stewart, 32, of Harborne, Birmingham, was found not guilty at the trial of affray. Speaking outside court Detective Constable Alex Boxall, of Surrey Police, said: 'I hope the sentencing today of Dino Costas Contostalvos demonstrates that he will be making amends in public for his actions nearly a year ago on the forecourt of a petrol station in Guildford which left three men suffering serious facial injuries. 'He is a popular rapper who commands a large following and as a high profile musician in the public eye, it is important that the public see that there are consequences for anyone who demonstrates this type of aggressive behaviour and the sentencing today follows a robust investigation to find those responsible and bring them to justice.' Nigel Knight from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'This case involved a violent attack on three young men on a night out, who were admirably attempting to protect two girls they had just met. 'Anyone in the situation these victims found themselves in would have feared for their own safety. Unable to defend themselves, they were left with numerous injuries as a result of a gratuitous attack.' Outside court Dappy, wearing a black and white baseball jacket, stopped to share a hug with tearful fans before he was driven away in a black BMW car with blackened windows. As he drove off, one girl screamed: 'I love you Dappy'.","Singer was spared jail after being convicted of assault and affray today .

Samsung, whose tablets use Google's Android software, has counter-sued Apple. Lee Seung-Woo,  an analyst at Shinyoung Securities in Seoul, said: 'There's no doubt the court decision will have an adverse effect on Samsung. 'Samsung is clashing with Apple in . many places, which could result in a temporary fall in sales and . increase costs related to litigation.'

Adam Howorth, a spokesman for Apple, said: 'It's . no coincidence that Samsung's latest products look a lot like the . iPhone and iPad, from the shape of the hardware to the user interface . and even the packaging. 'This kind of blatant copying is wrong, and we need to protect Apple's intellectual property when companies steal our ideas.'

Complicating things between Apple and Samsung is the pair's $5billion-plus commercial relationship, which some analysts think might be at risk. Samsung, for instance, counts Apple as its biggest customer, making chips and other parts central to Apple's mobile devices. The well-reviewed Galaxy Tab 10.1 was only recently launched in Europe and is in the early stages of being rolled out. For now, the iPad is the market leader. Competing products including Research In Motion's PlayBook and Motorola's Xoom have received lukewarm reviews, while Hewlett Packard's TouchPad is a late entrant in the market, which already has more than 100 devices, mostly running on Android. Meanwhile, a U.S. trade agency is also set to review Apple's patent-infringement complaint against Taiwanese phone market HTC Corp. The ban applies throughout the European Union, except the Netherlands, where a Hague-based court said separate hearings were scheduled for today and tomorrow. Apple would not say why it filed a separate case in the Netherlands. 'It's a strategy Apple has adopted to completely prevent Samsung from putting its tablet into the market place,' said Nathan Mattock, an intellectual property lawyer at Marque Lawyers in Sydney. Samsung's mobile unit, which includes handsets and tablet PCs, generated 30 per cent of the technology giant's revenue in the second quarter. The bulk of the rest comes from memory chips and televisions, sectors where Samsung is the global leader. Samsung, the world's biggest technology company by revenues, said it would challenge the court decision. In a statement, the firm said: 'The request for an injunction was filed with no notice to Samsung, and the order was issued without any hearing or presentation of evidence from Samsung.' 'I think we will be rigorously defending our position,' said Samsung executive Younghee Lee. Lee, who was unveiling the Galaxy Tab in India on Wednesday, said Samsung would launch the Tab in Australia in September. In a statement, Samsung Germany said it would file an objection immediately. 'Samsung will protect its intellectual property in Germany with legal measures. We will also actively continue to defend our rights worldwide.' Apple's move raises the stakes for . Google, which has accused its biggest rivals of banding together to . hamper its increasingly popular Android operating system, after it lost a . bid to buy thousands of patents from bankrupt Nortel. Without . patents, companies' devices are vulnerable to challenges for royalties . or, worse, demands from rivals to withdraw the products from the market . place. Samsung has been locked in a battle with Apple over smartphone and tablet patents since April. The Galaxy gadgets are seen as among the biggest challengers to Apple's mobile devices, which have achieved runaway success. In . Australia, Samsung has agreed to show Apple an Australian version of . the Galaxy Tab 10.1 one week before its launch there, a Samsung . spokesman said.","Temporary order applies to all of EU apart from the Netherlands, where a hearing is due to take place today ."
"By . Mario Ledwith . PUBLISHED: . 14:14 EST, 11 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:15 EST, 11 January 2013 . Addict: Imran Ahmed, 39, has been jailed for three years after stealing £100,000 from Audrey Green at a care home that he managed in Beeston, Nottingham . A prolific gambler stole more than £100,000 from an elderly resident at the care home he managed in order to fund his secret addiction. Imran Ahmed admitting stealing the money from an account belonging to 80-year-old Audrey Green, a resident at the Lilac House Care Home in Beeston, Nottingham. The 39-year-old used the money to fund 'a double life' of casinos and horse racing. The father-of-two, whose family owned the care home, was jailed for three years at Nottingham Crown Court. Over the course of five years, Ahmed siphoned over £100,000 from the resident's account without her knowledge. He . used the money to pay for his addiction, which his family was unaware . of, as he spun a web of lies to hide his financial affairs. Ahmed . was well thought of in the nursing profession, having obtained his . diploma in 1997, but he  began gambling at university and it had become . 'a pathological addiction'. He . made cash withdrawals from ATMs using Mrs Green’s debit card which was . kept, along with her personal identification number, in a safe at the . care home. Prosecutor Esther Harrison said Ahmed . would use the card to withdraw between £150 and £300 at a time, . sometimes taking out money more than once a day. Ahmed, who appeared in the dock wearing a grey wool jacket and white shirt, also stole the resident’s chequebook. Mrs Harrison told the court he stole £58,000 in cash and some £43,000 in cheques from Mrs Green’s account. The theft only came to light when the care home closed in 2011. Mrs Green was described as a 'vulnerable woman' who 'lacked confidence and was not financially aware'. Vulnerable: Ahmed stole the money using the woman's debit card and chequebook when she was staying at Lilac House Care Home in Beeston, Nottingham, which his family owned . The court heard how Ahmed was attracted by the thrill of the gambling lifestyle and being 'with the high rollers'. Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Those who take advantage of the elderly are the worst sort in my view.' Ahmed . looked down in the dock as Mr Stokes sentenced him to three years in . prison, of which he will serve half before being eligible for release. Mr . Stokes added: 'Audrey Green, who is now 80, was living at Lilac House. She was under your care and she was vulnerable. She had little financial . know how and I have no doubt she must have appeared to you an easy . target. Jailing Ahmed, the judge said his behaviour was as 'gross a breach of trust as it is possible to imagine'. He . said: 'Elderly vulnerable people are regrettably far too often the . target of fraudsmen and the court has got to make it plain that anyone . who takes part in this deliberate behaviour will be severely punished. 'You . had an extensive and long-standing gambling addiction which a report . tells me has been the driver of your offending. Doubtless it was but . that in reality it amounts to little in mitigation.' Defending Ahmed, Mr Philip Bown said: . 'This was a man being driven to distraction by the pathological . addiction to gambling. It was running his life. Addict: Imran Ahmed, 39, has been jailed for three years after stealing £100,000 from Audrey Green at a care home that he managed in Beeston, Nottingham . He said his client was full of remorse and that gambling now 'sickens' his client. Ahmed apologised to Mrs Green’s family in the dock before he was convicted. He said: 'I want to publicly apologise to Mrs Green and her friends for the pain and hardship that I have caused them.' The Nursing and Midwifery Council has been made aware of the proceedings, the court heard. Mr Stokes said Ahmed would never work in the care profession again. Th crime came to light when the home announced its closure and friends of Mrs Green were told there was insufficient funds to pay for her care. Janet and Paul Boothroyd, of Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, looked at Mrs Green’s bank statements and noticed the money had been taken from her account. The couple, who have known Mrs Green for 15 years contacted Barclays bank and Social Services who launched an investigation and urged them to alert the police. Speaking after the sentencing today, Mrs Boothroyd said: 'It’s been a two-year struggle to get it here for her and I’m a bit disappointed with three years.' 'Whether he stole the money for gambling or whatever it doesn’t matter. The fact of the matter remains that he stole money from a vulnerable, old woman. She went into the home just before her husband’s death five or six years ago. I think they’d been married for some 25 years.' Mrs Boothroyd said Barclays had been very understanding and had returned £96,000 to Mrs Green.","Imran Ahmed, 39, stole the huge sum from 80-year-old Audrey Green .

In court: Former fugitive Asil Nadir arriving at the Old Bailey where he denied stealing £150m from his empire . Polly Peck Tycoon Asil Nadir claimed . he fled Britain because he had been left 'a broken man with no hope of a . fair trial' after police launched an investigation into allegations he . had bribed a judge. The revelation came to light as he . took the stand for the first time in his long-running theft trial in . which he is accused of plundering £150 million from his company. Today it also emerged at the Old . Bailey that Turkey asked Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative . government to intervene to save Nadir’s business empire as it crumbled . around him. Turkish president Turgut Ozal wrote to . the then PM expressing his concerns that the multinational was being . undermined by Greek Cypriots to damage the northern Cypriot economy and . ultimately Turkey itself. In the letter sent on Mr Nadir’s . behalf in September 1990, the late President expressed his concerns as . Polly Peck employed thousands of people in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. Poly Peck’s (PPI) collapse would . hinder the finding of a lasting solution to the Cyprus question as both . sides needed economies on a parity with each other, the court heard. The Turkish finance minister Gunes . Taner then wrote 16 days later to then Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd . asking for more time to examine what support the Turkish government . could provide to PPI. However Asil Nadir, 71, giving . evidence at his trial, said weeks later Mr Hurd issued an 'ultimatum' on . a Saturday afternoon in that if £100million was not forthcoming by . Monday noon 'everything was over'. Nadir told the court: 'There was an ultimatum to Turgut Ozal. It was a message from Douglas Hurd. It was a Saturday. 'The ultimatum was: ""If by Monday noon we don’t have the £100million here, then everything is over"".' The disgraced tycoon told the Old . Bailey yesterday that he was on the verge of saving his £2billion firm . after securing £70million in loans from Turkish banks and cash from his . own family. Turkey wrote to then PM Margaret Thatcher, left, for help in securing Polly Peck's future, but days later her Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, right, issued an ultimatum demanding £100million in financing for the company, the court heard . Speaking for the first time since he . returned to Britain in August 2010 to face trial, Nadir said the . decision to place his company in administration was taken as he was . flying back to Britain from Turkey before he managed to tell the board . about the cash injection. He boasted of Polly Peck: 'Towards the middle of 1990, it was one of the best-performing companies in the world.' Nadir claimed the firm was not . insolvent when it folded, saying: ‘I think it had a tremendous future . and this attitude was shared by the top brokers and investors in this . country and worldwide. Finance was available from Turkey.’ Following the collapse of the . conglomerate in 1990 with debts of £550million, Nadir fled in a private . plane as he faced trial for theft. He said his health was left 'in . tatters' after his offices were raided, his papers seized and mail . tampered with with following the claim that he had tried to bribe a . judge in his trial. 'I was a totally broken man. My health . was in tatters, my hope of a fair trial was in tatters, I had zero hope . of receiving a fair trial.' He added: 'It was a frightening . situation. I still remember the concerns and the fear the lordship . [Justice Tucker] had in his face. 'I had laid all my hopes on getting an . independent trial but was very worried i would not. The judge's . expression was not one that one wants to see.' The corruption charges were later dropped. Support: Asil Nadir, 71, and his 28-year-old second wife Nur, who watched from the back of the court. Nadir was giving evidence five months after the trial began . The tycoon spent nearly two decades in . his native northern Cyprus after allegedly stealing millions to splash . out on Mayfair mansions, country estates, antiques, race horses, fast . cars and gifts for his family. But yesterday Nadir insisted that he . was ‘not guilty’, suggesting the cash was sent to a subsidiary company . in northern Cyprus to get better exchange rates when making new . investments abroad. He claimed he had been the victim of . injustice and said he had ‘zero chance of a fair trial’ after being . accused of bribing a High Court judge who was to oversee his trial back . in 1993. An inquiry was launched into claims . that there had been attempts to bribe Mr Justice Tucker, jurors heard. But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was no credible evidence . to support the allegations. Speaking haltingly, Nadir was watched . closely by his glamorous second wife Nur, 28, yesterday as he told how . his health was wrecked after being sued by the administrators of Polly . Peck, made bankrupt and put on trial. ‘I was a totally broken man. My health . was in tatters, my hope of a fair trial was in tatters, I had zero hope . of receiving a fair trial. ‘I could drop dead at any minute,’ he said. In a raid by bankruptcy officials in April 1993, all his papers including his defence papers were seized. Two weeks later Nadir left Britain on . May 4. He is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to . £33million and $2.5million. But Prosecutor Philip Shears, QC has . told the jury the ‘much bigger picture’ is that he stole £150million . from the major international conglomerate which had over 200 . subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure. Nadir, of Belgravia, central London, denies theft. The trial continues.

The playable doodle, which involves driving an ice-cleaning machine after a number of animated skaters depart from a rink, is inspired by the Zamboni ice resurfacer itself. The Italian-American trademarked his machine in his own name. Born in 1901 to Italian immigrants in Utah, the family later moved to Los Angeles, where Frank Zamboni ran an auto repair shop with his older brother and later opened an electrical supply business with a younger brother. In 1927, the two younger brothers entered the block ice business after opening an ice-making plant, which they used to open an ice rink shortly before America's entry into the second world war. Zamboni found a way of preventing rippling on the rink's surface as a result of the pipes put down to keep the rink frozen, an idea which he patented in 1946. Google's playable game lets people chase skaters to smooth the ice they rough up . However, his real breakthrough came . in 1949 when he produced a machine that turned the job of resurfacing . the rink into a one man job that could be done in 10 minutes. Previously, it had taken three men, working for 90 minutes. He died from cancer in 1988 at the age of 87.

Repeat offender John Moir, 46 has been jailed for ten months after being caught driving while banned . A serial criminal who has been banned from the road for the 43rd time told police that going back to jail would not stop him driving again. John Moir, 46, has been jailed for ten months after boasting to officers who arrested him that he was playing a 'game of cat and mouse' with them. He has been convicted of 218 separate offences, one of which involved him ploughing into a pedestrian who nearly died of his injuries. In the latest case, South East . Suffolk magistrates' court in Ipswich heard Moir was pulled up by police . last Wednesday for driving while banned. The court heard that when he was questioned about the offence, an unrepentant Moir told officers: 'It's a game of cat and mouse. 'I never admit anything, this isn't going to stop me driving. Going to prison won't stop me.' Emma Howson, prosecuting, said that Moir, who has 52 previous convictions, was caught driving a silver Vauxhall Tigra in Woodbridge, Suffolk, at 4pm last Wednesday. Police found the motor belonged to his partner and arrested him.  In court Moir, of Ipswich, Suffolk,  also admitted two thefts from vehicles in car parks over Christmas. Moir had piled up 42 previous convictions for driving while disqualified and had 77 thefts on his criminal record, the court heard. His last conviction was on August 13, 2012, for driving while banned, resisting a police officer and having no car insurance, for which he was jailed for five months. 'I believe he will kill someone eventually': Simon Jacobs, 45, nearly died after Moir drove into him in 2010 . Moir admitted driving while banned, having no insurance, and two charges of theft. He received a four-month jail sentence for driving while disqualified, and three months for each theft to run consecutively. Moir was also given a 12-month driving ban to replace a two-year disqualification he was given on September 6, 2011. If he wants to apply for a new licence after his ban expires he will have to take an extended driving re-test before he is legally allowed to drive a vehicle. Father-of-two Simon Jacobs, 45, was left . in a coma and doctors believed he would die after Moir hit him after . jumping a red light in Ipswich in August 2010. Moir served just nine months in prison after he was eventually captured following the incident in which he nearly killed Mr Jacobs. Today Mr Jacobs, who had been walking home from a snooker hall when he was hit, warned: 'I believe . it is only a matter of time before he kills someone. Moir was driving his girlfriend's silver Vauxhall Tigra when he was stopped by police officers (file picture) Hearing: South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court in Ipswich was told how Moir taunted officers who questioned him . 'I was lucky, but next time things could be very different.' The former electrician will never work again after sustaining terrible head injuries, and can no longer drive. He added: 'He has left me with a life sentence - I will never get over my injuries. 'When he ran into me he got 18 months, but only served half.  The next time it was 14 months and now 10. 'It is an insult.  I believe it is only a matter of time before he kills someone. 'I was lucky but next time things could be very different.  I just find it ludicrous, it is laughable.  The justice system needs to listen up, they are playing a waiting game - eventually I believe he will kill someone.' There are several contenders for the title of Britain's worst driver. In 2008 Jamie Manderson of Swindon was jailed for eight months and banned from driving for five years after being caught driving while banned - for the 51st time. He was first banned from driving at the age 15, and never held a driving licence. Manderson, then 35, was told in court: 'This is the worst case of driving while disqualified - in total - we have come across.' Also in 2008 Anthony Marland, then 39, of Ashton under Lyne, was convicted of driving while disqualified for the 54th time, and was told by a judge: 'This is one of the worst records of driving I have ever seen.' In 2010 Wayne Atkinson, then 38, from Bristol, was banned from driving for two years after being caught driving at 70mph in a 30mph zone, on the wrong side of the street and through red lights. Atkinson, who had never held a licence since his first disqualification in 1993, walked free from court despite the judge describing his record as 'appalling'.","John Moir, 46, of Ipswich, Suffolk, was caught driving while banned - again .

A group of six Asian men - including two sets of brothers - have been charged by police in connection with allegedly running the sex trafficking ring in the university city known for its dreaming spires. Since the initial dawn raids last month, officers had made a further two arrests as part of the probe, a police spokesman said. A 39-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman were detained on suspicion of 'grooming' this week. Ready . to move in: Police vans lined up ahead of Operation Bullfinch, . which investigated the alleged sexual exploitation of girls . The man has been freed on police bail to return to a police station in May, pending further inquiries and the woman was released without charge. Police arrested 13 men in raids across Oxford on Thursday, March 22, after investigating the suspected ring since May last year. Six men were charged and appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting at Amersham on Friday, March 30, for a preliminary hearing and were all remanded in custody. Father of two Kamar Jamil, aged 26 years, of Summertown, Oxford, who is charged with four counts of rape, two . counts of arranging the prostitution of a child, one count of making a . threat to kill and one count of possession with intent to supply class A . drugs, has since been granted conditional bail by the court. Seven men returned to a police station to answer bail on Thursday and had their bail extended for a further eight weeks. The men all made their first appearances in connection with the abuse ring at High Wycombe Magistrates Court . High Wycombe Magistrates Court heard during . the first hearing last month how the accused men are believed to have . groomed 24 girls for sex between May 2004 and March, this year.

An amateur art-lover stands to earn up to £35million after unearthing the missing head that goes with a woman’s naked body in a notorious 19th century painting. Gustave Courbet’s The Origin Of The World, displayed in one of Paris’s most prestigious museums, the Musee d’Orsay, depicts female genitalia. Until now it has only showed the body but experts believe the missing head has been uncovered after the anonymous art buff bought it for just £1,200 at a furniture shop. Scroll down for video . The missing head was discovered among bric-a-brac and furniture and bought for just £1,000 but is now believed to be worth £35million . Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fermier verified the painting and said 'The Origin Of The World finally has a face' Gustave Courbet led the French Realist movement of the 19th Century . He is said to have knocked down the asking price by a sixth. French magazine Paris Match revealed yesterday that the collector made the accidental discovery of the head while looking through bric-a-brac back in 2010. But the magazine says the authenticity of . the 1866 painting, showing a brunette with a wistful upwards gaze, was . confirmed in exhaustive chemical and spectographic tests. Jean Jacque Fernier, author of a catalogue of Courbet's work, told Paris Match: 'The Origin Of The World finally has a face'. He said the work is one of the 'most daring in the history of painting'. The Origin Of The World is regarded as a masterpiece by some, vulgar or even pornographic by others. It has long been thought Courbet wished to preserve, to that extent at least, the modesty of his subject and Irish lover Joanna Hiffernan. The discovery is now the talk of the art . world and prompted the French TV channel TF1 to declare yesterday: 'At . last Courbet’s painting has a face.' Jean-Jacques Fernier, author of the . recognised Courbet catalogue and one of the world’s leading experts on . the painter, told Paris Match the tests were conclusive. He described it as a 'highly important' find. Authenticity was scientifically . established using state-of-the-art techniques that matched the two parts . of the painting, its canvas and the original wooden frame. Mr Fernier also compared the length of brushstrokes and studied a sketch of the complete work. The painting depicts female genitalia and was deemed so scandalous that it was not displayed until 1988 . The Origin Of The World is displayed in the Musee d'Orsay, Paris . The art buff who found the painting is said to want to re-attach head to body a century and a half after the woman was painted. Courbet, from an affluent farming family in eastern France, influenced many other artists, from Claude Monet to Paul Cezanne, but scandalised Paris with some of his work. One painting, Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine (Summer), depicted two prostitutes under a tree. The Origin Of The World was considered so daring that it was not displayed until 1988. He was imprisoned in 1871 for his role in inciting the revolutionary Paris Commune’s dismantling of a prominent column that was the centerpiece of the Place Vendome, but continued to paint during his detention. He died six years later in Switzerland, aged 58, from liver disease associated with heavy drinking. Jo la Belle Irlandaise, painted in 1865 of Irishwoman Joanna Hiffernan, hangs in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art . Gustave Courbet is heralded as artist who led the 19th century Realist movement and influenced greats such as Claude Monet. His work is displayed at some of the most prestigious galleries in the world, including the Musee d'Orsay, in Paris and Metropolitan Museum of Art. Born to a wealthy farming family in 1819, Courbet learned to draw by using his sister's as subjects before moving to Paris in 1839. There he developed his own style by observing the reality around him. After winning national plaudits for his work such as After Dinner at Omans and Stone-Breakers, he gained notoriety for his detailed depictions of female genitalia in The Origin of the World. It was deemed so scandalous that it was not publically displayed until 1988. Scandal also followed other paintings such as Young Ladies on the Banks of the Seine, which showed two prostitutes, and Sleep, which depicts two nude women in bed. He was an established artists in France but in 1871 he was jailed for his part in inciting the Paris Commune's dismantling of the Vendome Column. He spent six months in prison and was fined 500 francs. Courbet died in 1877, aged 58, in Switzerland.","Art collector discovered it among furniture and bric-a-brac .

A British soldier killed in Cyprus was targeted by a gang of thugs high on drugs and carrying flick-knives who had a ‘score to settle’, a court heard yesterday. Private David Lee Collins, 18, was allegedly stabbed through the heart by Mohamed Abdulkadir Osman when the pair met in a nightclub following an earlier row sparked by North-South rivalry. The fight between the trio and the soldier had begun earlier in the day when Private Collins, from Manchester, taunted Londoner Osman about his home region. Accused: L-R; Tukki Abbas Shah and Umar Anwar, both 17, and Mohammed Adulkadir Osman, 19, all British tourists from London are escorted into a court in the town . of Paralimni in Cyprus yesterdau . Osman told detectives that he was . holding the weapon that killed the off-duty soldier in the early hours . of Sunday but claimed he was acting in self-defence. Today, his parents Lee Collins, 41 and Lisa Minott, 37, paid an emotional tribute read out by uncle Winston Riley at the Fusilier Museum in Bury. The family said: 'David was an amazing 18-year-old soldier with his whole life ahead of him. The Army was his number one priority in life and he proved to everyone that he could achieve this from a very young age. 'David always thought about everyone else before himself. We are all extremely proud of our little soldier and we are all shattered by our tragic loss. 'We are so happy that David was with his friends and colleagues at the Fusiliers at a memorable time of his life. We just hope that justice can do its course in Cyprus.' David joined the Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force as a 12-year-old, and his family said he had 'always dreamed of serving his country'. Fellow soldiers from the 2nd Battalion joined the family in paying tribute to 'a true fusilier'. Tragic: Mr Collins was stabbed to death at an Ayia Napa nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning . Yesterday Cypriot police re-arrested . the 19-year-old and friends Tukki Abbas Shah, 17, and Umar Anwar, 17, . all from London, on suspicion of premeditated murder. Osman, who is of Somali origin, is . alleged to have confessed to possession of high-strength cannabis and . buying 11 flick-knives and two brass knuckle dusters in the popular . holiday resort of Ayia Napa. However, he has claimed he was intending to take them back to London for friends. He admitted there had been a previous . altercation between the off-duty soldiers and the trio before the fatal . fight in the Black ’N’ White nightclub. But Osman maintained that Mr Collins, . from Manchester, had ‘jumped on to the blade’ which he had drawn in an . attempt to ‘scare off’ the soldier, who was enjoying a last night out . before being sent to Afghanistan. Famagusta District Court heard the . police claim that three British passport holders had ‘a score to settle’ with Mr Collins and his comrades after an angry exchange in a pub in . Ayia Napa Square, which was supposed to be out of bounds for British . service personnel. Cypriot newspaper Phileleftheros . claimed that the exchange was ‘racist’, while another, Simerini, said it . was the culmination of a petty argument. Detectives are analysing CCTV footage of the area. Lieutenant Stelios Christodoulou told the court: ‘They had a score to settle. ‘We are investigating whether the . argument was about their different backgrounds, or whether they had met . their victims before in England. ‘The fact that they took knives with them when they went out was suspicious.’ Police found two flick-knives – one . with blood on the blade – outside the club following the fatal attack, . the court heard. Lieutenant Christodoulou added that Shah – who, like . Anwar, is of Pakistani origin – was seen dropping items shortly . afterwards at the spot where the knives were later discovered. Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub . Osman, who had a bandage around his . right hand and a bruised right eye, told police that he did not mean to . hurt the soldier and was sorry for what happened. The accused had arrived on the popular holiday island just three days before the alleged murder  last Thursday. They were staying at the five-star . Adams Beach Hotel in Ayia Napa. Police found the butts of three . cannabis joints in an ashtray on the balcony and a sizeable quantity of . the drug in the room along with the weapons. Osman admitted he had . bought the weapons at a shop in the resort. Yesterday the suspects arrived at the . tiny Famagusta court in handcuffs. Shah and Osman covered their faces . while Anwar looked up at two English-speaking women of Asian appearance – . believed  to be family members – who had been waiting outside the court . for several hours. The Britons have not been formally . charged with the alleged murder but were remanded in police custody for a . further eight days while detectives investigate the incident. If charged they will stand trial in front of a judge without a jury. A murder conviction in Cyprus carries a life sentence. Mr Collins, of the 2nd Battalion, . Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, died from a ‘ruptured heart caused by a . sharp instrument’, according to a post-mortem examination carried out . yesterday. The fusilier was stationed at the . British Army base at Dhekelia but was set to fly to Afghanistan early on . Monday to take part in combat readiness training. The soldier’s family have said that they have been ‘devastated’ by his death. A Foreign Office spokesman said . yesterday: ‘We are aware of the arrest of three British nationals in . Ayia Napa and we are providing consular assistance.’ The centre of Ayia Napa was declared . off limits to soldiers after the rape and murder of Danish tour guide .

Mike Glover, regimental secretary of the Fusiliers, said: 'David was at the heart of the fusilier family. He was a fusilier cadet where his enthusiasm and leadership qualities marked him out as a fusilier serving in the 2nd Battalion. 'His commanding officer Lieutenant General Mike Butterwick has said that Fusilier Collins was a true fusilier, honest, hard-working and utterly loyal. 'He wore his beret with pride and soldiering was his life. On behalf of all fusiliers we mourn the loss of one of our own.' David was a former pupil at St Anthony's Catholic College in Urmston. A college spokesman said: 'The community at St Antony's College are devastated to hear of David's untimely death. During his time here he developed into a thoroughly well-mannered pupil.

The German Taliban member lost his ardour when other European terrorists were killed by Pakistan's miltary . A former neo-Nazi who joined the Taliban and attacked an American base near the Afghan-Pakistan border has told a German court that he made a 'terrible mistake'. The German man, who was only named as Thomas U, spoke of his regret over signing up for the German Taliban Mujahidin (DTM) and travelling with his wife to the war-torn Afgfhan-Pakistan border to become a terrorist, according to The Times. His catalogue of complaints over his poorly thought-out decision included his fellow combatants' drug habits, a lack of hygiene, contracting hepititis A and his friends being horribly killed by Pakistani forces helicopters. His wife also missed creature comforts such as shopping at the supermarket and her mobile phone. The couple escaped to Istanbul, Turkey, in 2010 after his wife became pregnant and were immediately arrested. She gave birth in a Turkish prison. Thomas U, 27, is accused of being a member of the DTM from December 2009 until July 10 and taking part in an attack on an American base. He paid 5000 euros to travel to the Afghan-Pakistan border in 2009 and was trained in the use of firearms and explosives. He even appeared in a Taliban propaganda video and boasted that the attack had 'disrupted the Christmas spirit' of the American base. But in April 2010 DTM's German co-founder Eric Breininger and a Dutch national only named as Danny R were killed in an attack by Pakistani forces and the failed terrorist became disillusioned with violence and came to regret his choices. The 1.87 metre-tall man weighed only 53kg after contracting hepatitis A and he was anxious about his wife's unborn child. In a court statement he said: 'It was a terrible experience. I was shocked at the lack of hygiene, people were spitting and vomiting. 'My wife was very unhappy because traditionally women are treated badly.' After the couple escaped, he spoke of his relief at escaping the hellish conditions he had endured. 'Finally I could hold hands with my wife in public,' he said.

Treatment: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez battles lung infection in Cuba hospital (file photo) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is suffering from 'complications' brought on by a 'severe lung infection' which developed after surgery, according to officials. Mr Chavez, 58, had his fourth operation for cancer in Cuba on 11 December and then developed a respiratory infection. The statement pointed to a deepening crisis for the ailing president, who hasn't been seen or heard from since his operation last month. 'Chavez has faced complications as a result of a severe respiratory infection. This infection has led to respiratory deficiency that requires Commander Chavez to remain in strict compliance with his medical treatment,' Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said Thursday night, reading the statement on television. The statement raised the possibility that Chavez might be breathing with the assistance of a machine. But the government did not address that question and didn't give details of the president's treatment. Concerns: With rumors swirling that Chavez, left, had taken a turn for the worse, Venezuela's Vice President Nicolas Maduro, right, said the ailing president's condition remains 'delicate' three weeks after his cancer surgery . The government expressed confidence in Chavez's medical team and condemned what it called a 'campaign of psychological warfare' in the international media regarding the president's condition. Following news that Hugo Chavez's cancer had returned in December, the president officially named Vice President Nicolas Maduro as his successor. Maduro has been an . active member of the country's government since Chavez assumed power in . 1998. The 50-year-old Maduro has been close friends with Chavez since the 1980s. He got into politics as a teenager, joining the Socialist League, which sent him to Cuba for training in union organising. He then became a union organiser in the Caracas Metro system, for which he served as a bus driver. Maduro . worked as a coordinator during Chavez's first presidential election and . later became a congressman and president of the assembly until 2006. As . vice president, Maduro has been key in designing the country's radical . anti-imperialist policy. He has worked to grow Venezuela's relationship . with Iran, Russia and China. Officials have urged Venezuelans not to heed rumors about Chavez's condition. In its latest statement, the government didn't point to any particular rumors but said 'this campaign aims ultimately to destabilize the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ... and end the Bolivarian Revolution led by Chavez.' Venezuela's opposition has demanded that the government provide more specific information about Chavez's condition. Chavez has undergone four cancer-related surgeries since June 2011 for an undisclosed type of pelvic cancer. He also has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He was re-elected in October to another six-year term, and two months later announced that the cancer had come back. This week, the president’s elder brother Adan joined a parade of visitors who saw Chavez in Havana, and then returned to Caracas. The Venezuelan Constitution says the presidential oath should be taken January 10 before the National Assembly, and officials have raised the possibility that Chavez might not be well enough to do that, without saying what will happen if he can’t. Hope: A supporter of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez holds a picture of him, as she attends to a ceremony in Caracas on New Year's Eve .

The world's only known jihadist rapper who uses out-of-tune hip-hop to drum up support for his holy war has been added to the FBI's Most Wanted List. U.S.-born Omar Shafik Hammami is thought to be a senior leader with al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda affiliated group in Somalia which was placed on the U.S. State Department's terror blacklist in 2008. Also known as Abu Mansour al-Amriki or 'the American', Hammami has been releasing rap songs in English on the internet since 2009 even though music is forbidden in Al-Qaeda's strict interpretation of Islam. Scroll down for videos of his rap songs . Singing 'sucks' : Omar Shafik Hammami (pictured) who has released a number of hip-hop tunes on the internet to drum support for his jihad has been added to the FBI's most wanted list . In two songs entitled Send Me A Cruise (Missile) and Make Jihad With Me, he taunts the West in a toneless drone and calls on other young Americans like him to join him on his mission. In Make Jihad with Me, his singing style is described by ABCNews as a 'deep Barry White growl'. Others have been even less complimentary, saying his a cappella tunes 'suck'. In the songs, Hammami says he hopes to be killed by a drone strike or in a cruise missile attack so he can achieve martyrdom. He invites young people to join the jihad to 'wipe Israel off the globe' and encourages strikes against the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Somalia. The 28-year-old, who has been indicted in the United States on various terrorism charges, has been the subject of an international arrest warrant since 2007.

He was pulled into the terror network after marrying a Somalian-Canadian woman and later being 'brainwashed' on internet forums. He moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America, Daniel Maldanado, who paved the road to Somalia for him. However, his wife and the mother of his daughter refused to follow him and asked for a divorce. Earlier . this year, he was rumoured to have been beheaded, but a month later he . released his autobiography The Story of an American Jihaadi, which . critics said contained odd spelling and banal observations.

Al-Shabaab carried out its first international attack in July 2010 in Uganda, killing 76 people watching the World Cup final in two bomb explosions. The group has 'repeatedly threatened terrorist actions against America and American interests,' the Federal Bureau of Investigations said in a statement last week. Also added to the terror most wanted list was Filipino Raddulan Sahiron, wanted for his alleged role in the kidnapping of an American in the Philippines in 1993 by the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group Abu Sayyaf. Sahiron is believed to be the leader of the group, which was put on the US terror blacklist in 1997, the FBI said. The Abu Sayyaf was set up in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, according to the Philippine military, and has been blamed for that nation's worst terrorist attacks. These include the bombing of a passenger ferry in Manila Bay that killed over 100 people in 2004, as well as many kidnappings of foreigners and Filipinos in the Muslim-populated south of the country where it is based. The State Department's Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to $1million for information leading to the arrest of Sahiron, who is believed to be in the Sulu archipelago.","Omar Hammami, 28, is 'senior leader' with Somali terror group al-Shabaab .

In 2007 baby Suraya Brown was born weighing less than a bag of sugar and measuring just six inches long. Then, doctors had no idea why this chubby, healthy-looking baby was so small. Now, five years on, they have finally diagnosed Suraya with a rare type of primordial dwarfism that is known to affect only three other families in the world. Today, Suraya's mother Atlanta Dujmovic revealed the struggle she and her husband went through before getting the diagnosis - and their hopes that Suraya can live a life that is as normal as possible. Scroll down for video . Atlanta Dujmovic with daughter Suraya, who has primordial dwarfism. Her mother said on This Morning that at five years old, her daughter is still wearing the clothes of a six-month-old baby . Mrs Dujmovic, from Hayes, Middlesex, who has one other daughter who is older than Suraya, said that when she fell pregnant with Suraya in 2007, everything seemed normal at first. Then, at the six month mark, doctors noticed the baby's measurements seemed small for dates, but were not inordinately concerned. 'The pregnancy seemed fine, apart from a few small things,' Mrs Dujmovic told Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on the ITV show this morning. 'At six months, the midwife said, ""you are quite small."" I started going to the hospital weekly to have scans and be monitored. Doctors there told me the baby was small, but never said where she was on the scale of how babies should be.' At first, Mrs Dujmovic's doctors and midwife were not overly worried, and suggested that a better diet and some treatment after birth might be enough to boost the baby's weight. 'We were under the impression it was malnutrition, because the placenta wasn't working well,' she said. 'One week it would be fine, the next week not. I thought I needed to eat more, and steroids after birth would help her along. 'I was told she might need postnatal care when she was born to plump her up.' But when Suraya was born, doctors were unprepared for what they would find. 'The doctors were expecting skin and bones, Mrs Dujmovic says. 'But she was extremely small, but chubby. It was not what they were prepared for at all.' The family are incredibly close, and the girls, who go to the same school, say they get on very well . For five hours Mrs Dujmovic and her husband were unable to see Suraya, who was immediately taken away by doctors for tests. Feeding was difficult, and Mrs Dujmovic was unable to breastfeed her daughter as the little girl had to be tube-fed. 'Everything that went down, even by tube, would come back up,' she says. 'Her dad was the rock. He took it all in his stride,' she says. 'I was all over the place. We hadn't experienced anything like this before. You are in quite a lot of shock. 'The doctors aren't giving you any answers. 'They didn't even know themselves until recently.' Mrs Dujmovic said Suraya - who was a 'diva' at nursery, loves going to school and is very happy there . Suraya spent one entire year in hospital before she was allowed to come home for the first time. 'She had a year of hospitalisation, she had X-rays, blood tests - but no one had any clue as to why she is the way she is. But . it was when she came home after her first birthday that the family . realised that although their little girl was tiny, she must not be . underestimated. 'She had . this extraordinary fighting spirit.' Mrs Dujmovic said. 'She went on to . shock the doctors. Her father wanted her to be fed properly - not to be . fed with a tube any more. 'I was not handling it well for the first two years, but he kept pushing. 'He wanted to know, ""what's wrong with her throat? Is there anything actually wrong?"" 'When the doctors told him no, he said, ""bring me a jar of baby food"", and he started feeding her. 'He helped her sit up, he supported her spine, helped her strengthen her neck. 'He walked her around the living room,' she says. The family found that when it came to schooling, they had to push for Suraya to be accepted at a regular school. 'We were given a thick pile of papers to find her a special school, but there isn't a school for people like her. She's small, but her brains are quite advanced. 'She has remarkable spirit, and we wanted her to go to a regular school - but we had to push for it. Mrs Dujmovic revealed she had to stay up until 2am the night before Suraya's first day, making her a small school uniform after struggling to find support from the school suppliers who she says said they would help but didn't. 'The school said she should just come in her normal clothes, but we didn't want that. I wanted to make it as normal as possible for her. Primordial dwarfism is a very rare form of dwarfism that results in a smaller body size in all stages of life beginning from before birth. It is in the profoundly proportionate category of dwarfism, meaning that individuals are extremely small for their age even as a foetus. The condition frequently remains undiagnosed until between three and five years of age. 'She's different enough already, why make her stand out more? Now Suraya has settled in and is loving school, Mrs Dujmovic says. 'At nursery she was the diva, but school has tamed her,' she adds. After five years of not knowing what condition Suraya had, the little girl was finally diagnosed last week. 'In August, doctors said they may have found something, but they weren't 100 per cent sure. 'Then last week, we got the final conformation that it is  a type of primordial dwarfism. It is very, very rare - only four known families are affected by it. 'Has it helped to know? You're relieved to know there is a name for it,' she says. 'You're researching everything, coming across things. The doctors said it could be something even they don't know about.' 'To know there are at least three other people with it, that we can find out what her life might be like, that really helps.

A secret US government communication concludes that the Syrian army more than likely used chemical weapons during an attack in the city of Homs last month. The document, leaked to The Cable, reveals the finding of an investigation by Scott Frederic Kilner, the U.S. consul general in Istanbul, into accusations that the Syrian army used chemical weapons in the December 23 attack. An Obama administration official who had . access to the document was reported as saying: 'We can't definitely say . 100 per cent, but Syrian contacts made a compelling case that Agent 15 . was used in Homs on Dec. 23.' The Syrian city of Homs has seen some of the worst fighting in Syria, with a US cable now suggesting it came under chemical attack by Assad forces on December 23 . Chemical weapon known as Agent 15 was suspected to have been used in the attack on Homs . Developed in the 1960s by the U.S., Agent-15, or  3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate, is one of the most hallucinogenic chemical warfare compounds ever developed. An odourless, colourless incapacitating agent it can be absorbed into the central nervous system through respiration, ingestion, or through skin contact. Exposure to just 6.2 micrograms per kilogram of body mass is enough to incapacitate half of the number of people exposed to it. Mr Kilner's investigation included interviews . with civilians, doctors, and rebels present during the attack, as well . as the former general and head of the Syrian WMD program, Mustafa . al-Sheikh. Dr. Nashwan Abu Abdo, a neurologist in . Homs, is certain chemical weapons were used. He told The Cable: 'It was a . chemical weapon, we are sure of that, because tear gas can't cause the . death of people.' Eye witness accounts from the . inverstigation reveal that a tank launched chemical weapons and caused . people exposed to them to suffer nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, . delirium, seizures, and respiratory distress. The symptoms suggest that the weaponised compound Agent-15 was responsible. Developed in the 1960s by the U.S., .

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, . an activist network based in Britain, also said in December that six . Syrian rebels had died after inhaling 'white smoke without a smell' in Homs. Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad, pictured here making a public address last week, is living on a warship guarded by Russian naval forces, according to reports . Syria denied using chemical weapons and said it would never use them against citizens. Speaking . to Pentagon reporters last week, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said his biggest . concern was how the U.S. and allies would secure the chemical and . biological weapons sites scattered across Syria and ensure the . components don't end up in the wrong hands if the regime falls, . particularly under violent conditions. Certainly it would seem that the country's leader is prepared to do whatever it takes to maintain power. President Bashar Assad is now believed to travels to meetings in his presidential palace in Damascus by helicopter after moving to a warship off the Syrian coast. Intelligence sources have said the president was being protected on the warship by Russian naval forces. The move is said to have come about after the president lost confidence in his own security detail. Intelligence sources told the Saudi daily paper al-Watan the president was being protected by Russia, which effectively amounted to political asylum, The Times of Israel has reported. Al-Watan was told Assad's fear of advances by the opposition in the capital was one of the reasons why he has moved to the ship. The dictator, pictured here with his wife Asma Al-Assad, is said to have moved with his family and aides to the warship because of his fear of advances by the opposition in the capital . His current position is also thought to allow a quick evacuation to Moscow if it became necessary. Russia has remained an ally of the regime since the popular uprising in March 2011, during which time the UN estimates more than 60,000 people have been killed. Russia also endorsed a speech by Assad where he offered an end to the crisis by calling national elections and forming a new government. In his first public speech in six months last week, the dictator urged Syrians to mobilise in a 'war to defend the nation'. His defiant call to arms came in an hour-long speech to cheering loyalists in the opera house in the capital Damascus. Assad unveiled what he claimed was a peace initiative to end the violent uprising against his rule. But he declared he would not talk to those he called extremists ‘who only understand the language of terrorism’ or to ‘puppets’ of the West. People gather at a site hit by what activists said was missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet from forces loyal to Syrian president Assad, at the souk of Azaz, north of Aleppo, on Sunday . Meanwhile, as the death toll continued to grow steadily in Syria, an aid agency working in the conflict zone has said that doctors are being murdered to stop the wounded getting treated. In a report released by International Rescue Committee's Commission on Syrian Refugees, they said that partner organisations which provide emergency medical services and supplies say the health care system has been decimated. Physicians described 'intimidation, torture and the targeted killing of doctors and other medical staff in retribution for treating the wounded'.","Evidence of Syrian army's use of chemical weapons 'compelling'

"By . Nina Golgowski . UPDATED: . 08:16 EST, 27 January 2012 . New data this week shows more American women are choosing to give birth at home opposed to in a hospital setting at an increase of 29 per cent in recent years. The two-digit percentage increase between 2004 and 2009 after a 14-year decline was compiled through birth certificates of American-born babies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2009 the agency saw the highest number of home births ever recorded at 29,650 since the data first began collecting in 1989. At home: More women are choosing to deliver their babies at home than ever with a 29 per cent increase in recent years according to a report this week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . 'It’s women who are consciously rejecting the system,' says the report's coauthor Eugene Declercq, a professor of community health sciences at Boston University to MSNBC. According to the report's findings, the most common participants are women 35 and older and those who have had several previous children. The recent years' spike is attributed to non-Hispanic white women whose numbers increased by 36 per cent - from .80 per cent in 2004 to 1.09 per cent in 2009. Boost in figures: The report found that 2009 had the highest number of home births ever recorded at 29,650 since the agency first began documenting them in 1989 with White non-Hispanic women composing the recent surge . With those numbers the report finds that one in every 90 births for non-Hispanic white women is now at home. Those home deliveries typically go under the care of a midwife. Marian MacDorman, a statistician with . the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the CDC, . emphasized to HealthDay News that that increase is 'pretty large,' notably for a four-year period. Coinciding . with the uptick in numbers, the risk profile for home births have also . declined - the numbers of home births having lapsed in the earlier years . between 1990 and 2004. The risks reported with at-home . delivery, which is recommended only to those experiencing a healthy, . low-risk pregnancy, can be fetal distress, cord prolapse, hemorrhage, . high blood pressure and premature rupture of membranes leading to the . mother's transfer to a hospital, according to the American Pregnancy . Association. Hollywood talk: Film documentary The Business Of Being Born produced by talk show host Ricki Lake drew criticism from the American Medical Association which later delivered a report on the risks involved with at-home deliveries . With the recent decline in home risks, additional reasons for the recent increase in home births may be the desire for a 'low-intervention' birth, the mother having specifically desired surroundings, a so-called Hollywood motivation, and even lower costs. 'An average uncomplicated vaginal birth costs about 60% less in a home than in a hospital,' the American Pregnancy Association states on its website. Hollywood celebrities undergoing home births and even publicly documenting their experience, such as talk-show host Ricki Lake who produced a film titled the Business of Being Born, may also play a factor in the recent increase. Motivated: Talk show host Ricki Lake gave birth to her second child at home, similar to most other women according to the recent report, leading her to produce the documentary The Business of Being Born . 'When they see celebrities doing it, they think 'Oh, this is a great idea,'' Dr. Mary L . Rosser, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology and women's health at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx told HealthDay News . Gisele Bunchen, wife of NFL New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, gave birth to their son at home in a bathtub in 2009, as well as model Cindy Crawford, actress Pamela Anderson, actor John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston, actress Meryl Streep, and actress Demi Moore with actor Bruce Willis. 'I can't imagine they are scared everyone will have a home birth because I did,' Ms Lake told the New York Daily News after the American Medical Association feared her documentary advocated home birthing without emphasizing the risks. Inspired and inspiring: Supermodel Gisele Bundchen, seen with her son Benjamin Brady about seven months after giving birth to him at home in a bath tub, is reported to have been inspired by Ricki Lake's documentary . In 2008 following, the association publicly warned those risks. Dr Rosser herself, who believes she sees the celebrity trend, notes that she personally doesn't recommend it to her own patients. 'I emphasize to people there is a two - to threefold increased risk of . neonatal mortality,' Dr Rosser said explaining that even when there's a low-risk pregnancy, things can go wrong. 'You cannot . predict postpartum hemorrhage,' Dr Rosser said. Like the statistics found in this week's report by the CDC, Ms Lake's first child was delivered in a hospital while her second was at home. Au naturel: Water births which are done in a tub similar to this one, is a style of birth that the supermodel Gisele Bundchen chose for herself at home which was praised by Ms Lake . 'After the first birth, I felt intrigued to learn about midwifery...' she told Babble. 'My second son's birth was something I researched for a long time, and then I had this birth experience that was so positively transformative,' she said. According to the Boston Globe, Gisele Bunchen was inspired by Ms Lake's documentary leading to her choice of having an at-home birth. 'It's so great to hear that (Gisele) had a positive home-birth . experience,' Ms Lake responded to the Globe following. 'Not only because it was at home . and in water, but because it says a lot to girls who follow her.'","Celebrities like Gisele Bunchen, Ricki Lake, Cindy Crawford and Pamela Anderson gave birth at home .

The number of gay men catching HIV has almost doubled in 20 years because new drugs have encouraged unsafe sex, new research shows. Between 1990 and 2010, cases rose by 76 per cent due to fewer people using condoms. Experts say this is due to the introduction of antiretroviral drugs that are effective in treating the disease. During this time there was a 26 per cent increase in the proportion having unprotected sex, according to the study. The number of gay men catching HIV has almost doubled in 20 years because new drugs have encouraged unsafe sex . Professor Andrew Phillips, of University College London, said: 'We created a model reconstructing the HIV epidemic in men who have sex with men in the UK. 'In doing so, we were able to explore the interplay between HIV testing rates, antiretroviral (ART) treatment and sexual behaviour on HIV transmission and incidence. 'By better understanding the driving forces behind the trends we have seen in the past, it will allow us to make informed choices to reduce new HIV infections in the future.' But the findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, suggest the increase in infections would have been 68 per cent greater without the introduction of ART in the same period, and 400 per cent more if condom use among men who have sex with other men had ceased entirely from the year 2000 onwards. Dr Valerie Delpech, head of HIV . surveillance at the Health Protection Agency, said: 'Our research . provides important evidence to support current UK public health . recommendations on expanded HIV testing and higher levels of ART . coverage, to reduce new infections among men who have sex with men. But the findings also suggest infections would have been 68 per cent greater without the introduction of antiretroval drugs . 'However, we see it is also vital condom use education continues as not only does this have a strong limiting effect on the HIV epidemic, but only a modest increase in unprotected sex is enough to erode the benefits of other interventions.' Exploring other scenarios, the research found cases would have reduced by 25 per cent if HIV testing levels had been higher, by 32 per cent if ART had been prescribed at diagnosis or by 62 per cent if both interventions had been combined. Effective ART therapy reduces how infectious peple with HIV are, lowering the risk of transmission. Dr Delpech added: 'Everyone should use a condom when having sex with new or casual partners, until all partners have had a sexual health screen. 'We also encourage men who have sex with men to get an HIV and STI screen at least annually, and every three months if having condomless sex with new or casual partners - and clinicians to take every opportunity to recommend HIV testing to this group. 'Through combining earlier and more frequent HIV testing, programmes that reduce unsafe sexual behaviour and higher levels of ART coverage for those requiring it, we could substantially reduce HIV transmission in this group.'","Between 1990 and 2010 there was a 26 per cent increase in the number of men having unprotected sex .

But motorist Baljinder Gill, 34, was left stranded in the fast lane of a dual carriageway on the A40 near Denham, Buckinghamshire, after she was caught up in the planned collision.

Radoslaw Bielawski, Andrzez Skowron and Jacek Kowalczyk guilty of . causing Miss Gill’s death by dangerous driving and conspiracy to commit . fraud. Miss Gill was not the intended victim . of the fraud. The business van in front of her had been targeted because . the gang knew it would have valid insurance.

High Court Judge Mr Justice Sweeney . said the death of Miss Gill had an ‘absolutely devastating’ effect on . her family who shortly afterwards lost one of her brothers to cancer. Relatives of Miss Gill, who lived in . Stanwell, near Staines in Surrey – little more than a dozen miles from . the crash site – were in court to see the men, all from London, jailed.

A hunt for dozens of Second World War Spitfires thought to have been buried in the Burmese jungle has proved fruitless. Last month, archaeologists spent nearly two weeks trying to unearth unused unassembled aircraft which they believed were packed into crates and buried by the RAF in 1945. But they failed to find any Spitfires at RAF Mingaladon, now Yangon International Airport. Archeologists spent two weeks hunting for the spitfire planes in the Burmese jungle . The aircraft were thought to have been delivered to Mangaladon Airport during World War II . Some 36 planes were thought to be lying undiscovered in Mingaladon - one of three potential locations in the country - with as many as 124 buried in total. But Wargaming Ltd, who were funding the project, today said they believe no Spitfires were delivered in crates and buried at RAF Mingaladon during 1945 and 1946. The company said that archival records showed that the RAF unit that handled shipments through Rangoon docks only received 37 aircraft in total from three transport ships between 1945 and 1946. None of the crates contained Spitfires and most appear to have been re-exported in the autumn of 1946, they said. Evidence also pointed to appalling weather conditions leaving a shortage of equipment, timber and labour at Mingaladon around the time meaning it would have been impossible for the RAF to bury aircraft 30ft deep in wooden crates even if it wanted to, according to Wargaming. Wing Commander Robert Stanford-Tuck, with Hawker Hurricanes for film Battle of Britain in 1968 . Tracy Spaight, Wargaming's director of . special projects, said: 'No-one would have been more delighted than our . team had we found Spitfires. 'We knew the risks going in, as our . team had spent many weeks in the archives and had not found any evidence . to support the claim of buried Spitfires. 'However, the team's assessment was that even if there were no crated Spitfires, parts of Spitfires or other aircraft might well have been found, since Mingaladon was a major airfield occupied by three different air force and hundreds of service people during World War Two. 'Had Spitfires been found we were equipped to recover them using the best available technical expertise. And we would have done the work to the same high ethical and archaeological standards which we brought to the rest of the project.'","Archeologists spent nearly two weeks trying to find 37 unused spitfires in the jungle .

He's spent more than £70,000 on 100 different procedures to transform himself into a real life Ken doll. And despite the cost and pain of going under the knife, Justin Jedlica said he has no plans to stop yet. The 32 year old appeared on today's This Morning to share his story and told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he doesn't consider himself addicted to surgery. Rather, he believes he is being 'artistic' by 'modifying' his looks. When asked if he would ever stop having cosmetic surgery, he replied: 'It's creative, would you ask Picasso not to paint? Why is it any more offensive because I choose to be creative through surgery?' Living doll: Justin Jedlica said he has modelled himself on Ken because the toy figure is the 'epitome of the optimal male aesthetic' Justin's 'creativity' has led him to have 14 operations and dozens of other procedures including filler injections. He's had five nose jobs, cranial brow bone shaping, augmentations to his cheeks, lips, and chin as well as pec, bicep, tricep and shoulder silicone implants. He said he has used a Ken doll as his inspiration because he is the 'epitome of the optimal male aesthetic' thanks to his 'swimmer's build - not too big, not too small', with 'exquisite features' that are 'not to linear'. Artist: The New Yorker told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he considers his cosmetic enhancements a creative process . Easier than working out? Justin shows Eamonn the kind of silicone implant he has in his biceps (and triceps and pecs) to create a muscular look . Justin, from New York, explained how he saved up to have his first nose job at the age of 17 after being inspired by stars such as Michael Jackson who made surgery seem like 'a luxury item'. 'I was from a low income family and it was something that seem unobtainable for me to be like one of those people,' he explained. He said he was not motivated by unhappiness with his own appearance. 'I always thought I was a handsome individual so had a great base to work from,' he said. 'I am happy but I enjoy the constant state of change like having a tattoo or body piercing.' 'Short term pain, long term gain': Justin said sculpting his body through surgery is cheaper than joining a gym . When Ruth asked him why he had chosen to pay for surgery to 'modify' his body, instead of working out, Justin said he didn't believe it would have been cheaper to go to the gym in the long run. 'By the time you pay for gym membership and time you spend not at work in the gym, it's not cheaper,' he said. He added that working out is 'long term pain for long term gain' whereas surgery is 'short term pain for long term gain'. The MailOnline reported a fortnight ago how a match made in childhood heaven was attempted by introducing Justin to 'real life Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova, 23.

With three million snapped up in its first four days on sale, the new iPad is the hottest gadget around. For some customers, however, that’s been a big problem. An influential U.S. consumer watchdog is investigating online reports that Apple’s tablet computer generates too much heat. The thermal camera shows the new iPad (left) is considerably warmer than iPad 2 - tallying with user complaints that the new tablet can become 'uncomfortably' warm while in use . One disgruntled customer said they were returning theirs after it reached temperatures of 47c (117f) following only ten minutes of use. Dutch technology website Tweakers said the new iPad, which went on sale last Friday, was 5c hotter than its predecessor when running. Customers have complained that the gadget is ‘too hot to hold’, particularly when playing games, prompting a spokesman for the U.S. watchdog Consumer Reports to announce it was conducting its own ‘scientific analysis with thermal imaging’. It found that the product became ‘significantly hotter’ after playing the popular game Infinity Blade II, with temperatures of 47c recorded on the device’s front and back. However, tester Donna Tapellini said the gadget was ‘not especially uncomfortable if held for a brief period’. Users have claimed that the problem with overheating iPads is particularly bad with 3D games . One user of Apple’s official support website said: 'I think we all know what we have to . do - which is to return the iPad. 'They . simply did not do a good enough job with this iPad, maybe next year. They also have so much money now that they are giving it away to the . stock holders. 'It was . reported that Apple sold over 3 million iPads over the weekend. I hope . they all return their iPad forcing Apple to revise and fix this iPad . sooner rather than a year from now.' A spokesman for Apple said the new iPad’s performance was ‘well within our thermal specifications’, adding that concerned customers should contact the company. The launch of the iPhone 4 in 2010 was also troubled, with buyers complaining that the handset could not connect to the internet or make calls if held in a certain way. Smokin' hot? Apple forum users have claimed that the new gadget is far hotter than previous iPads and can be uncomfortable to use . Tweakers said: 'On the left is the new iPad - with a temperature of 33.6c in the lower right hand corner. 'The iPad 2 scored in the same place a temperature of 28.3c, a difference of 5.3c.' The Dutch bloggers say that their image tallies with complaints on Apple websites. 'Forum messages noted that the location of the processor is a hot spot,' says Tweakers. 'At 33.6c, the iPhone is not too hot to touch, although the warmer housing is very noticeable.' On blogs, some iPad owners have even claimed that it goes into ‘cool down mode’ and freezes until it has reached a stable temperature. The . issue seems to be confined to the bottom left hand side, though some . people said that the whole left side of the device was too hot. User .

Altercation: Vice chairman of Deutsche Bank Brian Mulligan snarled at LAPD officers and struck martial arts poses while appearing 'out of it' A Deutsche Bank director ran through traffic and struck martial arts poses during a bizarre altercation with Los Angeles police, authorities said. Brian Mulligan, 53, appeared 'out of it'  after officers responded to 911 calls about a man trying to break into people's cars at a drive-thru in Highland Park. Mulligan seemed to be 'under the influence based on his behavior', Lieutenant Andrew Neiman told MailOnline. CBS Los Angeles, citing a police seen exclusively by the station, reported that officers were told by Mulligan he was high on marijuana and had ingested ‘White Lightning,’ another term for bath salts, and had not slept for four days. The bank executive was spotted wandering in a confused state by passers-by on May 15, 2011 at around 10.40pm. Due to his erratic behavior, officers called a senior officer to the scene, who carried out a drug evaluation. There was no definitive evidence of a controlled substance that the LAPD test for, according to the police spokesman. Mulligan told officers he was 'tired and exhausted' and asked to be escorted to his car so he could collect belongings to go to the local Highland Park Motel. When they reached the vehicle, there was a large amount of money in the car, causing officers to call for back-up as is protocol. Mulligan was then left at the motel by officers without further incident. Later that night at around 1am, the same officers who dropped Mulligan off at the motel responded to reports of a man trying to get into vehicles. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: The bank magnate is suiting the LAPD for $50million after the altercation left him with nasal fractures and other injuries . They saw Mulligan . in the street, running into oncoming traffic. Officers called him . back on to the sidewalk, but rather than comply, Mulligan assumed a . ‘combative stance’, striking martial arts poses. At that point, officers were forced to subdue Mulligan adding that a ‘use of force then occurred' before he was arrested. The businessman's injuries required him to be admitted to hospital for facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures. Earlier this month Mulligan sued the LAPD for $50million, saying that during the 2011 encounter he was battered by the police. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Deutsche Bank executive further alleged that the LAPD officers in question were holding him hostage at the motel where he was staying as a means to steal the $5,000 he had on his person at the time. He said, she said: Police officers said they found Mulligan walking near this Los Angeles-area Jack-in-the-Box . Held hostage? Police say that he requested to be taken to the Highland Park Motel to rest, but his lawyer claims he was held hostage there . Neither Mulligan nor Deutsche Bank immediately returned MailOnline’s requests for comment. Mulligan’s . lawyer Michael Flanagan told the Journal that the officers stopped him . on a sidewalk in Los Angeles and discovered $5,000 cash in his car. At that point, Mr Flanagan said that his client was driven to a hotel and told he would be killed if he attempted to leave. When, after a few hours, Mulligan did try to leave, Mr Flanagan said that police found him and beat him mercilessly. According to TMZ, Mulligan was booked for resisting arrest as well as interfering with law enforcement. The gossip website also reported that the Deutsche exec suffered facial lacerations and as many as 15 nasal fractures. Lt Andrew Neiman said the Force Investigation Division has opened an inquiry into Mulligan’s arrest, adding that it will likely be a year before it is completed.

The co-founder of Xbox has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft for 'five years of failure' - and claimed that Apple could ‘kill them’ at any given moment. Former Xbox engineer Nat Brown - who came up with the console’s name (albeit spelled xBox) - slammed Microsoft for failing to capitalise on innovations such as Kinect and making it difficult for developers to make and sell games on the device. The attack follows reports that Microsoft are likely to announce their Xbox 360 successor, codenamed Durango, at E3 in Los Angeles in June this year. Sales phenomenon: The Xbox 360 console has sold 76 million units since its inception in November 2005 . Writing on his blog ilike.code, under . the title ‘Stupid, Stupid xBox’, Brown said: ‘The past 5 years, and the . last year in particular, have been simply painful to watch. 'Coasting on past momentum. Failing to innovate and failing to capitalize on innovations like Kinect. Touting strategic and market success when you’re just experiencing your competitor’s stumbling failure (yes, Sony, Nintendo – you are, I’m afraid, stumbling failures). 'A complete lack of tactical versus strategic understanding of the long game of the living room.’ He also cited two ‘critical problems’ with the Xbox 360, blasting Microsoft’s membership model and the console’s operating system. ‘Why can’t I write a game for xBox . tomorrow using $100 worth of tools and my existing Windows laptop and . test it on my home xBox or at my friends’ houses?’ he wrote. ‘Why . can’t I then distribute it digitally in a decent online store, give up a . 30% cut and strike it rich if it’s a great game, like I can for . Android, for iPhone, or for iPad? Oh, wait, I can… sort of. The next generation Xbox console will require Microsoft's Kinect motion sensors to be connected when playing games, according to games industry sources. The machine - the follow up to the hugely successful Xbox 360 - will also feature new-look control pads and be capable of simultaneously running apps alongside video games. Having Kinect as a requirement has raised eyebrows among gamers as it is still widely criticised by 'hardcore' gamers for being a gimmick that adds little value to games. That's despite Microsoft having sold 20million of the motion-sensor units. The new machine is codenamed Durango. A source who is said to have previously revealed details on games consoles, told Kotaku he has had access to the development kits. ‘Read some of the fine-print at the xBox registered developer program page (that “membership” would cost you $10,000/year and a ton of paperwork, with Microsoft holding veto power over your game being published), navigate the mess through to learning about XBLA (also costly, paperwork and veto approval) and you may end up learning about a carved off little hard-to-find store with a few thousand stunted games referred to as XBLIG where Microsoft has ceded their veto power (and instead just does nothing to promote your games). ‘This is where indie developers have found they can go in order to not make money on xBox, despite an installed base of 76M devices. Microsoft, you are idiotic to have ceded not just indie game developers but also a generation of loyal kids and teens to making games for other people’s mobile devices.' Mr Brown went on to call the operating . system, particularly the first two levels of the Xbox 360 dashboard, as . ‘creaky, slow and ‘full of s***’.

More than 700 patients at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Center may have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C because of accidental reuse of insulin pens, according to a hospital statement and published reports. Authorities told The Buffalo News there is a 'very small risk' for the diabetic patients who may have been exposed to the reused insulin pens - but not the needles - between October 19, 2010 and November 2012. The VA memo obtained by the News said the problem was discovered by a routine pharmacy inspection last November 1. The News first published the report on its website Friday. Big mistake: Staff at the Buffalo Veterans Administration Center (pictured) re-used insulin pens on patients from October 19, 2010 to November 1 . More than 700 exposed: While the pens were re-used, the veterans hospital staff changed the needles, rendering the risk of infection very low, according to a doctor (stock image). The VA also notified western New York members of Congress of the possible exposure. In a statement to The Associated Press, VA spokeswoman Evangeline Conley said the hospital 'recently discovered that in some cases, insulin pens were not labeled for individual patients.' She added that 'although the pen needles were always changed, an insulin pen may have been used on more than one patient.' Conley said that once this was discovered the hospital took 'immediate action' to ensure the insulin pens were being used according to pharmaceutical guidelines. Taking up the fight: Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican who represents the Buffalo area, said that even with a fresh needle, contamination could have occurred if bodily fluid flowed back into the insulin pens . Insulin pens used by diabetics to inject insulin can be disposable or reusable with replaceable needles and cartridges. But according to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, even reusable pens should not be used on more than one patient. The VA told local lawmakers that of the 716 patients at the facility who may have been exposed to the reused insulin pens 570 are still living, according to The Buffalo News. “I was horrified,” the wife of a Marine Corps veteran who was possibly exposed told The News. “I started crying, figuring what could be wrong with my husband. I trusted the VA. He trusted the VA. To find out they weren’t labeling the insulin pens, and they were sharing them – it’s horrifying.” After seeing the VA's memo, Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican who represents the Buffalo area, said he spoke with Dr. Robert A. Petzel, undersecretary for health at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 'His thought was that it's a very, very low chance of passing infection,' Collins said. 'But it's not out of the realm of possibility, and that's why they're testing everyone,' Collins told the News. Collins said that even with a fresh needle, contamination could have occurred if bodily fluid flowed back into the insulin pens. The VA said it is offering free blood tests to rule out any infections.","The hospital only re-used the pens - and not the needles .

The first known instance of creatures growing their own 'disposable penises' has been discovered by researchers after studying the mating habits of sea slugs. Researchers in Japan were astonished when they realised that a group of sea slugs called Chromodoris reticulata would lose their penises after sex but then grow another one a few hours later. Marine invertebrate expert Bernard Picton, of National Museums Northern Ireland, said: 'I've never seen anything like this before.' Impressive equipment: The Chromodoris reticulata, or sea slug, can grow a new penis after having sex . The creatures, also known as nudibranchs, are hermaphrodites, and scientists already knew that they had male and female organs which enable them to perform the male role of donating sperm and the female role of receiving sperm at the same time. But the revelation that their penises fell off and then re-grew was a surprise to them. The discovery was made after a team from Osaka City University and Tokyo's Nihon University went diving to collect the sea slugs from shallow coral reefs off the coast near Okinawa. They placed the slugs together in aquaria in pairs and then observed them having sex.  Scientists noticed that those who had recently mated were unable to do so again within 24 hours. Looking more closely, they saw that after having sex, the creatures detached themselves from their partner then crawled away with their penises dragging along behind them.  About 20 minutes later, the used penis would fall off. Examination of the creatures' anatomy revealed a tightly coiled spiral inside the slug's body that would be missing in creatures that had not recently had sex. It works both ways: The hermaphroditic sea slugs can both impregnate and be impregnated at the same time . Brightly coloured: Sea slugs are known for their bright colours but that is not all they can boast about . Ayami Sekizawa, who led the study, said: 'We think this spiral is effectively a penis-in-waiting that will uncoil rapidly after penis disposal and grow into a new penis.' Why the creatures have such equipment is not yet known for sure, although the discovery that the discarded penises had backwards-facing spines on them suggested to the experts that perhaps they were there to remove rival sperm left after the partner's previous matings. Nils Anthes, an evolutionary ecologist from the German University of Tubingen, said that the penis might be discarded after sex to ensure a clean pairing next time. 'If genetic work confirms that the penis spines are really loaded with rival sperm after retraction, then it is best for the animals to dispose of the penis like a dirty syringe,' he told Nature.com. 'Otherwise they may risk delivering some rival sperm mixed with their own during later sexual encounters.' The slugs were observed to be able to mate at most three times, with 24 hours' recovery time between each copulation, during which a new appendage would grow. Other creatures are known to lose their penises after sex, including orb weaving spiders, periwinkles and land slugs. But scientists say that these sea slugs, which are found in the Pacific Ocean, are the only known ones who can re-grow their male equipment according to the BBC. The findings of the Japanese study are published in the Royal Society's journal Biology Letters.","Chromodoris reticulata slugs have a 'penis-in-waiting' that grows after sex .

The inner workings of a secretive and now-disgraced Roman Catholic order called the Legion of Christ were revealed by documents released on Friday. They include details on how the founder of the organization, the Reverend Marcial Maciel who died in 2008, lived a double life, fathering three children, and was accused of abusing seminarians. The Legion kept this information hidden. Also revealed are allegations that the organization solicited money from an elderly widow, eventually persuading her to bequeath it $60 million. The scandal, which has tarnished the . legacy of Pope John Paul II, is cited as an especially egregious example . of how the Vatican ignored decades of reports about sexually abusive . priests because church leaders put the interests of the institution . above those of the victims. Scroll down for video . Unsealed documents have shed light on the double life led by Marcial Maciel (left), founder of the disgraced Catholic Legion of Christ order. He is seen here with Pope John Paul II (right) in 2004 . These documents, released in Rhode Island, are the first-ever depositions . of high-ranking Legion officials and include how the order's former . second-in-command learned in 2006 that its founder had fathered a child. The No. 2 said he didn't go public . with the news of the paternity because Maciel, had already been sanctioned by the Holy See for having . sexually abused seminarians and forced into a lifetime of penance and . prayer. Pope Benedict XVI took over the . Legion in 2010 after a Vatican investigation into Maciel determined that the Reverend had fathered three children by two women. The pope ordered a wholesale reform of the order and named a papal . delegate to oversee it. In other documents released Friday, the . Rev. Luis Garza, the former No. 2 of the Legion, details for the first . time how he confronted Maciel's mistress and daughter, starting in . October 2006, after he became suspicious while visiting Maciel in a . Jacksonville, Fla., hotel that June and seeing the two women there. In 2010 Blanca Lara Gutierrez alleged that Marcial Maciel sexually abused one of his two sons with her as well as a son she had from a previous relationship . Jose Raul Gonzalez Lara (left) and Omar Gonzalez Lara (right) both claim they were abused by Marcial Maciel - their father . Both women confirmed Maciel's paternity, . and Garza said he obtained the daughter's birth certificate as proof - . listing the father as Jose Rivas. Later, it was revealed that Maciel . used the same pseudonym with his other hidden family, a Mexican woman . with whom he had two sons. In 2010 Blanca Lara Gutierrez alleged that Maciel sexually abused one of his two sons with her as well as a son she had from a previous relationship. The sons, now adults named Jose Raúl and Omar, said the abuse went on for years. Lara Gutierrez said she met Maciel in Tijuana in the 1970s but did not know he was a priest. She said he passed himself off as an employee of an international oil company, a private investigator and a CIA agent. Garza said he never confronted . Maciel about his double life and didn't think it was necessary to share . the news with the broader membership of the Legion or its lay movement . Regnum Christi. He said he only told the Legion's superior and two other . priests. 'I didn't think at the time that the . fact that fathering a child would change in any way the way we needed to . behave vis-a-vis Father Maciel or the actions that we needed to do,' Garza said in the 2011 deposition. Reverend Marcial Maciel, who died in 2008, fathered three secret children with two separate women and was accused of abusing seminarians . 'Because we needed to comply with . indications of the Holy See and also because there was an issue of . privacy and respect for the mother and the daughter.' The Legion didn't acknowledge Maciel's . children or the sexual abuse allegations against him until February . 2009, about a year after he died. The papers also describe how the organization solicited money from an elderly widow, eventually persuading her to bequeath it $60 million. The documents, previously sealed in a lawsuit brought before Superior Court in Rhode Island, include thousands of pages of testimony from high-ranking leaders at the Legion, its members and relatives of wealthy widow Gabrielle Mee. A Rhode Island Superior Court judge said last year that the documents raised a red flag because Mee, a steadfastly spiritual elderly woman, transferred millions to 'clandestinely dubious religious leaders.' But they had been kept under seal until The Associated Press, The New York Times, the National Catholic Reporter and The Providence Journal intervened, arguing that they were in the public interest. The Legion of Christ is also accused of soliciting $60 million from an elderly widow, Gabriel Mee. The woman's niece alleges her aunt was defrauded by the Legion and unduly influenced by its priests into giving away her fortune . The Legion had argued media coverage of the documents could taint prospective jurors if there was a trial. Mary Lou Dauray had alleged that her aunt, Mee, who died at age 96 in 2008, was defrauded by the Legion and unduly influenced by its priests into giving away her fortune. Her late husband was a onetime director of Fleet National Bank. The Legion said that it didn't exert undue influence over her decision-making and that the gifts were made of her own will. 'Our actions with regard to Mrs. Mee and her estate were appropriate and honorable,' Legion spokesman Jim Fair said. 'We were respectful and diligent in carrying out her wishes in the handling of resources provided to the Legion.' In a separate lawsuit, Mee said in a 2001 deposition that she had 'complete confidence and trust' in the Legion, despite never asking details of its activities. Mee said she had met with Maciel and he told her the Legion was 'in a crunch.' 'We only ask God for what we need,' Maciel said, according to her testimony. She replied, ''And the angel Gabriel came down from heaven.' My name is Gabrielle.' The Legion didn't acknowledge Maciel's children or the sexual abuse allegations against him until February 2009, about a year after he died. She said she was never directly asked for money but it was 'understood' that she'd help whenever the Legion needed it. 'When I, through the grapevine, hear that something is going on and they know it, it's understood if I can help, I'd be very glad to,' she said. 'Because I have total confidence, you see. Whatever they do is part of my life.' Bernard Jackvony, the lawyer for Mee's niece, said taken as a whole, the depositions expose how the Legion knew by 2004 that the Vatican was investigating Maciel for sexual abuse and by 2006 that he had a daughter yet kept the information private. He argued that Mee never would have given the Legion her money had she known of Maciel's true nature. 'In terms of fraud, when you withhold information from people, that's the same as if you said something to them that's not true,' he said. Garza also confirmed he was a member of a committee of three Legion priests who met annually to decide how to distribute funds from Mee's trusts. A Superior Court judge ruled in September that Mee's niece, Dauray, couldn't sue, but he noted there was evidence that Mee had been unduly persuaded to change her trusts and will.","Disgraced Legion of Christ founder, Reverend Marcial Maciel, is accused of fathering three children with two women and abusing seminarians .

Miss Bowman who is currently working as an assistant in a ski shop in France said she was 'ecstatic and in shock' to get the pictures back. She said: 'It is absolutely bizarre. We were convinced they had gone for ever. 'We are truly grateful to Peter for going to so much effort to track us down. The pictures hold so many amazing memories for us.' Miss Bowman said the 300 pictures were taken in the first few weeks of a three month backpacking trip that her and Emily were taking around Europe last summer. Most of the snaps showed the pair enjoying the sights around San Sebastian in the Basque region of Spain and Biarritz on the Atlantic coast of France before they travelled to Amsterdam. Miss Bowman said: 'We were in a bar . by a canal in Amsterdam when I realised my memory card was full as I had . been taking pictures all day. 'Emily . had a spare card in her glasses case so we quickly exchanged the cards, . but a little while later we realised the full one had gone missing. 'We went back to the bar and were pulling cushions off chairs to try and find it, but it was nowhere to be seen. 'Afterwards . we just bought another card and got on with our travelling. It was just . annoying because I had lost all the pictures from the early part of our . trip. Campaign: The card was found on the baggage belt of Amsterdam airport by Peter van Leeuwen who began a social media campaign to find the owner . 'It came as a complete surprise when we were contacted by the friend who we were staying with in Amsterdam who told us our pictures had turned up on YouTube. Reunited: Catriona Bowman and Emily Fazah, pictured left, eventually contacted Mr van Leeuwen after seeing a YouTube video and he emailed them the pictures . 'We were amazed to hear that the SD card had landed up on a conveyor belt at the airport several miles from Amsterdam city centre. 'How it got there from the bar is an absolute mystery. 'When I briefly spoke to Peter on a Dutch radio station, he was quite apologetic for not putting the pictures online sooner.' Miss Fazah, a media and broadcasting technology student at Leeds University, said: 'We don't know how the memory card got to the airport. 'We went back to the bar where we lost it on more than one occasion but eventually gave up hope. 'That was last summer - but then I got a call saying there was a big campaign launched to find us. 'I couldn't believe it.' Mr van Leeuwen, creative business partner at Dutch advertising agency Etcetera, said: 'It's amazing how fast news travels on Facebook. 'It's really the new 'lost and found'. 'That's why I decided to put it on Facebook and YouTube instead of bringing the card to the lost and found-department of Schiphol Airport.'","Catriona Bowman, 22, lost her camera card in an Amsterdam bar last July .

Explorer: Ernest Shackleton buried whisky bottles when he abandoned his desolate hut in the Antarctic to set off on an expedition . Three bottles of rare 19th century Scotch whisky left behind by Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton have finally been returned to his desolate snowbound base. They came home today after a distiller first flew them to Scotland to recreate the long-lost recipe. But not even New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who personally returned the stash, got a taste of the contents of the bottles of Mackinlay's whisky. They were discovered 102 years after the explorer was forced to leave them behind and buried them under floorboards . 'I think we're all tempted to crack it open and have a little drink ourselves now,' Mr Key joked at a ceremony handing over the bottles to Antarctic Heritage Trust officials at New Zealand's Antarctic base on Ross Island. The whisky will be transferred in March from Ross Island to Shackelton's abandoned hut at Cape Royds and replaced beneath it as part of a programme to protect the legacy of the heroic era of Antarctic exploration from 1898 to 1915. Bottled in 1898 after the blend was aged 15 years, the Mackinlay bottles were among three crates of Scotch and two of brandy buried beneath a basic hut Shackleton had used during his dramatic 1907 Nimrod excursion to the Antarctic. The expedition failed to reach the South Pole but set a record at the time for reaching the farthest southern latitude. Shackelton was knighted after his return to Britain. The bottles of rare 19th century whisky, pictured, were discovered 102 years after the explorer was forced to leave them behind .

Shackelton's stash was discovered frozen in ice by conservationists in 2010. The crates were frozen solid after more than a century beneath the Antarctic surface. Gravestone: The final resting place of explorer Ernest Shackleton at Grytviken, South Georgia . But the bottles were found intact — and researchers could hear the whisky sloshing around inside. Antarctica's minus 22 Fahrenheit (-30C) temperature was not enough to freeze the alcohol. The bottles remained unopened as they were returned Saturday - if Shackleton couldn't have a dram, no one could - but their contents nevertheless formed the basis for a revival of the bend. Distiller Whyte & Mackay, which now owns the Mackinlay brand, chartered a private jet to take the bottles from the Antarctic operations headquarters in the New Zealand city of Christchurch to Scotland for analysis in 2011. The recipe for the whisky had been lost. But Whyte & Mackay recreated a limited edition of 50,000 bottles from a sample drawn with a syringe through a cork of one of the bottles. The conservation work of the Antarctic Heritage Trust has received £5 for every bottle sold. The original bottles had flown in two combination-locked containers with the New Zealand prime minister to Antarctica in a U.S. Air Force transport plane from Christchurch on Friday. Antarctic Heritage Trust manager Lizzie Meek, who was part of the team that found the whisky, recalled its pleasant aroma. 'When you're used to working around things in that hut that perhaps are quite decayed and some of them don't have very nice smells, it's very nice to work with artifacts that have such a lovely aroma,' Meek told the ceremony by radio from explorer Robert Scott's Antarctic hut which she is restoring. 'And definitely the aroma of whisky was around very strongly.'","Distiller first flew them to Scotland to recreate long-lost recipe .

Dozens of other people had to be rescued when they were left dangling mid-air at Lecht Ski Centre in Corgarff, Aberdeenshire, yesterday. The five children, who were as young as nine, and the man were injured when they fell 20ft onto the mountainside, crashing to the ground. Stephen Bastiman-Davies took this picture of his wife and son being rescued from the chair-lift at Lecht Ski Centre . A failed component on a pylon at Lecht Ski Centre led to a chairlift pictured falling to the ground . Some of the injured were airlifted to hospital amid fears of spinal injuries following the accident at 3.25pm. After the casualties had been dealt . with, rescuers could finally turn their attention to the day trippers – . including children – trapped 20ft up on the broken lift in sub-zero wind . chill conditions. Among them was a small boy on his own in a chair, whose father tried to comfort him from the ground. Last night, it was unclear exactly what had happened – but Health and Safety investigators will visit the scene this morning. In a statement published on its Facebook page, the company involved Lecht 2090 said it did not know what caused the malfunction. An investigation is due to take place by the Health and Safety Executive and the chairlift, which is the only lift of its kind at the ski resort, is expected to remain closed for some time. The statement read: 'Some of you might know there was an incident with the chairlift this afternoon (Tuesday) where six people were injured. 'We are extremely upset that these people have been injured but as yet we don't [know] the cause of the problem with the chair. 'The first response was to look after the injured. The rest of the skiers were then taken off the chairlift by the two Lecht teams within around one hour and 20 minutes. 'A major incident was called by the company to alert all the other emergency agents who reacted quickly. The chair will be out of action for a while but the rest of the lifts will be working as normal.' Jennifer Johnston and her family, from . nearby Hatton of Fintray, were  skiing in the area – and her . 15-year-old son Calum was on a lift parallel to the chairlift that broke . down. He described one chair becoming detached from the main line and causing a pile-up. Police, ambulances, firefighters and mountain rescue teams dealt with those trapped at the scene .

They were all bundled up together. 'I heard a crunch and soon after the . cable released. There was  groaning as it was on the ground, although . there was no screaming when it fell – it happened too quickly.' Mrs Johnston added: 'We skied away and could see where one of the cables had come off the pylon. 'One chair was detached from the cable and had stopped progression up the hill, and other chairs had got tangled in the cable. 'One of the most upsetting things was a . little boy all on his own on a chair much higher up. His dad was on the . ground trying to comfort him and throw him gloves.'

They hugged, shed a few tears and he told his mother how happy he was to be back in the land of the living. Sam Woodhead, the 18-year-old British public schoolboy who had been lost in the unforgiving Australian outback for three days, was reunited with his mother, 54-year-old Claire Derry, today in the tiny Queensland hospital where he is recovering from his ordeal . Miss Derry said she told her son: ‘I didn’t think I would ever be holding you in my arms again. He’s an incredibly lucky man and we’re incredibly lucky that people kept looking as long as they did. Safe: Claire Derry arriving in Australia today to see her son Sam Woodhead who went missing after going for a run at a remote ranch in Queensland and surviving for three days in 40C heat . ‘He knows how lucky he is – that searchers did not give up looking for him.' Miss Derry was speaking after listening to . her son’s description of his lost days as they sat together in the . hospital in the outback town of Longreach. Earlier she had revealed her son survived by drinking his own urine and contact lens solution he was carrying in his backpack when he set out for a run from a cattle station near Longreach last Tuesday. While he still needs another 24 hours under hospital care before doctors will consider allowing him to leave, he was able to tell his mother how he kept hoping for rescue as dehydration and exhaustion took their toll on him in the near-40c desert heat. Scroll down for video . Saved: Sam Woodhead is pictured in a helicopter as medical staff prepare to have him airlifted to hospital . Safe: Sam Woodhead is helped to the search helicopter by rescuers . Rescued: Sam Woodhead, 18, from Richmond, south-west London, went for a run on Tuesday and disappeared . The demands on his body were so intense . that he lost 15 kilograms in those three days, but it was his fitness . that kept him alive, his mother said. He was not able to stand when they met in hospital, she revealed, but other than that ‘he looks fantastic.’ She added: 'He’s still very weak but he looks well. He must have the constitution of an ox. ‘I was shocked at his thinner frame, but pleasantly surprised that he doesn’t look too much the worse for wear.’ His arms are sunburned and he is covered in scratches, but there were no other visible physical injuries.’ But Ms Derry said that doctors had told her that there might be internal problems for the teenager because his kidneys are not quite functioning normally and his blood’s not normal. 'But the doctors say that’s completely typical of someone’s who’s been completely dehydrated,’ she said. Fly to safety: Sam is taken to the waiting chopper, ending his three-day ordeal . The British backpacker had kept himself alive by drinking contact lens solution, said his mother . She laughed with him as he repeated the story he had told her over the phone earlier in the morning about his rescuers as she prepared to fly from Brisbane to Longreach. He recalled the moment when two helicopter crew approached him as his strength was ebbing away . ‘They took the p--- out of me Mum,’ he told her. ‘They said they normally find people out here with their eyes pecked out (by eagles and crows). I had to laugh.’ When she first spoke to him over the phone as she prepared to fly to Longreach she said Sam had sounded weak and had not been able to keep any food down. But he managed to say how grateful he was to have been rescued. Happy: Claire Derry with her son's former nanny Katrina Brown who met at Brisbane when Miss Derry flew into Australia . ‘All he could say was “Mum, just thank these wonderful people. I’ve loved Australia from the minute I arrived here…these people are extraordinary.”’ Survival: Sam's mother said he survived his ordeal because he was 'incredibly fit' Ms Derry said she had no doubt that Sam’s survival was due to his fitness and previous training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. ‘Sam is physically incredibly fit – that was something I clung on to,’ she said. ‘He wants to go into the Royal Marines or Army.’ A helicopter crew searching for the teenager had passed over him several times but had been unable to see him, Brisbane’s Sunday Mail reported early today (Sun). ‘We were on our last pass before breaking off for fuel, when we spotted him,’ said Queensland rescue officer John Chate. ‘Sam had moved himself into a semi-clear area which had scattered shrubs, basically rough terrain. He was a bit unstable but on his feet.’ When the helicopter crew spotted him, Sam was wearing a dirty white T-shirt and a backpack with a small amount of clothes he had used as a shelter from the sun. He was unable to stand and had to be winched into the helicopter. Rescuers said they had learned from Mr Woodhead that when he realised he was lost he curled up on the ground for the night. In the first few hours of darkness and tried to find his way back to the cattle station at dawn before the heat of the sun struck him. He sheltered as much as he could as he tried to work out which way to walk – before night came and once again he just lay down and tried to snatch some sleep. Aspirational: Sam had travelled to Australia around four weeks ago to work as a ranch hand which he hoped would help him with his training to be an Army officer . Close family: Sam in the London 2012 Olympic stadium with sister Rebecca and mother Claire, who flew out to Australia to help with the search effort . Ms Derry, who had flown from her home . in Richmond, Surrey, learned that he had been found alive when airline . crew passed a message to her. She was so overjoyed that she hugged one of the stewards – and then the crew brought her champagne to celebrate. Speaking on her arrival in Australia, Miss Derry said the news ended 'the worst three days of my life'. 'Sam . is fearless and wants to go into the Marines or the Army and it was . because he was training to be ready for his interview with them that he . was trying to keep fit all the time,’ she told ITV . 'He’s . watched programmes and videos on the Marines and that’s why he would . have known a lot about survival and why we were fairly hopeful but we . got less hopeful as time went on.' Aboriginal trackers were brought in for . the search which involved some 200 volunteers and rescue workers. The . trackers found the imprint of his running shoe before a helicopter crew . saw him at 5am yesterday almost 13 miles from the ranch. Doing everything they can: Sam with his mother and sister in front of the Empire State Building in New York. The family have paid for an extra helicopter with night vision equipment to be drafted in to join the search . ‘He’s moving – he’s alive,’ the crew . reported back to their command centre. A Queensland police spokesman . said Sam was taken to the 135,000 acre Upshot Station cattle ranch where . he had been staying. According to his mother, Sam managed a smile when he was found by a rescue team which included his cousin Rob. She says she believes that her son . will want to continue his travels which was set to include a trip to . Thailand and trekking in the Himalayas but said 'I don’t know if the . rest of the family will be able to stand that. 'No doubt it’s what Sam will want to carry on doing but it might write the rest of us off.' He then endured crippling heat of around 39C for the next three days. At night he simply curled up on the ground before resuming his efforts to find his way home. Keen sportsman: Sam Woodhead wants to join the Marines . Alex Dorr, a pilot with the North . Queensland Rescue Helicopter, described the area Sam became lost in as . ‘harsh and unforgiving’. He added: ‘Not that long ago we had a guy who . was missing for a much shorter time and he passed away.’ Family support: Sam's father Peter described the family's ordeal as a nightmare when he appeared on ITV . His . father Peter and sister Rebecca told ITV's Daybreak about the family's . 'nightmare' ordeal waiting for news about the lost teen. Rebecca . said the former Brighton College student was on his way to hospital by . helicopter with injuries no worse than ‘minor sunstroke, dehydration and . chapped lips’. Asked about . being reunited with Sam, she joked 'God, I'm going to give a bloody good . whack, I tell you. There's a queue - trust me!' 'The word 'nightmare' these days is much misused,’ he said. ‘This has been a true nightmare.’ He went on to thank all the people who helped find Samuel - who numbered up to 200. After hearing the news, Mr Woodhead's sister Emma Lupton told BBC Radio Five Live today: 'We're just so relieved that he is safe. I just want to give him a hug.' 'It has just been the worst few days really and we've just had to stay positive and keep positive thoughts in our heads.' Helicopters and scores of local people in four wheel drive vehicles had been scouring the area around the cattle station where Mr Woodhead had been staying for the previous 10 days as part of his ‘outback experience' during his gap year. A middle-aged Swiss couple who were lost in Western Australia last month managed to survive three days in the desert because they had access to river water. A man on a quad bike who went missing earlier this week in Western Australia was found in a dehydrated state after two days.

Lugman Nazir, 22, crashed his Subaru Impreza during a 100mph chase, hitting Isaak Thompson, 20, who was sat on a wall in Bradford, last year. After the crash, the town's crown court was told Nazir climbed out of the wreckage and stepped over Mr Thompson who was so badly injured he may have to have his other leg amputated. He fled the scene without checking whether Mr Thompson was even alive. Jailed: Luqman Nazir, left, has been sent to prison for five-and-a-half years after smashing into Isaak Thompson, right, at a bus stop in Bradford last year . Mr Thompson is currently receiving counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder and coming to terms with the possibility of losing his other leg. Nazir, who was a Leeds City champion boxer when he was a teenager, was arrested a few hours after the accident at his home in Bradford. He had a history of offences and was on bail at the time of the collision for a violent bag snatch the previous month. The court heard that just eight days before the crash, he had been seen speeding at 80mph in Bradford in the Subaru Impreza but the police could not catch him. The court was also told how he pulled a woman by the hair and stole her friend's Peugeot car. In 2010, he was locked up for 21 months for punching a man in the face during a drunken row. Nazir pleaded guilty to robbery, careless driving, having no insurance, dangerous driving, causing Mr Thompson grievous bodily harm, common assault and theft. Scene: The bus stop in Bradford where Nazir crashed his Subaru Impreza following a 100mph police chase . Callous: Nazir climbed out of the wreckage and stepped over his badly-injured victim as he lay on the floor so he could flee on foot . Judge Colin Burn, who watched the aftermath of the crash on CCTV, told Nazir: 'All that can be seen on impact is a scene of broken glass and various debris strewn across the road but we know that Mr Thompson lost his leg. 'Many of the things that you would aspire to do yourself, he will not be able to do for the rest of his life simply as a result of your driving at ridiculous speeds, losing control of your vehicle and crashing it in that way.' Judge Burn jailed Nazir for five-and-a-half years and also banned him from driving for three years. Ian Howard, mitigating, said the injuries he caused Mr Thompson, whose university plans have been put on hold, might motivate him stop a life of crime.","Luqman Nazir, 22, smashed his Subaru Impreza into Isaak Thompson, 20 .

He made headlines around the world after using his last £500 on a huge billboard advert begging employers to give him a job. And it appears the ploy paid off after 24-year-old Adam Pacitti landed a position with a top media firm. Delighted with his new employed status, Mr Pacitti has now used his first pay packet to fund another huge billboard in Shoreditch, London, reading: 'I spent my first wage packet on this billboard. Thank you for helping me.' Giving something back: Adam Pacitti has spent his first paycheck putting a thank you note on a billboard a month after using the advertising stands to beg for a job . Mr Pacitti came up with the idea of the billboard advert after months and months of searching for work. The billboard in Shoreditch, London, featured a picture of Mr Pacitti with the message: 'I spent my last £500 on this billboard, please give me a job.' The billboard included the address of a specially created website, where potential employers could watch a video CV and find out more about Mr Pacitti, from Ryde, Isle of Wight. The site was swamped by more than 1.5 million hits from around the globe and Mr Pacitti found himself at the centre of a social media storm. He said: 'The original tweet I sent out, telling people what I was doing with a photo of me and the billboard had 1,600 retweets and endorsements from people like Jeremy Vine, Al Murray and Frank Skinner. 'I had thousands of e-mails and an unbelievable amount of interest.' What a difference a month makes: Unemployed graduate Adam Pacitti initially paid £500 to use a billboard to beg for a job . Mr Pacitti admitted he has been overwhelmed by the response to the Employ Adam campaign. He said: 'Of course I was hoping it would go viral, but I ended up receiving coverage from newspapers across the country and websites around the world. 'I couldn't be more grateful for the response I've had and I'm just so grateful to all the people who shared my website. Without them, I'd still be looking for work.' Almost immediately after launching the website employadam.com, the job offers started to roll in. 'I actually had people offering me jobs . before the billboard went up. They liked the video CV and the website, . but I knew the billboard would be the real selling point. Sell yourself: Adam Pacitti received more than 100 job offers after his unique advertisement . 'A potential employer e-mailed me within an hour of the website going live.' Instead of sorting through rejection letters, Mr Pacitti - who had been out of work for months, despite a first-class degree in media production from Winchester University - then found himself sifting through dozens of job offers and hundreds of e-mails from well-wishers. He said: 'Employers ended up e-mailing me contracts before we had even spoken, it was that successful. I'd say I must have had more than 100 job offers to date.' Mr Pacitti has now landed a job with award-winning production company KEO. The company, which is behind TV projects such as Hugh's Fish Fight, has hired him as a viral video producer, where he will specialise in creating films for the internet. As well as promoting KEO projects, bosses have given Mr Pacitti the green light to pitch his own ideas and one of the first will give him the chance to help others in his position. Work has started on a series in which Mr Pacitti will work with jobseekers to find innovative ways to help them find work. He said: 'I'm really looking forward to it. I'm working on so many projects, but this is the one that is most personal to me. 'I know how difficult finding a job is, so to be given the opportunity to help other people find employment is incredibly exciting.' Rob Love, director of KEO Digital, said: 'It was difficult not to hear about Adam. 'He managed to do a brilliant job of making lots of noise about himself in a really innovative way - both on and offline.

But there is little chance of rest for overworked Daisy who now has her hands full feeding the huge litter at the Farmer Palmer's Farm Park, near Wareham, Dorset. Kunekune pigs are the smallest domesticated breed in the world, originally come from New Zealand, and have an average of six to eight piglets at a time. It is not unheard of for a pig to have more in their first litter but because Daisy is very small staff expected fewer babies. New mother Daisy has her hands full feeding the litter of 11 hungry piglets . The 11 brothers and sisters all sleep on top of one another to conserve body heat . Sandra Palmer, co-owner of Farmer Palmer's, said: 'We expected her to have between four and eight piglets because she is so tiny. 'Daisy is about half the size of the other Kunekune pigs we have had here so we really didn't expect her to have so many, it was a bit of a surprise. One of the 11 piglets born to Daisy in one sitting . 'She managed to do it overnight without any help. 'She is having lots of food to give her enough energy to feed the piglets and has her own separate compartment to sleep in so she can have some rest, which the piglets can access. 'The piglets sleep on top of each other to conserve body heat which is very cute. We are planning to keep them until the summer and then we will sell some of them.' It is thought that Kunekune pigs were brought to New Zealand in the 19th century by whalers and were swapped for goods with the Maori people. The name 'Kunekune' was given to the hairy pigs by the indigenous tribes, which translates to 'fat and round'. The animals were on the brink of extinction in the 1970s until a conservation programme was put in place. Kunekunes were imported to Britain in 1992 when horse rider Zoe Lindop and Andrew Calveley heard about their endangered status and began breeding them from the UK.","Daisy, a Kunekune pig from Dorset gave birth to 11 piglets in one sitting .

A scout leader who broke his back sliding down a fireman's pole in front of his troop has been awarded almost £170,000 compensation by a High Court judge. Robert Wilson, 49, fractured a vertebrae when he 'landed on his bottom' after careering down a 10-foot pole at Clyne Farm Centre's assault course, in Mayals, near Swansea, in August 2009. He was taken to hospital by helicopter after the accident on the Burma Bridge obstacle at the Challenge Valley course. Despite major surgery, his work as a taxi driver and as a carer for his seriously disabled wife have been seriously curbed by his devastating injury. Mr Wilson, of Whitehill, near Bordon, Hampshire - who described himself as a 'fat taxi driver', unfit and weighing in at 13-and-a-half stone - said he had been worried about the pole descent but relied on a 'highly confident' instructor who reassured him. Mrs Justice Swift rejected claims that Mr Wilson was the 'author of his own misfortune' and described as 'entirely fanciful' claims that he had released his handhold on the pole whilst showing off in front of his troop. She found that the 24-year-old instructor had failed to demonstrate how to safely descend the pole in the wet conditions or to instruct Mr Wilson in the correct technique before he hit the deck and immediately experienced agony. More than 300,000 are estimated to have used the assault course at Clyne Farm Centre in Mayals, near Swansea . Mr Wilson earlier said the instructor told him: 'Just go out and give the pole a big hug, hug it tight.' The activity area of Clyne Farm Centre was designed with help of an army instructor . He added: 'I then said that I wasn't . very fit, that I was a fat taxi driver at 13-and-a-half stone, and are . you sure about this? She said to just give it a big hug.' Describing Mr Wilson as a 'thoroughly genuine and honest individual' who had done his best to give an accurate account of events leading up to the accident, the judge said of the instructor, by contrast, 'I did not find her an impressive witness'. Geoff Haden, trading as Clyne Farm Centre, was ordered to pay Mr Wilson, £167,514 damages, including £25,000 for Mr Wilson's 'pain, suffering and loss of amenity' and additional sums for his lost earnings and the extra assistance he will need due to his permanent injury. The judge said she had no doubt that Mr Wilson 'is a genuine hard-working man' who had devoted himself to the care of his wife, who was confined to a wheelchair by a childhood condition, and their four-year-old son. Lawyers for Mr Haden, a chartered structural engineer, had told the court that he had devised the assault course with the help of an army instructor and that, since it opened more than 20 years ago, it had been used by 300,000 people, half of them children, without any similar accidents having occurred.","Robert Wilson, 49, left unable to work or care for son and disabled wife .

A scrabble-loving grandmother is poised to become a bestselling author after compiling a list of high-scoring ‘wicked wee words’. Sheila John, 76, spent five years creating the list of little-known three-letter words, which include such examples as zek, pyz, and zho. These gems may be unfamiliar from everyday English, but they can reward players with up to 19 points – or far more if they  are placed on squares giving  double or triple scores for letters or words. Loves letters: Scrabble enthusiast Sheila John, 75, sets up some of the . high scoring three letter words she has compiled for her list . Mrs John, who has three grandchildren, . began writing her favourite high-scoring words down in a notepad to . help her remember them for fortnightly games at her pensioners’ group. But word got round about Mrs John’s secret weapon and soon all her opponents were asking for a copy. At first she would print out the list for friends. Now Mrs John's list is to be published in a book 'Wicked Wee Words' However, it became so popular that . eventually her printer broke down after it could take no more.  It was . then that Mrs John sought out a publisher – and to her delight they . snapped up her compilation. The book is entitled Wicked Wee Words: For Competitive Word Games. With millions of Scrabble players . across the world, the book – published in paperback and as an e-book – . is well-placed to be a bestseller on Amazon. The retired pharmacy technician from . Little Neston, Cheshire, said: ‘The book was a valuable tool for me and . my friends but I am just glad that it will be a tool for every other . Scrabble player too.’ Mrs John, who lives with husband William, uses the same Scrabble set that she bought in 1963 to play. The mother-of-three said: ‘I love Scrabble and have played it for as long as I can remember. ‘I started off with lists of words at home just for fun. 'My memory is not what it used to be. I often find a brilliant word and think ""I’m going to remember that"" but I often don’t and this solves that problem. The book was a valuable tool for me and my friends but I’m just glad it will be a tool for every other Scrabble player too. 'To be honest I only win as many games as I lose and I’m not the greatest Scrabble player in the world. For me its all about the enjoyment of playing the game. The most important thing if you want to win a game is a good night’s sleep the night before. Show off: Ms John racks up the high-scoring word 'Glycyls' which, just in case you were wondering, is the amino acid radical or residue of glycine . 'Initially I was printing out long . lists of words for friends at home but I had so many requests that my . printer gave up the ghost in the end. 'When another one broke I just . thought I would see if I could get the list published as a book and a . publisher said they would take it. 'I’m quite old to have just published . my first book but it is a thrill seeing the finished article. It was a . bit of fun and I enjoyed compiling it even though I’m not a creative . writer.

Eventually my friends could see I was using the list and they wanted one . too.’ Unlike other Scrabble dictionaries, . her book is searchable by any letter in a word, rather than just the . first letter. Focusing on short words that can be added to others on the . board, it could be a vital tactical weapon for players.

A man who served 19 years in prison for a murder he did not commit has been spared jail on drugs charges after a court heard how he developed a heroin addiction while behind bars. Worcester Crown Court was told that Vincent Hickey has spent around £150,000 servicing his addiction to drugs since his conviction for the murder of paper boy Carl Bridgewater in 1979. Hickey, 58, pleaded guilty in January this year to possessing amphetamine with intent to supply after drugs with a potential street value of £2,100 were found his freezer. He had previously admitted six other drugs charges after being found in possession of small quantities of illegal substances, including heroin, in August and October of 2011. But Judge Richard Rundell opted not to jail Mr Hickey, who was imprisoned for life in 1979 alongside three co-defendants after being found guilty of killing 13-year-old Carl near Stourbridge, West Midlands. Imposing a two-year community order, Judge Rundell told Hickey: 'Yours is an unusual, perhaps unique, case. 'You have got a long-standing addiction to heroin. We all know where you have got that, and you shouldn't have been there at the time. 'I am sorry that it happened.' Hickey was wrongly convicted of . the murder of newspaper boy Carl Bridgewater, 13, who was shot dead in . 1978 at Yew Tree Farm, Wordsley, West Midlands. He, his cousin Michael Hickey and . Jimmy Robinson were jailed for life and a fourth man, Patrick Molloy, . was jailed for manslaughter. Hickey (front second from right) in 1997 when his conviction was quashed. Hickey celebrates with his mother Anne Skett, cousin Michael and aunt Ann Whelan after his release . The quartet became known as the Bridgewater Four and after a long campaign their convictions were quashed in 1997. Under the terms of the community order, Hickey will be required to undertake a two-year drug rehabilitation programme and be supervised by probation officers for two years. Warning Hickey that the sentence was not a 'get out of jail free card', the judge added: 'If you fail to comply with the order you will be brought back and might be sentenced to prison - nobody wants to see that.' Before the sentence was handed down, defence counsel Sam Blom-Cooper submitted that Hickey's past provided unique and compelling mitigation.

The lawyer also stressed that Hickey, who lives in north Worcestershire, had pleaded guilty to possessing the amphetamine on the basis that he was merely acting as a ""custodian"" for a short time. Explaining that Hickey was now living in council accommodation and caring for his mother, Mr Blom-Cooper told the court: 'Quite clearly from both (psychiatric and pre-sentence) reports, he is a man of very limited means, although he did receive a substantial payment as compensation for the 19 years he served for an offence he did not commit.' Hickey was awarded £506,220, subject to 25 per . cent deductions to pay for their living expenses while in jail. Hickey, who is in now receipt of disability living allowance, was not ordered to pay anything towards prosecution costs of £1,200.","Vincent Hickey, 58, has been spared jail time after pleading guilty to drugs charges .

Across the Atlantic, the European horse meat scandal has swept the continent. Millions of products were pulled from store shelves in Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway after the scandal broke. On Friday, the European Union agreed to begin . random DNA checks on meat products, while British authorities announced traces of horse had been found in school meals, restaurant dishes and hospital food, as well as supermarket products. But a similar scandal is unlikely to happen in U.S., as the country no longer slaughters the animals or imports horse meat. Also, according to ABC News, none of the companies or countries implicated in the labeling controversy actually export beef to the U.S. A dump truck is filled up with blocks of meat at French meat processor Spanghero's factory. French authorities blame Spanghero for the fraud that led to the horse meat scandal . William Hallman, director of the Food Policy Institute at Rutgers University, told ABC: 'It's difficult to say that it could never happen here, but it's a lot less likely.' 'The bottom line is that no horse meat is legally being slaughtered for commerce right now in the United States,' Hallman added. Slaughtering or selling horses for meat was made illegal throughout the U.S. in 2006. Though the Congress ban was lifted in 2011, no states have yet resumed the practice. Federal laws ensure that that a USDA inspector be present at all slaughterhouses to check on the safety, hygiene and labeling of carcasses. Hallman says that even in states that had slaughtered horses before the ban, no money has been put forward to restart inspections. Dave Arnold, a food safety expert at the International Culinary Center in New York told ABC that: 'Unless you have a USDA inspector in a meat processing plant, you can't sell that meat legally,' he said. But despite the USDA checks Arnold admits that horsemeat could still enter the food supply fraudulently. 'That doesn't mean someone is not doing it illegally,' he added. Horse meat is a common sight in France, like at this Paris butchers. But it is rarely eaten in the U.S. The European crisis started in mid-January, when Ireland's food safety watchdog announced that it had discovered traces of horse DNA in burger products sold by major British and Irish supermarkets. The mislabeled products came from Irish processor Silvercrest Foods, which withdrew 10 million burgers from store shelves. Irish officials first blamed an imported powdered beef-protein additive used to pad out cheap burgers, then frozen blocks of slaughterhouse leftovers imported from Poland - an indication of the complexity of the food-supply chain that was about to be revealed to an alarmed European public. Traces of horse meat have turned up across Europe in frozen supermarket meals such as burgers and lasagna, as well as in in fresh beef pasta sauce, on restaurant menus, in school lunches and in hospital meals. On Friday, several British supermarket chains - including Morrisons and Tesco - said their tests had been negative so far. But Britain's Food Standards Agency said 29 of 2,501 products tested contained at least 1 percent horse DNA. All were burgers, lasagna and meat sauces sold by supermarkets and catering firms. Scandal: A UK lab testing beef products says that nine out of 15 samples in one batch contained horse, as well as lamb, chicken and pork in a scandal linked to abattoirs like this one in Romania . The scandal has also spread beyond . supermarket foods. Whitbread PLC, Britain's largest hotel and restaurant . company, said Friday that horse DNA had been found in lasagna and . burgers on menus at its outlets including Premier Inn hotels and Brewers . Fayre and Beefeater Grill restaurants. Whitbread said it was 'shocked . and disappointed at this failure of the processed meat supply chain.' Officials also said horse meat was . present in cottage pies delivered to 47 schools in Lancashire county, . northern England, and in hospital meals in Northern Ireland. Tests are continuing, and officials . say this is far from over. 'The more people have looked for horse meat, . the more products have been found containing it,' said Duncan Campbell, a . senior British food inspector. 'I don't think we have got to the bottom . of it yet.' European officials say the scandal is . the result of fraud, and possibly an international criminal conspiracy . to pass off cheap horse meat as more expensive beef. The French government says the chain of fraudulent meat sales reaches across 28 firms in 13 countries . Scandal: Meat from Spanghero found its way into Findus beef lasagne in Britain . At least some of the horse meat . originated at abattoirs in Romania, and was sent through a . Cyprus-registered trader to a warehouse in the Netherlands. A French meat wholesaler, Spanghero, . bought the meat from the trader, then resold it to the French frozen . food processor Comigel. The resulting food was marketed in . Britain and other countries under the Sweden-based Findus label as . lasagna and other products containing ground beef. French authorities blame Spanghero for the fraud, but it strongly denies wrongdoing. 'The responsibility started upstream,' chief executive Barthelemy Aguerre said Friday. 'We didn't want to cheat anyone.' The Romanian companies and the Dutch . trader also deny fraud. They say the meat was clearly labeled as horse . when they handled it. Dutch prosecutors said Friday that . food safety experts raided a meat processing plant as part of a criminal . investigation into horse meat fraud. Prosecutors said the company in . North Brabant province is suspected of fraud and money laundering. Findings: Dr Frank Hollywood, from the Staffordshire lab helping test beef, found contamination in 9 of 15 samples (right) The company - which was not named, in . line with Dutch privacy laws - is believed to have processed horse meat . from the Netherlands and Ireland, and mixed it with beef before selling . the mixture as 'pure' beef. Separately, British authorities have . raided five businesses - including an English slaughterhouse and a Welsh . meat processor - on suspicion of passing off horse meat as beef in . burgers and kebabs. Three men have been arrested. Horse meat itself is not harmful, and . is eaten in several European countries, including France, Germany and . Italy. In English-speaking countries including Britain and Ireland . eating horses is widely considered taboo. British officials have said that . horses slaughtered in Britain after being treated with the equine . painkiller phenylbutazone, or bute, may have made their way into the . human food chain in France. Bute is banned for human use because . in rare cases it causes severe side effects, but veterinary experts say . there is little risk from consuming small amounts in horse meat.

A post mortem examination found his neck had been broken. Anwar was jailed for life in 2009 after being convicted of murdering his partner’s toddler, Sanam Navsarka. The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of ‘unbelievable’ cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four . limbs broken. Horror: Two 'tramline' bruises showed where Sanam had been hit with this metal pole . The child, who was afraid of the dark, was ‘disciplined’ by being . repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a . tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement. Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy . rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures . remained untreated. In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she . could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered . the bloodstream, Bradford Crown Court heard. A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and . legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten . to her abdomen. Her death came only three months after married mobile phone salesman . Anwar met the child’s mother Zahbeena Navsarka at the shop where he . worked in Huddersfield. Anwar had sex with Navsarka in the back of the shop on the day they met . and he swiftly left his pregnant wife to move in with his new lover. To . cover their tracks after the child died in 2008, they told detectives . she was left alone in the bath for ten minutes and was found dead. But Anwar, described as brutal and domineering, was convicted and jailed . for a minimum of 23 years. Navsarka was cleared of her daughter’s . murder but found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in . prison. Judge Peter Thornton QC said it was a ‘truly terrible case’ and told the . defendants: ‘It is almost unbelievable the pain and anguish she must . have suffered, not just once or twice, but repeatedly and persistently . over weeks at your cruel and selfish hands.’ He added: ‘Your deliberate cruelty is beyond belief.

A third former teacher at Chetham's School of Music was today being investigated over sexual allegations against his former pupils, after ten women came forward to claim they were abused. Violin teacher Chris Ling, 55, who now lives in Los Angeles, California, allegedly inappropriately touched teenage girls and asked them to play naked for him, some of the women told a newspaper. One former pupil at the prestigious music school in Manchester claimed to the Guardian that Mr Ling spanked her bare bottom when she made a mistake, while another said he massaged her breasts. Under fire: A trial heard sexual abuse was 'rife' at elite academy Chetham's School of Music in Manchester . The allegations come after Michael Brewer, 68, was convicted on Friday of sexually abusing Frances Andrade, 48, who killed herself after giving evidence against her former music teacher at the school. Brewer's ex-wife Kay, 68, was also found guilty of indecently assaulting the mother of four when she was 18. Mrs Andrade’s body was found at her home one week after she gave evidence last month. A five-month investigation was launched into Mr Ling in 1990 by Greater Manchester Police, which was passed onto the Director of Public Prosecutions - but it was dropped for unknown reasons. The force told the Guardian on Friday that it had not yet found the relevant files to establish why the probe was closed, but a source confirmed to MailOnline today that the force is investigating allegations concerning Mr Ling. Greater Manchester Police said some women had come to them with allegations about Chetham's and it will be working very closely with the school, reported ITV News. The force added that it had been provided with a list of potential victims by a newspaper, but they have not yet been formally interviewed, and the investigation is at a very early stage. Facing jail: Michael Brewer (left), 68, was convicted on Friday of sexually abusing Frances Andrade, 48. Brewer's ex-wife Kay (right), 68, was also found guilty of indecently assaulting the mother of four . Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson said: ‘Following the conclusion of the trial last week there has been substantial press coverage and comment. ‘Greater Manchester Police has since been provided with a list of potential victims from a newspaper. In addition to this, several people have also come forward directly to police. 'Greater Manchester Police has been provided with a list of potential victims from a newspaper. In addition to this, several people have also come forward directly to police' Chief Superintendent Russ Jackson . ‘Reporting sexual abuse which occurred some time ago is an incredibly difficult thing to do, so we will be affording them, and anyone else who comes forward, all the appropriate time and support to discuss events in their own time. ‘We will be working very closely with the school in the coming weeks and months but I must stress this investigation is at a very early stage. ‘We have specially trained officers on hand to deal with any complaints sensitively and expeditiously and I would encourage any victim of sexual abuse regardless of when or where the offence occurred to call us.’ Last week, the current headteacher of Chetham's, Claire Moreland, said the revelations of Brewer's impropriety had ‘shocked us to the core’. Mr Ling’s lawyer told The People newspaper in March 1991 when it reported on claims against him: ‘More credence could be attached to rumours that Saddam Hussein has won the Nobel peace prize.’ 'More credence could be attached to rumours that Saddam Hussein has won the Nobel peace prize' Response to allegations in 1991 by Chris Ling's lawyer . An ex-student who once travelled with him to the U.S. also dampened the claims in 1991, saying: ‘Mr Ling is a wonderful teacher. I know what people are saying I don’t believe a word if it.’ MailOnline has approached Mr Ling for comment at his home in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, but nobody answered the door. A spokesman for Chetham's said: 'The police are now investigating the allegations of abuse at the school in the 1980s which have been the subject of recent newspaper reports. We will be assisting the police in whatever way we can. 'While this investigation is ongoing it would not be appropriate for the school to comment any further, save to say that we encourage anyone who has any relevant information to contact Greater Manchester Police on 101, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.' Meanwhile, last night an academic who . was also a pupil at Chetham’s around the same time as Mrs Andrade, . called for a wider inquiry into sexual abuse at music schools in the . Seventies and Eighties. Ian Pace, a pianist and musicologist who . lectures at City University in Islington, central London, said the world of classical music . was controlled by just a few influential people. Tragic: Frances Andrade, 48, killed herself after giving evidence against her former music teacher at the school . He said: ‘It is well known within the music world that there are many other such stories involving a variety of individuals in positions of power at various music schools. ‘Many of these people are extremely afraid to come forward with their stories, in a close-knit world of classical music in which careers are dependent upon the whims of a few powerful individuals. ‘A full independent inquiry into sexual and physical abuse in classical music education during this time is now absolutely paramount.’ Greater Manchester Police said it wants to hear from anyone who may have fallen victim to sexual abuse at the music school. The trial heard sexual abuse was ‘rife’ at elite music academy Chetham’s. Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘It was normal for us. Several friends of mine had been raped.’ Levine Andrade, 59, said his wife Frances was devastated at being called a liar by the prosecution when she told the court of the historic sex abuse by Brewer. Mr Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s when he began abusing his victim, then 14, in 1978. Mrs Andrade was found dead at her Surrey home after giving evidence against the Brewers. Jurors were not told about her death until after they found the pair guilty of six counts of sexual assault. Brewer and his ex-wife were remanded in custody and will be sentenced at a later date.

The remains of the body found in a remote cabin razed to the ground have been positively identified as fugitive ex-LAPD officer Christopher Dorner . Authorities say fugitive former cop Christopher Dorner died of a single gunshot wound to the head as authorities were pumping . tear gas into a mountain cabin during a deadly gun battle with sheriff's . deputies. San Bernardino County sheriff's Capt. Sheriff John McMahon told reporters Friday that it appears the wound was self-inflicted. Deputies said they heard one final gunshot from the cabin as it was going up in flames during Tuesday's gunbattle. Before he died, Dorner killed one sheriff's deputy and wounded another during a fierce shootout. Authorities . initially were unsure whether Dorner killed himself, had been struck by . a deputy's bullet or had died in a fire that engulfed the cabin during . the shootout. The search for Dorner began last week after authorities said he had launched a deadly revenge campaign against the Los Angeles Police Department for his firing, warning that he would bring 'warfare' to LAPD officers and their families. The manhunt brought police to Big Bear Lake, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, where they found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck abandoned. His footprints disappeared on frozen soil and hundreds of officers who searched the area and checked out each building failed to find him. This is the cellar of the burned out cabin where the remains of multiple murder suspect and former Los Angeles Police Department officer Christopher Dorner were found . This Remington Model 700 with the word 'Vengeance' printed on it belonged to fugitive former police officer Christopher Dorner . A statue of an angel stands on a wood column in front of the burned out cabin . Five days later, but just a stone's throw from a command post authorities had set up in the massive manhunt, Karen and Jim Reynolds said they came face to face with Dorner inside their cabin-style condo. The couple said Dorner bound them and put pillowcases on their heads. At one point, he explained that he had been there for days. 'He said `I don't have a problem with you, so I'm not going to hurt you,'' Jim Reynolds said. 'I didn't believe him; I thought he was going to kill us.' Scroll down for video .

Police have not commented on the Reynolds' account, but it renews questions about the thoroughness of a search for a man who authorities declared was armed and extremely dangerous as they hunted him across the Southwest and Mexico. 'They said they went door-to-door but then he's right there under their noses. Makes you wonder if the police even knew what they were doing,' resident Shannon Schroepfer said. 'He was probably sitting there laughing at them the whole time.' The notion of him holed up just across the street from the command post was shocking to many, but not totally surprising to some experts familiar with the complications of such a manhunt.

That's the only word I could use for that,' said Ed Tatosian, a retired SWAT commander for the Sacramento Police Department. 'It's not an unfathomable oversight. We're human. It happens. It's chilling (that) it does happen.' Candy Martin, the owner of the remote mountain cabin, said she was helpless as the building in the San Bernardino National Forest became the center of a raging gun battle on Tuesday that killed one sheriff's deputy, wounded another wounded and left the fugitive murder suspect Christopher Dorner dead. Ms Martin said she flipped on the television on Tuesday afternoon and realized that the cabins featured on the breaking news coverage of the standoff looked familiar. Destroyed: This is the destroyed wreckage of the cabin where Christopher Dorner made his last stand in San Bernardino National Forest .

'And we’re looking and we say, ""Oh these are cabins, these look like,"" and there’s no doubt that those are my cabins,' she told NBC 4 in Los Ageles. Ms Martin bought the Seven Oaks Cabins, situation in the forest about 20 miles from Big Bear, California, in 2005 as a mountain getaway for her extended family. 'It’s hard for me to imagine him in there. And I did do that. I imagined, what is he doing? What room is he in?' she told the TV station. The home had solid wood paneling and floors and contained a lot of history, It was built in 1928 and the compound was the set for several movies and TV shows, Ms Martin said. Watching the home burn to the ground on live TV was the hardest part, she said. 'Then the fire. Oh my gosh,' Ms Martin said. 'That was heart wrenching to see, the fire. I just started crying. I couldn’t talk at that point.' Presumed dead: Police have found charred remains in the basement of the cabin that they believe belong to Christopher Dorner - though no positive ID has yet been made . Mountain retreat: Ms Martin rents out several of the cabins as a peaceful, quiet mountain retreat . Standoff: This is the Seven Oaks property where Dorner barricaded himself inside Ms Martin's family cabin . Ms Martin said that when her family is not staying on the mountain in the cabins, she rents out several of the buildings to tourists and advertises the site as a tranquil, peaceful mountain paradise. 'Leave behind the stress and smog of the big city.  Be our guest in a cabin nestled in the woods and on the banks of the Santa Ana River,' the website reads. However, several online reviewers have begun posting outrageous comments in the wake of the siege. 'The underground tunnel feature is just great! Comes in handy!' wrote one reviewer on the Yahoo Travel site for the Seven Oaks cabins. 'A little hot today. The rates are very reasonalbe [sic] since I didn't pay anyway. Good luck on the renovation,' a user calling himself 'Great SPOT for a BBQ' writes. Dorner barricaded himself inside the cabin after a series of dramatic police chases and shootouts on Tuesday afternoon. Taking cover: Heavily-armed officers surrounded the property and took cover around the other cabins . Killed: Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot dead during the standoff with Dorner . The former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant made his way to Big Bear, 100 miles east of Los Angeles, last Thursday after he went on a revenge killing spree that left three people dead. He is believed to have shot dead the daughter of a former LAPD captain who defended him at a police review board hearing where Dorner was fired in 2009. Monica Quand was found murdered in her car in Irvine, along with her fiance Keith Lawrence on February 3. Last Thursday, he wounded an LAPD officer in a shootout and then ambushed two Riverside police - killing Officer Michael Crain and gravely wounded a second patrolman. Later that afternoon, Dorner's burning truck was found in the woods outside Big Bear. Despite an intense police search of the area for several days, Dorner was revealed to be hiding in vacant condos just across the street from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's command post. On Tuesday, he surfaced after five days of hiding and tied up a couple after breaking into their home. He stole their SUV, but crashed it during a police pursuit. Dorner then carjacked a Boy Scout leader's truck. He abandoned the vehicle and fled for Ms Martin's cabins after a shootout with a California game warden. San Bernardino SWAT officers surrounded the cabin and engaged Dorner in a raging firefight. Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot and killed when Dorner tried to make an escape. A second deputy was gravely wounded. View more videos at: http://nbclosangeles.com.","Remains of fugitive murder suspect positively identified as those of ex-LAPD officer Christopher Dorner .

A politician is set to fight an election against a man once accused of helping the IRA murder his father. Nigel Lutton, a Northern Ireland Unionist, will run against Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy in what could prove to be a dramatic Westminster by-election campaign. Mr Molloy has been publicly accused of being involved in the shooting of Mr Lutton's father Frederick. Contest: Nigel Lutton, left, will compete for a Westminster seat against Francie Molloy, right, a man once accused of helping the IRA murder his father in 1979 . The 40-year-old former police reservist was gunned down by the IRA at the height of the Troubles in May 1979. Mr Lutton, who was eight-years-old at the time of his father's murder, later said: 'They had assault rifles, really heavy-duty stuff - they just emptied high-velocity rounds into him'. In 2007, Democratic Unionist MP David Simpson used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to name Mr Molloy as having been a suspect in the case and a police informant. Mr Molloy has strenuously denied the accusations. The decision by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) to run a unionist unity candidate with the DUP sparked the resignation of two more members. Basil McCrea and John McCallister stepped aside when the party decided to put forward Mr Lutton in the Mid-Ulster Westminster by-election on March 7 which has been vacated by the resignation of Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness last month. Leader Mike Nesbitt said the departures were a matter of huge regret. Mr McCrea said: 'This is not sour grapes; this is not self-interest, this is a principled stand to do what is right and it will be in the hands of the electorate and the electorate alone to decide if we have made the right call.' Mr McCrea has been at odds with the UUP leadership and Mike Nesbitt for some time, having led a failed bid for the top position. He criticised the party over its handling of issues linked to the Union flag dispute and faced a disciplinary panel earlier this year, which cautioned him about recent media comments. He announced his resignation on the BBC's Nolan Show. The Democratic Unionists and UUP said Mr Lutton received unanimous support.","Unionist Nigel Lutton to face Sinn Fein's Francie Molloy in by-election .

Barclays' shareholders could have been misled over a £3billion investment by the owner of Manchester City F.C., it was alleged today. The bank said in 2008 that Sheikh Mansour had agreed to invest the money, which helped it avoid a taxpayer bailout - but, in fact, the money came from Abu Dhabi’s government. Sheikh Mansour was said to be providing half of a £7billion input, but BBC Panorama found that Barclays was told the investor might change shortly before shareholders backed the deal. Investment: Sheikh Mansour was said to be providing half of a £7billion input, but BBC Panorama found that Barclays was told the investor might change shortly before shareholders backed the deal . The bank allegedly decided to remain silent until this change was confirmed a few hours later. It claimed to have later provided ‘appropriate disclosure’ in three prospectuses released the next day. But this was allegedly buried in the small print, and still referred to ‘his investment’ in respect of Sheikh Mansour, despite knowing he was not in fact investing in the bank, reported BBC Panorama. He was still referred to as the investor in the 2008 and 2009 annual reports. Barclays claimed this was a ‘drafting error’ and the prospectus information was ‘appropriate in all the circumstances’. A Barclays spokesman said: 'We have repeatedly demonstrated to Panorama why the allegations which they plan to make in their programme are completely unjustified. 'Barclays is satisfied that the steps taken to disclose the change in ownership of the companies which were investing in the bank in 2008 were entirely appropriate. The change in ownership of the investing companies had no bearing on the transaction or required approvals.' Sheikh Mansour has an estimated wealth of around £20billion. The investment happened at a time of global economic meltdown, when RBS and Lloyds TSB had to ask the Government for a bailout. Changes: Barclays boss Antony Jenkins is to scrap the company's tax avoidance unit in a bid to move away from the bank's scandal-hit past . The Panorama programme comes as it was . revealed the bank will shut down a controversial unit used to slash . tax bills in a bid to ‘shred’ the legacy left by former boss Bob . Diamond. Critics last night welcomed the move but baulked at the idea that the lender has had a ‘Road to Damascus moment’ over its ethics. Barclays, which is fighting to salvage its reputation after a string of scandals, will unveil the plans after its financial results tomorrow, when it counts the cost of its wrongdoing. It is expected to slash up to 2,000 ‘casino bankers’ at its investment arm Barclays Capital as part of a shake-up. But in its most eye-catching bid to convince the public that it is improving its culture, it will also announce the closure of its structured capital markets business. This secretive division helps companies avoid tax through a network of offshore tax havens and was previously run by its highest-paid banker Roger Jenkins. But it has also been used by Barclays to cut its own tax bill in the UK, heaping pressure on ordinary households to bridge the £32billion annual shortfall in HM Revenue & Customs’ coffers. Last year it was ordered by the Treasury to repay half a billion pounds after being caught out using two ‘aggressive’ loopholes to avoid paying tax. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins will describe the activities of its tax-avoidance arm as ‘legal’ but ‘incompatible with our purpose’, pledging ‘a new approach for a new era of banking’. In the closest the bank has come to admitting widespread tax avoidance, he will admit that in some cases the unit ‘relied on sophisticated and complex structures, where transactions were carried out with the primary objective of accessing the tax benefits’. He will say: ‘We get it. The old ways weren’t the right way to behave nor did they deliver the right results – for banks themselves or for wider society. Job cuts: The move will see some 2,000 investment banking jobs axed by the firm . ‘There must be a new approach for a new era of banking. Banks that fail to change will become failing banks. My message is Barclays is changing.’ The move comes amid fresh accusations that Barclays helped clients avoid tax on an ‘industrial’ scale. In the Panorama investigation aired on BBC One tonight, a former insider will claim that the small team of 100 staff at the structured capital markets unit would share huge rewards from the profits of tax avoidance deals. Scandal: The closure is part of Mr Jenkins' drive to 'shred' the legacy left by former boss Bob Diamond who resigned following the bank's £290 million Libor rigging settlement last year . ‘Some tax restructuring is common in a lot of banks, and there’s nothing wrong with it. The issue is they turned it into an industry within the bank.’ The tax avoidance arm was run by Roger Jenkins, a former boyfriend of supermodel Elle Macpherson, who made as much as £40million a year before leaving the bank in 2009. Mr Jenkins, 57, is also one of several current and former Barclays executives being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office and the City watchdog over fees paid to Middle East investors during the financial crisis. Campaigners welcomed Barclays’ decision to close its tax avoidance arm but said it needed to be accompanied with a reform of the system to make it harder for companies to dodge tax. Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Companies shutting down controversial units might ease public anger but it doesn’t solve the problem of our broken tax system. ' 'Until it is reformed the public will remain deeply unhappy when they see companies able to exploit relief and loopholes simply not open to the rest of us.’ Chief executive Mr Jenkins admitted to the banking commission of MPs and peers last week that the overhaul of his bank amounted to ‘shredding’ the legacy left by his predecessor Mr Diamond. He admitted that an ‘aggressive’ and ‘self-serving’ culture had developed under the American. Barclays last night said it paid its fair share of tax in the UK, having paid £300million of corporation tax on profits of £1billion in 2011.","Barclays said in 2008 that Sheikh Mansour had agreed to invest money .

A mother caught trying to save her son from speeding points was jailed for two months yesterday. Susan Sherwood, 49, of Luton, Bedfordshire, tried to fool the authorities that a friend she claimed was over from New Zealand had been driving her Honda when it was captured by an M1 camera. She even provided the name of the man and his address in Auckland City - but they were fictional and the actual driver in December 2011 was her 24-year-old son Sam, Luton Crown Court heard. Speeding: It was 10.20pm on December 1, 2011 when Sherwood's Honda car was clocked between junctions 13 and 12 doing 60mph in a 50mph section of the M1 in Bedfordshire, prosecutors said . It was 10.20pm on December 1, 2011 when Sherwood's Honda car was clocked between junctions 13 and 12 doing 60mph in a 50mph section of the M1 in Bedfordshire, Daniel Siong, prosecuting, said. The vehicle was registered to the mother, and her son was a named driver. Contacted by letter, she at first claimed various people could have been the driver and she couldn't provide further details. When she received a second letter she wrote back in January 2012 naming a ‘Mr Moderich’, whom she said was a friend from New Zealand, and provided his address. She claimed she lent him the car while he was in the UK to visit people he knew in Northampton. Mrs Sherwood asked in correspondence to see a photograph of the car when it was caught speeding, the court heard. It was late at night and the quality of the picture was grainy. Judge David Farrell QC said it was mother ‘testing the water’ to see if it was possible to make out who was driving. Mr Siong said police then tried to . establish if Mr Moderich was a real person. Further enquiries with her . insurers revealed nobody by that name was entitled under the policy to . drive her car. Vehicle: This is a picture of a Honda car parked in Mrs Sherwood's driveway in Luton, Bedfordshire, on her son Sam Sherwood's Facebook page. It is believed to be Mrs Sherwood's Honda car that was clocked on the M1 . As a result of that, she was summonsed to Bedford Magistrates' Court for permitting a car to be used with no insurance. But last July Mrs Sherwood finally came clean about who had been driving. She said she had subsequently discovered it was her son Sam who had been the driver. Last September the mother was arrested for perverting the course of justice. Mr Siong said the prosecution accepted she had been trying to save her son incurring penalty points which would have affected his car insurance. The offence had arisen out of a ‘mother's desire to protect her son’, Charles Judge, defending, said. He added that every day since the incident Mrs Sherwood wished she could turn back the clock. Judge Farrell QC jailed her for nine weeks, saying that her that her case had been made worse by the persistence with which she continued to lie and the planning that was involved. The judge said her offending struck at the ‘very root of the penalty point system.’ Mrs Sherwood, who pleaded guilty to a charge of perverting the course of justice, sobbed as she was led from court.","Susan Sherwood, 49, of Luton, Bedfordshire, tried to fool the authorities .

Staff locked themselves in a back office as the man, who was also wearing mustard-coloured trousers, stole the money from behind the counter and ran off at around 4:45pm on January 26. Elephant Man: The offender, who used a grey T-shirt with two eye holes cut out to cover his head, escaped with around £350 after threatening staff at a Coral store in Streetly, West Midlands . Disguise: Staff locked themselves in a back office as the man, who was also wearing mustard-coloured trousers, stole the money from behind the counter and ran off at around 4:45pm on January 26 . Detective Constable Martin Beebee, from the Bloxwich Criminal Investigation Department of West Midlands Police, said: ‘This is one of the most unusual masked robbers we have encountered. ‘He can only be described as looking like the Elephant man. It’s surprising he was able to see anything at all through this make-shift mask. ‘However this was a disturbing incident for the members of staff who did the right thing by securing their safety and contacting police. We are appealing to members of the public to help us find the man responsible.

His skeleton has been preserved at a hospital since his death at the age of 27 in 1890 after a life of being regarded as a freak in Victorian society, and in 1980 a film was made about his condition. In 2001 there was speculation that, rather than Elephantiasis, Mr Merrick suffered from a rare disease called Proteus Syndrome which causes skin overgrowth and abnormal bone development. Mr Merrick was born apparently healthy, but as he grew up his lips thickened and a bony lump grew on his forehead. The weight of his head forced him to sleep sitting up and his speech was slurred. Mr Merrick used to disguise his disfigured face with a hat and mask to avoid attracting attention.","The robber walked into Coral shop on Jan. 26 in Streetly, West Midlands .

Google was today facing the prospect of being forced to remove offending posts on the Blogger website after a judge ‘opened the door’ for the firm being required to monitor what users write. The California-based internet giant convinced London’s Court of Appeal in a libel case that Blogger is the equivalent of a blank wall and it cannot be held responsible for what is written there by people. But the court ruled in the case involving law student Payam Tamiz that it was arguable Google was a ‘publisher’ in defamation law, and therefore responsible for offending comments once told of them. Court ruling: Google was today facing the prospect of being forced to remove offending posts on Blogger . However the court's decision will come as little comfort to former Conservative Party hopeful Mr Tamiz, who was vilified on Blogger by entirely false allegations of drug dealing and dishonesty. His epic legal tangle with Google, which was first reported by MailOnline one year ago, has so far only earned him a huge legal costs bill - £30,000 of which he must find within the next two weeks. Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Sullivan, upheld Google's arguments that Blogger is a ‘purely passive wall’ with no responsibility for internet ‘graffiti’. Mr Tamiz's plea that Google was a primary publisher of the smears was rejected as ‘misplaced’ by the judge, who said it only operates as a ‘facilitator’, enabling other people to express their views. Google could not be compared to an author or editor and the judge said he was also ‘very doubtful’ that it could be viewed as a ‘secondary publisher’, in a similar way to a libellous article ‘distributor’. However, the judge went on to rule that Google and others do have a responsibility to remove offending material from their sites within a reasonable time of a complaint of libel being received. Contest: The court ruled in a case involving law student Payam Tamiz (pictured) that it was arguable Google was a 'publisher' in defamation law, and therefore responsible for offending comments once notified . He said that if Google failed to act swiftly enough, it might be inferred to have associated itself, or made itself responsible for, a libellous post. It would at that point become responsible as a publisher and could be sued. In Mr Tamiz’s case the libellous posts had been taken down and - although he argued Google failed to do that quickly enough - the judge ruled that ‘the game would not be worth the candle’ if his libel case went ahead. 'Google's position is that it had no control over the content of the material posed on the “London Muslim” blog. It was not the publisher of that material but a neutral service provider' Antony White QC, for Google . During the very brief period in which Google could conceivably have been held liable, the judge said it was ‘highly improbable that any significant number of readers’ would have seen the comments prior to their removal. Mr Tamiz was suing Google over anonymous comments made in reaction to a posting on the ‘London Muslim’ blog. Amongst other things, he was accused - without justification - of being a drug dealer and having stolen from his employers. Dismissing his claim last year, top libel judge Mr Justice Eady said: ‘It is no doubt often true that the owner of a wall which has been festooned, overnight, with defamatory graffiti could acquire scaffolding and have it all deleted with whitewash’. But he added: ‘That is not necessarily to . say, however, that the unfortunate owner must, unless and until this . has been accomplished, be classified as a publisher’. Search engine: Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Sullivan, upheld Google's arguments that Blogger is a 'purely passive wall' with no responsibility for internet 'graffiti' The libel claim brought by Mr Tamiz, who in 2011 stood as a Tory candidate in local elections in Thanet, Kent, was left dead in the water by the ruling, even though nobody had suggested the accusations made against him were even ‘remotely true’. On appeal, Godwin Busutill, for Mr Tamiz, had argued for an extension of libel laws to police the melting pot of the internet. 'Little that happens on the internet is genuinely 'automatic' or 'passive'... the notion that the internet runs 'automatically' or 'passively' is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as Google' Godwin Busutill, for Payam Tamiz . He said: ‘Little that happens on the internet is genuinely ""automatic"" or ""passive""... the notion that the internet runs ""automatically"" or ""passively"" is in essence a powerful myth which has been fostered very successfully and profitably by internet superpowers such as Google. ‘It suits their business model to take and to be seen to be taking a “hands off” approach and not really able to do anything about problems that may be generated by their internet-based operations.’ However, Antony White QC, for Google, argued: ‘Blogger.com is a platform that allows any internet user around the world to create his or her own independent blog, free of charge. ‘It is a piece of computer technology... Google does not create, select, solicit, censor or approve the content of a blog, which is published and controlled only the blog owner or blogger. Analogy: Mr Justice Eady said the owner of wall which has been covered in defamatory graffiti could have it taken off with whitewash, but added that the owner should not be classified as a publisher until then . ‘Google's position is...that it had no . control over the content of the material posed on the “London Muslim” blog. It was not the publisher of that material but a neutral service . provider.’ His appeal dismissed, Mr Tamiz was ordered to pay 50 per cent of Google's legal costs. He will have to pay £30,000 on account within 14 days, but that is likely to be only a fraction of the final bill he will face. 'The ruling does open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the Court of Appeal in this case and run with them. But we are not there yet. In the meantime, Google and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases' Adam Wagner, barrister and UK Human Rights Blog editor . Adam Wagner, barrister and editor of the UK Human Rights Blog, told MailOnline: ‘The court did not rule that Google is legally obliged to take down offending posts once they are notified of them - in this regard, the judgment has little or no legal effect on Google. ‘The court did rule that it was arguable that Google was a ""publisher"" in defamation law, and therefore responsible for defamatory comments once notified of them. ‘Google in fact won this case, because even if it had been potentially liable under defamation law, the offending comment only had a ""trivial"" effect. ‘The ruling does, however, open the door for a future case where a court might take up the comments of the Court of Appeal in this case and run with them. ‘But we are not there yet. In the meantime, Google and other similar companies will rightly be worried that they may be liable in similar future cases.’ A Google spokesman told MailOnline: 'Google helps spread knowledge, enabling people to find out about almost anything by typing a few words into a computer. 'And services like Blogger, YouTube and Google+ help users to express themselves and share different points of view. Where content is illegal or violates our terms of service we will continue to remove it.'","Google says Blogger is blank wall and it isn't responsible for writings online .

Death: Briton Tim Hetherington was unlawfully killed during the Libyan civil war after being killed by shrapnel from pro-Gaddafi mortar fire . The bereft mother of award-winning British photojournalist Tim Hetherington, who was killed covering the Libyan civil war, today described him as a 'wonderful humanitarian'. The Oscar-nominated film-maker and war photographer was capturing images of fighting between Colonel Gaddafi’s forces and Libyan rebels in Misrata when he was caught in a mortar attack on April 20 2011. His American colleague Chris Hondros, 41, was also killed in the attack, while a number of other journalists including British photographer Guy Martin were injured by flying shrapnel. Speaking after an inquest into his death at Westminster Coroner’s Court today, his mother Judith cried as she said: 'He was an image maker and storyteller, that is how he liked to be described. 'He was a wonderful humanitarian.' The court heard that Mr Hetherington had arrived in Misrata on April 17 with a small group of photographers. On April 20, they came under heavy fire while seeking images along Tripoli Street in the company of rebel fighters. In a written statement, Mr Martin said: 'The fighting and level of violence we witnessed that morning was catastrophic, with hand-to-hand fighting, grenades being thrown, buildings being set on fire with loyalist troops still inside and incoming mortar fire coming from miles away.' Mr Martin, who is based in Istanbul, Turkey, said that after the battle seemed to have finished Mr Hetherington and the rest of the group 'considered we had pushed our luck that day'. They went back to their base and had different views on what they should do with the rest of their day. But Mr Hetherington argued that they should stay with the rebel fighters and it was his view which prevailed, the court heard. Returning to Tripoli Street to take pictures of the damage that had been done, the group found themselves caught up in a second battle. Judith and Alistair Hetherington, parents of the late photojournalist, arriving at Westminster Coroners Court in London for an inquest into his death. Mrs Hetherington described her son as 'an image maker and storyteller' Attack: The Oscar-nominated photo-journalist was killed during violent fighting in the Libyan town of Misrata (pictured) in April 2011 . Describing the fatal attack, Mr Martin said: 'For a brief mili-second I saw Chris (Hondros) stumble in front me - I looked up and was surrounded by thick grey dust. 'The ground seemed to be on fire as smoke rose up from the pavement. 'I could see my legs were still attached to my body but I could hear little and began to lose consciousness.' Mr Martin said he only found out about the deaths of Mr Hetherington and Mr Hondros from another journalist as he was trying to flee the country a week later. The court heard that New York Times reporter and former US marine Chris Chivers had inspected the scene afterwards. Mr Chivers concluded that the mortar attack which killed Mr Hetherington had come from loyalist forces. Recording a verdict of unlawful killing, deputy Westminster coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'He was not a soldier, he was an innocent photographer.' Talented: Tim Hetherington won first Prize in the Portraits Stories category in the World Press Photo 2002 contest for this image called 'School for the Blind', taken in Sierra Leone . She determined the cause of death had been a 'massive haemorrhage' caused by shrapnel from mortar fire which injured his legs. Mr Hetherington, who was 40 when he died and based in Kensington, London, was born in Liverpool and studied literature at Oxford University. Having lived in New York, he had dual British and American nationality and had been covering conflict zones in countries such as Liberia and Sierra Leone since the late 1990s. Best known for his work in Afghanistan, in 2007 he won the prestigious World Press Photo of the Year Award. His time there also led to his creation of the 2010 Oscar-nominated documentary Restrepo. Showing the lives of the men of a battle company of the 173rd Airborne in the Korengal Valley, the film won the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The photographer, whose first job was as a trainee at the Big Issue in London, also made short films about the soldiers he met in Korengal and released a book of pictures called Infidel.","Tim Hetherington, 40, died after being hit in the legs in Misrata in April 2011 .

After three centuries under the sea, you can only imagine what stories these rare coins might hold. Real-life pieces of eight are going under the hammer next Wednesday in Etwall, Derbyshire, after being recovered from the wreckage of a British ship used at the Capture of Gibraltar in 1704. The rare coins were recovered from HMS Association, which launched from Portsmouth in 1697 but sank in 1707 off the Isles of Scilly in what was called the 'greatest maritime disaster of the age'. Rare coins: One of the finds was a 17th century Spanish 'Cob' (left) and another was a piece of eight (right) Amazing find: The rare coins were recovered from HMS Association, which launched from Portsmouth in 1697 but sank in 1707 off the Isles of Scilly in what was called the 'greatest maritime disaster of the age' Remarkable: Hanson head porter Karl Martin poses with a piece of eight (left) and Spanish 'Cob' (right) The Isles of Scilly is known for having one of the highest concentrations of shipwrecks in the country, with 530 registered wrecks around the archipelago, but their most famous is the Association. HMS Association was a 96-gun ship of . the line weighing 1,459 tons and served as the flagship of naval officer . Sir Clowdisley Shovell during the War of the . Spanish Succession. The war, which involved . various European countries including Britain, lasted from 1701 to 1714 . and was fought over the feared joining of Spain and France under one . monarch. HMS Association sank in 1707 when Captain Edmund Loades was returning from the Mediterranean . with 20 other ships which entered the mouth of the English Channel. She struck the Outer Gilstone Rock off . the Isles of Scilly, and lost her entire crew of 800 men. It was . believed that the ship had lost its way due to . navigational errors. The wreck was left at the bottom of the ocean until it was dredged up in 1967, and held many treasures -  including the two pictured rare coins, which were the currency of pirates. One was a 17th century Spanish ‘Cob’. This unusually-shaped coin details the history of Spain, as the currency was cut crudely into shapes of an accurate weight in preparation for its melting down and usage in jewellery. Also uncovered from the wreck was an example of the infamous ‘piece of eight’, which was known as the world’s first global currency, used across the Spanish Empire and often outside as well. The legacy of these coins endures, and in Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous novel Treasure Island, Long John Silver’s parrot had been trained to cry out ‘pieces of eight’. In Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, a boy is sold for 60 pieces of eight, despite Crusoe admitting: ‘I was very loth to sell the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my own.’ A spokesman for Hanson Auctioneers & Valuers said: 'The sole association of pieces of eight . and pirates has grown, and now they are commonly used in films such as . the Pirates of the Caribbean.' The piece of eight and Spanish 'Cob' coins are only expected to fetch up to £50 together, with the auctioneer telling MailOnline that this was a reflection of the price a wholesaler is likely to pay.","Real-life pieces of eight are going under the hammer in Etwall, Derbyshire .

A popular 12-year-old schoolboy nicknamed ‘little Superman’ was found hanging in his bedroom by his brother after his mother confiscated his mobile phone, an inquest heard today. Cain Westcarr, of Gloucester, had spent two days arguing with his mother Veronica Lee, and was discovered just 40 minutes after saying he was going to his room to listen to music. Beaufort School student Cain was later pronounced dead at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, but the inquest heard his act may have been a cry for help and he had not intended to take his life. Tragic schoolboy: Cain Westcarr, of Gloucester, had spent two days arguing with his mother Veronica Lee, and was discovered just 40 minutes after saying he was going to his room to listen to music . The coroner said it was a tragic case and children sometimes don’t understand the consequences of their actions. Miss Lee had taken his phone from him one morning in June last year at their home. She tearfully told the inquest: ‘I don't think he actually wanted to kill himself. I don't think he wanted to live the life he had any more but I don't think he wanted to die. I think it was a cry for help.’ Detective Sergeant Mark Steinhouse, of Gloucestershire Police, said there were no suspicious circumstances and explained that Miss Lee had told his colleagues of the incident with the phone. ‘It was officers at the hospital who spoke to Veronica and they relayed back to myself at the address as to where the phone was,’ Detective Sergeant Steinhouse told Gloucestershire Coroners’ Court. ‘We recovered the phone and had (it) examined and didn't find anything on there of any relevance.’ The hearing was also read extracts of Cain's school report, which praised the youngster for being a ‘well respected and popular pupil’ who was ‘respectful’ and an ‘avid reader’. Home: Cain was found hanging on this road in Gloucester just 40 minutes after saying he was going to his room . The inquest heard evidence from Jackie Geatches, a family support worker at St Paul's Primary School, who knew Cain and his siblings. 'I don't think he actually wanted to kill himself. I don't think he wanted to live the life he had any more but I don't think he wanted to die. I think it was a cry for help' Veronica Lee, mother of Cain Westcarr . Assistant Deputy Coroner Tom Osborne asked her: ‘In an incident which must happen probably hundreds and thousands of times every day throughout the country, a parent takes the mobile phone away for a short period or even if it's only until such time as you've cleaned and tidied your room or until you've done your homework, how would Cain react to that?’ She replied: ‘He probably would have been angry with his mum for taking it and perhaps sulked about it.’ Describing how she heard the news of Cain's death, Mrs Geatches said: ‘I didn't believe it at first when I heard. For one minute I don't believe Cain wanted to take his life. ‘I actually think he wanted to inflict pain upon himself. That's how I interpret it. He wanted to see how much pain he could stand and unfortunately it ended in his death.’ A post-mortem examination found Cain had died from hanging. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death and said he could not be satisfied that Cain had intended to take his own life. Treatment: The 12-year-old schoolboy was pronounced dead at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital last June . ‘I hear that he is a young man with attitude, not a bad thing,’ Mr Osborne said. ‘In my own school reports I can remember people saying “attitude retarding progress” and it didn't seem to do me any harm. 'He obviously wanted to inflict pain upon himself or indeed pain upon his mother... ""I'll show you"" sort of attitude... ""you've taken my phone away""' Assistant Deputy Coroner Tom Osborne . ‘Part of that was mum taking his phone away from him in order to tidy his room or do something he needed to do.' Mr Osborne said he did not think Cain understood that 'if you are dead today, you are dead tomorrow'. He added: ‘They (some children) don't realise, perhaps sometimes it's not a question of re-booting the computer and they all come back to life. ‘He obviously wanted to inflict pain upon himself or indeed pain upon his mother... ""I'll show you"" sort of attitude... ""you've taken my phone away”. Education: Cain had attended Beaufort School in Gloucester and was described as a 'well respected' pupil . ‘I think if one considers the nature of this young man and the nature of his personality, I think it is more than likely than not this was a cry for help or a cry of punishment to his mum or to scare people and so led to an unfortunate turn of events.’ 'He probably would have been angry with his mum for taking it and perhaps sulked about it' Jackie Geatches, family support worker . Mr Osborne urged Miss Lee to remember the good things in Cain's life and not the tragedy of his death. ‘All I would say to you Veronica, as his mum, is that while Cain may have been a difficult lad during his 12 years, I am sure there were many moments during his life where he brought great joy, fun and everything else you do in your family,’ he said. ‘What I would urge you and the rest of your family to do is when you wake up tomorrow morning and remember Cain, remember those occasions rather than the circumstances resulting in his death. ‘If you want to remember him, go back to that school report because there is a lot there you and your family can be mightily proud of.’  Miss Lee did not wish to comment as she left the hearing.","Cain Westcarr, of Gloucester, had been rowing with mother Veronica Lee .

Labour has surged to its biggest lead over the Tories in the polls for a decade as female voters continue to desert the Prime Minister. If a General Election was held today Ed Miliband's party would probably secure 41 per cent of the vote while David Cameron's Conservatives would get 29 per cent - down four per cent in a month. Female support for the Tories is plummeting as among women 26 per cent more would vote for Labour - 51 to 25 - whereas Labour only get seven per cent more support from men - 36 to 29. Result: A joint Guardian ICM poll today gave Labour their biggest lead over the Tories for a decade . More bad news: The poll also found that many more women would vote for Labour than the Tories (the remaining numbers would vote for other parties) Losing the battle: A new poll shows David Cameron's Tories are leaking votes to Ed Miliband's Labour after his party gained its biggest lead for a decade . A further bitter blow for the Prime Minister will be that his pledge to offer an in/out EU referendum has not secured the support he had hoped for. Instead Eurosceptic rival UKIP's share has gone up three points to nine per cent, according to a Guardian/ICM poll out today. The party has also broken a promise made by the Chancellor while in opposition to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million. But by freezing the threshold at £325,000 to 2019 to pay for social care changes the Conservatives could lose even more core votes. Meanwhile the ailing Liberal Democrats are also losing support as heir share of the vote has sunk two per cent to 13. Disappointed: David Cameron's promise from an in/out EU referendum has not helped at the polls either . Scandal: Chris Huhne, pictured with his partner Carina Trimingham, resigned as an MP after admitting last week he asked his ex-wife Vicky Pryce to take his speeding points . Scramble: All the political parties are sending their big guns to Eastleigh, including Nick Clegg, in a highly-anticipated by-election . The Tories have not had such a low share of the vote since 2003, when Tony Blair's government received a boost when Saddam Hussein was toppled. This was before Iraq lurched into civil war and the scandal over the dodgy dossier became public. David Cameron's ratings are similar to John Major's and will be tested later this month during the Eastleigh by-election, the seat vacated by disgraced former minister Chris Huhne. The latest ICM/Guardian poll shows a dramatic decline in the Conservative share of the vote, but David Cameron’s personal ratings are down. Only 31 per cent say he 'understands people like me', a fall from 42 per cent in August 2010. One in three (37 per cent) thinks he’s 'good in a crisis'. But the Labour lead appears to be despite Ed Miliband's leadership as only 18 per cent think he’s good in a crisis, and 35 per cent thought he 'understands people like me', only slightly better than Mr Cameron.","ICM/Guardian: Labour 41%, Conservatives, 29%, Lib Dems 13%, UKIP 9% .

Pleading poverty: Disgraced police officer Gary Thompson, 45, who was jailed for six years last year for heading a £10million cigarette smuggling operation will pay back just £1 back . A disgraced police officer who orchestrated a £10million cigarette smuggling operation will pay back just £1, despite making £90,000 from the scam. Gary Thompson, a former police officer and Gulf War veteran led the racket that imported 60 million cigarettes into the UK. Thompson, who drove a Porsche and lived in a five-bedroom home with his wife, said he had run up debts of more than £120,000 after a career in the armed forces and the police.The 45-year-old . was jailed for six years . last year and was brought back to Newcastle Crown Court as prosecutors . tried to claw back some of his ill-gotten gains. He admitted laundering more than £2million of his criminal cash by setting up a fake fish tank company called Bubblearium, which existed only to launder the proceeds of the crime. But the judge heard he is currently penniless, despite making £90,000 from his crimes, meaning he must pay back a nominal sum of just £1 under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Former colleague Anthony Lamb, who benefited around £5,000, must pay back that  amount. David Lister, who pocketed £45,000, is also said to be lacking any available assets and so must also pay just £1. Thompson, who rose to the rank of . Acting Sergeant during his time with Cleveland Police, was part of an . organised crime gang illegally importing the cigarettes. The . 43-year-old, along his ex-colleague Lamb, used his knowledge of the . legal system to evade millions of pounds of duty, producing letterheads . and fake email addresses to hijack around 16 businesses in the North . East as a front to hide the scam from the authorities. Over . a three-year period the gang tricked freight agents by setting up a . string of aliases under the fake name David Wilson and hijacking . companies with telephone lines and email addresses. More . than 21 containers arrived at Felixstowe, Suffolk, from ports in Dubai, . Singapore, Turkey and Greece before Lister, 49, of Lakenside Caravan . park, Norfolk, used fake documents to collect the cargo and transport it . to the North East. Proceeds of crime: Despite making £90,000 and driving a Porsche Gary Thompson claims he is broke and will only have to pay back £1 from his scam . In total officers from HM Revenue and Customs intercepted 21 shipments and they discovered the gang had carried out dummy runs by importing six shipments of paving slabs. When they seized a further seven of the huge containers, they discovered a haul of 59,560,000 cigarettes which evaded VAT just short of £11m. But prosecutors claim they may never know the true value of the cigarettes because eight of the containers were never found. Caught: The gang tried to import millions of cigarettes through the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk (pictured) but were caught . They estimated those shipments may have represented another £10m in lost revenue. Thompson, of Castle Eden, County Durham, was jailed for six years last July after admitting conspiracy to evade cigarette duty. Lamb, 50, of Ashbourne Drive, Coxhoe, County Durham, pleaded guilty to the same charge and was locked up for five years.

This is the deadly six-inch gap on a 125mph railway line in Britain that was not repaired until two weeks after it was first discovered. The broken rail was on the East Coast Mainline near Selby, North Yorkshire, and had 'crumbled away to nothing' causing a 'risk to life', experts have said. Last Friday the damaged stretch at Hambleton South Junction was shut for five hours and nine trains were cancelled as engineers finally stepped in. Astonishing: This is the picture that will shock every train passenger, showing a gap of six inches of railway 'crumbled away to nothing' on the East Coast Mainline near Selby, North Yorkshire . Just as worryingly there have been several other dangerous incidents on the same line in the past five months. Experts say it could have led to another Hatfield disaster, where four died after a London to Leeds train was derailed by 'critical cracks' in 2000. This picture has has sparked a major investigation, and is a 'mirror image' of another gap found on the line just before Christmas. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) - the national rail safety watchdog -  said today it was investigating a 'number of rail breaks' on the line, which runs from London to Scotland. These include a broken rail spotted by the pubic in Lincolnshire last September and a 10cm gap seen by a train driver near York last November. The latest incident, near Selby, was spotted by on track teams and the section of track eventually replaced. Fast: The East Coast Mainline runs from London to Scotland with train regularly hitting 125mph on the route (file picture) But Bob Crow's RMT union said the fault 'raises serious questions about the impact of wear and tear on rail infrastructure.' 'This shocking new picture highlights the reality on Britain’s railways today - staffing, inspections and track renewals have been cut in the dash to save money and there is massive pressure right from the top of government to keep services running at all costs regardless of the potential human cost,' he said. 'We had trains thundering over this section of rail between London and the north at speeds of up to 125 mph. 'A train could easily have been derailed and even crashed into another coming the other way with loss of life.' A Network Rail (NR) spokesman confirmed the 'dip', as they called it, was found on January 17, but the track was not replaced until last Saturday February 2. 'A dip in our track was identified and spotted at Hampleton on 17 January,' a spokesman said. 'Following our well-tried and tested industry procedure to remedy such dips, we scheduled an intervention to repair this dip on the Saturday night of 2 February. 'Unfortunately, the track deteriorated more quickly than is to be expected and, on discovering the broken rail, all traffic was stopped immediately while a repair was carried out.'","East Coast Mainline rail was finally changed on Friday after 'crumbling away'

Brazil's patent authority has taken a bite out of Apple after ruling that the iPhone name belongs to a local company, not to the global computer giant. The verdict won't forbid Apple from using the name in Brazil, but it makes it clear the rights belong to local consumer electronics firm Gradiente. The São Paulo-based company's request to use the iphone trademark was granted in 2008, and the company started making 'iphones' - with a lowercase 'p' - in December. The new iphone... which runs on Android: Brazilian company Gradiente have tried to cash in on the Apple gadget's cult status with this cheekily named smartphone . The company was the first to make cellphones in Brazil, and launched the first national smartphone in 2004. Their phones are entirely different . from Apple's flagship mobile device. For starters, the Gradiente iphone . runs on the Android operating system, developed by Apple rival Google . Inc. And it doesn't come anywhere the specs of Apple's flagship gadget, nor does it look much like it's namesake. Dubbed the Gradiente iphone Neo One, . using a 700MHz processor it splashes Android 2.3 Gingerbread onto a . 3.7in capacitive touchscreen display. The dual-sim phone comes complete with . two cameras, front and back, with 0.3 and 5 megapixels resolution . respectively, but no flash - although if you live in sun-soaked Brazil . you might not need it. It also has lower screen resolution, . weighs more than the Apple phone, and sells for a fraction of the price . at 599 Brazilian Real - about £180. Head to head: Name aside, there are few similarities between the iphone and Apple's genuine article, right . One in every two smartphones sold worldwide is made by either Apple or Samsung, research has revealed. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the mobile device arch-rivals accounted for 52 percent of smartphone sales, up from 46 percent in the third quarter, according to tech market research firm Gartner. Sales of mobile phones around the world fell last year for the first time since 2009 as consumers shunned cheaper feature phones, the company said yesterday. 'Tough economic conditions, shifting consumer preferences, and intense market competition weakened the worldwide mobile phone market,' said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta. But smartphone sales continued to rise, he said. Higher-end devices would account for more than half the market for the first time this year. Total worldwide mobile sales to end users fell 1.7 percent to 1.75 billion units in 2012. Samsung and Apple continued to dominate the market, with the Korean company selling 385million phones in 2012, of which 53.5 per cent were smartphones, with Apple selling 130million smartphones. Chinese company Huawei reached third spot in worldwide smartphone sales for the first time in the fourth quarter, Gartner said. It sold 27.2million smartphones in 2012, up 74 per cent. Gradiente filed its request to use the . iPhone brand in 2000, believing that 'there would be a technological . revolution in the world of cellphones, with the convergence of . transmission and reception of voice and data via mobile Internet,' it . said in a press release. The verdict won't forbid Apple from . using the name in Brazil, but it makes it clear the rights belong . Gradiente, said Marcelo Chimento, a spokesman for the country's national . patent office. Stopping Apple's use of the name is . beyond the patent office's remit, and would have to be decided in court. Another option is for the two companies to reach an agreement, he . added. The issue in Brazil is reminiscent of . one that arose in the United States in 2007. Cisco Systems had owned the . iPhone trademark since 2000, and had been using it for a line of . Internet-connected phones. Once Apple announced its intention to . use the brand name, Cisco sued it in San Francisco federal court. The . two companies settled out of court six weeks later, without disclosing . the terms. The latest dispute is likely to be . resolved the same way, with Apple probably choosing to pay the Brazilian . company for the right to use the iPhone brand in Latin America's . largest country, a telecommunications analyst told the Associated Press . in December. This seems the best option for Apple, . because it 'doesn't want to stop selling its product in Brazil,' said . Eduardo Tude, president of Brazilian telecommunications consultancy .

A 'sadistic' killer who tortured and murdered his former partner and their two-year-old daughter has died just months into his whole-life sentence. David Oakes, 50, was jailed in November after he went to Christine Chambers’s house in Braintree, Essex, where he subjected her to 'degrading assaults' before blasting her and her daughter Shania, two, with a shotgun. His trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms Chambers’ home, laden with weapons, and killed the family just as they had gained a restraining order against him during a bitter custody battle. Afterwards he shot himself in the face during a botched suicide attempt, but survived. MailOnline understands that his death on Monday was not linked to his gunshot wound, and that he may have been terminally ill. Killer: David Oakes (left) murdered his former partner and her daughter last year before turning the gun on himself but failed to kill himself (right at court last year). He has died of natural causes in hospital . Torture: Oakes forced Christine Chamber to cut chunks of her own hair off before killing her and Shania (pictured together) in an attack that shocked Britain . Oakes had 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair. Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer. Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June last year. David Oakes' father Peter, 69, today confirmed the killer died from cancer. Shocked Peter said his son had tumours that spread to his stomach and chest and that he was told a few weeks ago he had only six months left to live. 'I'm shocked, very shocked. I expected him to last at least another six months but he never,' he said. 'He never rang me this weekend for a chat so I thought something may be wrong. 'We use to write letters to each other, I used to send him letters you know and he would write back. 'He was still my son despite being a convicted killer. I still miss him.' Today the Ministry of Justice confirmed that Oakes had died from natural causes after being taken to hospital. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'HMP Frankland prisoner David Robert Oakes died at hospital on Monday. 'He is presumed to have died from natural causes. 'As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.' Attack: Oakes stormed their home in Braintree, Essex, with a number of weapons, intent on killing in the days after Christine had secured a restraining order . Family: Christine Chambers, 38, and her daughter Shania died, but her ten-year-old daughter managed to flee the scene . Oakes had denied two counts of murder but was found guilty after nine hours of jury deliberations at his trial in May. Mr Justice Fulford ordered Oakes to serve a whole life sentence, making him one of a limited group of inmates who would never be released from prison. Describing Oakes, he said: 'A bullying and controlling man, who had frequently inflicted violence on Miss Chambers during the six years of their relationship, he killed his ex-partner and their young daughter simply because he knew she could not bear to be with him and wished to start a new life.' The trial heard Oakes arrived at the house with the shotgun, a drill and an axe. Oakes did not appear in court to be sentenced, after prison guards raised concerns he would harm himself. In November, the Court of Appeal refused to quash the whole-life order imposed on the killer. He was one of several inmates who argued such orders were incompatible with Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment. Judges rejected that argument, saying: 'Each of these appellants is dangerous, and on the available evidence, likely to remain dangerous for the indefinite future.'","MoJ confirm David Oakes, 50, has died of natural causes .

The photographs, labelled 'violating' by the Palace, were taken as Kate strolled along a beach with Prince William on the exclusive private Caribbean island of Mustique. Italian gossip magazine Chi and Australian weekly Woman's Day have published them, but the British media has refused because they breach the royal couple's privacy. But today This Morning presenters Eamonn . Holmes and Ruth Langsford were discussing the story in a news review section when Chi's front . cover flashed up and filled the screen, but the pictures were . not blacked-out. Holmes was later forced to offer a humbling 'unreserved apology to the Duke and Duchess' for the 'deeply regrettable' error on the show. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Error: This Morning is at the centre of another storm after it flashed up pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge on screen months after a similar mistake involving a list of alleged paedophiles . Mistake: The cover flashed up on the screen but the pictures could clearly be seen (blacked out by MailOnline) Pregnant: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen here with her husband at the unveiling of her picture at the National Portrait Gallery, has been photographed on holiday in Mustique . 'Earlier during today's news review we were discussing photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on a beach in Mustique published in an Italian magazine,' he said. 'Unfortunately we accidentally showed an unblurred image of the magazine cover, which briefly showed the photographs. This was a deeply regrettable error and we are very sorry. 'We apologise unreservedly to the Duke and the Duchess.' It appears the hosts were unaware of the production error and continued to discuss the story with Daily Mail sketch writer Quentin Letts. Apology: Eamonn Holmes returned to screen to say This Morning 'apologises unreservedly to the Duke and Duchess' for the error . It comes just three months after Phillip Schofield and ITV agreed to pay Tory peer Lord McAlpine £125,000 in damages after the television presenter showed a list of alleged paedophiles to David Cameron which contained his name. Schofield attempted to bring this to the Prime Minister's attention live on This Morning in November but inadvertently allowed the list of names to be seen by viewers. It led to a grovelling apology from ITV and Schofield and a giant settlement with Lord McAlpine's legal team. MailOnline understands publishers in the United States, France and Germany have also bought the set of Kate pictures for more than £100,000 in total. Italian gossip magazine Chi, which caused outrage when it published a photograph of Princess Diana as she lay dying, splashed pictures of the duchess and her growing baby bump across its front page. Speaking about the publication on This Morning, Mail political sketch writer Quentin Letts said: 'The magazine is called Chi, perhaps it should be called cheap, and it is owned by the old groper himself, Silvio Berlusconi, the Bunga Bunga man. 'There are people saying this is an invasion of privacy. I think they may be right.' 'Misjudged camera angle': The extraordinary moment Phillip Schofield handed the list of names to David Cameron which prompted a huge financial settlement . Kate, who is about four months pregnant, is wearing a bright blue . halter-neck bikini with her slightly rounded stomach clearly visible. Her arm is draped over her husband’s shoulders while William, who is . wearing blue baggy shorts and sunglasses, has an arm protectively around . his wife’s back. The headline on the front of Chi, which goes on sale today, reads ‘Kate and William – honeymoon for three’. The magazine also has pictures of Kate's sister Pippa, who is seen walking hand-in-hand with a mystery man. The Duchess's sibling is in a striped pink and black bikini and her slim companion is topless, wearing dark swimming shorts emblazoned with multi-coloured stars. In another shot the couple are seen walking along on the famous Mustique white sands with Pippa's brother James, who is also on the island along with parents Carole and Michael. Holiday: Kate Middleton is on Mustique with her sister Pippa, their brother James and parents Michael and Carole . New man: Pippa, here at Wimbledon with former boyfriend Alex Loudon in 2011, has been pictured walking on the beach holding hands with a new man in Chi magazine . Alfonso Signorini, editor of Chi magazine, has defended his decision to print the images. He told the BBC: 'The photographs, which can in no way be considered scandalous, were bought from an international photo agency, do not harm the image of the protagonists and the reaction of the media seems to me wholly over the top. 'Moreover, the photographs can hardly be considered an invasion of privacy when the subjects are public figures in a public place, in the open air; specifically on a beach surrounded by other bathers.' He told Italian news website Corriere.it : 'You can't compare it with the media persecution of Lady D (Diana, Princess of Wales). I repeat: the photos were taken in a public place.' Woman's Day editor Fiona Connolly said she had no qualms about running the pictures, insisting they were taken by a fellow tourist on Mustique – and not a paparazzo. She said the royal couple are not a ‘protected species’ outside Britain. 'This is not a hard decision. Kate's on a public beach, there are other holiday-makers there and she looks fabulous,' she said, adding: 'As . Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on . the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive . here'. The Royal couple are two of the world's most . recognisable people but it can be a struggle to guard their privacy, . which is why they headed for the private island of Mustique . Last night, royal sources said William, in particular, still felt ‘very . bruised’ about the fresh breach of privacy so soon after the same . magazine splashed topless photographs of Kate across its front page . beneath the headline ‘the queen is naked’. The source said William felt very strongly at the time that he had somehow ‘failed’ to protect his wife. The intimate photographs are thought to have been taken from a boat using a long lens camera. Chi magazine, which is owned by former . Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, boasts: ‘The extraordinary . images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their dream holiday in . the Caribbean. ‘The future mum, now four months pregnant, wore a tiny bikini which showed off her visible bump.’ Tweets: The mistake today prompted people to go on Twitter to express their disbelief at what happened . Australian magazine Woman's Day has also printed the pictures, as well as photographs of Kate's sister Pippa in a bikini, claiming they were taken by a member of the public on a public beach. Editor Fiona Connolly said the royal couple are not a ‘protected species’ outside Britain adding: 'This is not a hard decision. Kate's on a public beach, there are other holiday-makers there and she looks fabulous.' However, Mustique is a private island and there is an expectation of privacy for anyone holidaying there because the paparazzi is banned. Mrs Connolly said: 'As Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach - and a public one at that - so we are a lot less sensitive here. 'Our readers are going to love these photos. I don't expect any backlash at all really. I think she's looking fabulous and healthy and (with) a beautiful bump, like we haven't seen her before.'

Scroll down for video . At odds: Nick Clegg contradicted Prime Minister David Cameron on maintaining free bus passes and free TV licences for the over 75s and the annual winter fuel payment . Mr Clegg, who marks his fifth anniversary as Liberal Democrat leader today, made his comments at think tank Centre Forum amid mounting speculation about his own position. On Sunday his deputy Simon Hughes acknowledged that he was ‘in trouble’ and facing internal ‘chatter’ about his leadership. Yesterday Mr Clegg’s former chief of staff Richard Reeves said the ‘curtain will probably fall’ on the Coalition before 2015 if the party fails to boost its opinion poll ratings which have slipped into single figures. And the Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott . warned it would be ‘curtains’ for the party at the next election unless . the economy improved dramatically. Sources . close to Mr Clegg insist his position as leader is secure. But they . acknowledge the need to ‘differentiate’ the party from the Tories to win . back the legions of voters who have deserted since the election. Mr Clegg used a speech at the CentreForum think tank to boast he had blocked 'draconian' Tory cuts to welfare, and said the need for 'fairness' meant handouts for 0ver-65s had to be looked at . This . strategy accelerated yesterday, with Mr Clegg claiming he had acted as a . moderating influence on ‘extreme’ Tory demands for welfare cuts in this . month’s Autumn Statement on the economy. The Deputy Prime Minister said he had . vetoed a proposal from the Prime Minister to end housing benefit for . the under-25s, together with an idea from Iain Duncan Smith to limit . child benefit payments to the first two children. ‘That is the job of the Liberal Democrats – to anchor reform in the sensible centre ground,’ he said. The result was that a planned . £10billion package of benefit cuts was reduced to £3.8 billion, leaving a . hole that had to be filled by tax rises and cuts to other public . services. Mr Clegg labelled the two Tory proposals ‘extreme’ – saying they would have ‘penalised’ young people and larger families. The Deputy Prime Minister also renewed . his call for a halt to pensioner benefits for the better off. Some . Tories are known to back his stance but Mr Cameron has ruled out any . means testing before the next election. Mr Clegg is under pressure after deputy leader Simon Hughes said after two and a half years of coalition his leadership is 'in trouble' The winter fuel allowance is worth £200 for pensioner households and £300 for those over 80. Ros Altmann, of Saga, warned Mr . Clegg’s ‘populist’ call for the means-testing of pensioner benefits . could have damaging consequences. She added: ‘It would punish those who . have tried to be self-reliant and give much more money to those who . have not saved for their future. 'And then what’s next? Will he tell us . rich pensioners don’t need a state pension either? This could be the . slippery slope to undermining our whole pension system.’ Downing Street ruled out any change to . the universal nature of existing pensioner benefits. A spokesman said: . ‘The Prime Minister made a commitment to protect those benefits and he . believes in keeping his promises.’ He . set out his vision for how he could become 'a more permanent fixture of . government', warning his critics in Lib Dem ranks that being a party of . power meant making compromises. Three opinion polls at the weekend showed the Lib Dems have been overtaken by the UK Independence Party. A surge in support for the eurosceptic UK Independence Party has pushed the Lib Dems into fourth place in opinion polls.

He added: 'I actually bribed my children to sort of inform on Alison if ever she popped into Waitrose when she picked up the kids from school.’ Sir Terry and his wife, who have three children, live in Cuffley, Hertfordshire, which is close to the Tesco headquarters. The nearest Waitrose is less than six miles away in Enfield, north London. Waitrose has made an aggressive attempt to attract Tesco shoppers in recent years with a scheme promising to match its prices on big brand products. Meanwhile he described the decline of high streets - with thousands of closed and empty shops - as ‘part of progress’. Sir Terry said it was a natural result of families choosing to use supermarkets. Historic no more: Sir Terry has suggested that high streets are no longer fit for modern families whose shopping habits have evolved as families were choosing to use supermarkets . The retail guru, who has advised . successive prime ministers, suggested some high streets have effectively . become irrelevant, historic relics. However, critics suggest the change in . character of Britain, with the emergence ‘ghost towns’, also has a . great deal to do with Tesco’s financial and political muscle. In some cases it has used its enormous . financial and legal resources to push through planning applications for . new stores regardless of the views of local people and councils. Such is its dominance, that it has . effectively taken over many areas, claiming more than 50per cent of all . grocery sales in so-called ‘Tesco Towns’. While the giant, with profits of more . than £3billion a year, has also created a vast land bank, wrapped in . legal covenants, that has prevented rivals from opening competing . outlets nearby. The big supermarkets have also used . staple products like bread and milk as loss leaders to attract customers . away from small rivals. Sir Terry was speaking on Radio 4’s . Desert Island Discs yesterday, where he insisted shoppers, rather . than supermarkets, were responsible for the changes seen in towns. Dominance: Critics suggest Tesco's political and financial muscle can be blamed for the emergence of 'ghost towns' where independent retailers used to thrive . Asked by Kirsty Young whether seeing . boarded-up shops made him sad, Sir Terry said: ‘It does but it is part . of progress. People are not made to shop in supermarkets, they choose to . shop there. ‘High streets - some of them are . medieval and the way that we live our lives now is very different, so . what you have to do is make sure the benefits do outweigh the costs, and . I think that they do.’ The Association of Convenience Stores has fought to protect independent small stores – often unsuccessfully. 'I actually bribed my children to sort of inform on my wife Alison if ever she popped into Waitrose when she picked up the kids from school' Sir Terry Leahy . Its chief executive, James Lowman, said: ‘Modern high streets are vital to the future of retail. ‘Few would agree that the Tesco towns that emerged under Leahy’s tenure constitute progress. ‘People still value their local shops and town centres, and government needs to do more to support these businesses.’ During the programme, Sir Terry also . revealed an unlikely connection with punk rockers UK Subs - telling how . he lived in a flat above theirs and once kept them awake by listening to . his radio too loudly. He said: ‘I came down to London round . about 1980 and it was just at the time of punk music and new wave music, . and I got an attic flat in London above a punk rock band called the UK . Subs. ‘They used to play their music every . day to four in the morning and I would be rocked to sleep by the UK . Subs, and then I was up one morning with the Today Programme on my . transistor radio and there was a bang on the door and it was a man in a . leopard skin leotard and he said ‘Will you turn that radio down?

Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams may be handed a giant tax bill after a U.S. businessman paid around £25,000 so he could have an operation in an exclusive private American hospital. The controversial politician allowed prominent Irish-American businessman Bill Flynn to pick up the tab for a prostate procedure in New York last November. Mr Adams says the procedure had not 'cost the taxpayer a penny' and was paid for by a man he described as a 'very very good friend'. The member of the Irish parliament for Louth/East Meath, which is on the border with Northern Ireland, said the operation had freed him from five years of 'constant pain'. Tax liability: Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams had a £25,000 operation in America paid for by a friend but may be left with a large tax bill as a result . Bill Flynn, who was former chief of life insurance giant Mutual of America, is a close friend and agreed to cover the cost as Mr Adams had 'financial problems' linked to a second property. Pals: The help from businessman Bill Flynn (pictured) aided Mr Adams after five years of constant pain, he said . Today questions have been raised about whether he will be able to use an Irish gift tax exemption, which allows people to write off certain medical costs if it is given as a present. But crucially the gift has to be from someone based in Ireland and as Mr Flynn is often based in America, the exemption may not apply. 'Mr Adams is consulting with his tax advisers as to whether any taxation . arises from this medical procedure', a Sinn Féin spokesman said, adding: 'if he owes tax then of course he will pay it'. 'He did not get this just because he was a member of parliament, it was a close personal friend who paid for it. 'It could not be done in Ireland at that time'. The Sinn Féin president said last week there was a 'fixation' within the media 'on the state of [his] health'. He told RTÉ Radio One's Marian Finucane show: 'I have had a longstanding and very very painful complaint. And as you know I go back and forth to the States once or twice a year. One of my friends introduced me to…his doctor. And he recommended that I should have a process of a particular kind. 'I have been in constant pain for the last five years and at that time, the treatment of this kind was not available in the North.' Marian Finucane explained that such an operation cost in the region of $30,000 and it was difficult to explain how Mr Adams might have that money. He said: 'Well, I didn't pay for it … a very very good friend of mine, a man called Bill Flynn, very kindly paid for it… I couldn't have afforded it. My wife and my family are eternally grateful to him.' Mr Adams also insisted that having private medical treatment was in line with his party's policies, which is anti-private healthcare. He said: 'Sinn Féin's position, and it remains my position, is for a universal healthcare, a public health service of the very highest standard available to all citizens.'","Irish politician received financial help from his friend Bill Flynn last November .

The 'Baby Dolls' marched through the streets of New Orleans during Mardi Gras last week with hardly any of the throng lining the streets having any idea of the seedy truth behind the tradition. The history Baby Dolls spans more than a century, and began with the African-American women working in the red light district in Storyville. The Baby Dolls came together around 1912, as the word ‘baby’ began its run as both a term of endearment and a condescending slight toward women working as prostitutes. Strike a pose: A member of the New Orleans Baby Doll Ladies poses on Jackson Avenue during this year's Mardi Gras celebration last week . Blowing a kiss: A member of the New Orleans Baby Doll Ladies poses during the 2013 parade; Baby Dolls have been around more than a century . In the early 20th century, their costumes included stockings with garters, short silk or satin dresses, and of course, bonnets. But it was their brazen behavior that really drew attention to themselves during the parade. But a century later, the group is also comprised of African American men, according to Dr Kim Vaz, the dean at Xavier University. Dr Vaz, the author of a book chronicling the dolls’ history, told NPR that during the age of Jim Crow laws, black people were still disenfranchised, as there were different laws for how black and white red-light districts could legally operate. When the women in the black district discovered that their rivals were going to dress up for the Mardi Gras parade, they decided they needed to outdo them.

Celebration: Revelers gather for the start of the Society of Saint Anne walking parade in the Bywater section of New Orleans during Mardi Gras last week . Dr Vaz told NPR: ‘They said, “Let’s just be baby dolls because that’s what the men call us. They call us baby dolls, and let’s be red hot.”’ History: Dr Vaz has published the century-long history of the 'Baby Dolls' and how they've impacted NOLA . She also explained that their provocative name had a double meaning. ‘African-American women weren’t considered precious and doll-like,’ she said. Mardi Gras celebrations date from the city’s French founding in 1718. The Baby Dolls had an important role in post-Katrina Louisiana as well. A group called the 504 Eloquent Baby Dolls of New Orleans formed, named in part for a telephone area code. They marched with the tribe of Mardi Gras Indians, as well as the Skull and Bones club. The Louisiana Weekly, the newspaper of the New Orleans black community, identified the Million Dollar Baby Dolls in 1939 as among the city's oldest African-American masking groups, Dr Vaz told the Associated Press last month. The earliest known photographs of baby doll maskers are cells from a 1931 film that doesn't make clear whether they were prostitutes or mainstream revellers. 'Even today, those in the Baby Boom generation recall their mothers and grandmothers warning them against the lewd and lascivious behavior evidenced by many a Baby Doll on Carnival Day,' Dr Vaz wrote in her book, ‘The Baby Dolls: Breaking the Race and Gender Barriers of the New Orleans Mardi Gras Tradition.’ The first of the current baby doll troupes apparently started in the 1980s, when Merline Kimble and friends revived her grandparents' Gold Digger Club of baby doll maskers. The late Antoinette K-Doe created the group named for her husband, Ernie K-Doe, in 2003 with friends including Reed, Trepagnier and praline store owner 'Tee-Eva' Perry.","Baby Dolls founded by group of African-American workers in NOLA's red light district around 1912 .

These breathtaking images capture the spectacular display by thousands of starlings swamping over the seaside. At least 50,000 of the birds are thought to make up the ever moving dark cloud performing an aerial dance across the evening sky. The stunning photographs of the murmurations were taken at sunset by photographer Keith Morris over the past two months. Aerial dance: At least 50,000 starlings are thought to make up the murmurations above the Aberystwyth Royal Pier, in Wales . Breathtaking spectacle: The evening sky provides a stunning backdrop for the ever moving dark cloud of starlings . Love birds: The swarming starlings add to the romance for a couple enjoying a sunset walk by the sea . The huge gatherings are largest in the winter, when their numbers are boosted by birds from Europe migrating for the milder climate. Mr Morris used a Nikon D4 camera to photograph the flocks above Aberystwyth Royal Pier in Wales. He said: 'It's very unusual and unique to see starlings in a city as they're normally found in more rural areas. 'It's such a treat to be able to go to the peer every day and see them roost there. I get drawn to them. I think it would be impolite to not go and photograph them. 'There must be at least 50,000. It's certainly a sight to see.

The RSPB said starlings join forces in such a fashion for safety in numbers from predators such as peregrine falcons that find it hard to target one bird amidst a hypnotising flock of thousands.

RSPB'S Johann Holt said: 'In many cases they are like clockwork – you know that at a certain time in the evening the sky will start to turn black, and it's mesmerising watching the flock grow and grow.' But the charity also said that such spectacles are becoming less and less common, with the starling population dropping more than 70 per cent, leaving them on the critical list of UK birds most at risk. The decline is thought to be caused by a loss of permanent pasture, increased use of farming chemicals and shortage of food and nesting sites.

Cheap eats: Customers who buy the cheapest food at the supermarket are most at danger from contaminated meat, says Waitrose boss Mark Price . Customers who buy the cheapest food at the supermarket are most at danger from contaminated meat, says Waitrose boss Mark Price. The chief executive of the supermarket chain said that meat should be more thoroughly checked and its origins verified to keep consumers confident in the food they are eating. His comments come as the Food Standards Agency’s test results were due in for some of Britain’s suppliers, brewers and restaurant chains. The watchdog said 2,501 tests were . conducted on beef products, with 29 results were positive for undeclared . horsemeat at or above 1 per cent. Mr . Price maintains that Waitrose has done proper testing and origin checks . of its products and so has not been affected by the horsemeat scandal. He . wrote in The Sunday Telegraph: ‘If meat is being purchased blind from . outside the UK, and sometimes even via the internet in bulk, it is less . easy to find those guarantees that full knowledge and traceability . give. ‘If, at the same . time, there is a requirement to hit a price point for consumers under . financial pressure then there will be an inevitable strain in the supply . chain.’ Mr Price said the . cost of rearing animals and the often long supply route could also put . pressure to keep companies afloat or allow officials to give in to personal greed. He hoped the scandal would open up debate on food economics and lead to a shakeup of meat testing procedures to ensure consumer confidence in the product. Birmingham-based supplier 2 Sisters Food Group is among those waiting on test results. Their customers include major chains such as Harrods, Marks & Spencer, Asda and Pret A Manger. Tests are in: The Food Standards Agency have conducted 2,501 tests on beef products with 29 results positive for undeclared horse meat at or above 1 per cent . FSA chief executive Catherine Brown said that testing was the right way to address the issue, and said the focus would be on areas of higher risk. But she admitted that the number of people who had unknowingly eaten horsemeat was likely to be impossible to ascertain. ‘I don't think that we ever will (know how many), because these tests are a snapshot, so even where we find things it is very hard to work out how long, what number of batches, so I think it is unlikely that we will ever know that. It is shocking,' she told the BBC. Her comments came as the head of a major UK supermarket chain insisted that the horse meat scandal was not 'the tip of an iceberg'. Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC's Newsnight programme that supermarkets had not been slow to react to the scandal, but conceded there was a long way to go before the food industry could fully explain how the crisis has come about. The horsemeat scandal has swept across Europe and criminal investigations are being carried out in at least three countries. In Britain, three men were arrested last week on suspicion of fraud as authorities investigated the possible mislabelling of meat. One of the men, 63-year-old Peter Boddy, . owns an abattoir in West Yorkshire now under investigation. He also had . a contract with Aintree Racecourse for destroying the carcasses of . injured horses. Mystery meat: Catherine Brown, FSA chief executive said that testing was the right way to address the issue but she admitted that the number of people who had unknowingly eaten horse meat was likely to be impossible to ascertain . Mr Boddy and the other men were released on bail yesterday pending further police inquiries. Warnings about horsemeat fraud were sent to the FSA but no action was taken, the Sunday Telegraph claims. Tip-off: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has admitted that the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef . The FSA received three warnings that in Europe beef products were contaminated with horsemeat but the agency decided not to take action because the produce was not intended for Britain. But the free movement of food within Europe meant that contaminated meat could find its way into the British food chain. Meat imported into Europe from America could have entered the food chain in Britain – contaminated with horse painkiller ‘bute’ which can be dangerous to humans. Warnings that there was a fraud suspicion regarding horse carcasses and horsemeat from Hungary and Denmark and it was reported that much of the meat had been distributed probably to Belgium, Denmark and France, the Sunday Telegraph claimed. The watchdog did not act on the warnings because there was no indication that the meat was to be distributed in Britain. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Irish food safety chiefs kept British consumers in the dark for ten weeks after being tipped off about horsemeat in beefburgers. Officials have repeatedly insisted that horsemeat was only detected in the food chain after random inspection of products at Irish plants in early November. It was claimed that the results came to light in trials of new DNA testing techniques. But Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has now admitted the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef with horsemeat before last year’s tests and started investigating on that basis.","Mark Price: Meat should be more thoroughly checked and origins verified .

Factsheet: The RSPCA has a factsheet advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes. But experts have desccribed the advice as 'irresponsible' Experts have condemned the RSPCA as being ‘very irresponsible’  for advising families to put out scraps of food in the garden to feed hungry foxes. The astonishing suggestion emerged just days after a baby boy had his finger bitten off by a fox that attempted to drag him out the door of his home. The RSPCA guidance offers ‘cheese, boiled potatoes, raw chicken pieces, bread and table scraps’ as suitable foods in answer to the query ‘How can I help foxes living in the area?’. It adds that providing food ‘could help and even give you a chance to watch them’. The leaflet, entitled ‘Living with foxes’, and designed to be printed off the internet, recommends ear plugs for residents who are tired of hearing foxes shrieking in mating season. It also includes a section about how to deter foxes. The suggestion to provide food appears very different from comments by the charity after the attack on five-week-old Denny Dolan in Bromley, South-East London. A male fox tried to snatch him away by dragging him out of the door by his hand.  His mother Hayley Cawley fought the animal off and doctors had to reattach his left ring finger after the fox bit it off in the attack last week. On Sunday, the RSPCA appeared to discourage feeding, saying: ‘It’s extremely unusual for foxes to attack young children or anyone. ‘It’s not typical fox behaviour at all. Foxes will come closer to a house if there are food sources. Then they can become quite bold, but they usually do back off and run away when there’s people around.’ However, the leaflet continues to be available online. Last night, pest control expert Peter Crowden warned: ‘If you feed foxes, they will be encouraged to go into people’s homes in search of more food. You shouldn’t feed foxes in your garden. ‘They will come closer and closer to get food. When your novelty of feeding them wears off, that’s when they will start entering houses. ‘The RSPCA are very irresponsible for issuing this advice. Advice: The leaflet, entitled 'Living with foxes', encourages residents to wear to wear earplugs to avoid hearing foxes shrieking in mating season . ‘People are encouraged to feed them and you see people feeding them out of their hands in their lounges. But foxes are wild animals and they will stay wild animals. If you want to feed wild animals, go to the zoo.’ Mr Crowden said fortnightly rubbish collections were responsible for swelling fox numbers in populated areas. ‘Councils should be cleaning the streets and getting rid of rubbish. That’s the only way to prevent the numbers growing,’ he said. National Pest Technicians Association chief executive John Davison said foxes coming into homes is a problem people have created. He said: ‘You will get one fox and two or three people are putting food out, even trying to get it to take from their hand, and the fox gets used to people and will stray into properties if it thinks there’s food. ‘It’s a problem we humans have created, it’s not the fox’s doing.’ Injured: The advice is still available despite an attack on five-week-old Denny Dolan . The RSPCA has recently come under increasing criticism for its seeming transition from an animal welfare organisation to a political organisation intent on prosecuting fox hunting. Last night the RSPCA said: ‘We would encourage people to use humane deterrents and to make sure there is no food source available if foxes are coming into their gardens and they are concerned. ‘The factsheet referred to makes it clear that the most humane and long-term solution is to discourage foxes from your garden by removing or preventing access to what attracts them – however some people are determined to feed wild animals in their garden. ‘As stated in the factsheet the RSPCA often get asked about foxes, including what food they eat, as well as what risks foxes pose or how they can be deterred from gardens. The factsheet deals with each of these issues. ‘To be clear, the RSPCA does not encourage or endorse the feeding of foxes.’","RSPCA leaflet 'Living with foxes' is designed to be printed off the internet .

But Mark Zuckerberg's company will also get a multimillion dollar tax refund of around $429 million according to Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ). The refunds reportedly come from tax deductions on executive stock options and share awards. Facebook will receive a tax refund of around $429 million for 2012, despite making profits of over $1 billion . Facebook released its first annual report as a public company on January 30 after floating in May 2012.

As reported by Businessweek, Facebook says it had a $559 million federal tax liability in 2012. But their refunds on the tax deductibility of stock options reduced the companies federal and state income taxes by $1.03 billion for the year, including refunds of earlier years’ taxes of $451 . million. After a small portion is applied to state taxes, this benefit turns Facebook's liability into a refund. Yet according to CTJ, Facebook have further stock-option tax breaks that the company generated from its initial public offering of stock (IPO). Facebook is . hoping to reduce future tax liability by carrying forward another $2.17 billion in additional tax-option tax . breaks for use in the years ahead. As CTJ point out, this means . 'Facebook’s current and future tax reductions from the stock options . exercised in connection with its IPO will total $3.2 billion.' Facebook is hoping to reduce future tax liability by carrying forward another $2.17 billion in additional tax-option tax breaks for use in the years ahead . Facebook spokeswoman Ashley Zandy declined to discuss the tax break with Businessweek and instead referred to a transcript of Facebook executives’ conference call with analysts. In this call, Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman mentioned the accumulated tax benefits before noting that Facebook ended the fiscal year with nearly $10 billion in cash and investments. Ebersman claimed this gave the company 'great flexibility and risk protection.' Facebook delivered fourth-quarter results above Wall Street's expectations on January 30 and sought to show that it has finally transformed into a 'mobile company' after rising to dominance as a Web-based social network. But its stock dropped in after-hours trading as investors placed more significance on the company's growing expenses rather than on its increasing user base and higher advertising revenue.

A notorious South London gangster - who boasted about his life of crime in his autobiography - was jailed for duping a businesswoman out of £250,000 worth of jewellery. Jimmy Tippett, 41, author of 'Born Gangster' initially claimed he was forced into the heist by violent thugs, but abandoned this defence after learning the prosecution planned to read extracts of his book to the jury. He convinced the jewellery dealer to meet him at a hotel and arrived with a fellow-crook, who posed as a wealthy Saudi businessman's buyer. During the meeting at the Bromley Court Hotel with Anita Cotton, Tippett distracted her and walked off with the uninsured jewellery, which has never been recovered. This left the shocked victim with a £99,600 wholesale bill to the Hatton Garden jewellers, who had supplied her with the stock. Tippett, of Beckenham and Mark Spink, 52, also of Beckenham, who received twenty-two months, both pleaded guilty to stealing the jewellery from Mrs Cotton at the Coniston Road hotel on August 29, last year. A separate charge against Tippett of stealing £48,000 worth of jewellery from a woman in Brighton while on the run was dropped by the prosecution. In his autobiography Tippett says he was born into a criminal aristocracy, with his father bare-knuckle fighter Jimmy Tippett snr. known as the 'Guv'nor of Lewisham.' His first arrest was at the age of twelve, he was carrying a gun at the age of sixteen and visiting Reggie Kray in prison. Ironically, his boasts were used against him at Croydon Crown Court where prosecutor Mr. Julius Capon said: 'Mr. Tippett is an author and in a synopsis of his book 'Born Gangster' he says he was involved in drug deals, robberies, bloody fights and dodgy scams. Jailed: Tippett was given a two year and three month sentence at Croydon Crown Court . 'He says he has no regrets about his life and makes no apologies for his crimes. He says he has never done an honest day's work in his life and was not forced into criminal activity, but was a path he chose.' Tippett's criminal career has taken him to the Costa del Crime, Britain's toughest prisons and associations with London's underworld. The jewellery taken by Tippett and his accomplice was never recovered. File picture . 'Mrs Cotton runs a small company that sells jewellery and many of her sales were made via the internet and she had been in contact with Tippett on the internet and via telephone and text messages,' explained Mr. Capon. A proposed meeting at the Dorchester hotel fell through so Tippett agreed to meet Mrs Cotton in Bromley. 'He claimed he would be with a man called 'Bruce', who was the representative of a Saudi businessman. 'The story was that the Saudi businessman wanted to buy jewellery for his prostitutes and Mrs Cotton was asked to bring some jewellery with her. 'They met in the lounge of the hotel, with Spink posing as 'Bruce' and all three sat around a table and the defendants continued with the scam, asking questions and examining the jewellery. 'Tippett distracted Mrs Cotton when asking her questions about the prices of certain pieces and he got up and walked out with the jewellery. 'Spink remained, but after a short while tried to leave for the toilets and kept trying to escape. 'The victim's husband, who had some concerns about the meeting, was nearby and when he saw Spink he called the police and the defendant was arrested as he tried to leave in a cab.' When quizzed by police Spink claimed he thought it was just an innocent social get-together, saying: 'I was just looking at the pretty lady.' Tippett went on the run and was circulated as wanted and was eventually arrested at a Ramsgate Travelodge hotel. Both defendants have lengthy criminal histories for offences of theft and burglary and Tippett has additional convictions for violence and public order.

Three doctors who originally testified for the state of Georgia against Hill now claim that Hill is mentally disabled, and thus, should not be put to death. Hill’s lawyers have continually argued that their client has had mental issues for the duration of his incarceration, and are doing everything in their power to spare his life. Hill is scheduled to die in an Atlanta prison via lethal injection at 7pm ET on Tuesday night for brutally attacking his then-cellmate, Joseph Handspike, in 1990. Authorities said that Hill, who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his girlfriend, Maya Wright four years earlier, attacked Handspike again and again with a nail embedded in a piece of plank. Handspike died of his injuries. However, the Handspike family has publically declared that they do not agree with Hill’s execution. Hill’s upcoming lethal injection goes directly against the 2002 case, Atkins v. Virginia, which ruled that Daryl Atkins was ‘mentally retarded’ and was not of sound mind, and therefore could not be sentenced to death. Dr Thomas Sachy wrote in an affidavit last week: ‘Having reviewed my earlier evaluation results and the far more extensive materials from the record of this case, I believe that my judgement that Mr Hill did not meet the criteria for mild mental retardation was in error.’ The other doctors concede and claimed their evaluations of Hill in 2000 were ‘rush jobs,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Clemency: Members of the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles prepare to hear a clemency hearing for Hill last July . The state has said that Hill’s lawyers have failed to prove ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that the man is mentally disabled. Lauren Kane, a spokesperson for the state Attorney General’s Office, declined comment, saying that her office will respond when Hill’s attorneys file new motions. Hill was originally scheduled to be executed in June, but the Supreme Court allowed him a stay of execution while his attorneys pursued a challenge based on the state’s changing of execution method. Hill is among three Georgia inmates on Death Row fighting for a court order that would prevent the state from using a drug to execute them without a doctor’s prescription first. Watchful: A corrections officer stands guard with a shotgun on the main road into the Georgia Diagnostic Prison in Jackson, Georgia last July after a 30-day stay of execution was announced for condemned murderer Hill . Hill, along with Andrew Allen Cook and Marcus Wellons, argue that the Georgia Department of Corrections’ use of the drug without a doctor’s prescription violates the federal Controlled Substances Act. Outrage: Troy Davis was the last Georgia inmate to be executed in the state; his 2011 death was highly controversial . Even if the court finds him mentally disabled, Hill would still spend the rest of his life in prison, the Journal-Constitution says. The case has stirred a national outcry of those believing Hill to be mentally unwell. If he is executed, it will be the first carried-out execution in the state since the 2011 death of Troy Davis. At the time, Davis’ conviction and condemnation drew fury, as many believed that Davis was the victim of mistaken identity in the murder of Burger King guard Mark MacPhail in 1989. Prosecutors and MacPhail's family said they were certain Davis was guilty and that justice was served. Prison officials also provided an audio recording and transcript of his last words, which he used to again proclaim his innocence and urge his supporters to ""continue to fight this fight."" Davis was notified of the execution date on Sept. 7, and a day later he was asked to make a last meal request. He scrawled a response in big letters: ""None. Will Be Fasting!"" According to figures collected by Amnesty International, the U.S. was the only country within the G8 to carry out executions in 2011.","Hill, 53, is scheduled to be executed on Tuesday unless his lawyers can prove he is 'mentally disabled' within a reasonable doubt .

Since then, Jackie, 50, has gone on to rescue nine ponies from the butchers' knives, bidding directly against the buyer from Red Lion Abattoir near Nantwich, Cheshire. The mother-of-four has transformed the lounge at her Cheshire farm into a stable for her latest pony, Jaz, 12, who she paid just £150 for. Jackie Winston-Jones has transformed the lounge at her Cheshire farm into a stable for her latest pony, Jaz . The mother-of-four now plans to open a sanctuary to save more ponies from the abattoir . Jaz, pictured with Jackie, is a former top riding school pony, which went under the hammer for just £150 . Jackie, who runs a kennel, is now planning to start a horse sanctuary with the help of Hillside Animal Sanctuary, which blew the whistle on the mistreatment at Red Lion Abattoir last month. Jackie first saved a Welsh Bay Cob at Beeston Market near Chester for £200. She said: 'My husband Laurie couldn't believe his eyes when I turned up with my first horse, Maid. I'd set out to Tesco to do the weekly shop but then suddenly remembered it was Beeston Auction Mart where the horses go under the hammer for next to nothing. 'I turned around and headed straight there, saw Maid on Death Row - the area where the meat horses wait outside in the car park for auction - and went in and haggled for her with a dealer against the abattoir man. He wasn't pleased. 'A friend at the sale loaned me her horse box and I took her home. When my husband Laurie saw what I'd done he just said I was crazy.' Last Wednesday, Jackie went back to Beeston with £200 in her pocket. She expected to buy one or two ponies - and came back with eight ponies. They included Jaz, a former top riding school pony with a sackful of rosettes for wins over her 12-year life. Another was a pregnant foal with another foal alongside her. Jackie, pictured, who runs a kennel, had the ponies checked over by a vet - and they were all given a clean bill of health .

'I couldn't just stand by and watch them sold and carted off to Red Lion Abattoir to be slaughtered for the meat market. I didn't have enough cash but my son Matthew who was with me dashed to the cash point and drew out what he could. 'I paid for one by credit card, and there was a friend there who said she would buy a horse if I looked after it. I got money off another friend there and a lady who came forward and said she'd have one. Somehow I got enough together for the lot. 'I outbid the abattoir man. I was determined they weren't going through those gates at the abattoir. He wasn't happy, but I guess he'll have his day another time in another place.' The horse lover said she had the horses checked over by a vet when she got them home. Luckily, they were all given a clean bill of health. She now plans to set up a charity which will own the horses and loan them to carers who have been fully vetted. 'I can't look after them all on just two to three acres but this way we can monitor the horses at their new homes and because the charity owns them we can make sure they are well kept. Only trusted keepers will be allowed to have them. The idea is to set up lifetime homes for them. 'Now, we're desperately trying to re-home them through our Facebook page.' 'It's already growing through word of mouth with well wishers arriving with feed and horse blankets and odd bits of kit. But the loose box I've got is too small for eight so Jazz has to bed down in the lounge until we sort out more space. I don't mind, it's worth it just to see her happy. 'We're determined the cruelty and the horse meat trade has to stop, I won't rest until Red Lion and places like it are closed down for good. 'It is such a shame these horses are cast off like this. There wasn't really a bad one among them. 'Yes they were scruffy, but with a bit of TLC, good food and water they can be brought back. To think by now, they would all be killed and into the food process is appalling. 'It's taken over my whole life, but I will not rest while these lovely animals face a dreadful fate. Through the internet, and Facebook, we can reach out to those who care.'","Jackie Winston-Jones, 50, has rescued nine ponies - bidding against the buyer from Red Lion Abattoir .

RBS boss Stephen Hester launched an impassioned plea to keep his bonus yesterday as his bumper pay packet was described as ‘modest’. Mr Hester admitted he was the ‘captain on the bridge’ while his traders rigged interest rates but said he still merited being handed a shares pay-out worth £780,000. He received the backing of RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton, who described Mr Hester’s basic pay package of more than £1.6million as ‘modest’ by banking standards. Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester speaks to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards yesterday . Sir Philip’s comment was last night described by campaigners as ‘an insult to ordinary taxpayers’, who bailed RBS out to the tune of £45.5billion during the financial crisis. Mr Hester, Sir Philip and a string of RBS bosses yesterday gave evidence to the Banking Commission of MPs and peers over the Libor rate-rigging scandal – at its worst between 2006 and 2010 – which culminated in a £390million fine from US and UK regulators last week. The commission warned RBS against ‘creative accounting’ over plans to recoup £300million in bonuses from employees to pay American regulators. Mr Hester said he accepted ultimate responsibility as the ‘captain on the bridge’ since he took the helm of RBS in November 2008, shortly after it was rescued. But he faced awkward questions over why only one senior manager, investment bank chief John Hourican, has resigned over the wrongdoing. He was also asked why he was clinging on to the £780,000 shares bonus awarded in 2010, which will be transferred to him next month. Mr Hester, who already receives a basic £1.2million salary and a £420,000 cash payment instead of a pension, can cash the shares in a year later. His fate was contrasted with that of Mr Hourican, who was forced to hand back at least £4million in bonuses. Write caption here . Banking Commission chairman Andrew Tyrie, who suggested Mr Hourican had been made into a ‘human shield’ for the debacle, said: ‘Mr Hourican has paid with his job. Do you not think you should pay with your bonus?’ Mr Hester said his bonus ‘should be assessed on all the things I do’, adding: ‘If you look at the RBS we took on four years ago that we have done huge things to rescue a situation for the company and for society and stakeholders. ‘This includes hundreds of billions of pounds of risk that the country was exposed to and isn’t any more.’ The bank boss claimed he was responsible for defusing ‘the biggest balance sheet time bomb in corporate history’. Over the last four years, RBS has removed £700billion of toxic assets from its balance sheet. Mr Hester was supported by chairman Sir Philip, who argued that he is paid ‘well below the market rate for bankers’. Sir Philip also pointed out that Mr Hester, who is eligible for a maximum annual package of £7.1million, has given up his bonus three times in four years. Asked why only Mr Hourican has fallen on his sword, Sir Philip said: ‘We decided a single point of accountability was necessary – not a mass series of assassinations’. But the comments about Mr Hester’s pay infuriated critics. Deborah Hargreaves, of the High Pay Centre think-tank, said: ‘The idea that Mr Hester is paid modestly is insulting to taxpayers and people on average salaries. ‘There are big question marks over whether he deserves his bonus when the rigging of interest rates continued for two years under his watch.’ Sir Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss who ran the bank until 2008 .","Stephen Hester receives a basic £1.2million salary and wants to hang on to his £780,000 shares bonus ."

Claim: Kate Tantum, the daughter of a former MI6 director, has taken her former employer Travers Smith to a tribunal over unfair dismissal after she fell pregnant . A new mother has accused a top City law firm of sexual discrimination claiming she was rejected for a permanent job as she was pregnant. Katie Tantum took her three-month-old daughter Heidi to her employment tribunal, where she made the claims. The daughter of a former director of MI6, Miss Tantum, 33, was a trainee on £42,000 a year at Travers Smith when she told them she was expecting a baby. The Cambridge graduate claims the company failed to offer her a permanent contract because they did not want to pay maternity leave. Now she is claiming for loss of earnings. Her fiancé Stuart Tozer and his mother have also been on hand to look after the baby in the four-day hearing. In March last year Miss Tantum, from Kew, west London, said she discovered she was pregnant and told her bosses. She said they were initially ‘understanding’ and ‘seemed supportive’ but over the following months her supervisor ‘just stopped bothering with me’. She said: ‘It was as though investing time and  effort in my training stopped being worth his while.’ Miss Tantum said once she became visibly pregnant she felt the need to tell people she was not planning to take her full maternity leave and was ‘absolutely committed to returning to the firm’. However, in May she learned that she was not to be offered a permanent contract with the firm. She said senior partner Andrew King told her that ‘no one put their hand up’ for her. She said: ‘I was one of only three trainees out of 22 not retained permanently or given a minimum one-year contract.’ Fluent in French and German, Miss Tantum worked in recruitment and public relations before going into law. Unfair: Ms Tantum was one of only three trainees not kept on and believes that this was due to her pregnancy . After a period in property law in France . she moved back to London and was accepted on to the trainee scheme at . Travers Smith, one of the leading smaller law firms in the City. Miss Tantum started on a £38,000 salary but described an atmosphere . where staff were expected to work into the early hours. That contrasted . with a statement on its website about its culture where the firm says: . ‘There is certainly no staying late to look good’. She said: ‘The firm’s current selection process basically comprises of a single subjective criterion which is: who do the partners want to employ after September? ‘In my case, the criterion translated as do you want a newly qualified . solicitor who will be here or one who is going off on maternity leave?’ Action: The headquarters of law firm, Travers Smith, who Miss Tantum alleges fired her as she was pregnant . Miss Tantum – whose father Geoffrey is a former Middle East Director for . MI6 – claims the firm ‘frowned upon’ people who wanted to work family . friendly hours. She said: ‘I believe I was not fairly considered and . that the reason for that was my pregnancy and or planned maternity . leave.’ The tribunal was told that of the 66 partners at Travers Smith, only ten are women. But Kathleen Anne . Russ, partner and head of tax at the firm, denied discrimination. Asked if Miss Tantum was discriminated against she said: ‘That’s just . totally wrong and I think it’s absolutely shown to be wrong when you see . how many people in our department are mothers and have gone through . maternity leave. ‘I myself have had two children and maternity leave.

Six water companies are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans . Some of Britain's biggest water companies are controversially using tax havens to avoid paying millions in UK tax, a new investigation claims today. Six of them, including Northumbrian, Yorkshire and Thames, are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans. The arrangements have emerged as water regulator OFWAT announced last week that water bills would rise by 3.5pc to an average of £388-a-year per household. Controversial schemes taken by big firms to slash their tax bills are the centre of attention at the moment after MPs slammed US giants like Google and Starbucks as 'immoral'. The government has announced new plans to clamp down on firms who push their revenues abroad out of the grasp of the taxman. They will be prevented from winning lucrative Whitehall contracts. Companies bidding for government contracts will have to provide details of their tax compliance history, including tax returns that have been judged incorrect, under the draft new rules announced yesterday. Proposals to change the law come as water firms Northumbria, Yorkshire, Anglian, Thames, South Staffordshire and Sutton and East Surrey were thrust into the spotlight over their tax affairs. An investigation by lobby group Corporate Watch shows all have taken big loans from investors which they are allowed to offset against their profits – the figure over which corporation tax is calculated. While we already knew firms reduced their tax bill by doing this we did not know that they had also found a way to avoid paying tax on the interest payments made on these loans. Normally when a UK company pays interest to a non-UK company it has to withhold 20pc of the payments and give it to the taxman. But investors in the water companies have found a way round this by using a complex tax scheme. They issued their loans through the Channel Islands stock exchange as something called 'quoted Eurobonds' which means they do not have to pay the tax on the interest due to a loophole. Thames Water, which is based in Reading, Berkshire, confirmed the interest payments on its £310million of quoted Eurobonds from its owners are tax-deductible . Corporate Watch has found some of the £1billion in loans made to Northumbrian Water, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, were listed on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange. It paid £50million in interest on this for six month in 2011/12 and is due to pay £100million for the following year, Corporate Watch says. This means it has saved paying the UK Government £30million in tax on the interest. It declined to comment. Yorkshire Water, which is owned by investment funds based in the US, UK and Singapore and HSBC, accrued £66million in interest payments on £844million of quoted Eurobonds in 2012, Corporate Watch says. This, together with the interest payments on its other debt, helped it pay just £100,000 in corporation tax on an operating profit of £335million in 2012. It declined to comment. Thames Water, which is part owned by Australia's Macquarie group, nicknamed the 'Millionaire Factory' for its huge payouts to shareholders, confirmed the interest payments on its £310million of quoted Eurobonds from its owners are tax-deductible. Combined with its other debt, these helped the company wipe out an operating profit of £577million, meaning it received a tax credit in 2012. It said: 'Our operational performance. . . is better than ever. This is the result of higher-than-ever levels of investment. Meanwhile our customers' bills remain the second-lowest in the country.' It was a similar story at Anglian Water, Sutton and East Surrey and South Staffordshire Water who all declined to comment.","Claims follow an investigation by lobby group Corporate Watch .

The remains of the body found in a remote cabin razed to the ground have been positively identified as fugitive ex-LAPD officer Christopher Dorner . Officials said Thursday that the burned remains found in a California mountain cabin have been positively identified as fugitive former police officer Christopher Dorner. Jodi Miller, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County sheriff-coroner, said the identification was made through Dorner's dental records, but did not give an official cause of death. Dorner was killed Tuesday at a cabin near Big Bear on Tuesday afternoon as a massive blaze broke out in the cabin after SWAT team members surrounded the cabin with highly-flammable tanks. The search for Dorner began last week after authorities said he had launched a deadly revenge campaign against the Los Angeles Police Department for his firing, warning that he would bring 'warfare' to LAPD officers and their families. The manhunt brought police to Big Bear Lake, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, where they found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck abandoned. His footprints disappeared on frozen soil and hundreds of officers who searched the area and checked out each building failed to find him. Five days later, but just a stone's throw from a command post authorities had set up in the massive manhunt, Karen and Jim Reynolds said they came face to face with Dorner inside their cabin-style condo. The couple said Dorner bound them and put pillowcases on their heads. At one point, he explained that he had been there for days. 'He said `I don't have a problem with you, so I'm not going to hurt you,'' Jim Reynolds said. 'I didn't believe him; I thought he was going to kill us.' Scroll down for video . Highway 38 at Glass Road is closed, as San Bernardino Sheriff's deputies investigate the crime scene in the town of Angelus Oaks, California today . A reporter interviews a resident, who declined to give his name, near the scene of a Tuesday standoff and shootout . Police have not commented on the Reynolds' account, but it renews questions about the thoroughness of a search for a man who authorities declared was armed and extremely dangerous as they hunted him across the Southwest and Mexico. 'They said they went door-to-door but then he's right there under their noses. Makes you wonder if the police even knew what they were doing,' resident Shannon Schroepfer said. 'He was probably sitting there laughing at them the whole time.' The notion of him holed up just across the street from the command post was shocking to many, but not totally surprising to some experts familiar with the complications of such a manhunt. Jim Reynolds, 66, right, and wife, Karen Reynolds 57, recount their experience during a news conference Wednesday in Big Bear Lake of being held captive by fugitive Christopher Dorner inside a condo unit they own . 'Chilling. That's the only word I could use for that,' said Ed Tatosian, a retired SWAT commander for the Sacramento Police Department. 'It's not an unfathomable oversight. We're human. It happens. It's chilling (that) it does happen.' Candy Martin, the owner of the remote mountain cabin, said she was helpless as the building in the San Bernardino National Forest became the center of a raging gun battle on Tuesday that killed one sheriff's deputy, wounded another wounded and left the fugitive murder suspect Christopher Dorner dead. Ms Martin said she flipped on the television on Tuesday afternoon and realized that the cabins featured on the breaking news coverage of the standoff looked familiar. Destroyed: This is the destroyed wreckage of the cabin where Christopher Dorner made his last stand in San Bernardino National Forest . Devastated: Candy Martin said she sobbed as she watched her family's vacation home burn to the ground on live television . Helpless: TV news chopper captured live images of the cabin burning down . 'And we’re looking and we say, ""Oh these are cabins, these look like,"" and there’s no doubt that those are my cabins,' she told NBC 4 in Los Ageles. Ms Martin bought the Seven Oaks Cabins, situation in the forest about 20 miles from Big Bear, California, in 2005 as a mountain getaway for her extended family. 'It’s hard for me to imagine him in there. And I did do that. I imagined, what is he doing? What room is he in?' she told the TV station. The home had solid wood paneling and floors and contained a lot of history, It was built in 1928 and the compound was the set for several movies and TV shows, Ms Martin said. Watching the home burn to the ground on live TV was the hardest part, she said. 'Then the fire. Oh my gosh,' Ms Martin said. 'That was heart wrenching to see, the fire. I just started crying. I couldn’t talk at that point.' Presumed dead: Police have found charred remains in the basement of the cabin that they believe belong to Christopher Dorner - though no positive ID has yet been made . Mountain retreat: Ms Martin rents out several of the cabins as a peaceful, quiet mountain retreat . Standoff: This is the Seven Oaks property where Dorner barricaded himself inside Ms Martin's family cabin . Ms Martin said that when her family is not staying on the mountain in the cabins, she rents out several of the buildings to tourists and advertises the site as a tranquil, peaceful mountain paradise. 'Leave behind the stress and smog of the big city.  Be our guest in a cabin nestled in the woods and on the banks of the Santa Ana River,' the website reads. However, several online reviewers have begun posting outrageous comments in the wake of the siege. 'The underground tunnel feature is just great! Comes in handy!' wrote one reviewer on the Yahoo Travel site for the Seven Oaks cabins. 'A little hot today. The rates are very reasonalbe [sic] since I didn't pay anyway. Good luck on the renovation,' a user calling himself 'Great SPOT for a BBQ' writes. Dorner barricaded himself inside the cabin after a series of dramatic police chases and shootouts on Tuesday afternoon. Taking cover: Heavily-armed officers surrounded the property and took cover around the other cabins . Killed: Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot dead during the standoff with Dorner . The former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant made his way to Big Bear, 100 miles east of Los Angeles, last Thursday after he went on a revenge killing spree that left three people dead. He is believed to have shot dead the daughter of a former LAPD captain who defended him at a police review board hearing where Dorner was fired in 2009. Monica Quand was found murdered in her car in Irvine, along with her fiance Keith Lawrence on February 3. Last Thursday, he wounded an LAPD officer in a shootout and then ambushed two Riverside police - killing Officer Michael Crain and gravely wounded a second patrolman. Later that afternoon, Dorner's burning truck was found in the woods outside Big Bear. Despite an intense police search of the area for several days, Dorner was revealed to be hiding in vacant condos just across the street from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's command post. On Tuesday, he surfaced after five days of hiding and tied up a couple after breaking into their home. He stole their SUV, but crashed it during a police pursuit. Dorner then carjacked a Boy Scout leader's truck. He abandoned the vehicle and fled for Ms Martin's cabins after a shootout with a California game warden. San Bernardino SWAT officers surrounded the cabin and engaged Dorner in a raging firefight. Detective Jeremiah MacKay, 35, was shot and killed when Dorner tried to make an escape.

Thieves will have their hands amputated and rapists will be chemically castrated under a controversial new judicial system for Bolivia's indigenous people. Trained doctors will be paid to operate on convicted criminals in the city of El Alto after they are sentenced by a newly created court. And if medical professionals refuse to perform the surgery, lesser-trained indigenous doctors from the rural, highland provinces will be paid to take on the work. The first court to work under the community justice framework was appointed in El Alto, on the outskirts of the Bolivian capital La Paz (pictured), this week . Carmelo Titirico, leader of the National Council for Ayllu y Marka people, said the brutal punishment had been approved by the area's indigenous community 'as it's the only way to stop those crimes'.He told LV7 Radio: 'Indigenous justice is handled differently, not between four walls as ordinary justice is. We will not be sending people to jail in these cases.'He added he was aware the measures could lead to widespread rejection, but said his council would not back down. Rapists will be chemically castrated, and thieves who are caught offending three times will have one of their hands cut off. Titirico said the punishments were permitted under the 'community justice law' enshrined in the South American nation's constitution promulgated by President Evo Morales in 2009The new system is part of the 'Law of Separate Jurisdictions', in force since 2010, that defines the boundary between 'community justice' and the usual legislative process.Community justice can only be dispensed against indigenous people, whereas the regular legal system can be applied to everyone.

Irish food safety chiefs kept British consumers in the dark for ten weeks after being tipped off about horsemeat in beefburgers, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Officials have repeatedly insisted that horsemeat was only detected in the food chain after random inspection of products at Irish  plants in early November. It was claimed that the results came to light in trials of new DNA testing techniques. But Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has now admitted the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef with horsemeat before last year’s tests and started investigating on that basis. Evidence: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has admitted the Irish received a tip-off of possible contamination of beef with horsemeat before last year's tests . They did not alert their UK counterparts until mid-January, however, and food safety and industry chiefs are incensed by the delay. It meant thousands of British shoppers were duped by fraudsters and dined on burgers, lasagne and spaghetti bolognese laced with horse. The Irish secrecy was revealed last week in a little-noticed exchange in the House of Commons. Mr Paterson told MPs: ‘The reason the Irish agency picked up this issue in the Irish plant was that it had local intelligence that there was a problem. That is why it did a random check – I cleared this with [Irish agriculture] Minister [Simon] Coveney.’ The lack of urgency from the Dublin authorities – who appear to have ignored an agreement to share intelligence with their counterparts in Northern Ireland – has provoked fury in Whitehall and throughout the food industry. Enforcement chiefs are particularly frustrated because while the Food Safety Authority of Ireland informed the UK food watchdog about its tests in November, there was no suggestion horsemeat was being processed as beef. Sloppiness: Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke said it was 'unacceptable' that food had been deliberately contaminated . The Irish first had test results . indicating horsemeat in the beef supply chain on November 30. But . instead of immediately alerting authorities in London and Belfast, Irish . officials sat on the results and decided to order more tests. The . shocking discovery that a Tesco frozen value burger was adulterated . with 29 per cent horsemeat was not announced until January 15. Even . then, the FSA in the UK was told the Irish had not been acting on a . specific tip-off. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘It would have been much better to have given us the full picture. We asked the Irish a number of times and we have been told repeatedly the testing was not intelligence-led.’ Last night, however, Mr Paterson’s disclosure of the tip-off brought a confused response in Dublin. The FSAI repeated its assertion that it had not acted on specific intelligence but said it could not comment on ‘conversations between Ministers’. A spokesman for Mr Coveney’s Irish agriculture department also declined to comment. Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke  told The Mail on Sunday: ‘What has happened is sloppiness at best and criminality at worst. We have found that in the areas where food was contaminated with products which shouldn’t have been there, it was deliberate. That is unacceptable.’ Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, said: ‘If Irish authorities knew horse was in the food chain last November, it was their duty to tell people about it.’ Tougher controls on food consignments traded within the European Union are expected to be agreed before the end of the month after the scandal spread to 12 EU states. Mr Paterson is also pushing for random checks. He said: ‘Too much is taken for granted under the present system.’ Three British factory bosses arrested over horsemeat allegations on Thursday were yesterday released on bail. Peter Boddy, 63, Dafydd Raw-Rees, 64, and Colin Patterson, 42, had been held at Aberystwyth on suspicion of fraud. Mr Boddy was taken for questioning to the Welsh town from his slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Mr Raw-Rees and Mr Patterson were arrested at nearby Farmbox Meats Ltd. A police spokesman said inquiries at Farmbox Meats would continue. Rotting carcasses ended up in UK as corned beef .","Irish safety chiefs kept British consumers in the dark for ten weeks .

A council leader has been ridiculed by locals over his plans to change a borough’s name from Havant – because he says it sounds like ‘have not’. Anthony Briggs says he wants to ‘improve the area’s image by getting rid of its negative name’. But the bizarre idea has been dismissed by local residents proud of the fact that Havant’s name was recorded in the Domesday Book. The Tory council leader is calling for a public consultation to change the name because it ‘sounds like the haves and the have nots’. Mr Briggs, who has been the borough leader for five years, said: ‘I think it’s unfortunate what the word Havant portrays. It sounds like have not. We live in a part of the country which has the coast and the South Downs and it’s a wonderful place. ‘I think a name such as South East Hampshire has a much better ring to it than Havant. ‘The name is very negative but unfortunately people do get attached to place names. ‘There are many places in our borough, not just the town Havant, and as we share services with other councils I think, to move forward, we should change the name. ‘It is confusing to people. When I go abroad and I’m asked where I come from, I tell them and they have no idea where it is.’ Mr Briggs added the council could hold a competition to choose a new name. But Chris Everitt, chairman of the Havant Group Business Centre said: ‘I’ve never heard of anything so ridiculous and this just shows how out of touch politicians are with the residents they are supposed to represent. ‘There will be a lot of opposition. People here are proud and there is no way they would stand to lose such an important part of their heritage.’ The borough of Havant has had its name since 1086 and locals say it is 'ridiculous' to suggest it should change . The Hampshire borough – between Chichester and Portsmouth on the South Coast – derived its name from the village of Havant, which had a population of about 100 in 1086, when the Domesday Book was written. The village was known as Hamafunta around 935 AD, which translates as the spring of man, named after springs in the area. Sophie Fullerlove, director of Havant’s The Spring arts and heritage centre, said: ‘The history and name of Havant are very important to the area. It comes from the local springs, which were fundamental to the village. ‘The water was used to make parchment which, legend has it, was used for  the Magna Carta and Treaty of Versailles. ‘I don’t agree the name has a negative connotation and I don’t think locals have a problem with it either. ‘We would welcome a visit from councillors to the heritage centre to learn exactly how the borough got its name and how important it is.’","Council leader Anthony Briggs says historic name is 'unfortunate'

The world witnessed two galactic events on Friday that had only a one in 100 million chance of happening on the same day, according to astronomy expert Meg Urry. The asteroid that flew within 17,000 miles of Earth was a once-in-100-years event, while the meteor that exploded over Russia was a once-in-a-decade occurrence, Urry wrote on CNN.com. Multiplying those two probabilities together results in a one in one hundred probability that they would happen on the same day. Scroll down for videos . Space rock: Although it came uncomfortably close to the Earth, the asteroid was only visible with a good pair of binoculars . Spectacular sky: The Urals region was struck by falling meteorite fragments which fell in the city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border . Ice breaker: An official standing near an eight-meter hole left by the meteorite in the surface of a frozen lake near the town of Chebarkul . Unexpected . sight: A terrifying meteorite shower left a thousand people injured, . buildings devastated and the mobile network wiped out when it hit Russia . this morning . Terrifying: Brightly burning rocks could be seen for hundreds of kilometres as they crashed at around 9.20am local time and one bystander described it 'like a scene from the Armageddon movie' The meteor, which weighed 40 tons, injured almost almost 1,000 people with flying fragments of glass and rubble. It penetrated Earth's atmosphere at a speed of at least 33,0000mph. As it raced through the sky, the 50-foot . wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, creating the . enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball somewhere . between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am local time. Although some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding. Hours later,  the 150-foot, 130,000-ton asteroid successfully skimmed past Earth. It was the nearest fly-by for an object from space of this size since records began. Although scientists said there was little chance of asteroid 2012 DA14 hitting the planet, if it did, it would have inflicted 1,000 times more damage than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Its closest approach, passing within 17,000 miles (27,357 kilometers), which is closer than some satellites, was at 7.25pm, GMT. Disaster: This graphic shows the sequence of events which led to the meteor crashing in Russia . Speed: Russia's space agency Roscosmos said the meteorite was travelling at a speed of 30 km (19 miles) per second and that such events were hard to predict . Interception: According to an unconfirmed report in Russia Today, the meteor was intercepted by Russian air defense . Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave . Of the meteor, Gulnara . Dudka, a resident of Chelyabinsk, 930 miles east of Moscow and the . biggest city in the affected region, said: ‘I really thought it was . doomsday.’ Teacher Valentina . Nikolayeva, who tried to protect her pupils from the force of the blast . said: ‘There was an unreal light that lit up all the classrooms. ‘That . kind of light doesn’t happen in life, only at the end of the world – . then a trail appeared like from a plane but only ten times bigger.’ Amazingly, there . were no fatalities and most of the wounded were hurt by flying glass – . some 1.8million square feet of which will have to be replaced. Russian . news networks noted that the meteor struck just hours before the Earth . was due had its closest recorded shave with an asteroid. However, space . experts said the arrival of the much larger asteroid was merely a . coincidence. Professor Alan . Fitzsimmons, of Queens University Belfast, said there was ‘almost . definitely’ no connection between the exploding meteor and asteroid 2012 . DA14. ‘This is literally a cosmic coincidence, although a spectacular one,’ he said. Prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the meteor could be a symbol for the vulnerability of the economy – and the ‘whole planet’. British . experts said that thousands of tons of material from space rains down . on the Earth each day, but nearly all of it burns up and disintegrates . far from the view of the naked eye. Occasionally . a meteor can come so close that its explosion is felt, as happened . yesterday, or a small meteorite or large asteroid can actually hit the . planet. Smoking: Pictures show a streak of smoke followed by several bright blasts of flames . Coincidence: Early indications are that the shower is unrelated to Asteroid 2012 DA14, which is due to skim the orbit of the Earth later today . High in the sky: The vapour trail of a falling meteorite is seen in the sky over the city of Chelyabinsk . Injured: A man identifying himself as Viktor poses for a photograph after receiving treatment for injuries after the meteorite shower hit the Russian region . Medical treatment: Many injured had bloodied faces from being hit by shards of glass broken in the explosions . Toll: Hundreds of people were injured, but there have been no reports of fatalities . Dr Simon Goodwin, an . astrophysicist from Sheffield University, said: ‘While events this big . are rare, an impact that could cause damage and death could happen every . century or so. 'It very much depends on where it hits. A big enough . meteor could cause significant immediate death and maybe cause climate . change by releasing dust into the air – these are maybe every few . thousand years. ‘And a really big impact occurs every few ten millions of years and can cause mass extinctions.  One killed the dinosaurs. ‘Scientifically . this is not hugely interesting. Probably its greatest importance is to . make people realise that things fall from space all the time, and every . now and then they can be dangerous. ‘And an impact in a heavily populated area could kill huge numbers of people with no warning or chance of stopping it.' Sonic boom: Tim O'Brien, associate director of the University of Manchester's Jodrell Bank Observatory, said the injuries were caused when the meteor created a sonic boom causing windows to shatter . Explosion: Eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass . Damaged: A zinc factory in Chelyabinsk was seen with a partially collapsed roof and walls in the morning after meteor pieces rained on the town . Moment of impact: A pair, seen on CCTV, cower from the impact as the window near them explodes . Injured: Four schoolchildren were known to have been injured from broken glass . Unexpected: Eyewitnesses spoke of several devastating explosions rocking buildings and shattering glass . One eyewitness Gulnara Dudka, in her . 20s, gave a dramatic account of the meteorite, telling how she feared . 'doomsday' had arrived, reported the Siberian Times. 'What was it? People said it was a plane that fell and exploded,' she said. 'I saw a bright blast from behind me. Everything was lit up, very bright light. 'It was like from Armageddon movie when the meteorite rain started, I really thought it was like doomsday. 'It was so scary especially the . explosion. It was very strong. I am speechless. It was so strong. My . camera couldn't reproduce how strong the bang was.' 'I was sitting at home and typing . something on my computer. Suddenly there was a huge bright flash,' said .

Aftermath: People look at damage to a shop following the meteor shower . Shattered: The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . 'At first I thought something happened at my neighbours place but a minute later the sound of the explosion came.' He said 'many lost their windows, glass is everywhere in the streets'.

She asked if it was a hostage situation. No. 'I asked them if it was a morgue up there,' she said. After she was told Noah was one of the 26 shooting victims, she said she went into denial, thinking he was just hiding at school. Relatives and friends offered support. Visiting a makeshift memorial helped, too. She recently took her children out of town for a few days, and the family is getting counseling. 'But I find that grief finds me no matter how busy I keep,' she said. 'It's a very strange process. It just blindsides you when you least expect it.' Pozner said her little boy also came to her in dreams. In one, the six-year-old brushes his teeth at the sink, his dark hair wet. He looks directly at his mother and says, 'Mommy, I'm having fun.' In another, Pozner gives birth atop a . mountain, is handed the infant by a midwife and walks down a long . flight of stairs back to a village. But she drops the baby. 'When I got to the bottom, the baby was dead,' Pozner said, crying. Scroll down for video . Paralyzing: Veronique Pozner, pictured, said the moment she found out Noah was dead was like being told you were paralyzed from the neck down . Dreams: Pozner, pictured, said her little boy also came to her in dreams . Since the massacre last month, Pozner has struggled with the gaping hole left by the loss of her energetic, affectionate son. 'What's the alternative?' the 45-year-old oncology nurse told The Associated Press in an interview this week. 'Not getting out of bed? I don't think Noah would want to see me like that, although sometimes it is hard to get out of bed.' She has tried to help her other children cope and make sense of the senseless. Noah was especially close to his twin, who escaped the shooting unharmed along with sister Sophia. Arielle continues to talk about Noah in the present tense. Among donations the family received was a stuffed animal they call Noah bear. 'Every time Arielle hugs it, she says it doesn't feel anything like her brother, but she does enjoy having it around,' Pozner said. Her children are filled with . questions. Why did it happen? Where is the shooter now? Can he still . hurt Noah and the other victims? 'I tell them, ""Just like some people . can be very sick in their bodies, some people can be very sick in their . souls, and they don't think the same way other people do and they can't . feel other people's pain,""' Pozner said. She assures them the gunman can't bother Noah and the other children anymore. Goodbye: Veronique Pozner, pictured left at her son's funeral, said some days it is hard to get out of bed . Struggle: Pozner, pictured at Noah's December 17 funeral, said she has tried to help her other children cope with Noah's loss . She took her children back to school in neighboring Monroe this week for the first time since the shooting. On the drive, Sophia asked her not to play music on the radio because it makes her cry. Pozner said she was reassured to see police at the school and believes such a presence can act as a deterrent. She thinks gunman Adam Lanza's mother, who owned the weapons the 20-year-old used to kill 20 six and seven-year-olds and six staff members in the December 14 assault, was negligent. 'I think he had a mother who at best was blind; at worst aided and abetted him,' she said. 'Maybe she wanted to compensate for his feelings of inadequacy by letting him handle weapons of mass carnage and taking him to shooting ranges. I think there was gross irresponsibility, and I'd like to think that maybe she was just as unwell as he was to have allowed someone as obviously compromised as he was to have access.' Those who knew Nancy Lanza have described her as a good, devoted mother. To help move on from the tragedy, Ponzer is pushing for reforms from the White House. Her . family has submitted a detailed proposal to a White House task force, . recommending a range of legal reforms including federal grants to review . security at public schools and requiring gun owners to lock weapons if . mentally ill or dangerous people could access them otherwise. Procession: Noah Pozner was laid to rest on December 17 after last month's tragedy . Change: Pozner is pushing for White House reforms after the tragedy . Pozner also said it wasn't right that the law protects the release of any mental health information on the gunman. She said she planned to challenge that because it could shed light. 'Those are all answers that I feel that we're entitled to,' she said. The family is suggesting a new law requiring people to notify police within 24 hours if they know about an imminent threat of harm or death made by a person who has access to guns or explosive devices. 'I've just been in deep admiration of her strength and her ability to try to do something positive and to try to make a difference out of what happened,' said Pozner's brother, Alexis Haller. 'She's an inspiration really for the whole family.' Pozner said she is not ready to go back to work yet. These days, she has a tattoo near her wrist with angel wings and her son's name, his birth date of November 20, 2006, and the day he died, December 14, 2012. 'He was just a very expressive little boy,' Pozner said. 'He was just a bundle of energy.' She thinks of her son's facial expressions, of him asking for a snack after school. Days before the massacre, he had come downstairs to see her shortly after being put to bed. 'I just wanted to give you one more hug,' Noah said. 'Why is your pajama top off?' his mother asked.'So I can feel your heart better,' he replied.","Veronique Pozner, 45, said some days it's 'hard to get out of bed'

Supermarket Morrisons has bought 49 stores from failed DVD and games rental chain Blockbuster as it steps up plans to expand its convenience business. The deal will not prevent any of the job cuts already announced by Blockbuster administrators Deloitte, but Morrisons said it hopes to create around 1,000 jobs as it reopens the shops as convenience stores. The UK's fourth-biggest grocer also announced the rebranding of its M Local convenience business to Morrisons M local. Supermarket: Morissons has bought 49 stores from failed DVD and games rental chain Blockbuster as it continues its fightback under chief executive Dalton Philips (pictured) Today's announcement - for an undisclosed sum - follows the recent acquisition of seven stores from collapsed camera retailer Jessops as Morrisons takes advantage of quick access to high street locations to build up its convenience chain. It is accelerating expansion plans after struggling to compete because of its small number of convenience stores, as well as a lack of grocery delivery service. Morrisons, which currently has 12 M Local stores, reported a disappointing 2.5 per cent decline in like-for-like sales for the six weeks to December 30, which followed a 2.1 per cent decline in the previous quarter. The Bradford-based business is leading a fightback under recently appointed chief executive Dalton Philips, launching an advertising campaign fronted by TV presenters Ant and Dec earlier this year and sponsoring hit shows Britain's Got Talent and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. Morrisons hopes to have at least 70 convenience stores by the end of 2013, while it is expected to announce the latest move towards a full-scale online food delivery service alongside its annual results on March 14. Gordon Mowat, managing director of Morrisons Convenience, said: 'We are rolling out the Morrisons M local estate at pace this year and these acquisitions give us a kickstart in securing a solid foothold in this key sector. Losses: The deal will not prevent any of the job cuts already announced by Blockbuster administrators Deloitte, but Morrisons said it hopes to create around 1,000 jobs . The announcement follows the supermarket's recent acquisition of seven stores from collapsed camera retailer Jessops . 'The convenience market is growing as more people shop locally and we want to be in a position to take advantage of this.' Many of the Blockbuster stores are located in the South East - an area where Morrisons is keen to increase its presence - and are expected to open for trading by the end of the summer. The stores bought are among the 164 stores earmarked for closure by Deloitte last week, which threatens around 800 jobs and comes on top of the 168 shop closures and 760 job cuts already announced. Blockbuster, which had 528 staff and employed 4,190 staff, collapsed into administration last month after struggling to adapt to the changing market and rivalry from internet retailers including Netflix, Amazon's LoveFilm and iTunes, which now offers a movie rental service.","Morrisons to create 1,000 jobs as it reopens shops as convenience stores .

A young mother died from a heart condition after doctors repeatedly told her she only had heartburn when she complained of severe chest pains. Gemma Jones, 28, had suffered crushing agony in her arms, abdomen and chest for months before she collapsed and died at her home. But while she had seen various doctors about her symptoms – one just three days before her death –  she was consistently misdiagnosed, it was claimed. Agony: Gemma Jones died from a heart condition after doctors repeatedly told her she only had heartburn . An inquest heard Miss Jones could have been saved by a simple ECG test. This would have shown that she did not have acid reflux, as doctors told her, but a potentially fatal inflammation of the heart caused by a virus. Last night, her fiance Philip  Medhurst condemned doctors for allegedly ignoring her series of  complaints. He suffered the agony  of finding Miss Jones lying collapsed  in bed at their home in Daventry, Northamptonshire. Mr Medhurst also paid an emotional tribute, saying: ‘Gemma was loved immensely and will always be  in our hearts.’ Miss Jones, who had a son Harry, had first complained of chest pains in October 2010 and was given an ECG – electrocardiogram – but the results were normal. Complaining that she felt huge  pressure on her chest, she returned  to see doctors in 2011 and then in the months before she died in March, including an appointment three days before her death. But rather than repeat the test, which measures the heart’s electrical activity, GPs sent her home, telling her she simply had acid reflux. This is when acid from the stomach leaks up into the gullet, causing symptoms including indigestion, heartburn and chest pain. The inquest at Northampton General Hospital heard that an autopsy showed ‘chronic inflammation’ of her heart from diffused viral myocarditis. The condition would have been detected by repeating the ECG. Paramedic Nicola Kirk, who was the first to treat Miss Jones after she  collapsed, told the hearing she was ‘surprised’ the problem had not been  diagnosed. After the hearing, Mr Medhurst insisted his fiancee should have been offered an ECG. ‘She said it felt as if someone was applying huge pressure to her chest. She went back and forth to the  surgery but was just told it was acid reflux,’ he said. ‘The Thursday before she passed away, she went to the surgery again, and again was told it was acid reflux. Gemma Jones with her son Harry. She was found lifeless on the bed at home by her fiancee . ‘If Gemma had been given an ECG, it would have shown up and she could have been treated.’ On the night Miss Jones died, Mr Medhurst had been out with friends. He sent a text at midnight asking if it was okay to stay out and she replied that it was. But when he returned home, he found her unconscious on the bed. Dr Francis Somerset, from Abbey House Medical Practice, told the inquest Miss Jones had an ECG in October 2010, with normal results. He said he saw her once after that, in September 2011. ‘It is rare and very serious,’ he said. ‘It sends a shiver down my back. I am glad I was not the last person to see her.’ Miss Jones’s last appointment was with Dr Asma Saad, a GP registrar, who told the inquest the patient had not mentioned chest pains. Asked if she would have ordered an ECG if Miss Jones had done so, the doctor said: ‘Definitely. We would have ordered an ECG there and then. It would have rung alarm bells.’ Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. She said: ‘I can only remember two cases of the condition in 17 years as county coroner.’","Gemma had chronic inflammation of the heart which would have been picked up by an ECG test .

Amsterdam's today became the first city in the Netherlands to ban students from smoking marijuana at school. The city's mayor Eberhard van der Laan introduced the law after school chiefs complained about pupils turning up to classes high after rolling up outside the grounds. Marijuana is widely available in Holland as, although it is technically illegal, police can't prosecute people for possession of small amounts. The Netherlands' relaxed drug policy means some youngsters are turning up to classes stoned, prompting a ban of its use near schools (file picture) But it has also had the unwanted side effect that Dutch children are frequently exposed to the drug in public areas. City spokeswoman Iris Reshef says schools have always forbidden pot, but found it difficult to enforce the policy when students smoked on or near campus and challenged administrators to do anything about it. 'It's not really what you have in mind as an educator, that children would be turning up for class stoned, or drunk either for that matter,' she said. 'But it has been a problem for some schools.' Tolerance: Amsterdam is known for its 'coffee shops', where marijuana can be purchased and smoked (file picture) After a change in national law, the city will now be able to declare as of January 1 'no toking zones' - areas like schools and playgrounds where weed-smoking is forbidden by law. The move is closely paired with a decision by the new government to ditch plans for a national 'weed pass' that would have blocked tourists from buying marijuana. That was a measure years in the making, and greatly desired by southern cities such as Maastricht that have been flooded with dealers from Belgium and Germany who drive across the border to buy weed in bulk. Marijuana has been tolerated in Holland for decades, attracting many tourists who travel there to enjoy the drug . But the weed pass was opposed by Amsterdam, where drug tourists are not generally seen as causing many problems. Last month, Van der Laan proclaimed that coffee shops would stay open for tourists after all. In a letter Wednesday, he noted that one in three tourists who come to Amsterdam try marijuana while they're here, more than previously estimated. After several decades of the tolerance policy, Dutch marijuana usage rates are in the middle of international norms, higher than those in neighboring Germany, but lower than those in France, Britain or the United States.","Netherlands' relaxed drug laws exposing children to the drug .

The election of a new Pope could start sooner than the earliest possible date of March 15, it emerged today. Under Vatican rules, there is always a 15-20 day waiting period before Cardinals vote in a conclave after the papacy becomes vacant. But the announcement of Pope Benedict XVI that he will retire on February 28, means they will have plenty of time to get to Rome to take part in the election . Scroll down for video . Pope Benedict XVI: An election to find his successor could be held earlier than the usual 15-20 days after a papal vacancy . Vatican spokesman The Rev. Federico Lombardi claimed that rules on papal succession were open to interpretation and that 'this is a question that people are discussing.' He said: 'It is possible that church authorities can prepare a proposal to be taken up by the cardinals on the first day after the papal vacancy' to move up the start of conclave. Rules: Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi says the cardinals may accept a proposal bringing forward the election . The date of the conclave's start is important because Holy Week begins March 24, with Palm Sunday Mass followed by Easter Sunday on March 31. In order to have a new pope in place in time for the most solemn liturgical period on the church calendar, he would need to be installed as pope by Sunday, March 17. Given the tight time-frame, speculation has mounted that some sort of arrangement would be made to start the conclave earlier than a strict reading of the law would allow. Questions about the start of the conclave have swirled ever since Benedict announced on Febraury 11 that he would retire, the first pontiff in 600 years to abdicate rather than stay in office until death. As a result, his decision has created a host of questions about how the Vatican will proceed, given that its procedures for the so-called 'sede vacante' - or vacant seat - period between papacies won't begin with a pope's death. Lombardi also gave more details about Benedict's final audiences and plans for retirement, saying already 35,000 people have requested tickets for his final general audience to be held in St. Peter's Square on February 27. He said Benedict would spend about two months in the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo south of Rome immediately after his abdication, to allow enough time for renovations to be completed on his retirement home - a converted monastery inside the Vatican walls. That means Benedict would be expected to return to the Vatican, no longer as pope, around the end of April or beginning of May, Lombardi said. He was asked if and when the pope would meet with his successor and whether he would participate in his installation Mass. Both issues simply haven't yet been resolved, Lombardi said.","Vatican spokesman says cardinals may agree to radical proposal to bring forward the succession vote .

Her face full of anguish, this is the moment Chelsea Clinton left New York Presbyterian Hospital yesterday after visiting her mother Hillary, who has a blood clot between her brain and skull. Chelsea was the first of the Clinton clan to be by her mother's bedside after she was admitted on Sunday. As soon as word of her condition spread, a frenzy of media gathered outside the hospital and captured Chelsea's worried face as she left. Former President Bill Clinton later arrived at the hospital to visit his wife, the concern also etched on his face as he was spotted driving away after a brief stay. The Secretary of State is expected to spend the next few days being treated for the clot which doctors discovered during a routine checkup after Hillary fell and hit her head two weeks ago. Chelsea Clinton looks visibly anguished as she leaves the New York Presbyterian Hospital after visiting her mother Hillary Clinton yesterday where she is being treated for a blood clot . Health scare: Hillary Clinton's doctors discovered the clot during a follow-up exam on Sunday and confirmed it was in her head yesterday . In a statement yesterday, doctors assured it was not a life-threatening condition and assured she had suffered no brain damage or stroke. 'In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff,' Drs Lisa Bardack and Gigi El-Bayoumi said in a statement. A clot occurs when a blockage builds up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death. For Clinton, 'the particular vein they're talking about, there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it doesn't build up in the brain,' Dr Sanjay Gupta told CNN. The condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down. Clinton, 65, was admitted to the hospital on Sunday and CBS New York reports that doctors want to monitor her for at least another 48 hours. Doctors are keeping her under their watchful eye as they adjust the dose of her anti-clotting medication. Chelsea, who was spotted by the New York Daily News, was the first member of the Clinton family to be seen publicly at the hospital. Chelsea, 32, a special correspondent for NBC News, looked upset as she left the hospital - cell phone in hand. She ignored questions from a reporter and went back inside. Aides and doctors say Clinton contracted a stomach virus in early December and became dehydrated, then fainted, fell and hit her head on December 9. She was diagnosed with a concussion on December 13 and hasn't been seen in public since. Political force: Clinton is known as President Obama's most popular cabinet members - and among the names mentioned for a possible 2016 presidential run . Medical care: Clinton was admitted to New York-Presbyterian Hospital so doctors can monitor her medication over the next 48 hours . 'In the course of a routine follow-up MRI on Sunday, the scan revealed that a right transverse sinus venous thrombosis had formed. This is a clot in the vein that is situated in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear. It did not result in a stroke, or neurological damage. To help dissolve this clot, her medical team began treating the Secretary with blood thinners. She will be released once the medication dose has been established. In all other aspects of her recovery, the Secretary is making excellent progress and we are confident she will make a full recovery. She is in good spirits, engaging with her doctors, her family, and her staff.'From Dr Lisa Bardack, Mt. Kisco Medical Group, and Dr Gigi El-Bayoumi, George Washington University . The new health scare may bring back . some painful memories for the former first lady, who suffered a large . blood clot in her leg back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with the New York Daily News, Clinton called the 1998 clot 'the most significant health scare I've ever had.' Most clots in the legs are . treated with six months of blood thinners to allow them to dissolve on . their own and to prevent further clots from forming, he said. A clot in a lung or the brain is more . serious. Lung clots, called pulmonary embolisms, can be deadly, and a . clot in the brain can cause a stroke. Clinton's illness led her to cancel an . overseas trip and scheduled testimony before Congress about the attack . on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. When her absence was reported, several pundits and newspapers accused Clinton of making her illness seem worse than it was to dodge questions from lawmakers over the consulate attack, which claimed the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The New York Post called her concussion a 'head fake.' Florida Rep Allan West said Clinton had a case of the 'Benghazi flu,' while Fox News contributer Charles Krauthammer dubbed it an 'acute Benghazi allergy.' Reines said doctors will continue to assess Clinton's condition, 'including other issues associated with her concussion.' First family: Mrs Clinton is pictured with daughter Chelsea Clinton and husband Bill during the closing Plenary session of the seventh Annual Meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative last year . Earlier this week, The National Enquirer . reported that brain cancer was behind Mrs Clinton's health problems and . that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the . diagnosis. But a spokesman for the Democrat labelled the claims 'absolute nonsense' and insisted Clinton was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion. Only days before her concussion Clinton had said she was in excellent health during an interview with Barbara Walters. Hillary Clinton has a blood clot located in the vein in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear, a condition called transverse sinus venous thrombosis. The transverse sinus is located beneath the brain and allows blood to drain from the back of the head. It is the most common sites for clots inside the head, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A clot occurs when a blockage builds up, either from partial thrombus (coagulated blood) or an outside compression. When the vein becomes blocked, the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area, which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death. For Clinton, 'the particular vein they're talking about, there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it doesn't build up in the brain,' Dr Sanjay Gupta told CNN. Symptoms and signs can include headache, nausea, vomiting and seizures, although the condition was detected in Clinton with a routine MRI scan following her treatment for concussion. Doctors questioned whether this concussion, paired with the fact Hillary had a similar clot in her leg in 1988, led to the condition. 'You don't typically see blood clots forming in veins after this sort of concussion,' Dr Gupta said. 'She is somebody who has formed these blood clots before. There are some people who more likely develop blood clots. Does she clot more vigorously than normal? That with the brain injury - the concussion - could have led to it.' The condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down. Other treatments include using a shunt to drain pressure on the brain or surgery - yet doctors said neither are necessary for Clinton.

But in the world of high-stakes Manhattan real estate, money is no object. In fact, it can be a point of pride and a show of seemingly-unlimited affluence, which could help explain the sky-high prices. The top three properties – located in Midtown West, Lenox Hill,and Lincoln Square – boast creature comforts and space that many can only dream of, and are listed between $95million and $100million, making them the priciest residential listings in the city. Priciest: The 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, at 781 Fifth Avenue in the Lenox Hill neighborhood of Manhattan is one of the most expensive listings at $95m . Location: The 18th floor co-op is located at the southwest tip of the Lennox Hill neighbourhood, a block away from landmarks like the Plaza Hotel, Grand Army Plaza, and Central Park . Amenities: The Sherry-Netherland co-op offers 7,000 square feet, complete with seven bedrooms and seven baths . Luxe: Along with a massive terrace, the property has four exposures, an almost unheard of thing in Manhattan real estate . The first property, the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, is listed with Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens and Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman. The 18th floor co-op is located at the southwest tip of the Lennox Hill neighbourhood, a block away from several Manhattan landmarks – including the Plaza Hotel, Grand Army Plaza, and Central Park. It offers 7,000 square feet, complete with seven bedrooms and seven baths, dizzying views of the Plaza Hotel and Central Park, and three separate entrances. The property, which has wrap-around terraces, has been on the market since September. Despite the colossal price tag, its monthly real estate tax is incredibly affordable, at only $1 per month. High living: The 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, a co-op residential hotel across from the Plaza, is selling for a staggering $95million . Austere: A copper gargoyle adorns the building, which overlooks the southeast end of Central Park . Old school: The lobby reflects the glamorous old New York set, with attended elevators and marble details . Aside from its expansive space, the Fifth Avenue property boasts services associated with old New York, including valets in white gloves, turn-down service, maid service, 24-hour concierge, and in-room dining from Harry Cipriani. It was designed in 1927 by the same architecture firm that created The Waldorf-Astoria and The Pierre; its 165 apartments were converted to co-ops in 1954. A property at 15 Central Park West was also listed for $95million, and the sweeping French Gothic Woolworth Mansion was listed for $90million. The most expensive listing of the year goes to the penthouse at  150 W. 56th St. in the CitySpire condominium which was previously owned by Long Island real estate developer Steven Klar. He listed the property in July of this year. Trophy: 150 West 56th Street, the CitySpire building, boasts the most expensive listing; its penthouse suite costs $100million, but also has top-of-the-line equipment and 360-degree views . Greco-Roman: The elaborate penthouse was designed by Juan Pablo Molyneux, and takes much inspiration from Greek and Roman architecture . Vistas: The penthouse occupys the top three floors of the CitySpire building; its dining room sits 20 and overlooks the Hudson River . Lavish living: The three-story penthouse has an entire guest apartment and lots of terrace space . The octagonally-shaped property boasts 8,000 square feet and three floors – one of which is an entire guest suite. Mr Klar told the New York Times in a July interview that he purchased the property in 1993 for $4.5million and spent years redesigning the raw interior. He transformed it to hold a 20-person dining room, six bedrooms, nine baths, complete with wine cellar and media room. It has 135 windows, which look out to four separate exposures. But Forbes notes that the property does not have other typically-essential high-end features like high ceilings. Contender: Apartment #35S of 15 Central Park West is also listed for a staggering $95million . Views: The apartment is located at the southwest corner of Central Park and offers stunning views of the city . Expansive: Located in Lincoln Square, the a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bath condominium is also listed for $95million . In addition, the new construction, One57, the property being constructed blocks away, could seriously block some of the views. The third listing, also for $95,000,000, is at 15 Central Park West, a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bath condominium in Lincoln Square. The property has three exposures, library, massive living room, and views of both Central Park and the Hudson River.

'Officers and members of the US Marshalls Fugitive Task Force responded to that area. They encountered Mr. Morales. He was shot and he is now deceased.' Erbling didn't say whether Morales' actions provoked the officers to open fire. He said the matter was being investigated. The Southlake DPS Facebook page first tweeted the information shortly after 1 a.m. By 3:25 a.m., police had not moved Morales' body, NBC reported. On Thursday, federal agents went door-to-door in the neighborhoods near the Grapevine Wal-Mart, where Morales made his brazen escape. They talked to homeowners and searched barns and sheds in the area, warning that the man, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was armed and dangerous. He is believed to have stolen men's . clothing and jewelery from the home on Friday night. Morales was still . wearing part of his prison-issued jumpsuit as well as jogging pants, . according to CBS News.

The fugitive's escape from custody sparked a widespread five-day manhunt in North Texas.

He . is being treated at a Dallas hospital for deep stab wounds to the neck, . shoulder and back and a collapsed lung. It's not clear when he would be . released. Pardinas . and Detective David Carrero were scheduled to fly to Nevada with . Morales so he could serve two life sentences there for aggravated sexual . assault. But the officers and Morales weren't allowed to get back on . the plane during a layover in Texas because of the inmate's erratic . behavior, authorities said.

During the first leg of the flight, Morales was 'bumping his head against a passenger seat in front of him, so he was doing a lot of crazy, unusual things that just disrupted the entire flight,' said Miami-Dade Police Director J.D. Patterson Jr. The detectives were then forced to rent a vehicle at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport with the intention of driving the nearly 1,200 miles to their destination. Miami Police said there are clear policies about transporting inmates across state lines, but didn't discuss details other than to say two officers must be present. The officers stopped to use the restroom at the store late on Monday night and were waiting for a third officer to meet them and assist with the rest of the trip. While Carrero was inside the store, Morales got hold of the broken pair of eyeglasses, stabbed Pardinas and fled, authorities said. 'He was handcuffed. We don't know how he got the handcuffs free,' Patterson said. It's unclear if Morales' hands were cuffed in front or behind him or if he was shackled.

He was being taken to Nevada to serve out life sentences on a separate sexual assault conviction in that state. Authorities frequently fly inmates across the country and said they are occasionally forced off the plane by an inmate's behavior.

Faraz Shauketaly, who works for the Sunday Leader newspaper, . is said to have suffered serious injuries to his neck in an attack by three . gunmen in his home on the island. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said it 'remained . unclear' whether the incident - the latest in a spate against reporters - . was related to Mr Shauketaly's work on the English-language paper. Journalist Faraz Shauketaly was taken to Kalubowila hospital in Colombo after he was shot at by three gunmen . Mr Burt said the Sri Lankan authorities 'must quickly . identify who committed this crime and bring them to justice' - accusing . them of doing too little to investigate previous incidents. And the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights . Navi Pillay said she was 'deeply disturbed' by the attack on someone . who worked for a publication critical of the Sri Lankan government. The newspaper has . been harshly critical of the government and its outspoken editor . Lasantha Wickrematunga was killed four years ago. However, the . newspaper's criticism has not been as sharp since it was bought by a . businessman close to the ruling party last year. Sunday Leader editor Sakunthala Perera said the gunmen . stormed the home of the journalist - who holds dual UK/Sri Lankan nationality - . yesterday in Mount Lavinia on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo.

'The UK and EU have urged the Government of Sri Lanka . to do everything possible to investigate such incidences and ensure that those . responsible are brought to justice.' The shooting happened on the outskirts of Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, at Faraz Shauketaly's home . Ms Pillay told Channel 4 News: 'I'm deeply disturbed by . this particular shooting because it's a journalist and he's attached to a . newspaper that's known to be critical of the government - particularly on . accountability and in justice issues - which are issues that I cover.

'I will be reporting to the Human Rights Council my . concern over extra judicial killings, abductions and this kind of treatment and . suppression of freedom of expression.' She said he should be given immediate protection. 'Whoever tried to kill him obviously was targeting him. It's an act of attempted assassination so he needs to be protected . immediately.' There needed to be a 'proper investigation before we . can conclude' whether there was any state involvement in the attack, she . said.

'These institutions built into the democracy must now . begin to work properly and this is an immediate instance where they can . demonstrate that.' Police spokesman Prishantha Jayakody said an investigation was underway and declined to comment further. According to Amnesty International at least 14 Sri Lankan media workers have been killed since the beginning of 2006.

Arianna Williams, 33, spoke out about the shooter accused of killing four, saying she isn't surprised that he reached his tipping point and eventually snapped. Police have confirmed that Dorner died on Tuesday after a massive manhunt. 'When you have a profession where you worked your whole life to really obtain something in that level of success…when you go into that environment where everyone else is not lined up with the way you believe and the way you think…after time, the stress could probably wear on you,' Williams told KCAL-TV. Snapped: Arianna Williams spoke out about her former boyfriend, saying he bottled up his emotions . 'I don’t think (that justifies) someone going out and killing anyone because they're stressed out at work. Chris, unfortunately, was one of those people…he bottled up his emotions and wasn’t good at expressing himself,' she added. Authorities say fugitive former cop Christopher Dorner died of a single gunshot wound to the head as authorities were pumping . tear gas into a mountain cabin during a deadly gun battle with sheriff's . deputies. His ex-girlfriend said she is not surprised Dorner snapped . San Bernardino County sheriff's Capt. Sheriff John McMahon told reporters Friday that it appears the wound was self-inflicted. Deputies said they heard one final gunshot from the cabin as it was going up in flames during Tuesday's gunbattle. Before he died, Dorner killed one sheriff's deputy and wounded another during a fierce shootout. Authorities . initially were unsure whether Dorner killed himself, had been struck by . a deputy's bullet or had died in a fire that engulfed the cabin during . the shootout. The search for Dorner began last week after authorities said he had launched a deadly revenge campaign against the Los Angeles Police Department for his firing, warning that he would bring 'warfare' to LAPD officers and their families. The manhunt brought police to Big Bear Lake, 80 miles east of Los Angeles, where they found Dorner's burned-out pickup truck abandoned. His footprints disappeared on frozen soil and hundreds of officers who searched the area and checked out each building failed to find him.

Artist Michael Rohde - who was inspired to embark on his project after being homeless for five months - said that, unlike 'simple' pictures snapped using smartphone apps like the ever-popular Instagram, his painstakingly created images offer a means of seeing things 'from a new perspective'.

The 52-year-old then takes separate pictures of every single item in the room from below, before using a computer to 'stitch' the two perspectives together. He began with his own flat, before branching out to document the homes of friends and acquaintances around Berlin.

'The view of above is adequately known and the most popular in our society, because it is the perspective of control and power,' he said. 'But we also should know the opposite side.' He said the seed for the project was planted when he spent five months homeless in 2009. 'Homelessness was my choice as I was having problems with government agencies,' he said. 'I collected all kinds of materials from abandoned buildings to make myself a place to sleep at night and photographed them from above. I felt this showed the perspective of control and power. 'Later, once I had my own apartment again, I turned this angle around and that's how the idea for 'From Below' developed,' he said. 'First I take fragmented, individual photos of the whole room from the middle. 'Then . I photograph each of the objects within it - cupboards, chairs, the . entire inventory - from below, in a personal perspective, so to speak. 'These are combined on the computer to form one complete, multi-perspective composition. 'These are pictures for me, in the reason it's painting and not (classic) photography.' Mr . Rohde, originally from Lippstadt, has been interested in the perception . of space and perspective within interiors as a theme for 10 years.

The family of a man who was slain is outraged that a woman convicted in his death received only a four-year prison sentence for her crime. Peggy Sue Thomas, 47, a former Ms. Washington beauty queen, received the sentencing after she pleaded guilty to plotting the murder of Russel Douglas. Douglas was found shot to death in his car two days after Christmas in 2003. 'It seems like a travesty of the basic sense of justice that she would be sentenced to less than four years in prison for the cold and premeditated act that could not have happened without her involvement,' the victim’s father, Jim Douglas, said in court on Friday, ABC News  Seattle affiliate KOMO reported. Rage: Family of Russel Douglas were angry at former beauty queen Peggy Sue Thomas receiving just four years in prison for her role in his murder . Turning to Thomas in court, he said, 'I hope [prison] will be a living hell for you.' 'In a few short days you'll be placed in . a shark tank as a piece of fresh meat,' he added. 'I'm sure they . will appreciate all that fine plastic surgery.' Prosecutors said Thomas and her then-boyfriend, James Huden, lured Douglas into a remote area so Huden could shoot him. Huden was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to 80 years in prison. Prosecutors say the murder was plotted out of revenge, with Huden and Thomas suspecting that Douglas was abusing his wife and kids. Thomas worked at a hair salon with Douglas's wife. Victim: Douglas was lured to his death after Thomas and her then-boyfriend James Huden believed he was abusing his wife and kids . Thomas, who was crowned Ms Washington . in 2000 and has had a string of failed marriages since, had faced a . first-degree murder charge until the plea deal that was struck on . January 24. That trial was due to begin just a week before she pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. After sentencing, Jim Douglas, the victim's father, called Thomas 'the most despicable of human species.' Huden, who was arrested in Mexico in 2005, was convicted of first-degree murder last summer and sentenced to 80 years. Thomas was arrested in July 2011 on her houseboat, called Off the Hook, near Farmington, New Mexico. Huden could have been faced a much slimmer sentence if he had testified against Thomas, but he refused. Couple: Thomas' boyfriend James Huden (right) was arrested in 2005 and pleaded not guilty to the murder, but he refused to testify against Thomas, left . Victim: Russ Douglas, a father of two from Whidbey Island, was found shot to death in a car just after Christmas in 2003 . A motive for the murder was never . established, but reports suggested the duo had planned to kill Douglas . out of revenge because they suspected him of abusing his wife and . children. Thomas knew Douglas' wife Brenna, who owned the salon where the former beauty queen worked. 'It was some weird karmic revenge thing. I’m not sure if that was the motive or the only motive. There were a . lot of theories about what the motives were,' prosecutor Greg Banks told The Seattle Times. After her 2000 pageant victory, Peggy Sue got married - a few times. One of those nuptials was a short-lived marriage to Alaska oil tycoon Mark Allen. Allen's horse Mine That Bird, won the Kentucky Derby in 2009 - the same year the couple divorced, according to a 2011 profile in Seattle Weekly. After being arrested and posting $500,000 bail, Thomas made headlines for her post-jail travels. She was allowed by a judge to take a two-week, five-state road trip so she can attend her half-sister's memorial service, go to the dentist and pick up winter clothes, after her release. The trips took her to New Mexico, Utah and Nevada to take care of a few chores - preparing to sell a house and picking up her winter clothes, among other things.","Peggy Sue Thomas, 47, a former beauty queen, implicated in 2003 death of Russ Douglas .

"By . Abigail Butcher . PUBLISHED: . 20:16 EST, 16 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:45 EST, 18 February 2013 . We might be appalled at having unknowingly eaten horse, but as a horse lover, I believe we need a horsemeat trade in Britain. If used properly, it could solve some of our desperate horse welfare problems. I worked as head of news for Horse & Hound, the UK’s equestrian bible, for six years. During that time, I was horrified by daily stories of neglect. Not necessarily the sort of neglect that results in an RSPCA prosecution, but nonetheless brought about by owners shirking responsibility. We call ourselves a nation of animal lovers, but there is a growing crisis in the horse world and our charities are awash with unwanted and abandoned equines. In a minority: Horse lover Abigail Butcher, pictured riding in Argentina, believes that selling horses for food could put a stop to welfare problems such as neglect . The sheer expense of keeping a horse means that prices – even of decent competition animals – have plummeted with the economy. These days, low-value animals and horses that can no longer be ridden – either through injury, old age  or bad behaviour – can barely  even be given away. As a result, they often languish, neglected and forgotten, in fields. Last year, more than 700 horses were reported abandoned to the horse sanctuary Redwings – up from 160 in 2009. Another charity, World Horse Welfare, last year rescued double the number of horses it did in 2006. Why is this happening? Aside from financial issues, it’s because we have bred too many low- standard animals for too long and we can’t face up to our responsibilities. When my ex-racehorse could no longer be ridden because of injury, I chose to have him destroyed. The alternative was to leave him in a field, unhappy and in pain. By having him put down, I knew his suffering was over. I am, however, in the minority  of owners who choose humane destruction. One reason is that  disposing of a horse is not cheap: a vet will charge at least £150 to put one down. Neglected: Hundreds of horses, such as this animal in North Wales, have to be rescued every year as it is too expensive for owner's to look after them, or have them put down . Even then it is illegal to bury a horse unless you get an individual licence, so the body must then be disposed of at a cost of between £100 and £400, usually by either a local hunt kennels or a knackerman. The horse’s carcass will be incinerated or fed to the hounds or  animals at a local zoo. If you want your horse cremated and its ashes returned, you can say goodbye to nearly £1,000. But there is a ready market in continental Europe for horsemeat. And the slaughter trade provides a humane and logical way to dispose of unwanted animals. There is a financial incentive, too. If a horse has not been given drugs unsafe for human consumption, an abattoir will pay roughly £300 for it. In 2008, Horse & Hound investigated horse dealer James Gray, who was found with more than 100 horses in various stages of ill-health and decay on his farm in Buckinghamshire. At the time, no one could work out why he had them. Now we know. There are an estimated one million horses in the UK and the ones swilling around at the bottom of the market can be bought by dealers for as little as a fiver at auction –  and sold on for meat. Humane: Abigail Butcher says horse meat is consumed by millions of people in continental Europe, such as shoppers at this horsemeat butcher shop in Paris . People hoped this trade in unfit horses would slow in 2004 when the EU introduced horse passports to track what drugs a horse had been given. If the horse had been given the painkiller phenylbutazone, or ‘bute’, it would be signed as unfit for human consumption. But Labour failed to police the system and until recently it has been easy to circumvent the scheme. Each year, about 10,000 horses are sold for meat in the UK. Native ponies make up a proportion of  that number, and around 1,000 racehorses end up in the food chain each year, too. However, the British Horseracing Authority has just announced that the number bred for racing in Britain and Ireland has fallen by just under a third compared with five years ago – meaning fewer will finish their careers unwanted at an abattoir. So the majority must be leisure horses, finding their way there via a dealer. In all my years at Horse & Hound, and as a horse owner, I don’t know of a single person who has sold a horse for meat – or admitted to it. But why not? We eat cows, sheep and chickens, so what’s wrong with allowing people to eat horse? The horse is a meat animal consumed by millions in continental Europe. If humane destruction at a well-regulated abattoir in the UK is the kindest option, isn’t that preferable to allowing a beautiful animal to suffer? I think so.","Abigail Butcher believes horsemeat trade could end welfare issues .

The trial of a teenager who allegedly lured in a victim with a fake Facebook profile before murdering him will reach its closing arguments this week. Manuel Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, is accused of setting up a bogus account and using the picture of a 'curvy' and 'seductive' internet model to attract men online. Prosecutors claim that when Eddie Leal, a 23-year-old professional bantamweight boxer, agreed to meet the fictional woman, known as Rebecca Santhiago, he was shot to death by Guzman in San Jacinto, California. They say Guzman's motive was to kill for a 'thrill.' Edmundo Guzman Jr, left, is accused of using this picture of a 'curvy', 'seductive' model, left, in a false Facebook account for a fictional woman known as Rebecca Santhiago to lure men. Prosecutors claim he then shot a man who came to meet 'Santhiago' in a 'thrill kill' Riverside County District Attorney’s Office claim that Guzman, who was 17 at the time, created the profile using a glamor shot of an East Coast internet model, reports ABC. The account paints a picture of a single 21-year-old, who 'loves to kick it at house parties or clubs' and asks for men to 'show some love and maybe we can hang out.' Prosecutors described the photo used as showing 'a curvy, attractive, young brunette in a tight dress who was smiling seductively.' Leal began Facebook messaging 'Santhiago' and a meeting was arranged in a San Jacinto park at around 2 am on May 30, 2011, it is alleged. The prosecution claims that when Leal arrived he encountered Guzman, who shot him several times, in what attorneys describe as a 'thrill kill.' The false account paints a picture of a single 21-year-old, who 'loves to kick it at house parties or clubs' and asks for men to 'show some love and maybe we can hang out' Upcoming boxer, Eddie Leal, 23, was found shot dead in his car. Prosecutors claim that he was lured to a meeting point and then murdered by Manuel Edmundo Guzman . Leal died at the scene and authorities found the up and coming boxer in the driver's seat of his Toyota Corolla in Roanoke Street, San Jacinto. After a year-long investigation, detectives allegedly tracked the bogus Facebook profile to a computer at Guzman’s mother’s house, where he lived. Investigator Tony Pelato, a computer forensics expert, told The Press Enterprise that he had 'no doubt at all' that Santhiago’s chat messages were typed on Guzman’s computer. A copy of the Facebook page and the chat messages were reportedly also found on the victim's computer. Guzman was arrested and charged on April 10, 2012. He was already on probation for a juvenile conviction the previous year. According to the prosecution, the victim came to meet the fictional woman at this street corner but instead was fatally shot . The defendant's attorneys have argued that the case is circumstantial and there is no evidence the teenager fired a gun. Last week a witness testified that five bullet casings left at the murder scene did not test positive for any trace of Guzman's DNA. Guzman faces charges of first-degree murder as well as a special circumstance allegation of lying in wait, as well as gun and great bodily injury allegations. If convicted, he faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.","Edmundo Guzman Jr, 19, accused of using a picture of an internet model in a false Facebook account to lure men .

A rookie driver was cleared of dangerous driving for allowing drunken youths to ‘surf’ on the bonnet of his car minutes before he accidentally ran over and killed a close friend. Youcef Adjerid, 18, drove a short distance with one youth on the front of his Fiat Punto before he hit his brakes and sent him flying into the road. Tragic Toby Hearne - who had been to a fancy dress party dressed as a Christmas present - then got on the bonnet and managed to hold on when Adjerid, of Chippenham, Wiltshire, stopped sharply. Not guilty: Youcef Adjerid (left) was cleared of dangerous driving after allowing drunken youths to 'surf' on his car bonnet minutes before he accidentally ran over and killed a friend Toby Hearne (right) But moments later Toby lay down in the road near the car and Adjerid failed to see him and drove over him. Mr Hearne suffered catastrophic chest injuries and died instantly at the scene in Stanton St Quintin, Wiltshire. Police questioned Adjerid, who had not been drinking, but he was not charged over the death in the early hours of December 22, 2011. A coroner later ruled that Mr Hearne died as the result of an accident when his judgement was impaired by alcohol. Adjerid - who had passed his test just two weeks earlier - was however charged with dangerous or careless driving over the car surfing stunt. Swindon Crown Court heard how Adjerid turned up late at a house party just as it was ending. On the way he came across four friends - Sam Riley, Joe Bodman, Hal Bailey, and tragic Mr Hearne. Mr Riley and Mr Hearne decided to climb on to the bonnet of his car and took turns to ‘car surf’ as he drove along at walking pace. Tributes: Flowers were left at the scene of the fatal accident in Stanton St Quintin, Wiltshire, where Toby Hearne was killed . Adjerid laughed as he slammed on his brakes and threw Mr Riley to the ground and then repeated the stunt with pal Mr Hearne, who managed to stay on when he stopped. A jury, who had not been told of the death of Mr Hearne, took just over an hour to clear Adjerid of all charges. Outside court Adjerid said: 'My year has been incredibly hard. It has been a very difficult time after what happened. 'This brings closure to a difficult chapter in my life and I just want to move on now.' One of Adjerid’s friends told the inquest into Mr Hearne’s death: 'I saw clearly what happened. 'I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about. 'Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off.'","Youcef Adjerid let friends 'surf' on bonnet of his car just before fatal accident .

A mummified head found in an attic, claimed to be that of the first French monarch Henri IV, continues to divide historians and researchers. A new book claims to end the mystery of what happened to the king’s remains, mainly his head which researchers say was found five years ago in the attic of Jacques Bellanger, a retired tax collector in Angers, western France. The claims come as British scientists confirmed that a skeleton unearthed in Leicester was Richard III, who was killed in battle more than 500 years ago. Mystery of remains: This mummified head, found in an attic in Angers, western France, is the French monarch Henri IV's head, researchers say but there are critics who dispute the claims . In book Henri IV: The Mystery of a Headless King, authors Stéphane Gabet and Philippe Charlier say that facial hair, a broken nose, a knife gash on the upper lip from a failed assassination attempt and a large beauty spot prove that the head is the king’s. There are now calls for his head to be reburied in the Basilica of Saint Denis but as critics dispute and continue to argue over the claim, it remains in a bank vault near the Bastille. Forensic pathologist Charlier led a team of researchers who claim their research has uncovered a rare genetic signature shared by Henri and Louis XVI, who are separated by seven generations, and managed to provide evidence for the authenticity of both sets of remains in the process. Calls to be reburied: Some say the head should be reburied with Henri's body in the Basilica of Saint Denis but critics continue to argue over the claim . He said: 'This study shows that (the owners of the remains) share a genetic heritage passed on through the paternal line. 'They have a direct link to one another through their fathers.' Critics refute claims it is Henri’s head and say that the brain in the mummified head, which has shrunk to the size of a nut, would have been removed by royal embalmers had it been Henri. Long thought to belong to Henri, . assassinated at the age of 57 by a Catholic fanatic in 1610, the head . changed hands several times over the next two centuries, bought and sold . at auction or kept in secretive private collections. Henri IV was killed by a Catholic fanatic as his coach became caught up in traffic congestion 400 years ago. Unearthed: The claims come as British scientists confirmed that a skeleton found in Leicester was that of Richard III, who was killed in battle more than 500 years ago . New detail: The facial reconstruction of Richard III was unveiled last week (right) following the confirmation of remains found in Leicester last year . He was buried in the Basilica of Saint Denis near Paris, but during the frenzy of the French Revolution, the royal graves were dug up and revolutionaries chopped off Henri's head, which was then snatched. The head disappeared but resurfaced in 1919 when antiques dealer Joseph Emile Bourdais bought it from an auction house for three francs, it has been claimed. Divided dynasties: The remains have divided descendants of two royal French dynasties including Prince Louis de Bourbon who wants the head to be reburied with the king's body . He tried unsuccessfully to confirm the authenticity of the head as Henri’s for much of his life, even offering it to the Louvre before his death in 1946 but was refused. Ever since then it was kept in secretive private collections until 2008 when a head was found in Mr Bellanger’s attic, who claimed he bought it in 1953. In their examinations of the monarch's head, Gabet and Charlier found features often seen in the king's portraits, including a dark wound above his right nostril. They also found a healed bone fracture above his upper left jaw, which matched a stab wound the king suffered during an assassination attempt in 1594 and a pierced ear. Mr Gabet wrote: ‘In the loft, in an old wardrobe, was a box. Inside, there was something wrapped in an old towel. ‘Jacques Bellanger folded back one side of the towel, then the other. The mummified head appeared, well conserved, impressive. It was a magic moment.’ The mystery has divided descendants of two royal French dynasties. The Duke of France and Count of Paris, Henri d'Orléans, has called the book a ‘pseudo inquiry’. He told French journalists: ‘This affair seems closer to a novel than scientific or historic truth. ‘What are we supposed to see from this supposed facial reconstitution - that he had a Bourbon nose?’ The Duke of Anjou, Prince Louis de Bourbon, disputes this. He said: ‘Now that we have found and authenticated the head, we have to organise its return [to the rest of the body].’ The facial reconstruction of Richard III was unveiled last week following the confirmation of the remains found in Leicester.","The claims have been made in a new book after head was found in Angers .

Whatever the Duchess of Cambridge wears turns to gold. From a cornflower blue dress from Zara to a pair of vibrant pink jeans, her wardrobe choices have sent high street sales soaring with shoppers desperate to emulate her impeccable style. But it seems that not everyone is reaping the rewards of the 'Kate effect', with designer Roland Mouret admitting that Kim Kardashian has more selling power than the Duchess. Battle of the fashion queens: While the Duchess of Cambridge is known for boosting sales, Roland Mouret maintains that Kim Kardashian has better selling power. Both beauties have worn his creations, as seen here . Kate wowed the world when she stepped out in one of his show-stopping cream gowns at Claridge's last year, but French designer Mouret said the 30-year-old doesn't boost his sales as much as businesswoman and reality TV star Kim. 'You don’t see hundreds of women running . around looking like her [Kate Middleton],' he said. 'To be honest, we’re . more likely to get orders on a dress that Kim Kardashian’s worn,' he told The Telegraph. Outspoken: The 'King of the dress' isn't afraid to speak his mind . He attributes this to the fact that the Duchess has no interested in drawing in the attention of the media, unlike Kim Kardashian who lets the media follow her life on a daily basis. Speaking about Kate's fashion choices, he said: 'She’s highly attuned to those details that will provoke a tabloid frenzy and above all, she does not want a tabloid frenzy, . 'She doesn’t seem to feel the need to dress sexily to woo the world. 'She’s dressing for William and herself.' And it seems that the Duchess is so afraid of the media frenzy that she once asked for one of her gowns to be altered to fit less tightly. 'She doesn’t want a bottom situation like Pippa had,' said Mouret.

Zookeepers in Edinburgh could be set to hear the pitter patter of tiny feet soon with the UK's only two giant pandas likely to be ready to breed within the next month. Experts believe that Tian Tian and Yang Guang, who arrived at Edinburgh Zoo in a blaze of publicity in 2011, could mate within weeks. The pair are said to have already started showing important changes in their behavour. Mating season: Giant pandas Tian Tian, left, and Yang Guang, right, could be ready to mate according to experts at Edinburgh Zoo . Male Yang Guang has been spotted doing handstands against trees, walls and rocks and scent-marking as high up as possible - known as a display of virility in the wild - while Tian Tian has already started calling out to him - a common sign during breeding season. Zookeepers can usually tell when pandas are likely to mate through a combination of behavourial observation and hormone testing. But no hormonal changes have been seen in either panda as yet. Edinburgh Zoo - where the pandas have lived since their arrival from China in December 2011 - has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping. Relaxing: Tian Tian stretches in her enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo. Female pandas are in season for just 48 hours . Behavourial changes: Yang Guang has started doing handstands and scent-marking - a tell tale sign that he is ready to mate say experts . They were first introduced to each other last April but did not end up fully mating. Female pandas are in season for less than 48 hours. Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas and strategic innovations for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: 'We're delighted that both Tian Tian and Yang Guang have started to scent mark and call, both clear behavioural indicators of courtship and mating behaviour. 'Although both giant pandas are showing these changes in their behaviour, it is still early days yet and way too early to give any accurate prediction on timings, however, early indicators do suggest the breeding season will probably fall in March this year. Acquainted: Tian Tian and Yang Guang peer through the fence at each other from their enclosures at Edinburgh Zoo . 'In reality we could be as little as four weeks away, although equally the big day could still be as far off as eight weeks. 'This year we will combine both natural and assisted reproduction methods. 'This follows the best practice methodology adopted by other panda-keeping zoos around the world and gives our giant pandas the best possible chance of success.' Celebrities: The two pandas arrived at the zoo in a fanfare of celebration from China in December 2011 . The pair arrived at Edinburgh Zoo amid much excitement in December 2011. During their first year at the zoo, Tian Tian, meaning 'Sweetie', and Yang Guang, which means 'Sunshine', brought in half a million visitors and an extra £3million revenue. They will stay in Edinburgh for at least another nine years. Ready to mate: Tian Tian . Although pandas are generally thought of as poor breeders, that is a mistaken theory based on animals in captivity. Experts say that wild pandas have a reproduction rate similar to the American black bear which is thriving. Giant pandas reach sexual maturity at between five-and-a-half and six-and-a-half years old. A female can mate with several males who compete with one another to mate with her while a male panda will seek out different females who are on heat. The mating season for giant pandas generally falls between March and May but a female is in season for less than 48 hours. Males and females normally only associate for between two and four days and the female is pregnant for between 95 and 160 days. Pandas normally give birth to a single baby, but multiple births are possible if artificial insemination is used in captivity. They produce offspring roughly once every two years.

The gret-grandsons of legendary character of the Wild West have died in a Florida plane crash . Kit and Barry were great-grandsons of William F. 'Buffalo Bill' Cody, who founded the town of Cody in Wyoming. He was one of the most colorful figures of the American Old West and known for the shows he organized with cowboy themes that extensively toured the US and Europe. Buffalo Bill’s Wild West toured Europe eight times. In June 1887 the show played a command performance in the UK for Queen Victoria's jubilee in front of royalty from all over the continent. Cody died in 1917 from kidney failure. He is buried on top of Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colorado. Cody's great grandson Kit was believed to have been at the controls of the Cessna 310 when it crashed on Thursday. The Federal Aviation Administration lost contact with the Cessna 310 on Thursday afternoon, and the crash site was discovered on Friday about 20 miles from Vero Beach. His son-in-law Bryan Edwards said the three were on one of Kit’s two airplanes and had been 'island hopping' in the Bahamas before the accident occurred in the wooded Fort Drum Marsh Conservation Area, west of Vero Beach and southeast of Orlando. Florida businessman Rob Krieger, 65, also died in the accident . Family members told the Cody Enterprise newspaper that Kit’s wife Linda was supposed to have been on the flight but dropped out at the last minute. Kit divided his time between homes in Cody and Winter Haven, Florida. His brother Barry is a retired high school athletics director from Popular Bluff, Missouri. Kit Cody was known for his adventurous spirit and in September 2008, at age 63, made his 1,000th parachute jump. Following the jump he said: 'This was a good jump. Any jump you can walk away from is a great jump. In all my 1,000 jumps, I’ve never had a close call, and I hope the next 1,000 jumps will go as well.' Kit Cody owned several motels in the Florida area and was close friends with Krieger, a prominent businessmen in the Winter Haven area.

A South African man who had been in a coma for seven years was 'woken up' after being given a sleeping pill. Ayanda Nqinana, from Johannseburg, was left with severe brain injuries after his car crashed along an Eastern Cape road in 2005. His doctors said the father-of-one would most likely never recover. But his wife Nomfundo recently read a newspaper article about other long-term coma patients who had woken up after being fed sleeping pill Stilnox. Reverse effect: A South African man who had been in a coma for seven years was 'woken up' after being given Stilnox sleeping pills . She insisted her husband be given the tablets and, just five days later, Mr Nqinana was awake and able to talk. He even recognised relatives, including his son Ayavuya, and could recall conversations from before his crash. Mrs Nqinana told TimesLive.co.za: 'Ayavuya was so excited that he kept running to me saying: ""Mum! Daddy knows my name."" 'I will never forget the day Ayanda woke up; it was the happiest day of my life. Stilnox, also known as Ambien, is a prescription medicine used to treat insomnia by initiating sleep. It . contains Zolpidem, which studies have found increases blood flow in the . brain, particularly in areas involved in language comprehension - . allowing improved function. Studies into the connection between stroke rehabilitation and Stilnox are ongoing. John White at Moss Rehabilitation Center in Philadelphia is leading a study into the connection. So far he has found that fewer than 10 per cent of stroke victims respond to the drug. 'We’re . not able to yet advise families on how to use this drug clinically . because the research is in the very early stages,' he said last year. 'The very first request he made was to see his son, and that moved me.' Although Mr Nqinana is unable to hold a proper conversation, he can say the odd word and respond using sign language such as a thumbs-up gesture. But his doctor, Siyabulela Bungana, remains unconvinced about Stilnox's ability to rouse patients out of a coma. He said: 'He has not spoken to me. I have not seen any evidence of improvement.' The case is not the first time that Stilnox has woken up somebody in a coma. Last December, it is believed to have roused Sam Goddard, 23, after he suffered a series of strokes that left him in a coma. Mr Goddard, from Brisbane, Australia, was playing football in February 2010 when his head began to pound so severely he screamed for an ambulance. Doctors told his fiancée Sally Jane Nielson that he had suffered a staggering eight strokes, leaving him with permanent brain damage, and would never be able to walk, talk or recognise his loved ones, and would likely be blind. But after 45 days in a coma in the Intensive Care Unit at Royal Brisbane Hospital – where he also contracted pneumonia – Mr Goddard woke up and began making slow progress after he was given Stilnox.","Ayanda Nqinana, from Johannseburg, was left with severe brain injuries after his car crashed in 2005 .

A former solicitor who put an antique Chinese vase up for auction two years ago has only just managed to sell the piece after a lengthy legal row over the auctioneers' fees. Tony Johnson and his mother Gene believed they had sold the rare piece, which they had inherited from an relative, for the 'stratospheric' sum . of £43million in 2010. But the Chinese billionaire buyer is believed to have balked at paying an extra 20 per cent in auctioneers fees on top of his winning bid. New home: This rare 18th century Qianlong vase has finally sold for £25million after a two year legal battle over its sale at auction . Peter Bainbridge, who owns the Bainbridge auction house that 'sold' the exquisite vase, spent months trying to save the deal by negotiating with the buyer but with no success. After a two year stalemate, a new unidentified buyer from the Far East put in a new offer through Bonhams auction house and is now believed to have paid up to £25million for the 18th century Qianlong vase. It is thought the bulk of the money has gone to the Johnson family although Mr Bainbridge would have been 'significantly' compensated. Julian Roup, a spokesman for Bonhams, said: 'We are pleased to confirm the sale of the vase for an undisclosed sum, in a private treaty deal.' A Chinese table screen priced at just £150 has stunned experts at auction when it sold for £34,300. The . blue and white porcelain screen turned heads at the sale at Addison's . Auction House in Barnard Castle, County Durham, when fierce bidding from . the UK and overseas meant the price quickly soared. The . 2ft-high porcelain table screen, painted with a mountain scene and . intended purely for decorational purposes, was painted by the renowned . Chinese ceramic artist Wang Bu. The . son of Wang Xiuging, Wang Bu became a popular porcelain painter during . the reigns of Tongzhi and Guangxu, and started an apprenticeship in . Jingdezhen, China, at the age of nine, after following in his father's . footsteps. He eventually earned the title of 'Qinghua Dawang' - which translates as 'The King of Blue and White'. His work is now held in various key museums and is much sought after by collectors around the world. This . lot, pictured right and below next to auctioneer Will McNab, was bagged . by a Canadian buyer for £34,300, and after a buyer's premium of 15 per . cent was added, the final price came in at £39,445 - more than 250 . times the guide price. The 16ins porcelain vase was made for the Chinese emperor Qianlong, who ruled between 1736 to 1795. It was looted from the Imperial Summer Palace during the infamous raids by the British and the French in 1860. Mr Johnson, 56, from the Isle of Wight, and his elderly mother inherited it from her late sister, Patricia Newman, in January 2010. It had once belonged to Mrs Newman's late husband who had in turn inherited it from an uncle who brought it back from China. Mr Johnson believed it could be valuable and contacted Bainbridges auctioneers in Ruislip, Middlesex. The object attracted massive interest from Chinese bidders at the auction in November 2010 and it sold for 40 times its estimate before the dispute erupted. Ivan Macquisten, editor of the Antiques Trades Gazette, said the deal that has now been reached was the best result for everybody concerned. He said: 'From what I understand Peter Bainbridge did everything possible to try and negotiate with the original buyer. 'But he could not have budged on the 20 per cent buyer's premium otherwise he could have been exposed to a legal case by the under-bidder. 'If an item fails to sale at auction, under contract the auctioneer normally reserves the right to offer it for sale again. 'But Mr Bainbridge couldn't re-sell it as the piece had been spoilt and tainted by what had happened. 'The private deal that has now been struck is as good an outcome as the vendor and Mr Bainbridge could have hoped for. 'The private treaty was brokered through Bonhams in Hong Kong and Colin Sheaf, their head of Asian art, is the biggest cheese there is in the world at Asian art. 'From what I can gather Peter Bainbridge has been compensated. It must have been a significant amount of money for him to release the vase to Bonhams. 'The price of between £20million to £25million is a fair price. The vendor would have walked away with a good chunk of that and Bonhams would have got a decent fee out of it as well.' Mr Macquisten said the vase was one of the finest pieces ever made in China. He added: 'Last year there was an exhibition in Beijing of great historical Chinese objects and a similar vase was listed as being in the top dozen items in Chinese art history and that wasn't as good as this one.'","18th century Qianlong vase originally sold at auction for £43million in 2010 .

Bob Ashford, a father-of-four, who has Whitehall security clearance, stepped down from his £90,000-a-year job as director of strategy for the Youth Justice Board partly to run for the role. But he has had to step down as Labour candidate from the contest to become Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Avon and Somerset after the Home Office and Electoral Commission ruled that the way the law was drafted means there is no room for manoeuvre, even though his conviction would be considered ‘spent’ under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. Unable to escape his past: Bob Ashford holds a photo of himself aged 13 . In the running: John Prescott is also a candidate . However, there is no bar on police being recruited or keeping their jobs if they have a minor conviction.

But Mr Ashford has now been told that, . because he was convicted in 1966 of trespass on the railway and . possession of an offensive weapon, he would also be forced to withdraw. Labour is now canvassing its other candidates to check that none have an . undisclosed juvenile conviction. Last . night, Mr Ashford, of Frome, Somerset, said the legislation was . ‘absolutely ridiculous’, adding: ‘This was a flawed policy idea from the . beginning and it’s now proving to be absolutely and fatally flawed.’ He said he had received hundreds of emails of support, and would be seeking legal advice on whether there were grounds for him to challenge the legislation. In a second development, it emerged magistrates will also be banned from standing. The Home Office had intended to ban only judges but Lord Justice Goldring, the senior presiding judge in England and Wales, has issued guidance that, in order to protect judicial independence, magistrates would have to quit the bench just to take part in the contest. This is despite the fact that the police authorities which are being replaced by elected commissioners have long had magistrates among their membership. The former Welsh Guardsman suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent of his body during the Falklands conflict in 1982. As a teenager he was arrested when he was in a stolen car with two or three other males aged between 18 and 27. Mr Weston always said he was not aware the care was stolen, but on advice, pleased guilty at the subsequent trial. He was fined £30 and put on probation for three months. 'These are the details of the offence. At the time I was 13 years of age in 1966 and living on a council estate in Bristol. 'I had no previous involvement with the police and came from a good and caring family. 'I remember very well the knock on the door from a group of lads I knew from school. 'They persuaded me to go out with them and I felt I had little choice. 'I also knew from what they said that if I refused they could make my life difficult at school. We went to the railway embankment and I felt very uncomfortable about this. 'One of the lads pulled out an air gun and started shooting at cans. I never touched the air gun and felt unable to leave, as I was frightened at what might happen at school. 'A goods train passed and presumably the guard reported our presence to the police who arrived a short time later. The lads with the air gun ran away whilst I and two others froze and were arrested. 'My next memory is of the police coming to my house and talking to my parents in a separate room. 'The police never questioned me to my knowledge. I then went to court and was to the best of my knowledge charged with trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon. 'I was told to plead guilty to the two charges even though I had never touched the air gun. 'I was fined £2 and 10 shillings on both counts. Both of these offences are to the best of my knowledge “imprisonable” offences. 'I carried on at school, attended University and put the offence behind me. I have never been convicted of any other offence. 'It was only when I qualified as a social worker and started applying for jobs that I realised I would have to disclose this previous offence.'","Bob Ashford was just 13 when the incident happened over 40 years ago .

Prudish: Censors were worried teenagers would become confused about sex and reproduction if they watched the classic horror film Alien (pictured), it has emerged . Censors were worried teenagers would become confused about sex and reproduction if they watched classic horror film Alien, it has emerged. Archived files reveal the film could have been given an 'AA' rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) - making it suitable for cinema-goers aged at least 14. Instead the 1979 film was stamped with an adults-only 'X' rating - which is today's 18 certificate - mainly because of just one scene. When hapless Kane - played by John Hurt - examines a pulsating egg on an eerie planet, censors squirmed in their seats. It is one of the scariest moments in the 117-minute film but was bizarrely deemed to present a 'perverse view of the reproductive function'. There are no sex scenes or nudity in Alien and the 30-year-old document suggests censors were not concerned by the violence, gore or the escalating fear factor. It was the image of the egg - which leads to Kane's shocking demise during a meal in an infamous scene - that was thought by the BBFC to be too disturbing for sexually inexperienced viewers. Alien was directed by Oscar-winner Ridley Scott and starred Sigourney Weaver as heroine Ripley, fighting for survival against a murderous shape-shifting creature. It has a similar premise to the Steven Spielberg blockbuster Jaws which was released four years before Scott's space thriller. But the killer shark film was deemed suitable for children and given an AA rating by the BBFC because child psychologists warned it would affect adults more. Scroll down for videos . Scary: Kane - played by John Hurt - looked at the pulsating egg in a scene which gave the film an 'X' certificate . Too much? The image of the egg - which leads to Kane's shocking demise during a meal - was thought to be too disturbing for sexually inexperienced viewers by British Board of Film Classification censors . The judgement on the BBFC archives reads: 'I feel uneasy about passing for 14-year-olds a film which uses sexual imagery in a horror context. 'The images are not always explicit but run like a dark undercurrent throughout suggesting a powerful, threatening, unnamed force. 'Occasionally the image is explicit as . when the leathery egg opens up to reveal a glistening pulsating membrane . which erupts into a squid-like creature.' The . censor claims his decision was based on a similar scene from the 1978 . remake of the B-movie Invasion Of The Body Snatchers which was also . given an adult-only rating. Archives: The film could have been given an 'AA' classification - making it suitable for those aged 14 plus . Star: Sigourney Weaver is pictured in the 1979 classic, which is still seen as one of the scariest films ever . The BBFC official concludes: 'I don't want to flash ideas like this to teenagers who might not have come to terms with the normal sexual functions. Gloomy: The promotional poster for the 1979 film . 'The early teens are a troublesome time with physical changes making terrific demands on emotional stability. 'I don't myself want to pass for this age-group a film which might be disturbing in a non-specific way to a significant proportion of them.' The film was released uncut in 1979 and was a hit with audiences who squirmed and screamed at the tightly wound story. Weaver starred with Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, Yaphet Kotto and Ian Holm as the doomed crew of the Nostromo. There have been six films since the original was released and the Alien - designed by surrealist H.R. Giger - is one of Hollywood's greatest monsters. Dr David Sorfa, head of film studies at Liverpool John Moores University, said the decision was based on a 'crude psychology' at the BBFC during the time. Dr Sorfa said: 'The BBFC would make judgements in the 1969s and 1970s based on crude psychology of a perception of an ideal viewer. 'Censors would state their blanket judgements based on what they thought a viewer of a certain age would think. 'Today, there is a mechanism in place which essentially means certain imagery cannot be included.' VIDEO: Alien 1979 trailer. A sex education lesson? VIDEO: Pulsating egg in Alien.

The rain which has drenched Britain . for weeks throughout June and July is making a re-appearance - and . ominous grey clouds are already starting to loom across the nation. It looks set give the thousands of tourists who have flocked to Britain for the London 2012 Olympics a good old taste of British weather. Meanwhile, millions of commuters battling the daily grind, as well as children on their school holidays up and down the country, will have to endure yet more showers.

Millions flocked to . the coasts to bask in the rays, others took to open air pools to cool off while farmers who have been poised to begin harvest for weeks rushed to the fields with combine harvesters. But summer, it seems, was short lived. The bad weather began in earnest for many this morning, when they woke up to pavements full of puddles. Forecasters . said it cleared up slightly this afternoon so those with tickets to . outdoor events such as beach volleyball, hockey and archery did enjoy a bit of sunshine. Ready for all weathers: Two spectators sits in the rain in the stands prior to the show-jumping phase of the equestrian eventing competition at Greenwich Park this morning - ready with brollies and wet weather gear . Those watching Zara Phillips and her fellow riders from Great Britain's . equestrian team bid for gold at Greenwich Park experienced a . soggy start to the day but they saw a bit of sun later on. Temperatures were expected to peak at 19C (66F) to 20C (68F) in the South . East today, while other areas such as Weymouth, Dorset, where the . sailing took place, were due to be around 17C (63F) to 18C (64F). Meanwhile, throughout the rest of this week, scattered . showers, some heavy in places, and the odd rumble of thunder are expected . to make an appearance. Saturday is likely to see heavy downpours across . much of the UK with a 40 per cent chance of rain over London. Washout: Spectators were also forced to get their brollies out as the heavens opened over Wimbledon during the Olympic tennis today . Rain stopped play: This pair looked particularly despondent at the drizzly conditions in SW19 which prevented some of the tennis .

'The . petals have been bruised by the constant rain and the petals can only . be handpicked in the sunshine but even on the dry days there hasn't been . any sun so the petals remain sodden.

Dressed in their best and posing for the camera they look for all the world like any other wealthy Edwardian family enjoying an English seaside holiday. These smiling pictures - forgotten for more than a century - offer an unusually relaxed insight into how a wealthy family once holidayed. Doing away with the somewhat stilted, awkward pose usually adopted in family pictures at the time, George . and Theodora Hewitt and their three children, Doris, Cecil and Graily, . are shown enjoying a family holiday like a great deal many others . would have done, in the town of Sheringham, Norfolk. Yet these images are particularly poignant, because they were taken by the sports-loving family's disabled son Cecil. A set of touching family photographs taken in the early 1900s and showcasing the talent of a disabled photographer have been unearthed in a small museum . Cecil Hewitt took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57 . They catalogue the holidays of the wealthy Hewitt family from London. It is believed many were taken by Cecil Hewitt, one of the family's sons . While his family enjoyed the fashionable leisure pursuits of the era, Cecil, who suffered with an unrecorded condition, documented their life with his camera capturing the Hewitts . relaxing on the beach, posing in front of a First World War pillbox and . taking part in fashionable leisure pursuits and games. Amateur photographer Ron Wiebe found the slides stashed in shoeboxes in a cupboard at The Mo museum in Sheringham. Mr Wiebe said he believed the family . gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking . part in so many other things. He said: 'It was one of his few outlets. 'There . are a lot of photos of family parties and people standing on the . croquet lawn and in front of the grass steps, which they seemed very . proud of,' he said. 'They always seemed to have a sporting implement in their hands and there are lots of photos of them having afternoon tea.' Cecil Hewitt suffered from an unrecorded condition which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair.

Smart: The family and their friends are all impeccably dressed even as they relax on holiday . Fascinated by the images he discovered, Mr Wiebe has been scanning and cataloguing the collection and researching the Hewitt family pictured in the photographs. Mr Wiebe said: 'There were nearly 1,200 images in the collection sitting in old shoe boxes.'Nothing had been done with them. 'I looked at them and saw it was quite a treasure of photographs. 'As I started to photograph these things, I started to become interested in the people in them and started to do a bit of family history research.' The family, lived a comfortable life in London. Wealthy George Hewitt made his money selling horse medicine as a partner in a company which still exists today under the name Day, Son & Hewitt. Close: Mr Wiebe said he believed the family gave Cecil the camera because his disability prevented him from taking part in so many other things . Relaxed: Cecil looks happy as he stands in this picture with a family member . The pictures, taken between 1906 and 1926, show the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham where they had a holiday home . The seaside resort was an eighteenth-century invention. Many doctors at the time prescribed 'sea air' for the sickly and disabled as an alternative to 'taking the cure' at a spa. As a result, generations of holidaymakers, from the early Victorian age until the Thirties, saw England's seaside resorts flourish. Here was a place where holidaymakers and visitors could enjoy the beauty, the power and the much-touted healing properties of the sea, all from the safety of the sturdy pier. During the great Victorian building boom, all seaside towns wanted a pier, and soon they had sprung up around the coastline. Such was their popularity that by the turn of the century there were 90 piers around the country. The family built a holiday home they named East Court on the corner of Holt Road and Abbey Road in Sheringham in 1903, which has now been converted in to flats. Cecil, who was born in 1890, suffered from an unknown disability which resulted in him being shorter than average and meant that he needed metal calipers and a wheelchair. He took the photographs between the ages of 16 and 36 and died in Totnes, Devon, in 1947 aged 57. The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham. Through his research, Mr Wiebe has discovered Graily survived his time as a soldier in the Great War, only to die in mysterious circumstances in a hotel room in France several years later aged only 30. He has also learned that although Graily and Doris both married neither of them had children. Mr Wiebe, who has now become one of The Mo's trustees, now plans to continue his research in to the Hewitt family. Sheringham's Mo museum, which is run mainly by volunteers, lacked the manpower and resources to formally catalogue the negatives and slides when they were donated in 1991. They were left in a cupboard for more than two decades as a result. A £6,000 Big Society Fund grant has enabled the museum to begin tackling the backlog, properly preserve the Hewitt collection and buy touch screen computers to enable visitors to view all of its photographs easily. Looking back: Members of the Hewitt family are captured enjoying their seaside break by Cecil . High life: The collection shows the family and their friends enjoying the good life in Sheringham . Having fun: The pictures show the Hewitts and their friends looking content and happy while they enjoy their holiday . Museum manager Philip Miles said the collection was one of the most exciting things the museum had ever found. Mr Miles said: 'The work Ron has done for us would have cost thousands of pounds.'The museum couldn't exist without the volunteers. 'We . are very appreciative of his work and pleased that we have been able to . preserve the collection for future generations to enjoy. The Mo will reopen on March 1.

Painting a . picture of a rather nervous woman, another source recalled being at an . industry party at Soho House in Los Angeles in September where Britney . was a guest, saying: 'Britney stood in a corner and hid. 'She didn't speak to anyone - you wouldn't even have realised she was there. She's a shy, shy girl.' Still friends: The pair were last pictured together last month and their relationship apparently became more of a friendship, with them sleeping in separate bedrooms . Court papers: Official papers reveal that Jason Trawick is no longer responsible for Britney Spears . Britney and Jason had been staying at the W Hotel in Hollywood during the X Factor filming, but a friend told how they had their own rooms as they had become 'just friends'. Britney is now believed to be back at her home in Calabasas with her sons Sean, seven, and Jayden, six, and Jason has moved out. Jason . also acted as Britney's manager, and the pop star has now changed . management to CAA, indicating the pair have also severed ties in their business . relationship. Court papers just release show resigned as Britney's co-conservator, but her father Jamie Spears will remain as conservator. Moved out: Trawick ios no longer living with Britney; he is seen grocery shopping in Calabasas last month . Reports had suggested that Britney's father Jamie had in fact brokered his daughter's break-up with Jason himself, and a friend confirmed: 'I did hear this.' Radar Online reported: 'Jason wanted out, and in the fragile state that Britney is in, it’s not like he could have a rational conversation with her about it, so it was really between him and Jamie. They decided how the relationship needed to end and how to go about the technicalities, such as removing Jason from the conservatorship, when he would move out and how to announce the split. Britney was left out of everything and really didn’t even know what was going on. 'Jason and Jamie wanted to make sure that Britney didn’t lose it, so they had to water things down for her a bit.' Keeping close: Britney assures fans that she and Jason will 'remain great friends' and added that she will 'always adore him' Rare solo outing: Coffee-toting Britney Spears and her sons go shopping for pet supplies in Thousand Oaks, California, in November . On her own: Britney Spears goes grocery shopping, in a rare pictures taken without Jason Trawick by her side, in October . Britney had raked in $15 million for her judging role on the X Factor. Announcing her departure from the Fox talent show, she said: 'I had an incredible time doing the show and I love the other judges and I am so proud of my teens but it's time for me to get back in the studio. 'Watching them all do their thing up . on that stage every week made me miss performing so much! I can't wait . to get back out there and do what I love most.' However, the Grammy winner's team has already begun 'serious talks' for a lucrative Vegas concert deal. Severing all ties: Jason used to act as Britney's manager but the star, seen with Jason in October, has now changed management . According to TMZ, Britney and her . people have been in serious negotiations with one of the Caesars group . properties for 'a while.' The former Mouseketeer is likely . being wooed to star in her own long-running show at the Colloseum at . Caesar's Palace since that is where Cher and Celine Dion also held . residencies. Dion scored $100 million a year to . headline her show and her previous A New Day show grossed more than $400 . million over five years. Cher also struck a lucrative deal with the casino where she performed for three years at $60 million a year. And speaking to E!, Daren Libonati, president and COO of the promotion and production company Justice Entertainment Group, said Britney could earn up to $2 million a week at a place like Caesars Palace. 'It was a very difficult decision': Britney Spears is rumoured to be planning Vegas show after confirming she quit The X Factor on Friday . E! calculated that if she worked 40 . weeks a year, that's $48 million a year for her. And if she signs up for . a Dion-like residency of three years, that's $144 million. Mr Libonati said: 'Deals such as this are based on scale. That's a very basic guess on what such a deal might look like. It could be even more.' However, fans wrote of their dismay at the idea. Writing on MailOnline, one said: 'She couldn't handle 3 months of twice a week X-Factor.. What makes you think she can handle a VEGAS show. She needs to stay home and be a mom! I feel horrible for her!' While, Agnes from Stockholm, Sweden said: 'How ill-advised! If Britney had a chance of seeing such a committment through with Trawick, there's just no chance she'd manage now. 'We are talking about someone who has documented mental issues, someone who has made headlines for just the number of breaks she needed during tje the X-factor auditions. We are talking about someone who lip-sang all through her last world tour despite many of her fans' outrage. 'A Las Vegas residency must be a huge challenge for any performer and the pressure surely must be enough to break even the strongest of characters. 'How will a person as mentally vulnerable as Britney is said to be, manage demanding shows several nights a week, week after week, month after month, for one, or two or three years in a row? I am afraid her paying fans shall have to brace themeselves for a huge and disappointment if such a deal is closed, her critics will have a field day and Britney herself may be pushed over the edge and onto another mental breakdown as a result.' However, a close friend of Britney told MailOnline today: 'She is well and has amazing family and friends who love her. She is dancing five days a week and is in the studio working on her 8th album. She is in demand career wise.' Working on her eighth album: The 31-year-old pop star said she was very proud of her teens but 'it's time for me to get back in the studio' Heading for Vegas?

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 07:24 EST, 15 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:07 EST, 15 February 2013 . A disgraced carer who screamed 'I hate you' at a dementia patient at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital is still working with elderly people. Bonka Kostova roughly pulled the  helpless 73-year-old patient . into the ward with his trousers round his ankles before launching a . tirade of abuse at him. Ms Kostova, a qualified midwife who was working as a healthcare assistant, was struck off this week by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. But an alarming loophole in the system . means she can still be a carer, because healthcare assistants are not . officially regulated. A healthcare assistant who dragged a dementia patient half-naked from a toilet at the scandal-hit Stafford Hospital is still working with the elderly . During the incident in July 2010, the Bulgarian carer branded the patient 'an animal' and told startled . colleagues she could not tolerate dementia sufferers. She failed to turn up to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing this week, which banned her from ever working again in a qualified nursing or midwifery role. But the NMC had no power to ban her from taking another job as a healthcare assistant. In an email to the professional regulator, Kostova wrote: 'I don't want to practice as a midwife, I am quite happy to work as a carer only'. Healthcare assistants are not regulated, . although there are plans afoot to change this in light of the public . inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal. NMC Chair Timothy Cole said: 'The panel was in no doubt that, on the facts found proved, Ms Kostova placed the patient at unwarranted risk of harm. 'She has brought the profession into disrepute and breached fundamental tenets of the profession.' It was revealed Kostova is now working St Joseph's Convent Nursing Home, a private establishment in Stafford which charges its elderly and disabled patients up to £676 a week. The 41-resident home is owned by the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Cluny, based in Dublin. It is thought she has now been suspended from St Joseph's in the light of the NMC case. Kostova abused the patient while working at Stafford hospital on July 22, 2010. Patient A, who suffered from Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's, was found wandering the ward in a confused and agitated state at around 3.30am. Ms Kostova's former colleague Jane Wilkinson (pictured) told a misconduct hearing this week that Kostova was 'out of control' when dealing with the patient . Kostova was asked to take over his one-to-one care, but was soon seen by staff nurse Jane Wilkinson pushing him forcibly back down into his wheelchair. 'Ms Wilkinson took patient A to the toilet and then went to answer a call bell', said Rebecca Wood, for the NMC. 'When she returned she witnessed the registrant pulling patient A out of the toilet, pulling him by the collar of his pyjama top. 'His trousers were around his ankles, his genitals exposed. 'Due to the aggression shown and the fact Patient A had no dignity, staff nurse Wilkinson intervened at that point, pulling patient A's trousers up and assisted getting him back into the wheelchair.' Ms Wilkinson told the hearing Kostova then became 'out of control', shouting abuse at patient A as he was led away. 'She shouted: 'I hate him, I really hate him, he is like an animal, I can't bear working with him'', Ms Wilkinson told the hearing. 'Bonnie repeated her comments two or three times. It seemed Bonnie was becoming hysterical.' Kostova's case is the first to be brought before an NMC misconduct panel since the publication of a damning report into standards at Stafford Hospital. The two-year inquiry, led by Sir Robert Francis QC, found 'failures at every level', including patient left lying in their own urine for days, forced to drink water from vases and sent home with  life-threatening conditions. As many as 1,200 patients are thought to have died unnecessarily - though Sir Robert had said the true figure will probably never be known. Mr Cole said a finding of misconduct was inevitable given Kostova shunned the NMC hearing and has offered no insight into her actions. 'The panel has no evidence of an explanation, remorse, a genuine apology, remediation or insight, or any assurance from Ms Kostova that such behaviour would not happen again', he said. 'Therefore, the panel cannot be satisfied Mr Kostova is highly unlikely to repeat her misconduct. 'The panel considers she would be in the future liable to place patients in unwarranted risk of harm.' Kostova was hired by the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust in April 2009 while she was waiting for her midwifery registration to take effect in the UK. She was offered no training in handling aggressive dementia patients, and was allowed to continue working on the ward despite several incidents of abrupt behaviour towards patients and staff. Workmates simply put her bad behaviour down to her poor grasp of the English language. 'Ms Kostova, while not practicing as a registered midwife, was at the time of the incident, registered as a midwife with the NMC', said Mr Cole. 'This made her subject to the code, with regards to her care for patients.'","Bonka Kostova was a qualified midwife but working as healthcare assistant .

A lone gunman has gone on a shooting rampage in rural Pennsylvania, killing three people including a woman who was decorating a church for a children's Christmas party. Jeffrey Lee Michael, 44, of Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, shot dead Kimberly A. Scott, 58, William Harrison Rhodes Jr., 38, and his father-in-law, Kenneth Lynn before state troopers killed him in a firefight. The shocking shooting spree came a week to the day that 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza shot dead his mother and 26 innocent school children and staff in Newtown, Connecticut, before turning the gun on himself. Scroll down for video . Crime scene: An ambulance leaves the scene along Route 22 near the entrance to Canoe Creek State Park, in Blair County, Pennsylvania, where a gunman shot two people . Michael's first victim was reportedly . Scott, of Duncansville, who was decorating Juniata Valley Gospel Church . in Frankstown Township for Christmas Friday morning when shots rang out . and bullets pierced through a window. Michael entered the church and shot Scott, then fled in a truck, leaving another woman who was with her unharmed. Michael then allegedly shot Rhodes and Lynn in the . driveway of a home after a confrontation at a stop sign, one of the . men's cousins, Marie Brenneman, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'This person went to their driveway with a pistol, pointed at them and started shooting,' Brenneman said. Victims: William Harrison Rhodes Jr., 38, pictured, and his father-in-law, Kenneth Lynn, were killed, along with 58-year-old Kimberly A. Scott . She said the shooter was a neighbor of Rhodes and Lynn. 'They were uneasy around him,' she said. Rhodes' sister, Marie, mourned the loss of her brother on Facebook.

State police said late on Friday that they were still trying . to piece together a timeline and motive. The gunman and the victims . weren't related, . Blair County District Attorney Rich Consiglio said. Investigators said they were looking into the relationship, if any, between Michael and his victims. Rhodes' sister, Marie, mourned the loss of her brother on Facebook. 'Today is the worst day of my life,' she wrote . They said victims may have a connection, but officials would not give any further details. 'It's going to take us some time to . put this all together ... and know exactly what occurred,' said Lt. Col. George Bivens, deputy state police commissioner. Investigators are processing five crime scenes within about a 1.5-mile radius. The rampage ended when troopers chased Michael down and killed him in a shootout. Three troopers in patrol cars were . injured in the pursuit that began after the gunman, driving a pick-up . truck, fired at them, police said. One trooper injured a wrist and then . was hit in the chest but was saved by a bulletproof vest. A second trooper was injured by glass . fragments in his eye and bullet fragments that hit him in the forehead, . Bivens said. The third trooper suffered minor injuries from the head-on . crash, he said. 'I think we have three very fortunate . state police members tonight,' Bivens said. 'We are very thankful for . the fact that they survived this attack. Someone was watching over . them.' The woman at Juniata Valley Gospel . Church had cooked food the day before for the funeral of the church's . longtime pastor, said the Rev. James McCaulley, his brother. Place of worship: The gunman stormed the Juniata Valley Gospel Church, pictured, in Frankstown Township . Shock: County officials say that the gunman killed two men and one woman before he was shot dead as he tried to flee in his pick-up truck . The church . was still reeling from the Rev. David McCaulley's death when the woman . returned to decorate its hall - named after the pastor of 58 years - and . bullets ripped through a window, he said. James McCaulley, who is the pastor of . another church about 50 miles away from the site of Friday's carnage, . said his older brother began leading the Frankstown church in 1954. 'He preached his last sermon at the church in October before he fell ill,' McCaulley said. Despite fatal shootings being in the news on a daily basis, there has been no comprehensive tally of gun deaths in America. The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence claims that more than 96,217 people have been shot so far this year in a tally on its website, but the information is estimated based on the number of gun injuries and deaths recorded by the CDC in 2008 and 2009 - the latest years statistics were released. The lack of reliable, up-to-date data has spurred on an anonymous pacifist to start keeping track using the Twitter feed @GunDeaths. Since the Aurora, Colorado, movie theatre massacre in July, the feed's creator has tweeted every reported shooting death he can find. And after the Sandy Hook school shooting, website Slate is using that information to compile an interactive feature called 'gun deaths in America since Newtown'. According to the data, there have already been 120. The church, which lists about 150 . members in an online want ad posted this month for an associate pastor, . is close-knit, and the woman killed Friday was among its more active . members, McCaulley said. She had made food for him to take home Thursday . since his wife had died this year, he said. 'The only thing I can say good at . this time is that [the gunman] didn't do this 24 hours earlier when . there was a big crowd in the church hall,' McCaulley said. 'We're . devastated.' Friday's shootings were the second involving a rural Pennsylvania church this month and came exactly a week after the devastating Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre, which shook the nation on December 14. On that fateful day, 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza used his mother Nancy's prized Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and two other guns to shoot her dead at point-blank range in the home they shared. He then descended on the Newtown elementary school where he shot dead 20 six and seven-year-olds and six staff members, including the school's principal, before killing himself. The shocking massacre has reignited the debate around gun control in America, with President Barack Obama tasking Vice President Joe Biden with working up proposals to restrict access to weapons by January. The Pennsylvania shooting happened as the National Rifle Association made their first announcement  since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The group's CEO Wayne LaPierre put . the blame for the mass shootings on violent media, rejected new gun . control measures and called for more security in the nation's schools. 'The only way to stop a bad guy with a . gun is with a good guy with a gun,' LaPierre said at the press . conference in Washington D.C. 'I call on Congress today to . appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every . single school in this nation,' he said. LaPierre's statement did not go . unchallenged, with two protestors interrupting him with banners blaming . the NRA for school shootings who were then escorted out of the . conference.

Jeremy Hunt has warned senior NHS executives there will be 'consequences' if they have wrongly gagged a former manager from speaking out about concerns over patient safety. Gary Walker has said he was paid £500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. But this week he broke his silence about a care scandal that may have cost the lives of 670 patients. In doing so, he ignored an email from NHS-funded lawyers ordering him to respect the terms of the gagging order in 2011. Jeremy Hunt (left) has warned there will be 'consequences' if Gary Walker (right) was wrongly gagged to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust . Warning phone calls followed the letter when it became clear he planned to tell BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about his ordeal. He was told: ‘Should you breach the term relating to confidentiality, you will immediately repay to the trust, on demand, all sums paid under this agreement in full.’ Refusing to be cowed, Mr Walker gave interviews to the BBC and the Daily Mail. In them, he attacked both the current head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, and one of his key sidekicks, Dame Barbara Hakin. Mr Walker said Sir David, who faced calls to quit last week for his failure to stop the scandal of high death rates at Stafford Hospital, had been warned about problems in Lincolnshire in 2009 but was ‘not interested in patient safety’. He also accused Dame Barbara of halting a review into worrying high mortality rates at the trust. Staff were also told ‘targets must be met regardless of demand’. Sir David Nicholson (left) has refused to step down following the scandal. Dame Barbara Hakin (right) allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust . Today, the Health Secretary said he was . concerned that Mr Walker, the former chief executive of United . Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, appeared to have been 'leaned on'. Mr Hunt said he is ready to order NHS bosses to reverse the gagging order if it is found to have breached NHS guidelines. He has written to Paul Richardson, chairman of the trust, to tell him it is not an acceptable way to behave when an NHS manager raises concerns about patient safety. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: 'I don’t think this is acceptable, I think it is the wrong thing to do. 'I don’t want to make a judgment about the truth or otherwise about what Gary Walker said. Obviously there are very, very serious allegations that we need to get to the bottom of but I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.' The Francis Report into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal called for a ban on the use of gagging orders that prevented concerns being raised about patient safety. Mr Hunt said he had written to the Trust to find out the contents of the settlement so he could establish if it was in line with NHS guidelines on whistle-blowing. United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, where Mr Walker was chief executive, is one of 14 trusts being investigated by health chiefs over high mortality rates . He added: 'If it isn’t, of course I will insist that they change it. 'First of all, we must have a culture where people are not afraid to speak out and secondly I was very concerned that it appeared that someone was being leaned on not to speak out and most of all I want to get to the bottom of whether there is any truth in what he was saying.' Asked if the senior staff at the Trust faced being sacked if there had been mismanagement, he said: 'If they have got this wrong there will be consequences, yes, but I want to investigate and find out and get to the bottom of what actually happened before I make a judgment on that.' Mr Hunt said for too long there had been a culture of celebrating success in the NHS but “not being honest about failure”. Mr Walker was sacked in 2010 for gross professional misconduct over alleged swearing at a meeting. He claims he was forced to quit for . refusing to meet Whitehall targets for non-emergency patients when the . trust came under pressure because of soaring demand for beds for . emergency patients. East Midlands Strategic Health . Authority said it “utterly refuted” Mr Walker’s claims and acted at all . times 'in the interest of patients'.

The trust has apologised to Mr Kirkby, who said: 'Mary was cheated out of her dignity and was catastrophically let down. It was tear-jerking seeing my wife of almost 50 years like that' Mr Kirkby added: 'She had no Zimmer frame and had to use the bedside cabinet - which is on wheels. But where were the nurses? They must have seen her struggling. 'Then when she was sent to Pendle, there were three more falls over the next week. One could be an accident, two unfortunate, three carelessness...but four? That is just gross negligence. 'When I went in she was very agitated and she screamed when I touched her knee. But when I told the nurses that she was in pain, they disagreed, saying: ""No she's not - she's an old lady [and] they do it because they can"" and ""crying is what old people do"". 'She had been in pain for six days but obviously she couldn't tell them because she couldn't talk [because of the stroke]. I kept pushing for help and eventually a doctor got an X-ray done and she was found to have a broken hip from the fall. 'If that's not ringing alarm bells, then that's just not right.

'Another time a nurse told me: ""I caught your wife eating with her fingers"". I told her the fact she'd sat there and watched her unable to use the utensils - when she was meant to be helping her - was a disgrace. 'I can tell that the nurses are frustrated but they cannot speak out because they are worried about getting sacked. I do not trust the NHS any more. 'What was particularly insulting was on the day of her funeral I received a letter from the NHS about how they planned to carry on treating her. The letter was even dated after her death.

The fanatical Muslim, who preached hate sermons towards the West – arrived in the leafy suburb of North-West London last week. He had left his previous £400,000 four-bedroom rented home near Wembley Stadium after apparently complaining it was too small for him and his family. Scroll down for video . Hate preacher Abu Qatada's new home in north London (left) and leaving his former home in north-west London escorted by home office officials . He shares his new detached home,  which is paid for by state handouts, with his wife and four of their five children. Similar homes in the area have sold for close to £500,000. But the woman who owns the smart four-bedroom house reacted angrily last night after discovering the identity of her new tenant – and said she would try to evict him. She said she was 'astonished' to be told the radical cleric had been allowed to live in the property, which she rents out through an agency for £1,400 a month. Speaking from her home, the owner said: 'I had no idea who was living there. I have read about this man and why he was in prison, he does not seem like a nice character. 'A family member was living at the house until they recently passed away. Now we are letting it out via a local estate agent – who told me they would most probably let it to a member of their staff. 'We signed a contract with the company for six months but there is no way I would have given my permission to rent the house to a man like that – not ever. A satellite dish is removed from the hate preacher's old home . 'It is a very smart house with a nice garden and we hoped someone decent would be able to enjoy being there. This has left me very unhappy.' The owner yesterday contacted the estate agent to demand an explanation – but the company claimed that they did not know who was renting the house as they had in turn sub-let it. 'We are hoping to have a meeting on Monday to find out what is going on, we are very unhappy and I told the agents they have to sort this situation immediately,' she added. 'I do not want this man in my house and we will be taking steps to remove him if we can.' It comes as the Government revealed the hate preacher has so far received more than half a million pounds in legal aid. In a parliamentary answer Jeremy Wright, under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Justice, confirmed that as of December 5 the Legal Services Commission had provided £515,778 in funding. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'We must never lose sight of the fact that legal aid is paid for by the taxpayer. The total costs in some cases seem very high and many - myself included - will question whether they provide value for money. 'I am concerned about public confidence in the legal aid system. I have ordered an immediate examination of aspects of the system that affect its credibility with the public. 'Legal aid is a fundamental part of our legal system, but resources aren't limitless. Legal aid should be reserved for cases where there is genuine need.' Removal men were seen outside the radical cleric's north-West London home, loading possessions, including a large satellite dish and what looked like a personal cross-trainer, into a van . Neighbours also reacted angrily to Qatada's move yesterday as it emerged that two security cameras had been installed above lampposts opposite the house. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I had no idea who was living there. An old lady used to live there and she was always very polite and no bother at all. 'This is a nice area where people say hello to each other. But I can't imagine many people around here being too happy at having a terror suspect living next door.' Another neighbour said: 'Two men spent an afternoon erecting two security cameras opposite my house. When we asked them what was going on they told us to call the police. 'But even now, when there are plain-clothed police outside our house, no one will tell us anything. 'It just isn't right we should have this stress brought to our doorstep. This is a very nice area for hard working, law-abiding people.' However, the vicar at the church said: 'Absolutely anyone is welcome to our church and I would encourage Mr Qatada and his family to join in our Christmas celebrations and reach out to the local community – especially at this time of year.' Yesterday two plain-clothed police officers kept watch on the house in an unmarked car. A woman, believed to be a Home Office employee,  visited the new Qatada residence at 10.30am and stayed for two hours. Qatada was pictured wearing traditional Muslim robes as he left his former house in North-West London last Monday. Removal men were seen loading possessions, including a large satellite dish, into a van before driving off. Qatada, 52, who has been described as Osama Bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, remains on bail in London.

"By . Catherine Ostler . PUBLISHED: . 20:01 EST, 8 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:11 EST, 13 February 2013 . Romantic break: Kate and Prince William are enjoying their seventh visit to the island of Mustique for a 'Babymoon' On the Caribbean island of Mustique, a warm, salty breeze blows through the trees and the white sand is as fine as Johnson’s baby powder. Only tree frogs and chirruping crickets disturb the silence. Turquoise water laps the shore of Macaroni Beach. Above the shoreline stand the island’s villas, built in a kaleidoscope of styles. There are colonial houses, mock palazzi, Mexican ranches, French chateaux, pagodas and sprawling cod-Balinese palaces. They are owned, or sometimes rented, by the international super-rich who come to this paradise island seeking peace  and privacy. Here, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been enjoying a ‘Babymoon’ — a last romantic getaway before the birth of their first child in July. They are staying in a £19,000-a-week villa — one of the most luxurious on the island. And they are familiar faces on the  island now, for this is their seventh trip to Mustique. The patrician playboy Lord Glenconner — Colin Tennant — bought the island in 1958 for £45,000 and sought to associate the place with the Royal Family by giving Princess Margaret a plot of land as a present on the occasion of her marriage two years later. Since then Mustique, three miles long and one-and-a-half miles wide, has been a magnet for celebrities and royals — and their relatives. Kate’s parents, Carole  and Michael Middleton, have come to regard it as a home from home. They are staying in a villa near their daughter and her husband. Their other daughter, Pippa, was happy to pass up the opportunity to run a marathon in New Zealand to join them. It was once rumoured that the Middletons were going to buy a place on Mustique. They haven’t — but then they hardly need to. At any time about three-quarters of the island’s houses are available to rent via the Mustique Company office. How much more fun to try different places! Tennant’s genius was to make Mustique a workable business for himself by turning it into a society playground. And yet he ended up hating Mustique because, as the prices rose (which had always been his aim), louche aristocrats and rock stars were joined by international financiers with whom he had little in common. Bankers, venture capitalists and hedge-funders now constitute most of the island’s owners and many of those who rent the villas, too. But it is this fact that has played into the hands of the Middletons. Fifty years ago, a former air hostess and flight dispatcher would not, perhaps, have been welcomed with open arms by the cabal of aristos who haunted the place. Indeed, so capricious was Tennant when he was alive that he once excluded some guests who  complained about the ‘crocodiles’ — actually lizards — running over the walls. Getaway for the rich and famous: Mustique was bought by Lord Glenconner - Colin Tennant - in 1958 who then worked to make sure the island was associated with the Royal Family . But in these days when money talks on Mustique, the multi- millionaire Middletons seem to feel right at home. And having Prince William for a son-in-law gives them a cachet that goes a long way in a place like this. That said, they don’t tend to gravitate towards the island’s more high-profile owners such as Mick Jagger, publishing tycoon Felix Dennis and American designer Tommy Hilfiger, but rather to the self-made but unflashy set of which they consider themselves part. Their Mustique friends include the British hedge-funder Mark Cecil and his wife Katie, whose villa Aurora they have rented in the past. So close is food stylist Katie to the Middletons that she even styled some of the pictures in Celebrate, Pippa’s much-mocked book of party tips. Aurora is, of course, beautifully styled itself. It is a tradition at the villa that tenants — leading designer Tom Ford has stayed there — plant a tree when they leave; apparently the tree the Middletons  planted last year died. But no doubt they will return at some point and plant another. The Middletons’ invitations to the Royal Wedding included a sizeable Mustique contingent and, naturally, if you have been invited to the  wedding of the decade, you will be keen to reciprocate with the best hospitality you can muster. Aside from the Cecils, there was Richard Schaffer, the tennis pro who has run the tennis club on the island for 15 years. Gregory Allen, the island’s yoga teacher, was there. Jeanette Cadet, who has run villa rentals on the island for 25 years. Liz Saint, who runs the equestrian centre — surprisingly for such a small island, there are ten horses and three ponies to ride — attended, as did Roger Pritchard, the current managing director of the Mustique Company which oversees the place. Home sweet home: Kate's parents Michael and Carole Middleton, pictured at Wimbledon tennis tournament last year, have come to think of Mustique as a home from home . The Hon Brian Alexander, heir to his brother Earl Alexander of Tunis, who used to run the island, and the celebrated Basil Charles, an island fixture and the owner of Basil’s Bar, were also at the wedding. Basil grew up on neighbouring St Vincent and started his bar when Lord Glenconner pulled him out of a ditch after a motorbike crash. He stills runs ‘Jump Up’, a live music and lobster night on Wednesdays. William and Kate first visited Mustique after a fortunate conversation at a society wedding in 2006 when he told a friend named Lotty Bunbury that he would love to go to the island, but that he ‘couldn’t possibly afford to’. It so happened that Lotty is married to Mustique’s only doctor, Michael Bunbury. Thus, she arranged for William and Kate to be lent the beautiful Villa Hibiscus (in the end, they made a donation to charity in return), belonging to John and Belle Robinson, the owners of fashion chain Jigsaw. Later, Kate worked as an accessories buyer for Jigsaw in the only job she has ever had that wasn’t under the umbrella of Party Pieces, her parents’ firm. So Mustique, to a certain extent, forged her short career, just as it helped shape Pippa’s book. That first stay, as we now know, was the start of a family love affair with the place that shows no sign of abating, not least because the Middletons do love to socialise — and Mustique is a very social island, though not in the same way it  once was. Lord Glenconner celebrated his 50th birthday in 1976 with a wild bash on the theme of Croesus, at which everyone wore gold. For his 60th birthday he held celebrations that lasted a week and ended with a grand ‘Peacock Ball’. These days, the parties are rather more private, usually taking place behind the high walls of the villas, although open-minded types such as Mick Jagger are still known to set up tables on the beach  for dinner. Now that the qualification to this exclusive club is neither class nor status but, simply, wealth, there  are 17 different nationalities who own houses on the island. Though there are scions of the grand families of England, Scotland and  Ireland, they are now definitely outnumbered. Paradise: Mustique is a private island in the Caribbean where Princess Margaret once had a holiday home . There is a growing American-style emphasis on who has earned what, though unlike the real attention-seekers who go to nearby St Barts, Mustique is still for those avoiding rather than seeking publicity. When the Middletons first started going, there was a bit of grumbling about the newcomers. Like an English village, in Mustique, the longer you have been coming,  the better. And there are still complaints about the change that comes over the island when there is a Royal visit. The security presence is  irksome to those not welcomed into the Middleton inner circle. Last year, security tried to restrict use of ‘mules’ — the island vehicles which resemble suped-up golf carts — to the island’s only hotel,  called the Cotton House, and Basil’s Bar, and annoyed visiting millionaires by quizzing them about what they were doing with the cameras on their mobile phones. As everybody who lands on  Mustique feels they are a ‘somebody’, treating them like the great unwashed was never going to go down well. But for the most part, according to one regular visitor, the Middletons ‘have been welcomed with open arms’. The staff, as we have seen from the Royal Wedding guest list, are all enthusiasts, and so are the  property owners; nothing sends  the prices up quicker than a bit of Royal patronage, as Lord Glenconner knew. This then, is the place where the newest addition to the Royal  Family will, with luck, find themselves toddling in the waves in years to come, and dozing in their cot under the obligatory mosquito net. That’s once they have negotiated the eight-hour flight to Barbados followed by a nerve-testing short hop on a light aircraft, or possibly by yacht. Mustique has never had convenience in its favour. But as the new Prince or Princess will learn over the years, and as their great aunt Margaret discovered, it has many welcome compensations. Carole Middleton and her daughter Kate, pictured together shopping, both enjoy holidaying on the island .","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are enjoying a 'Babymoon' on the island .

Second wife: Jonathan Agnew, pictured with his second wife Emma, has spoken out about his relationship with his children from his first marriage . The familiar voice appeared to break as Jonathan Agnew spoke about his two daughters from his first marriage. ‘My relationship with my kids is the one sad area of my life,’ the cricket commentator lamented yesterday in an emotional moment on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. Agnew, the voice of BBC cricket, told presenter Kirsty Young of the ‘tough time’ he had maintaining his relationship with Jennifer and Rebecca after his divorce from their mother Beverley. The 52-year-old former England fast bowler, affectionately known as Aggers, went on to say he wanted to ‘stand up’ for absent fathers in broken families who want to play a part in their children’s lives. And he described how he and his second wife Emma had made a ‘conscious effort’ to ensure that her former husband maintained a relationship with his children from that marriage. Yesterday, however, the first Mrs Agnew insisted it is the BBC cricket correspondent’s ‘own fault’ that he doesn’t have a better relationship with Jennifer, 27, and 24-year-old Rebecca. She said: ‘He has had the opportunity to see and be with his children any time he chooses. He’s been in control of that. So, if he hasn’t taken part in their lives that’s been his choice. ‘He’s never been stopped from seeing his children and I don’t think I’ve made it difficult at all.’ Mrs Agnew, 56, who owns a child care centre in Leicester, said her former husband has provided for her children financially but has not been there emotionally. She said: ‘I think he feels if he’s done financial stuff he’s done his bit as a dad, but actually kids just want some time. ‘He thinks he can buy them a nice Christmas present and they don’t need to be spoken to for a few months.’ Perhaps the most stinging criticism came from Agnew’s own daughters who claim to have felt like ‘an embarrassment’ to their father once he remarried. Rebecca, who works with her mother, said: ‘If it wasn’t for Mum we wouldn’t have a relationship with him. 'We’ve felt very unimportant since Dad married Emma – pushed out. We always felt like an embarrassment. We’ve both wanted to be part of his life but we’ve just never felt involved.’ Jennifer, a veterinary nurse, added: ‘Because we didn’t have much of a relationship when we were young, it’s difficult now we’re adults. ‘He doesn’t know anything about me now. He has a much better relationship with his stepchildren than he does with us. Family group: BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew, 52, with his daughters Jennifer, 27, (right) and Rebecca, 24, and second wife Emma (far left) 'He’s been forgiven for a lot. He’s been given multiple chances.’ Test Match Special broadcaster Agnew was apparently astounded that his daughters were not among those listening to him on the radio. Mrs Agnew said: ‘He said to me once, “My children have no idea who I am and what I do” – because they didn’t listen to the cricket on the radio. 'I said, “You are their dad and what you do is irrelevant”. He thought his children should listen to the cricket to know what he did but it’s not really the kind of thing girls like is it?’ Mrs Agnew said she ‘gave up everything’ to be with the cricketer after meeting him when he was on tour with his county team Leicestershire in her home country of Zimbabwe. He joined Test Match Special in 1991 and Mrs Agnew said their ten-year marriage, which ended in 1993, was ‘difficult’ because he would be abroad for months covering games. Young father: Jonathan Agnew with his first wife Beverley and baby daughter Rebecca in 1986 . She added that her former husband has let his daughters down ‘repeatedly’ over the years, missing school pick-ups, parents’ evenings and sports days. Mrs Agnew said: ‘Jennifer had a school concert when she was about ten or 11. He only came back from abroad that day. Happy: Jonathan Agnew pictured with his second wife Emma . 'He turned up at the concert, came late, sat down and his daughter sang one of her four songs and he got up and walked out because he was tired. ‘I was looking at her face and the disappointment... It would have been better had he not come at all. You can’t explain that to children.’ Agnew married Emma in 1996 and became stepfather to Charlotte, 22, and 19-year-old Thomas. The commentator said yesterday he was ‘proud’ that he and Emma had helped her first husband, Brian Dodds, keep in contact with his children. He told how Mr Dodds, a solicitor who died of motor neurone disease in 2005, would enjoy family meals with them and even go on holiday with them. But his first wife insists she too had done all she could to help her daughters keep in contact with their father. She said: ‘I even went and had Christmas dinners with them where I joined his new family so the children could see him, which was a very uncomfortable situation for me. I had to bury my pride on many occasions.’ Mrs Agnew added: ‘His relationship with his children is on and off. They’re both adults now so they’re old enough to have their own relationship. 'Jenny’s just been for a job interview which he knew about but hasn’t bothered to ask about. ‘He always said I should remind him of these things. It’s not for me to be his secretary. He can pick up the phone.’","Jonathan Agnew had 'tough time' maintaining relationship with daughters .

This past Feb. 15, that postcard suddenly decided to arrive. Forty-six years ago, Bert Jacobson went on a family trip to the east coast to buy trucks and equipment for the family’s concrete business. Mailbox Mystery: 46 years after he sent it, Bert Jacobson's postcard to his mom mysteriously arrived . Along the way, it seems the family visited the Old Country Store Museum in Hereford, Pennsylvania. ‘It was an awesome trip,’ Jacobson recalled to Oklahoma’s KWTV. Like any 13-year-old, Jacobson wanted to let his mother know what a great time he and his father and cousins were having. ‘Mom, Hi. We've been having a great time,’ Jacobson read aloud to a news crew while examining the perplexing postcard. Unlikely story: 'This is one in a billion' says a now grown up Jacobson, who sent the card from Penn. in 1967 . Tattered and yellowed, Jacobson’s curlicue cursive is still legible and a picture of a country store and a pot belly stove are clearly visible on the reverse. A 1967 postmark and Abraham Lincoln stamp carrying the price of four cents are also perfectly preserved. Wherever the postcard was all those years, it was protected from damaging elements. Still legible: Jacobson's cursive can still be read and the Abe Lincoln four cent stamp and USPS postmark from 1967 are still quite clear . However, no one has a clue where the place was. ‘Under a piece of machinery? I don't know,’ Jacobson wondered. But how the card suddenly went from lost to history to delivered like an everyday bill is a mystery. Unsolved: No one in the family knows how or why the card finally showed up, delivered as if it was an everyday parcel . ‘I have no idea,’ Jacobson mused, shaking his head. All those years ago, Jacobson addressed his childhood shoutout mom to the family business post office box. Miraculously, the family still uses that same PO box today and that, of course, is where the mystery card ended up. Jacobson’s sister, Marilyn Hubbard, said it was a company employee who first picked up the parcel. ‘This can’t be,’ was the shocked secretary’s response, Hubbard said. So what was Jacobson’s mom’s response to her son’s suddenly surfacing card? ‘She wasn’t really surprised that Burt had written her a card,’ Hubbard said, smiling, ‘but she was very surprised that it took years to get here.’ As for cool-headed Jacobson, he seemed to think such freak occurrences are bound to happen to someone. ‘Sure this is one in a billion,’ he said, ‘mine just happened to be one of them.’ NewsOn6.com - Tulsa, OK - News, Weather, Video and Sports - KOTV.com | .","Bert Jacobson's memento, sent during a trip to the east coast, took 46 years to travel from Pennsylvania to the family's town of Pauls Valley, Oklahoma .

And the model and actress, who played 22-year-old Kristen’s mother in . Snow White and the Huntsman, responded with just one word: 'Wow.' She posted the message on July 24, just moments after Us Weekly called her director husband's spokesperson for comment, according to the magazine.

Scroll down for video . Bad news: It emerged yesterday that Kristen Stewart (R) had an affair with Liberty Ross' (L) husband Rupert Sanders . Before deleting her page Liberty had also posted a series of cryptic tweets that seemed to be referencing the alleged affair. She retweeted a quote from Marilyn Monroe which read: 'Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.' She later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.' 'Wow,' was her final note before signing off. Too much: Liberty, pictured with Rupert on the set of Snow White and The Huntsman, has deleted her Twitter page . Passionate: Kristen and Rupert, at a May screening of their movie, were reportedly caught in a romantic clinch . Should Robert Pattinson forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating? Liberty played Queen Eleanor to Kristen’s Snow White in the box office hit, which was directed by Rupert and released last month. Last Tuesday, Kristen was caught in the arms of Rupert, with Us Weekly running photographic evidence of their intimate dalliance in it's new issue. Kristen today issued a grovelling apology to her boyfriend, Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, in a uprising public statement. In a statement to People magazine, she said: 'I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected.

A spitfire enthusiast has spent 28 years building a life-size version of the famous fighter plane from scratch. Terry Arlow, 56, built the 'perfect' replica of a Spitfire Mk. IX, the same one flown by his friend Tony Cooper during World War Two, despite having no engineering skills, after landing on a plan for the aircraft. He was inspired by the 1969 war film Battle of Britain when a youngster. But it took eight years alone to secure the plans from the RAF museum in Hendon. Replica: Spitfire enthusiast Terry Arlow spent 28 years building the life-size version of the Spitfire Mk. IX . Impressive: Mr Arlow hand-crafted the plane from aluminium and spare parts from other Spitfires . Finished product: Mr Arlow said his life has 'revolved around the project' since he took it up 28 years ago . In 1990, Mr Arlow set about building the famous fighter and scoured Europe for parts. With the help of his family, father-of-four Mr Arlow hand-crafted the plane from aluminium and spare parts salvaged from other Spitfires. Mr Arlow, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: 'It was like a jigsaw puzzle. I had to make all the parts from bare materials and then piece them together. 'It has literally taken tens of thousands of hours to make. It has been non-stop really over the 28 years. 'My life has revolved around the project. You're never away from it. Even in my spare time I'd be studying books and doing research to make sure it looked perfect.' Mr Arlow used aluminium to hand craft each individual part - including the fuselage, wings and tail - while sourcing original parts for the cockpit and detail. 'Tremendous': WWII pilot Tony Cooper sits in the cockpit of the completed Spitfire alongside owner Mr Arlow . Detail: Former RAF pilot Mr Cooper (right) was amazed by the level of detail on the finished article . Original: WWII pilot Tony Cooper in the Spitfire, registration number MK 805, which is what the life size replica is based on . Pilot: Mr Cooper said, 'It is wonderful to think Terry spent 28 years of his life building such a perfect replica' The finished article - completed in . 2010 - was so spot on, friend and former RAF pilot Tony Cooper was . amazed by the level of detail. Mr . Cooper flew the Spitfire Mr Arlow based his model on, which had the registration number MK 805, on 38 operational missions during . WWII. During his time in the RAF Mr Cooper, who is now 97, served with the 64 Fighter Squadron and was stationed at Harrowbeer . The Spitfire MK 805 became the personal aeroplane of F/Lt. Cooper and inscribed 'Peter John III', as it was the third Spitfire to carry the name of his son who was born two months before it entered service on July 5, 1944. Paint job: The wings are spray painted in Mr Arlow's workshop in Suffolk . Ongoing work: The wings are prepared to be spray painted as the aircraft is put together . Preparation: Mr Arlow said the wings were the trickiest part of the plane to build as they are elliptical . Plane parts: A section of the wing, before it was painted in its distinctive colours . Construction: The wing of the Spitfire is bolted together as the plane is pieced together . Mr Cooper flew the plane a total of 71 times, of which 38 were operational missions. The Mk. IX replaced the Mk. V from June 1942 . Speaking about Mr Arlow's replica, he said: 'It is absolutely tremendous. It looks just like the real . thing. 'It is wonderful to think Terry spent 28 years of his life . building such a perfect replica.' There were, however, moments when even Mr Arlow wasn't sure the build would ever be completed. Mr Arlow, who had help from his family including son Stephen who sprayed the aircraft, added: 'There was definitely a sense of relief when I completed it after all those years. 'There were times, even two to three years before the end, that I wondered whether I would get there. 'It was only through sheer determination that I kept going. Finished version: How the wings looked after the impressive painting effort . Streamline: The fuselage of the Spitfire is bolted together in Mr Arlow's workshop . Getting down to work: The plane really begins to look like the original Spitfire as its wings and fuselage are spray painted . Nearing completion: Mr Arlow, who had help from his family including son Stephen, who sprayed the aircraft, said there was a 'sense of relief' when he finished the project . Difficult: Mr Arlow said, 'There were times, even two to three years before the end, that I wondered whether I would get there' 'The wings were the trickiest to build . because they are elliptical. Even though it is not a flier I still . wanted it all to be spot on so took my time getting everything right.' Mr Arlow now runs a business called Simply Spitfire, hiring out his eye-catching plane to war-themed movies, TV shows and events. And he insists that you couldn't put a price on his life-size Spitfire. Mr Arlow, who stores the plane locally to where he lives, said: 'The first question I always get asked is what it is worth - but to me its priceless. 'It is always what someone is willing to pay for it.' In demand: Mr Arlow now hires out the finished Spitfire for movies, TV shows and events.

"By . Michael Zennie, Associated Press and David Mccormack . PUBLISHED: . 09:35 EST, 9 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:11 EST, 20 February 2013 . Best-selling crime author Patricia Cornwell told a federal courtroom on Friday that a firm of New York-based financial managers are to blame for her money problems, not her lavish spending which included $5m on private jets and a $40,000 per month lease at Trump Tower. Despite earning over $10million a year in book sales, Cornwell is reportedly down to her last $13 million and has been forced to sell off her helicopter, sports cars and several homes in a bid to reduce her debt. During a three-hour testimony before a Boston courtroom, Cornwell blamed bad advice by financial advisers Anchin, Block and Anchin LLP for a series of renovation mishaps, bad real estate deals and risky investments that have swallowed up her finances. She is seeking damages that could total more than $100million. Crime fiction author Patricia Cornwell (pictured right with partner Staci Gruber) is at the centre of an epic legal battle against her accountants . However defense lawyer James Campbell said Cornwell's money worries were due to her extravagant lifestyle which included spending  $1,000-per-day on a car service, a $10 million renovation project at her Massachusetts estate and the $1.2 million purchase of a Florida condo. The best-selling crime author also spent  $40,000 a month for an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City, $200,000 in taxes alone for her customized, personal helicopter, $5million for private jets to ferry her across the country and $11million for private estates in Concord, Massachusetts. She also had several employees, including one who was paid $100,000. The trial has cast a harsh spotlight on the intensely private 56-year-old. Cornwell lives with her longtime partner, Harvard University neuroscientist Staci Gruber. 'Where did the money go? Ms Cornwell and Dr Gruber spent the money,' said Campbell. 'You have to consider the large lifestyles involved, the . spending habits, impulsive buying.' Cornwell's crime novels, most of which follow Virginia forensic examiner Kay Scarpetta, have made Cornwell a nationally-recognized name. Her books - which lean heavily on the use of forensic science - are credited as a major influence for the TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.' Author Patricia Cornwell, with spouse Staci Gruber to her right, leaves federal court in Boston after taking the stand in her lawsuit against her former financial management company . Her novels, including 'Postmortem,' 'Cruel and Unusual' and 'Book of the Dead' have sold more than 100million copies worldwide. This is not the first time Cornwell has begrudgingly found herself in the spotlight. In the early 1990s, Cornwell had an affair with Margo Bennett, a married . FBI agent, which came out years later after Bennett's estranged husband . was arrested and convicted for the attempted murder of his wife and the . abduction of her pastor. Cornwell has also publicly revealed that she struggles with bipolar disorder. Her lawyer argues that she hired Snapper and his firm to insulate herself from her money and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company. 'This case is, at its core, about trust,' her lawyer, Joan Lukey, told . the jury. 'There is no amount of money that is enough to properly . compensate her for what Anchin, Block and Anchin did.' Cornwell has been forced to sell off a number of luxury sports cars including a Ferrari . The crime writer spent $5million on private jets to ferry her across the country . Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net . worth of her and her company, despite having earning above $10million in earnings per . year during the previous four years, was a little under $13million, the . equivalent of only one year's net income. She also claims in the lawsuit that Anchin had borrowed several . million dollars, including mortgages for property and a loan for the . purchase of a helicopter, and had lost millions by moving her from a . conservative investment strategy to high-risk without her permission. She said she also found checks written for expenses she never . authorized, including a $5,000 check for a bat mitzvah gift to Snapper's . daughter from Cornwell, she alleges. According to the Boston Globe, she claims money for 46 rare books she purchased was also mishandled. And, she says, Snapper steered investments into a development backed by one of his associates - Bobby DeNiro, the son of actor Robert DeNiro. Wildly popular: Most of Cornwell's novels center around Virginia medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. The novels, which have sold 100million copies worldwide, are credited with introducing the forensic science crime genre . Lavish: Cornwell's financial manager claims the author lost most of her money because she spent it living lavishly - including $40,000 a month for a room in Trump Tower . Cornwell says problems caused by Anchin and Snapper were so . distracting that they caused her to miss a book deadline for the first . time in her career and cost her $15 million in non-recoverable advances . and commissions. After Cornwell filed the lawsuit in 2009, Snapper pleaded guilty to . violating campaign finance laws by buying $50,000 in tickets to an Elton . John concert benefiting Hillary Rodham Clinton, using Cornwell's money. He paid a fine. Cornwell, a Virginia native, is politically connected herself - though she has preferred to support Republican candidates in the past. She reportedly summered with President George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, and has close family ties to evangelist Billy Graham - even acting as a spokesperson for the family. Lawyers for Anchin and Snapper deny Cornwell's claims. During opening . statements at the trial, attorney Campbell described Cornwell as . 'a demanding client' who 'tends to push off responsibility and assign . blame when things go off track.' 'I do what I do when and how I do it,' she allegedly wrote in an email to Snapper read by Campbell to the jury. Cornwell said one of Anchin's primary functions in 2006 was to ensure that locations were arranged where she could write without distraction while her home was undergoing reconstruction. She said Snapper leased a series of expensive apartments, including one at Trump Tower in New York, that she had to leave long before leases expired because of construction, privacy or other issues. In the lawsuit, Cornwell openly acknowledges her struggles with bipolar disorder, an illness she said has contributed to her belief that she needs other people to manage her business affairs and investments. She said Anchin was aware of her illness.","Patricia Cornwell, 56, is suing Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP and money manager Evan Snapper, claiming she lost untold millions .

A son testified against his mother on Monday as she stood trial for the murder of his father who was shot dead at his home. Donna Horwitz, 66, has been charged with first-degree murder after she allegedly shot dead millionaire businessman and ex-husband Lanny Horwitz at the luxury home they once shared. The couple's son Radley Horwitz told the court in Palm Beach, Florida that he awoke at the house when he heard nine shots ring out and his mother screaming. Scroll down for video . Accused: Donna Horwitz, 66, in court this week in Palm Beach, Florida after she allegedly shot dead her estranged husband at their lavish home in 2011 . Witness: Radley Horwitz gave evidence against his mother at her murder trial over the fatal shooting of his father Lanny . Mr Horwitz Jr, 38, found his father dying on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood and his mother near to the victim's naked body. An autopsy later revealed Mr Horwitz senior had multiple gunshot wounds to the torso and arms along with one shot fired directly in his mouth. Radley told the court on Monday: 'She [Donna] was screaming my name and she might have said ''your father, your father'' or something like that.' He added: 'He made this godawful, inhuman gurgling sound.' The Horwitzs, who had married twice and recently separated again, were reportedly having a furious row on the morning of September 30, 2011 at their home in the exclusive Admiral's Cove district of  Jupiter. Lanny, a 66-year-old real estate attorney, had reportedly been packing for a weekend with a woman who was believed to be a girlfriend when he was killed. Slain: The body of Lanny Horwitz was found with nine gunshot wounds in the bathroom at his home in Admiral's Cove, Florida . According to WPBF, Radley said his father was 'sarcastic and belittling' and that his mother was deeply affected by how her treated her. It was also revealed at the trial, which began last Friday, that Radley harbored ill feelings towards his father and once owned a book on how to hire a hitman. Radley Horwitz and his father Lanny's financial affairs were in ruins at the time of the murder, the court heard and Radley stood to benefit from a $500,000 life insurance policy his father had taken out. He has denied killing his father. The defense have alleged that the 66-year-old businessman was shot either by his son or an unknown intruder. Bitter battle: Donna Horwitz had married her husband Lanny twice and the couple were separating for the second time when he was shot dead at his Florida home . Mrs Horwitz's attorney Grey Tesh said at the opening of the trial that DNA from a speck of blood was found on a gate outside the home which did not match the accused. As the prosecution brought in final witnesses today, a police detective told the jury that Mrs Horwitz had hoped for a reconciliation with her husband and was in complete despair that he seemed to be leaving her for someone else. Detective Eric Frank read from Mrs Horwitz's journal, where she wrote: 'My heart is broken and he is working on my mind, playing games with me' according to the Palm Beach Post. The jury is expected to hear closing arguments tomorrow morning. Crime scene: The Horwitzs' luxury home in Admiral's Cove, Jupiter where 66-year-old Lanny was found murdered in September 2011 .

Pope Benedict asked the faithful to pray for him and his successor in his penultimate Sunday address to a crowded St. Peter's Square before becoming the first pontiff in centuries to resign. The crowd chanted 'Long live the pope', waved banners and broke into sustained applause as he spoke from his window, as details have emerged about his declining health. A German journalist claimed that the Pope was unable to see from his left eye and was 'exhausted-looking' when he last saw him ten weeks ago. Blessing: Pope Benedict asked the faithful to pray for him and his successor in his penultimate Sunday address to a crowded St. Peter's Square . Peter Seewald, who has interviewed the Pope on several occasions and wrote a book with him in 2010, said: 'His . hearing had deteriorated. He couldn't see with his left eye. His body . had become so thin that the tailors had difficulty in keeping up with . newly fitted clothes. He added: 'I'd never seen him so exhausted-looking, so . worn down.' In the Vatican, the 85-year-old, who will abdicate on February 28, thanked them in several languages. Speaking in Spanish, he told the 50,000-strong crowd: 'I beg you to continue praying for me and for the next pope.' It was not clear why the pope chose Spanish to make the only specific reference to his upcoming resignation in his Sunday address. A number of cardinals have said they would be open to the possibility of a pope from the developing world, be it Latin America, Africa or Asia, as opposed to another from Europe. 'I can imagine taking a step towards a black pope, an African pope or a Latin American pope,' Cardinal Kurt Koch, a Swiss Vatican official who will enter the conclave to choose the next pope, has said. After his address, the pope retired into the Vatican's Apostolic Palace for a scheduled, week-long spiritual retreat and will not make any more public appearances until next Sunday. Crowds: The Vatican estimated a crowd of 50,000 turned out for the Sunday address today . Speaking in Italian in part of his address about Lent, the pope spoke of the difficulty of making important decisions. He . said: 'In decisive moments of life, or, on closer inspection, at every . moment in life, we are at a crossroads: do we want to follow the ""I"", or . God? The individual interest, or the real good, that which is really . good?'

His reign also saw Muslim anger after . he compared Islam to violence. Jews were upset over his rehabilitation . of a Holocaust denier. During a scandal over the Church's business . dealings, his butler was convicted of leaking his private papers. Since his shock announcement last Monday, the pope has said several times that he made the difficult decision to become the first pope in more than six centuries to resign for the good of the Church. Aides said he was at peace with himself. 'In a funny way he is even more peaceful now with this decision, unlike the rest of us, he is not somebody who gets choked up really easily,' said Greg Burke, a senior media advisor to the Vatican. 'I think that has a lot to do with his spiritual life and who he is and the fact he is such a prayerful man.' People in the crowd said the pope was a shadow of the man he was when elected on April 19, 2005. 'Like always, recently, he seemed tired, moved, perplexed, uncertain and insecure,' said Stefan Malabar, an Italian in St. Peter's Square. 'It's something that really has an effect on you because the pope should be a strong and authoritative figure but instead he seems very weak, and that really struck me,' he said. The Vatican has said the conclave to choose his successor could start earlier than originally expected, giving the Roman Catholic Church a new leader by mid-March. Some 117 cardinals under the age of 80 will be eligible to enter the secretive conclave which, according to Church rules, has to start between 15 and 20 days after the papacy becomes vacant, on February 28. But since the Church is now dealing with an announced resignation and not a sudden death, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the Vatican would be 'interpreting' the law to see if it could start earlier. Religious retreat: After his address, the pope retired into the Vatican's Apostolic Palace for a scheduled, week-long spiritual retreat and will not make any more public appearances until next Sunday . Pope Benedict will stay at the papal summer retreat Castel Gandolfo (pictured) for around two months before moving to a convent inside the Vatican where he will live out his remaining years . Cardinals around the world have already begun informal consultations by phone and email to construct a profile of the man they think would be best suited to lead the Church in a period of continuing crisis. The Vatican appears to be aiming to have a new pope elected and then formally installed before Palm Sunday on March 24 so he can preside at Holy Week services leading to Easter. New details emerged at the weekend about Benedict's health. Peter Seewald, a German journalist who wrote a book with the pope in 2010 in which Benedict first floated the possibility of resigning, visited him again about ten weeks ago. 'His hearing had deteriorated. He couldn't see with his left eye. His body had become so thin that the tailors had difficulty in keeping up with newly fitted clothes ... I'd never seen him so exhausted-looking, so worn down,' Seewald said. The pope will say one more Sunday noon prayer on February 24 and hold a final general audience on February 27. The next day he will take a helicopter to the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo, south of Rome, where he will stay for around two months before moving to a convent inside the Vatican where he will live out his remaining years.","Pope Benedict spoke at penultimate Sunday address at St Peter's Square .

A mother who was told she had miscarried and would never have any more children has spoken of her joy after doctors later realised she was actually pregnant with twins. Natalie Foxcroft, 24, had already suffered four miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies – where the baby forms outside the womb and which can prove fatal to the mother. She found out she was pregnant again on January 3 – just two days after her partner Ross had proposed to her. After four miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies - and being told she would never have more children - Natalie Foxcroft has discovered she is pregnant with twins . But her joy turned to more heartache when medical staff could not find the baby during a scan. They feared Miss Foxcroft, who has a two-year-old son, was having another ectopic pregnancy. As a result, she underwent surgery to remove her remaining fallopian tube - ending any hopes of having any more children. But just two days later, while still recovering in hospital and reeling from the horrendous news, she was told by doctors that blood tests taken after the operation showed she still had high levels of pregnancy hormones. 'I had a scan a day later and I was very nervous, but they found a baby in my womb,' she said. 'In the space of a week I’d gone from finding out I was pregnant, to losing the baby, and then finding out the baby had survived the operation. I couldn’t believe it.' A week later, during a follow-up scan, Miss Foxcroft and partner Ross Whitehead, of Liversedge, West Yorkshire, received an even bigger surprise - she was pregnant with twins. 'We felt a sigh of relief when the nurse showed us the baby’s heartbeat on the monitor,' said Miss Foxcroft. 'But we could hardly believe it when she said ""and there’s the other one’s"". Miss Foxcroft's pregnancy is particularly rare as the twins are ‘monochorionic monoamniotic’ which means they will grow in the same amniotic sac, with no membrane separating them. 'We were really, really shocked but over the moon. It was like getting two for the price of one.' Miss Foxcroft's pregnancy is particularly rare as the twins are ‘monochorionic monoamniotic’ which means they will grow in the same amniotic sac, with no membrane separating them. They share the same placenta but have two umbilical cords, and will be identical. to take each day as it comes, and I think that’s the best piece of advice.' The twins are to be delivered by Caesarean section at 32 weeks. Miss Foxcroft also has a two-year-old son, Harry. She said: 'He goes around telling people that mummy has two babies in her tummy, so I think he understands. 'We have told Harry that he has a big job as an older brother to make sure the twins will be okay while they are growing up. 'We still have to go for fortnightly check-ups to make sure the babies are okay but my mum told me to take each day as it comes, and I think that’s the best piece of advice.' Mono-amniotic twins are identical twins that develop inside the same amniotic sac. Also known as Mo-Mo twins (Monoamniotic-Monochorionic), they are always identical. Monochorionic means one placenta, while monoamniotic means one sac. These pregnancies are incredibly rare, affecting an estimated one in 65,000 pregnancies. Unfortunately, these twins have a greater risk of health complications due to the close proximity of the two umbilical cords in the amniotic sac. This makes it particularly easy for the twins to become entangled in each other's cords, or to compress one another's cords, endangering their oxygen and food supply. The survival rate for mono-amniotic twins is approximately 50 per cent. Mo-Mo twins are usually delivered by Caesarean at 32 weeks.","Natalie Foxcroft, 24, had previously had four miscarriages .

Past it: Twenty-one per cent say the last time they were physically active was at school, college or university . If you feel you don’t get to the gym as much as you should, you’re far from alone. One in ten of us has not exercised in more than ten years. And the typical Briton abandons exercise altogether by the age of 56. Lifestyle changes, such as moving away from home, getting married and working longer hours increasingly prevent us exercising. And we have become far less active as a nation, according to a survey of 2,000 adults by the British Heart Foundation. Some 21 per cent of people say the last time they were physically active was at school, college or university. Two thirds of us have run no further than 100 yards in the past year – and 40 per cent have not run at all. Working longer hours was cited as the biggest factor affecting fitness levels – with 41 per cent saying it led to them doing less exercise and eating less healthily – while 22 per cent blamed getting married. Ellen Mason, of the BHF, said: ‘Adults should try to be active every day and build up to at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity each week.’ A staggering 40 per cent of people have not broken into a run of any sort and 14 per cent say they have jogged no further than 10metres to catch a bus. Even half of those aged under 24 have ran no further than 100metres in the past 12 months. The research, carried out to mark the opening of registration for the London to Brighton Bike Ride, shows how we have become far less active as a nation. Today's parents say that as a child they walked and cycled 16 miles in a typical week - but, worryingly, their own children do just six miles.

More than a quarter of men admitting . that once in a long term relationship they gave up as their 'looks no . longer seemed important'. The research found that getting married typically causes people to put on 7lbs. One in six admit gaining at least one stone after finding the perfect partner. Moving out of their parents' home and a sudden loss of income - leading to lapsed gym memberships - were also key lifestyle changes. With 10 per cent of Brits not having exercised in over ten years, the British Heart Foundation is calling for entrants to its iconic 54-mile charity cycle ride in June. Nancy Prior, head of Events at the charity, said: 'We are leading increasingly busy lives and it can be difficult to prioritise physical activity as family and work commitments get in the way.

The Battle of Hastings has been cancelled for the second year in row so the grass on the original battlefield can grow back. Last year the annual re-enactment of the famous 1066 battle - which attracts up to 2,400 participants, including archers, foot soldiers and cavalry - was cancelled for health and safety reasons because of 'deep mud'. And this year's event due to be held in October has already been called off by bosses at English Heritage so the grass can grow back at Battle Abbey in Battle, East Sussex. The historical re-enactment has been cancelled this year so the grass at the famous site can grow back . A spokesman for English Heritage said it had no choice but to cancel the event - which attracts huge crowds of up to 30,000 and participants in full armour, shields, swords and maces - because the grass needed to be re-seeded. Locals, however, are fuming as the annual event is important to the local economy. One businessman, who runs a hotel, said last week: 'It looks like we won't be fully booked like we have been in the past. 'We can normally count on all the rooms being taken during the re-enactment, but now for two years in a row we'll probably have 15 empty rooms.' Local Tom Paine, 43, said: 'I don't imagine for one minute that the battlefield in 1066 was like the Wembley pitch, so if they want a ""real"" re-enactment then what better than a giant mud bath. 'Last year it was cancelled for health and safety reasons because of a bit of mud and this year it's been cancelled again because they want it looking like a football pitch.' A spokesman for English Heritage said: 'Extreme weather conditions in 2012 took their toll on the historic battlefield [and] as a Registered Battlefield under the protection and guardianship of English Heritage, its conservation takes top priority and its management has to be handled in a way which reflects the sensitive nature of the site. It is the second year in a row the event has been cancelled leaving businesses out of pocket . UP to 30,000 people a year visit the area to watch the re-enactment . 'On expert advice, it has been decided the area needs to be re-seeded and rested to enable it to fully recover and establish a more robust grass surface. 'This action will help us to balance the best management of this iconic battlefield, given the potential impact changes in weather patterns are likely to have, with our underlying wish to continue staging events which so graphically illustrate this key event in our history.' The famous battle saw victory for the Norman Army after they defeated the English army under King Harold II. The 947th anniversary will now be marked by a 'theatrical re-telling' of the event, rather than a full-on battle. The English Heritage spokesman added: 'Although we appreciate that many people will be disappointed, we hope the events we are staging in other parts of the site this year will be enjoyed by thousands of Abbey visitors and that by taking this action now, we will be able to safeguard large scale events in the future, with the aim to reinstate them from 2014.' Last year the battle was cancelled by English Heritage due to health and safety reasons after torrential rain turned the battlefield into a mud bath. A spokesman said at the time: 'Although the forecast was for fair weather, unexpected torrential rain over several hours has resulted in unacceptably high levels of mud both on the battlefield and on public areas. 'For safety reasons, the event cannot go ahead.'","English Heritage said the event had to be cancelled to conserve the site .

Murder suspect Christopher Dorner, a former Los Angeles Police officer wrote a 'manifesto' about racial prejudices and corruption within law enforcement . Former LAPD officer Christopher Dorner tried to persuade fishermen in San Diego to take him to Mexico before he went on a deadly shooting spree, it has been alleged. The cop-turned-fugitive died from a single gunshot wound to the head following a nine-day manhunt. His body was pulled out of a cabin in Big Bear Lake last week following a shootout with police. But now fishermen at Driscoll Wharf, in San Diego, have told NBC 7 that Dorner was on the pier near Nimitz and Harbor Island Drive on February 5 trying to charm his way into a boat ride to Mexico. Jeremy Smith, a local fisherman, said: 'He kept saying he wanted to go fishing off Mexico. I said ‘Mexico? That’s kinda weird. You could go fishing on the bay.' According to Smith and other fishermen, Dorner was willing to pay $200 to $400 for someone to take him out to sea. He told the fishermen he was going to be deployed to Afghanistan but wanted to go fishing in Mexico before he left. Smith said he offered to show him around a luxury yacht that was for sale but asked him to remove his military boots which he declined to do so. Smith added: 'Maybe he had a gun. Usually people want to see inside.' San Diego Police Lt. Andra Brown said she was not aware of Dorner being spotted in San Diego but that an investigation was ongoing. Dorner is accused of murdering the daughter of an ex-LAPD captain and her fiance on February 3 and shooting dead an officer in cold blood.

Thousands of police officers throughout Southern California and Nevada searched for Dorner, a former Los Angeles officer during the manhunt . Three further police personnel were shot and wounded while he was on the loose, and another died in the final siege at the ski resort of Big Bear. It is believed he carried out the attack as revenge after he was dismissed from the LAPD in 2008 on a charge of making false statements. He also posted a 6,000-word manifesto online about the decision made five years ago to dismiss him and made accusations that racism remained rife in the police force. Dozens of protesters rallied outside Los Angeles police headquarters yesterday. Protesters told the Los Angeles Times they didn't support Dorner's deadly methods, but objected to police corruption and brutality, and believed Dorner's claims of racism and unfair treatment by the department. Many said they were angered by the conduct of the manhunt that led to Dorner's death and injuries to innocent bystanders who were mistaken for him.

Michael Nam, 30, who held a sign with a flaming tombstone and the inscription 'RIP Habeas Corpus,' said it was 'pretty obvious' police had no intention of bringing Dorner in alive. 'They were the judge, the jury and the executioner,' Nam said. 'As an American citizen, you have the right to a trial and due process by law.' During the hunt for Dorner, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck called for Dorner's surrender and said he didn't want to see the suspect or anyone else injured.

A police officer who kept his driving licence despite speeding at 100mph has been convicted again after being caught drink-driving. PC Matthew Stott, 45, was banned for a year after he admitted driving while over the legal limit on the A14 in Suffolk in September when he appeared at Norwich Magistrates' Court this morning. Prosecutor Oliver Haswell told the court that Stott - who admitted speeding in a 70mph zone in 2009 but kept his licence and job - had failed to stop for two police cars thinking it was 'former colleagues playing a prank'. But Mr Haswell said Stott's passenger had repeatedly told him 'just stop' as cars with flashing lights chased him after spotting a defective rear light. Two police cars attempted a 'boxing in' manoeuvre to force him to stop but had to abort this when it became clear he would not stop and the public may be at risk. Mr Haswell added Stott, who claimed to have drunk two large glasses of wine, panicked and told his female passenger: 'My job, my job, I'm going to lose everything and I've only got six years left.' He eventually reached his home in Stowmarket, where he agreed to a breath test. Stott had previously denied the charge but changed his plea on the morning of his scheduled trial. He had intended to fight the allegation on the basis that the breathalyser was faulty and officers had not followed correct procedures. Heather Oliver, mitigating, said the police pursuit had lasted 'only five minutes'. His breathalyser reading of 44 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath was only narrowly over the legal limit of 35, she added. The PC said he had drunk two glasses of wine (posed by model) Miss Oliver said that Stott had 'parlous' finances and his 24-year-career was now 'effectively over'. 'He will be punished over and above what many defendants would face in a similar situation,' she added. District judge Peter Veits banned Stott from driving for 12 months and ordered him to pay a fine and legal costs totalling £1,115. He said: 'You must deal with drink driving on a regular basis and you must see the consequences of that. 'It was a very unwise decision to drive that night and you exacerbated that by not stopping for the police.' Stott was previously convicted of driving at more than 30mph above the normal limit at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court in Ipswich. He told the court he had been suffering from stress and was late for work. But instead of banning him from driving, magistrates decided to put six penalty points on his previously clean driving licence and issue him with a fine. At the time, road safety campaigners criticised that decision, labelling it an example of 'one rule for police and another for everybody else'.","PC Matthew Stott had 'two glasses of wine' before getting behind the wheel .

Father-of-two Jabur Hissan buried more than 29,000 letters in his garden and on wasteland, burned 400 more and dumped nearly 200 on a canal towpath. He told a court that he thought he was dumping 'junk mail' but he was actually carrying bills and letters. Hissan (not pictured) 'was finding it difficult to keep up with his rounds and he was struggling at home to bring up a young family' his defence said . Some of the post should have been delivered to houses the 32-year-old walked past on his way back to his home in Birmingham. Hissan was jailed for eight months and told he had created a 'devastating risk'. District Judge Jack McGarthar said: 'There is a serious risk, there were bills in the mail and people were not able to meet their responsibilities, letters to loved ones and more. 'This has a devastating effect on anybody affected by it. 'Postmen are in a position of very high trust and you have seriously breached that position.' Hissan admitted charges of arson, criminal damage to property worth more than £5,000 and delaying post. The offences covered a total of 29,178 items. John Dove, prosecuting, told Birmingham Magistrates' Court that some of the dumped letters had turned to 'pulp'. He said: 'Most of the items were in very poor condition as they had been exposed to the elements and left rotting. 'Some of the packets had been dumped in vegetation and trampled into the ground, suggesting an attempt had been made to bury them, and some were mere pulp.' Robert Skinner, defending, said Hissan believed he was ditching junk mail. Mr Skinner said: 'He was at the bottom of the rung and, I suspect, on the bottom pay package offered by the Royal Mail. 'He was finding it difficult to keep up with his rounds and he was struggling at home to bring up a young family, one of whom was requiring regular medical treatment for eczema. 'It was of his view that it was junk mail that he was not delivering.' But the judge said to Hissan: 'The items described as junk mail by your solicitor are certainly not junk to the people who pay for them to be delivered. 'The Royal Mail depend entirely in postmen to act faithfully and deliver items placed into their trust.' Royal Mail spokesperson Val Bodden said: 'Royal Mail has a zero tolerance approach to any dishonesty and that stance is shared by the overwhelming majority of postmen and women, who are honest and hardworking and who do all they can to protect the mail and deliver it safely. 'It is a criminal offence to tamper with or delay the delivery of mail and anyone caught doing so will face serious disciplinary measures and Royal Mail will always seek to prosecute the tiny minority of people who abuse their position of trust. 'The safety and security of mail is of the utmost importance to this business and Royal Mail will not allow the actions of any individual to damage the good reputation of our thousands of hard-working postmen and women.'","Jabur Hissan told a court that he thought he was dumping 'junk mail'

For the last couple of years, females have been performing increasingly better in exams than males. But it now appears their success on paper may be affecting their love lives. The latest Census results show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for women to find a man with the same level of education. Looking for love: Women in America are finding it increasingly difficult to find a male partner with the same level of education as themselves . Not so clever: The ten worst places to meet a qualified bachelor . Smart move: These are the places to look for a brainy guy . Sarasota, Florida, is now the worst in the country with 18 females college graduates to every male with a diploma aged under 35. Seattle is the most balanced city, yet there are more than eight graduated women for every seven graduated men, The Atlantic reports. These statistics are echoed, to a slightly lesser degree, across America. In 2011, 36.1 per cent of women aged between 15 and 19 had a degree compared to 28.4 per cent of men in the same age bracket. Tough odds: In some States, there are as many as 18 female college graduates to every male with a diploma aged under 35 . The discrepancy is the worst between white men and women with  43 per cent of white women having at a bachelor's in 2011 compared to just 35.5 per cent of men. The number of black men with a bachelor's in 2011 was 17 per cent compared to 22.9 per cent of black women. Meanwhile, only nine per cent of Hispanic men had bachelor's compared to 16.8 per cent of women. Jordan Weissmann, associate editor at The Atlantic, analysed the impact this will be having across the country. He wrote: 'Of course, Sarasota is just an extreme example of what's true all over America. The number of college-educated women now far outstrips the number of college-educated men, which in turn has diminished their options in the dating pool. 'One of the great social narratives of the past half century is that Americans have been self-segregating into cultural and class enclaves, in part by marrying people more and more educationally like themselves. 'But that's not really the whole tale. As Stanford sociologist Michael Rosenfeld documented in a 2008 paper, contemporary women are less likely to marry a fellow bachelor's degree holder than they were in 1960, and about 11 percentage points less likely to than today's men.' This explains why there is now far more competition for females to find a mate on the same educational scale as themselves.

It took Mr Richardson an hour and a half to butcher the seven squirrels, yielding a modest amount of meat. He said: 'You'd need one and a half squirrels for a main course.

The chef says squirrels have a gamey flavour and the recipe was adapted from one for rabbits . Appetising: The grey squirrel does not give much meat and one and a half animals are needed for a main course . Although they are only being used as a starter now, Mr Richardson says they could feature on the menu again in the autumn when the squirrels are more plump. He said: 'That is when they are at their heaviest, after they have been eating nuts and fruit all summer.

Bonus: Ellen Alemany is among five senior executives set to receive a multi-million pound share windfall from state-backed the Royal Bank of Scotland . Five senior executives at Royal Bank of Scotland are in line for a multi-million pound share windfall in May. The payout - which is likely to be around £6 million - will reignite the row over rewards at the state-backed bank following its £390m fine for rigging Libor interest rates. The jackpots will come from  long term incentive schemes that were awarded in 2010 and are due to bear fruit in mid-May. In addition to sharing in a total of £6m worth of shares, the five are expected to receive an annual bonus for last year as well as their six or seven figure ‘basic’ salaries. Lord Oakeshott, the Lib Dem peer, said: ‘We put £45bn into RBS to get it lending again but it is still failing in its core purpose of lending to British business and it single handedly stopping the economy growing. ‘Most long suffering taxpayers will find it quite wrong to see top RBS bankers collecting £1m plus bonuses when RBS is still failing to lend and failing the nation.’ The latest controversy comes hard on the heels of recent criticism heaped on chief executive Stephen Hester over a £780,000 delayed bonus award from 2010 that he is due to pocket next month. RBS has pledged to reduce its pay, bonus and incentive pot by £300m in order to cover the costs of its Libor-rigging fine so that British taxpayers are not forced to pick up the tab for its misdeeds. It said it will also claw back bonuses paid in the past. But this will not include Hester’s deferred bonus and nor has it derailed plans to make the lavish share awards to the five executives in his top team. Ellen Alemany, who runs the bank’s US operations, stands to receive the largest windfall of around £2.1m from two share awards granted in 2010 under long term incentive schemes. Nathan Bostock, who is in charge of dealing with the bank’s toxic loans, will bag shares worth £1.2m. Chief executive Stephen Hester is due to receive a £780,000 delayed bonus from 2010 next month . Paul Geddes, now in charge of the RBS’s Direct Line insurance operation, stands to receive shares worth £800,000 while business banking supremo Chris Sullivan will be awarded up to £900,000 worth. Ron Teerlink, the group administrative officer who has announced he is leaving the bank, will get shares valued at £1m. Hester could in theory be awarded shares under the same long-term incentive plan. However, he is extremely unlikely to get any as he has not hit his targets for improving the bank’s share price and its financial performance. Finance director Bruce van Saun is also thought to have failed these performance hurdles so will get no shares under these awards. The other five are in line for their shares because they had different targets from their bosses. RBS declined to comment but it is understood decisions are yet to be made on the exact number of shares that will be showered on the five executives. The bank’s chairman Sir Philip Hampton provoked outrage last week by telling the parliamentary banking commission that Hester’s pay was ‘relatively modest’. Hester has agreed to give up his bonus annual bonus for 2012 because of the Libor-rigging and the IT meltdown that caused havoc with millions of customers’ current accounts. The latest largesse to RBS executives comes  amid speculation over the Government’s plans for its 82pc stake, currently worth around £13bn less than taxpayers were forced to shell out to buy it. Options include a giveaway by Chancellor George Osborne of free shares worth up to £400 for every taxpayer.","Five senior executives in line for multi-million pound payout .

Lakers' loss: Jerry Buss died of cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 79 years old . Jerry Buss, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Lakers who bought the team in 1979, died this morning while battling cancer. He was 80 years old. News of his death came just days after it was reported that he had been suffering from the disease and hospitalized in intensive care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His assistant, Bob Steiner, said that although he had been hospitalized for cancer, his immediate cause of death was kidney failure. Under Buss' leadership since 1979, the Lakers became Southern California's most beloved sports franchise and a worldwide extension of Hollywood glamour. Buss acquired, nurtured and befriended a staggering array of talented players and basketball minds during his Hall of Fame tenure. Few owners in sports history can even approach Buss' accomplishments with the Lakers, who made the NBA finals 16 times through 2011 during his 32 years in charge, winning 10 titles between 1980 and 2010. The Lakers easily are the NBA's most successful franchise since he bought the club. He was also beloved by his players, and often referred to the team as his extended family. Several current and former players, including Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson, had visited Buss in his final days. In a statement released today, NBA Commissioner David Stern said: 'The NBA has lost a visionary owner whose influence on our league is incalculable and will be felt for decades to come. 'More importantly, we have lost a dear and valued friend. Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.' Working with front-office executives . Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak, Buss spent lavishly to win his titles . despite lacking a huge personal fortune, often running the NBA's highest . payroll while also paying high-profile coaches like Pat Riley and Phil . Jackson. LA icon: Buss poses with the Laker Girls cheerleaders after his star was unveiled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006 . He co-founded a basic-cable sports television network and sold the naming rights to the Forum at times when both now-standard strategies were unusual, adding justification for his induction into the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. Magic Johnson and fellow Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy formed lifelong bonds with Buss during the Lakers' run to five titles in nine years in the 1980s, when the Lakers earned a reputation as basketball's most exciting team with their glamorous Showtime style. Jackson then led Shaquille O'Neal and Bryant to a three-peat from 2000-02, rekindling the Lakers' mystique, before Bryant and Pau Gasol won two more titles under Jackson in 2009 and 2010. Although Buss was proudest of his two . hands full of NBA title rings, he also was a scholar, Renaissance man . and bon vivant who epitomized California cool - and a certain LA . lifestyle - for his entire public life. The father of six was rarely seen without an attractive - and much younger - woman on his arm. Buss earned a Ph.D. in chemistry at age 24 and had careers in aerospace and real estate development before getting into sports. Scroll down for video . Champions: Buss stands with Kobe Bryant and Bryant's wife Vanessa after the Lakers defeated the Boston Celtics to capture the 2010 NBA championship . Legends: Buss speaks at his Basketball Hall of Fame induction as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Pat Riley look on . With money largely from his Santa Monica real-estate ventures, Buss bought the then-struggling Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and both clubs' arena - the Forum - from Jack Kent Cooke in a $67.5million deal that was the largest sports transaction in history at the time. In January 2011, Forbes estimated the Lakers were worth $643million - the second-most valuable NBA franchise. Magic: Buss hugs Magic Johnson in the locker room after they won the 1980 NBA championship against the Philadelphia 76ers . Buss also helped change televised . sports by co-founding the Prime Ticket network in 1985, even receiving a . star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006 for his work in television. Breaking . the contemporary model of subscription services for televised sports, . Buss' Prime Ticket put beloved broadcaster Chick Hearn and the Lakers' home games on basic cable. A former aerospace engineer and real-estate developer, Buss has been a prominent name in American sports since he bought the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and the Forum from Jack Kent Cooke in 1979. Immediately, Buss transformed the Lakers into the NBA's most glamorous franchise, winning 10 NBA championships under his watch - with the first in 1980. Buss' children moved into leadership roles with the Lakers in recent years. Jim Buss, the Lakers' executive vice president of player personnel and the second of Buss' six children, has taken a leading role in basketball decisions, while daughter Jeanie plays a major role in running the franchise's business side. Yet Jerry Buss was deeply involved the Lakers' most recent major moves, including the acquisitions of Steve Nash and Dwight Howard last summer, along with the firing of coach Mike Brown and the hiring of Mike D'Antoni early this season. Buss has been hospitalized several times in recent years, including a stint last July for dehydration. He was treated for blood clots in his legs in December 2011.

Not to rest in peace: The cemeteries, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, have become a site of pilgrimage for descendants of the troops killed during the uprising of 1857 known as the Indian Mutiny . Some descendants, including leading judge Sir Mark Havelock-Allan, have voiced their concern about the construction plans. P.K. Mishral, superintendent of the Lucknow branch of the survey, said the graves were historic shrines that must be protected. He was quoted in the Daily Telegraph saying: We have to protect all these things relevant to our history.’ But city officials are angry at the Archeological Survey of India’s rules which protect the graves as historical monuments, preventing any construction within 330 feet of them. They claim that the rules should be waived in this case as the graves are not looked after by relatives and are preventing the modernisation of the city. Waive restrictions: City officials are angry at rules which prevent any construction within 330 feet of the graves claiming that they should be waived as the graves are not looked after by relatives . A Metro project manager, who did not want to be named, said he thought the opposition could be overruled. Celebrated figures: Among those buried there is Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, whose statue stands in Trafalgar Square in London . He said: ‘There are some difficulties and we are trying to sort them out with concerned officials. ‘We will take care of everything before taking a final decision.’ The Indian Mutiny was an uprising by local soldiers against the ruling British East India Company. In 1857, growing tension was inflamed by rumours that Indian soldiers' rifle cartridges were being greased with pig and cow fat, offending Muslims and Hindus alike. The unrest erupted in May. The city of Delhi soon fell and there were further uprisings elsewhere. In Lucknow, Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence fortified his home - the Residency - and prepared for a siege. Mutineers attacked the Residency and its 1,700-strong garrison in May and by July Sir Henry was dead. Garrison numbers dwindled until a relief force under Major-General Sir Henry Havelock fought its way into Lucknow in September. The Residency was evacuated in November but was recaptured in March the following year and the uprising was crushed soon after. The East India Company was subsequently abolished and the government of India transferred to the Crown.","Some of the 2,000 graves could be destroyed for the construction .

A former professional boxer has been jailed for seven years today for killing a stranger with a single punch outside a pub. Graham Brett, 50, knocked Australian-born Neil Hannah, 49, unconscious with one punch to the jaw. He toppled backwards and suffered a brain injury and died five days later on August 7. Brett, from Pimlico, central London, pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Former professional boxer Graham Brett, left, was jailed for seven years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of 'gentle giant' Neil Hannah, right, who suffered a fatal brain injury in the attack . The court was told the pair had been drinking in the Greyhound pub in Pimlico when Brett took exception to Mr Hannah and called him outside. He took his glasses off and aimed a right hook at Mr Hannah, who was described as a 'gentle giant'. Brett fought as a light heavyweight in the early 1980s and recorded two wins and two losses in his professional career and also fought 70 amateur bouts. Brett, who has a history of drunken violence, had downed seven pints on the night of the attack and taken cocaine. He told police he was acting in self-defence after Mr Hannah called him a 'Pommie c**t'. However, Gillian Etherton QC, prosecuting, said CCTV of the incident shows Brett took up the stance of an 'experienced boxer'. She told the court: 'The assault on Mr Hannah was an unprovoked, gratuitous display of violence.' After his boxing career ended, Brett coached at an amateur boxing club and worked on the railway network. Brett punched Mr Hannah in the jaw outside the Greyhound pub in Pimlico and then carried on drinking inside . He has a history of alcohol abuse and convictions for violence stretching back to 1997. Miss Etherton said: 'He has a long history of unprovoked violence and aggressive behaviour. As a result he has been banned from a large number of pubs, social clubs and a boxing club. ‘The locals in the area knew him and were frightened by him.’ Mr Hannah had lived in the UK for several years and was described as 'an unbelievably placid guy' and 'always jovial'. CCTV shows the first contact between the two men took place at 10.12pm when Mr Hannah walked outside where Brett, who was celebrating a new job, was smoking a cigarette. A few minutes after Mr Hannah went back inside, he was called onto the street by Brett. The footage shows Mr Hannah raise his hands slightly before being punched in the face. Brett then put his glasses back on and went inside to carry on drinking. When he was arrested at home later that night Brett told police: ‘The geezer went to bite my nose off. I hit him and he went down.’ Mr Hannah was taken to hospital but a scan revealed two fractures to the back of his head and swelling of the brain which led to his death five days later. The judge said Brett had launched a 'completely unjustified attack' as he sentenced him at the Old Bailey . Brett was due to stand trial for murder at the Old Bailey today but pleaded guilty to manslaughter, which was accepted by the prosecution following consultation with the victim's family. The judge, Mr Justice Start-Smith, said: ‘Unnecessary violence in residential areas creates great and justified public concern. ‘Law-abiding citizens are entitled to go the pub and expect to be safe when they go for a drink. ‘The court has to do what they can to deter those who engage in gratuitous violence when they go out for a drink.’ He said Brett had launched an ‘unprovoked and completely unjustified’ attack on his victim. The judge said the appropriate sentence would normally have been four years - but upped this to seven after hearing details of Brett’s violent history. Brett told the judge ‘thank you very much’ and blew kisses to his supporters in the public gallery as he was led away to the cells.","Graham Brett, 50, punched 'gentle giant' Neil Hannah in unprovoked attack .

A 13-year-old girl who told police how she had been groomed and raped by an Asian sex gang wrote a harrowing letter to herself at the age of 14. In the letter addressed to her alter-ego Michelle, she wrote, 'I feel like the asians really hate me even when they say they love me'. The girl, who told police about the rape that took her virginity and the time five men queued outside a bedroom to demand sex from her, added, 'They took all my dreams and my life away from me.' Victim: A vulnerable 13-year-old white girl wrote a letter to herself saying Asian men took her dreams and life away from her (posed by model) In a three hour interview with South Yorkshire Police in 2003, the girl, at the time 13, told of the hellish ordeal of how she was ensnared to two police officers. Six months later, at the age of 14, Amy, a name used to protect her identity, from a village near Rotherham, was interviewed again for two hours, which was filmed and captured. She found the courage to speak to officers in the hope that the men who had exploited her would be prosecuted. In footage obtained by The Times, Amy identified the youths who befriended her and spoke of how she enjoyed spending times with them after school. Victim: A vulnerable white girl who was sexually abused by Asian men was offered lessons in Urdu and Punjabi after her ordeal. (Picture posed by model) She said they introduced her to older men, cars, alcohol cigarettes and cannabis. She also spoke of the shame and confusion about whether to tell anyone after she was raped for the first time and how she was subjected to acts of casual, brutal sex. In a later interview she said she was held in a bedroom in a flat as five men queued to demand sex from her. When Amy was with her abusers, they told her to tell police officers her name was Michelle. The letter she wrote to herself at 14 reveals the torment she suffered at the hands of the gang. She added, in a letter revealed in The Times, that the men 'say they love me' and 'I just feel sad because they've took all my dreams and my life away from me.' 'If I had one dream it would be for them to treat me like I'm human and not just a piece of meat'. She wrote a reply to herself from Michelle saying she was frightened of the men and that she felt she deserved the horrible things they did to her. Police have never charged anyone in connection with any sexual offence against Amy. Before . the girl spoke to officers in 2003, South Yorkshire police already knew . of a crime pattern involving the sexual exploitation of young teenagers . in Rotherham by a group of offenders, largely of Pakistani heritage. The news comes as research, reports and case files revealed police turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls. Confidential documents have revealed the scale of sexual exploitation of young white girls in Rotherham, South Yorkshire . And it was claimed council officials were desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls. The . research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 . were ignored by the authorities. In many cases, police action was taken . only against the victims. Among other alleged crimes which no one was prosecuted for was a British Pakistani man found in a car with a 12-year-old, a bottle of vodka and pornographic images of the girl. Another alleged crime was a 14-year-old girl missing for a week and found under the influence of drugs in a car with a man 20 years older. They had sex but he was arrested only for drug possession.

A mother has spoken of her shock after a 4ft-long boa constrictor appeared in her bathroom whilst she was bathing her two daughters. Stacey Way, 28, said she had previously spotted a yellow object next to a water pipe a few days before, but, thinking it was a banana her toddler had shoved down the side, had forgotten all about it. Or at least she had, until, a few days later when she suddenly saw the object move - and realised it was a snake. Stacey Way, 28, said she was shocked to discover the 4ft boa constrictor in her bathroom whilst she was in there with her two children . The 28-year-old mother, from Parkstone, Dorset, said: 'I was so shocked, I couldn’t believe it. 'I was wiping the bathroom floor when I noticed what I thought was a mouldy banana my toddler had shoved down the side of the water pipe. 'I know it sounds ridiculous, but I thought ‘I’ll get that in a minute with my gloves on and then just forget all about it. 'Three days later I was bathing my two little ones and wiped around the floor again when I saw that this thing was sticking out more than before, but as I got closer it went back in. The 28-year-old mother said she had spotted what she thought was a banana in her bathroom several days before, but the fruit turned out instead to be a huge snake . 'I looked closer and realised that the banana, or now snake, had a mouth.' Horrified, she took the children, aged two and four out of the bath, and called a friend who arrived with a box. The pair went to a nearby reptile centre to ask for help but they were forced to call the RSPCA, who told them the floorboards would need to be removed to rescue the beast. But as the property was rented, the officer advised her to leave a tub full of water on the bathroom floor to entice the snake out. When Stacey checked a few hours later the creature had fully emerged and the reptile centre were able to collect it from her home in Parkstone, Dorset. Stacey Way, 28, points to the spot in her bathroom, right, where the huge boa constrictor, left, was hiding away . 'When I looked in the bathroom a few hours later he was sticking right out the hole so I called the shop and they came and got him,' she said. 'It was about three-to-four feet long, I couldn’t believe it. 'Now I think I’m seeing snakes everywhere even though we’ve filled up all the holes. 'I don’t mind snakes from a distance, but not in my bathroom.' And staff from the reptile centre who are now looking after the snake known to grow up to 13ft long say they are baffled as to where the snake could have come from. Leanne Harris, owner of Safe Haven Exotics said: 'The snake could have come from anywhere, it could have escaped from a cage or have been dumped by someone. 'I was shocked when I found out it was in Stacey’s bathroom.'","Stacey Way, 28, said she had previously spotted a yellow object next to a water pipe but had forgotten all about it .

During the gloomiest hours of the Second World War, it was the secret weapon that boosted the morale of battle-weary troops. An Army of deliciously curvy young women, often stripped to lacy underwear, were deployed to lift the spirits of the men fighting fascism. And in the war against the Nazis, maintaining the inspiration of service personnel faced with death and destruction was often seen as vital as having enough ammunition. Morale boost: Thousands of pictures such as these were sent out to troops during the Second World War. On the left is an image called 'Hit the Deck' and on the right American actress Betty Grable shows off her celebrated legs . Saucy: Author Mike Brown has brought together this fascinating collection of nostalgic pictures which celebrate feminine beauty. These cards were usually printed out from vending machines at amusement arcades . But the battalion of females were not living, breathing, flash and blood. Instead they were pin-ups that bolstered the morale of British troops wrenched from their homes and sent to barrack rooms to tackle the enemy. The most famous was 'Jane', the cartoon heroine who boosted morale during the Blitz and other troubled times by removing her clothes. The blonde bombshell, who was drawn in the Daily Mirror, became a national treasure and was reputedly painted on the first British armored vehicle ashore on D-Day in June 1944. Long way from home: US Staff Sergeant John Ferris on his bunk at Nettuno, Italy, in April 1944, with a fine collection of pin ups . Winston Churchill jokingly dubbed Jane 'Britain's secret weapon'. As well as illustrations of smiling, buxom beauties - often in uniform showing they supported the war effort - racy photographs and postcards of naked women also brightened up the mess halls of the Army, Royal Navy and RAF. From pin-ups such as Blondie, to . girlfriends and wives, images of so-called sex-bombs were also . emblazoned on the sides of Allied aircraft flying on bombing runs into . occupied Europe as a reminder of home. Now . the pin-up – one of the most enduringly popular, but least credited, . icons of war-time Britain and Europe - is being recognised in the latest . vintage book from period author Mike Brown. Called . 'The Pin-up in World War II', the book is beautifully and abundantly . illustrated by scores of pin-ups – archetypal nude photos, cartoons and . illustrations from dozens of sources. Artwork: These pictures from 1942 are fine examples of the pin-up girls from an era when a glimpse of a stocking was considered highly erotic . Mr Brown's book charts the history of the pin-up which came of age by the end of the 19th century, with the advent of photography and the 'dirty French postcard'. In the Second World War the pin-up became the darling of millions of young men suddenly torn from their families and plunged into the all-male environments of garrisons and the front line. Images from the UK, U.S., France and Germany are included. Mr Brown said: 'Throughout the 1930s and '40s, there can’t have been a barrack room in Europe that wasn't filled with torn-out magazine pages, photos and postcards of pin-ups, either hidden in drawers and kitbags or boldly displayed on walls and notice boards. 'Pin-ups went to war just as much as sweetheart letters, uniforms and artillery and, as well as being a delight to the eye, were a bedrock of troop morale. Now, at last, they've been brought together in a single, fully illustrated history and celebration of the wartime pin-up.' * 'The Pin-up in World War II' is published today (Dec04) by Sabrestorm at all good bookshops and online retailers priced £6.99.","Author Mike Brown has brought together a fascinating collection of vintage photos .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:35 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 16 January 2013 . An Ohio man hatched a plot to kill a . woman he was in a home-ownership dispute with, authorities say, by approaching . an emergency room patient at the renowned hospital where he worked as a nurse . with the question, ""Ever killed anyone?"" No, the Cleveland Clinic patient replied, but I once shot a . man. That was good enough, authorities say, for nurse Andrew Martin, . 23, who allegedly tried to resolve the dispute by offering the patient $10,000 . to kill the woman, who was never hurt. Martin, of the town of Bristolville about 50 miles east of . Cleveland, has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 7 in . U.S. District Court in Cleveland. His attorney, Edward LaRue, said ""there's much . more to come"" in the case. Accused: Andrew Martin, 23, of Brisolville, Ohio is accused of offering $10,000 to a hitman to kill a woman to resolve a property dispute . According to a federal affidavit that reads like a combination . of real-estate law and backroom conspiracy, Martin somehow hooked up with a man . named David Simons, who had done occasional carpentry work for an elderly man, . George Warehime. How Martin and Simons met wasn't detailed. Warehime died Dec. 4, 2010, at age 83 after years of decline. Doctors said he showed evidence of Alzheimer's disease. The administrator of his . estate, sister Joy Comey, put his house up for sale and lined up a buyer. She was stunned to visit the home Nov. 21, 2011, and find . Martin and another man, David Simons there. They claimed her brother had deeded the . house to them nine months earlier without cost. Getting the house could enrich the men. It is valued at . $193,000 for tax purposes. Comey said her brother never . mentioned giving up his home, on a tree-lined boulevard in a desirable . neighborhood in Lakewood, minutes from Cleveland. Comey lived near him in the . area blocks from Lake Erie and visited him frequently to care for him. Comey called police, and a year-long ownership fight began in . probate court. A judge eventually sided with Comey and voided a backdated deed . notarized under questionable circumstances. Dispute: This is the home at the center of a court case where a 23-year-old stands accused of an alleged murder plot. Andrew Martin is accused of plotting to murder Joy Comey whose brother, he claims, left him the property . Comey argued that the two men took advantage of her brother, . who was found in 2009 to have memory loss and dementia. He couldn't hear . well. Simons claimed the deed to the house showed up in his mail box . without explanation. His attorney quit in the middle of the probate case, . fearful that his client was involved in fraud, court records said. Martin is accused of using a cellphone to discuss the plot, . and because the cellular network crosses states lines, he is being charged in . federal court, instead of state court, with the murder-for-hire scheme. Irritated that 'this 70-year-old lady, she has been trying to . mess up my life,' Martin approached an ER patient who 'looked like a big guy,' according to the federal affidavit. 'Ever hurt anyone?' Martin allegedly asked the man, whose name . wasn't disclosed. 'Yes, no, maybe,' the ER patient responded cautiously. Martin pressed ahead, according to the affidavit, asking, 'Ever killed anyone?' Hired: Nurse Andrew Martin is accused of trying to hire a hit-man at the exclusive Cleveland Clinic to kill a woman in a property dispute. The man was a patient and allegedly tipped off the intended victim . 'I shot someone in the leg once,' the patient responded. Satisfied the man lived in a tough Cleveland neighborhood, . Martin allegedly offered him $10,000 to kill Comey. Martin described her and her . car and provided her address, prosecutors say. When the patient tipped a police officer, Comey was alerted . and went into hiding. The threat caused her anguish, and 'she was deeply disturbed, . as one would expect,' said her probate attorney, Franklin Hickman. Calls to Comey's home went unanswered, and Hickman said he had . advised her not to talk to reporters. The Cleveland Clinic, a research hospital known for its . nationally ranked heart care, suspended Martin without pay when he was arrested . in November. Martin was locked up without bail to await trial. LaRue, his attorney, said a picture of a hard-working young . man would emerge at Martin's trial. 'He's been remarkably productive,' he said. 'He's been working . ever since the age of 15. He's 23 now and has attained a certain degree of . business acumen in the world, as well as a nursing license.' Simons could not be reached for comment. A bankruptcy court . filing from last year showed he had debts of nearly $150,000; he wasn't charged . in the alleged murder plot. Last May, in the middle of the probate fight, Simons took out . a $600,000 insurance policy on the house, according to the federal affidavit. Ten days later, an early morning fire later declared arson damaged the house, . and the insurer rescinded the policy. Local prosecutors declined to comment on any investigation . involving suspected house fraud or arson. There is little evidence of the fire at the spacious house, . which remains boarded up and padlocked by the city.","Andrew Martin is accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill Joy Comey .

"By . Paul Revoir and Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 06:24 EST, 14 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:08 EST, 14 February 2013 . New role: Helen Boaden, the executive in charge of BBC News when the Jimmy Savile controversy erupted . The BBC’s most high-profile woman executive is moving to a new job just days before the release of explosive transcripts into the Corporation’s handling of the Savile scandal. Helen Boaden, formerly director of news, is to become director of radio following months of speculation about her future. The switch is technically a sideways move for Miss Boaden, 56, although some regard running the huge news operation as the bigger role. Confirmation of her move comes shortly before the BBC publishes thousands of pages of evidence used by former head of Sky News Nick Pollard in his report into why Newsnight ditched an investigation into Jimmy Savile. Miss Boaden, 56, had been criticised in the report for failing to tackle the ‘virtual meltdown’ in parts of the news department. The testimonies, emails and texts are expected to be published at the end of next week and insiders admit that some of them may be embarrassing to a number of senior BBC executives. Miss Boaden, who has been in charge of BBC News since 2004, was told last week that incoming director general Lord Hall would like her to move to radio and  yesterday the BBC confirmed this will take place after Easter. Miss Boaden, a former controller of Radio 4, said: ‘It is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio. The British public love BBC Radio and I intend to cherish and champion it.’ Change: Former culture secretary James Purnell, right, is to join the BBC in a major strategic role. The appointments have been made by incoming director-general Tony Hall, left,  before he takes up his position . Together: Jimmy Savile and Helen Boaden are pictured at the Savoy Hotel in London in December 2006 . At the height of the Savile crisis she temporarily ‘stepped aside’ from her £340,000 a year role, and it was later revealed she had at one point offered to resign. There is speculation that the former editor of The Times, James Harding, will be handed her former post. Mr Hall said of his appointments to the senior management team: 'I am building a senior team that will define the BBC and public service broadcasting for the next decade. 'It will be a team that is made up of outstanding talent from outside the BBC combined with the best people from within. 'There will be more changes over the coming months and there is a lot of hard work ahead but today's appointments are the first steps in delivering that vision.' There will also be changes to the role which acting director-general Tim Davie will take on in April when Mr Hall arrives. Mr Hall was appointed director-general following the resignation of George Entwistle, after just 54 days in the job. Mr Entwistle quit, saying that as editor-in chief he had to take 'ultimate responsibility' for a Newsnight investigation that had led to the former Conservative Party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, being wrongly accused of child abuse. Change of direction: Boaden is understood to have previously been offered the job by the then director general George Entwistle, who left in November (seen here resigning next to Lord Patten,) but turned it down . Mr Davie - formerly the director of BBC audio and music - will become CEO of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide, and this role is being expanded to include 'a more strategic global perspective'. This will involve developing the BBC's international brand and editorial strategy. Mr Davie said: 'I am very pleased to take on the important task of building the BBC brand globally and leading a growing, creative BBC Worldwide.' BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music controller Bob Shennan had been an early . favourite for the radio role, which was previously held by Tim . Davie. As director of news, Miss Boaden was responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight. Ms Boaden said: 'It is a huge pleasure to be returning to my first love of radio. I look forward to working with our outstanding controllers and some of the most creative on and off air talent in the BBC' It is known that she told Mr Entwistle – then running BBC TV – at an awards lunch last year that Newsnight was planning to run a report about claims that Savile abused young girls, which could affect Mr Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying tribute to the presenter. In a memo to news staff, Ms Boaden . said that her move was a 'bittersweet moment', as she listed some of the . notable moments in output during her tenure in news. They included coverage of the Asian . tsunami, the banking crisis, the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the . Arab Uprising, the edition of Question Time featuring BNP leader Nick . Griffin and the hunt for gunman Raoul Moat, as well as the Olympic Torch . relay. She wrote: 'I confess that it is a . bittersweet moment for me. Everyone knows that I love radio and always . have. So naturally I genuinely relish returning to this cherished and . uniquely creative part of the BBC, especially under a new DG . (director-general) who is passionate about its importance. 'But leaving News and all of you is . undoubtedly a wrench. I believe I may be the longest serving Head of . News over the past 25 years.' She added: 'It has been a huge privilege and an absolute pleasure to lead you.' Sources at Newsnight have also suggested that she warned the programme’s then editor, Peter Rippon – who has also since stepped aside – that he needed to be sure of his facts before screening any claims that Savile was a criminal. She resumed her role as director of BBC . News in December after further blunders - caused by a change in the . chain of command in news while an inquiry was ongoing - led to Lord . McAlpine being wrongly identified as being involved in a sexual abuse . scandal. She began at the corporation almost 30 years ago, working as a news producer at BBC Radio Leeds before going on to work as a reporter and then editor of Radio 4’s File on 4, and as a presenter on Woman’s Hour. She took responsibility for business programmes on the station in 1997 and was made station controller three years later. Fiercely defensive of the station’s ‘intelligent’ programming that ‘feeds the mind’ she helped it to reach audiences of 10million for the first time. Despite running Radio 4 during another BBC crisis – when an infamous Today programme  report sparked the Hutton Inquiry – she escaped censure because the show is governed by the BBC News division. In the wake of the scandal Miss Boaden was promoted to become said division’s first female director in 2004. Last year she applied to become director general but was beaten by Mr Entwistle. It is understood she was offered a senior role in radio instead, but turned it down. Ms Boaden said Fran Unsworth would become acting director of news from March 19. She took that position during the period in which Ms Boaden stepped aside.","Boaden was BBC News executive when Jimmy Savile controversy erupted .

A mother emerged from court smirking after admitting that her vicious pitbull-type dog mauled an eight-year-old boy, leaving him scarred for life. Owner Emma Gregory, 20, showed no remorse as she left Manchester Magistrates' Court after hearing details of the ‘terrifying attack’ which lasted several minutes on the young schoolboy who now needs plastic surgery. District Judge Wendy Lloyd said allowing the dog out on the street was ‘like leaving a loaded gun in the garden’. Mother-of-one Emma Gregory laughs after admitting her dog mauled a defenceless eight-year-old boy . Pet Tia attacked the boy as he walked home from school with his mother – gouging into his cheek, arm and leg. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, screamed in agony as he tried frantically to fend off the dog. His mother used the boy’s schoolbag to hit the dog in a desperate bid to make it stop, a court heard. The boy’s wounds were so bad that he needed plastic surgery. Gregory, who has an 18-month-old baby, pleaded guilty to having a dog that was dangerously out of control, as well as a further count of having two fighting dogs. The court heard that Gregory from Openshaw in Manchester, also owns a second pit bull-type dog called Mia. The young boy was attacked by a pitbull-type dog, similar to the pitbull terrier pictured, which bit into his face, arms and legs . District Judge Lloyd said: ‘The victim was a vulnerable child and an aggravating feature is that this type of dog is a prohibited breed. I have seen pictures of the child’s injuries. ‘It is a mess. This little boy when he looks in the mirror every morning will remember this frightening attack. ‘Hopefully, I am told, the scarring will improve. It was something that should never of happened.’ She added: ‘You knew the type of dog it was and didn’t take adequate precautions.’ Gareth Hughes, prosecuting, had told the court that Gregory was seen shooing Tia out of the house and closing her door just moments before the attack on May 23. Peter Etherall, defending, said Gregory - the mother of an 18-month-old baby - had never previously had any problems with the dogs. Gregory will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court next month.","Mother Emma Gregory smirked and laughed as she walked out of Manchester Magistrates' Court .

Katie Couric has been left shaken after learning that a phone line still listed in her late husband's name has been making early-morning 911 calls. Each time the calls have been placed at 2 a.m. on Tuesday mornings, police have been sent to her Manhattan home to investigate. In total, there have been at least 10 calls from the line, police said. The television host was so distressed that she even contacted New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to ask for his help. The New York Police department is now looking into the calls, which could be the work of a prankster or simply from a fault with the line, a source told the New York Daily News. Concerns: Katie Couric, pictured last week, has been left shaken by 911 calls made from a phone line registered in her late husband's name. The calls have sent police patrol cars to her home . A tired-looking Couric made the revelation about the bizarre calls to her audience members ahead of a taping of her show on Tuesday. She arrived on the set late and apologised, sharing that she had been unable to sleep for hours the night before after learning that the phone was calling authorities. The phone is the landline for her Upper East Side apartment in New York, and is still registered in the name of her late husband, Jay Monahan, who passed away from colon cancer in 1998. A friend said that Couric just never changed it to her name after her husband passed away. Couric said the phone had been calling 911, sending a single patrol car to her apartment. She would get an automatic call back to her apartment with a 911 operator on the line, the Daily News reported. Loss: Katie Couric sits by a picture of her husband Jay Monahan, who died from colon cancer in 1998 . Speaking to the audience, she said it was a 'SWAT' call, like prank calls that have sent entire SWAT teams to the Los Angeles homes of Ashton Kutcher and Tom Cruise, among others. Couric told the audience that most of the calls have been placed when she is not even there. 'It's happened like three times the last three weeks,' she said. 'Every day, every time at 2 a.m. on . Tuesday morning. I was out of town the last time it happened and . apparently it happened before when nobody was home.' She said that it was particularly disturbing because the calls were made on her late husband's landline, and she was unable to sleep until 4.30 a.m. that morning. Home: Couric, left with Monahan, said that police have been sent to her New York City home after the calls . Inside look: Couric invited audience members to her home in an earlier episode of her show, Katie . 'I got no sleep, so I am just oversharing,' she told the audience, who laughed, the Daily News said. After learning of the calls, Couric first told staff in her building and they decided she should contact the local precinct, but she also decided to call Commissioner Ray Kelly. One audience member recalled: 'She said, ""That is one of the perks of . being well-known, that you can get through to Ray Kelly."" And she said . Ray Kelly told her that you have to respond to these things, and that . the NYPD would investigate it.' A police source confirmed to the paper that the matter is under investigation, and authorities are trying to determine whether there is a fault with the phone or whether she is the victim of a prank. Support: Couric even contacted New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, pictured, for help .

For almost 50 years, he has been the very soul of secrecy and reticence, refusing even to admit he was ever a member of the IRA. But in the two weeks since Gerry Adams joined Twitter, the Sinn Féin TD and former MP and MLA has developed an extreme case of TMI – too much information. His 75 tweets – an average of more than five a day – have a collective embarrassment factor that makes MI6’s dossier redundant. Twit pics: Gerry Adams (pictured with a constituent named as Liam) joined Twitter two weeks ago and has already posted 75 times - an average of five a day . So far his posts have revealed him to be an absent-minded ­64-year-old who owns several teddy bears and takes his toothbrush into the Dáil chamber instead of his pen. And he is in danger of being dubbed ‘Ducky ár lá’ after letting slip that he takes his yellow rubber duck in to the bath with him. He has revealed musical tastes that extend from Joni Mitchell to Leonard Cohen to Luke Kelly and has admitted to being a ­tree­­-hugger. His dramatis personae includes his favourite teddy bear, Ted; a Shinner called Lightbulb who is a terrible driver; and a trusted aide called RG. But Grizzly’s most embarrassing foray into the Twittersphere so far came last week when he admitted breaking into his own house. First the Twitter ingenu told his followers at 4pm: ‘RG took the car. Took my house keys also. I feel an adventure coming on.’ By 5.35, Gerry was still locked out. He was prepared to shin up the drainpipe but was frustrated by a broken pipe – a shinner clearly unwilling to jump without cast-iron guarantees. ‘RGs phone constantly engaged. Its getting dark. Wud climb in back window but downpipe broken,’ he tweeted forlornly. A little later, Gerry took matters into his own hands. He tweeted: ‘RG traced. Where are u now when we need u? 70 miles away. Im in now. Starving. Need a glazier. Slan.’ Embarrassment factor: In his tweets, Mr Adams mentions frequently his favourite teddy bear Ted (right) and his dog Snowie (left) Since then, it’s all been down hill. Under the name @GerryAdamsSF he revealed: ‘Friday! Yahoo! Getting home 2 . c the small people in my life. Cant wait. Ted will b sasta.’ Included in the tweet was a link to a picture he had taken of four teddy bears of varying sizes, including a yellow one with an Antrim GAA badge on his chest. ‘Sasta’, properly ‘sásta’ is one of the stock national-school Irish phrases that pepper Mr Adams’s tweets. Embarrassingly, he had to be taught how to make a fada on Twitter – and his first effort instead produced a French grave accent. ‘This twitting cud b addictive. And shud not b done under the influence. So sin è. Ah my first tweeted fada. At last. Oiche mhaith. Xo,’ he crowed. Ted is frequently mentioned. On St Valentine’s Night, Mr Adams wrote; ‘Cooking. Oysters romantiq Cog au vin. Jelly & custard Champagne & strawberries. Pity I’m on my ownieoh. Ted is out.’ Proving popular: At the latest count, Mr Adams had amassed more than 10,000 followers . Last week he wrote that he had accidentally brought his toothbrush into Leinster House. ‘In Dáil chamber. Thought I had a pen in my pocket. Discovered it is a tooth brush! Silly me!!!!’ On February 9, he wrote that he had seen some unusual natural behaviour while on an early morning bike ride. ‘Saw the dawn breaking. Grey light. Out on bike. Saw a squirrel chasing a cat. A grey one. The squirrel that is. Glad 2 b alive. So is cat,’ he observed. Party officials confirmed the account is his, and say the tweets show a side of Adams they often see in their dealings with him. ‘He is far more relaxed in private,’ said a Sinn Féin TD. ‘During the years of the peace process, it was a sensitive process and as the leader of Sinn Féin he had to be conscious of people’s feelings. It was a serious business and it didn’t look good to be laughing and joking all the time.’ At the latest count, Mr Adams had amassed more than 10,000 followers. As for the 30 Tweets being followed by Mr Adams, let’s hope they are not of a nervous disposition.","Gerry Adams joined Twitter two weeks ago and has made 75 posts already .

Fateful night: If proved authentic, the violin of Wallace Hartley (pictured) will have survived the tragedy in which more than 1500 people lost their lives . The violin believed to have belonged to the heroic band master who played as the Titanic sunk is set to sold at auction for a record price. If proved authentic, the violin of Wallace Hartley will have incredibly survived the tragedy in which more than 1500 people lost their lives in the Atlantic on April 15, 1912. The final extensive scientific tests are underway to prove its authenticity but experts believe it to be genuine. It is expected to fetch hundreds of . thousands of pounds on April 20 when it is auctioned by Titanic experts . Henry Aldridge and Son based in Devizes, Wiltshire. It has passed all other tests over the last seven years and the results of the last investigation are due early next month. A . plan of the Titanic used in the inquiry into the doomed ship sold for a . record £220,000 in 2011 but it is believed the instrument will exceed . this price. The anonymous . seller of the violin claims that Maria Robinson, Hartley’s bereaved . fiancé, retrieved the violin after his death. The instrument had been a . gift from her. The fate of Hartley's violin has always been a mystery to Titanic scholars. All eight members of the band that . gallantly played as passengers lined up for evacuation to the lifeboats . perished in the disaster but the bodies of the band leader and two other . musicians were pulled from the water by a search crew from the CS . Mackay-Bennett and taken to Nova Scotia, Canada. Violinist John Law Hume from Dumfries in . Scotland and bass player John Frederick Preston Clarke from Liverpool . were laid to rest in Halifax but Hartley's body was repatriated to . England and buried at Colne, Lancashire, the town where he was born and . raised. Gift of love: Wallace Hartley, pictured front row, fourth from left with violin in the Bridlington Municipal Orchestra, was given the violin he played on that fateful night by his fiance Maria Robinson . Newspapers at the time reported that . Hartley was found fully dressed with his violin strapped to his chest. However, when the effects of Body 224 were itemised by The Office of the . Provincial Secretary in Nova Scotia there was no mention of it. Other than his clothes and spare . change he had only a ring, a pen, a silver matchbox, a gold cigar . holder, a watch and chain, a collar stud, a pair of scissors and two . pieces of correspondence. It . was not among the possessions handed back to his father Albion Hartley . who collected the body from the Arabic at Liverpool docks. The . assumption has long been that the instrument was spirited away by . someone involved in collecting the corpses. Now . the instrument believed to be Hartley's is currently being handled by . the leading Titanic memorabilia auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son who . hold every record set for items from the ship and are considered the . world's leading authority on its artefacts. Incredible story of survival: The violin of bandmaster Hartley who played as the Titanic (pictured) sank, is set to sell at auction for hundreds of thousands of pounds . They have so far spent many thousands of pounds seeking to establish beyond any doubt that the violin is the genuine article. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on the impending auction. But a source close to the sale confirmed: ‘It is the most iconic and important item ever connected to the Titanic to come up for sale. Leading Titanic memorabilia auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son have so far spent many thousands of pounds to prove it was Hartley's violin . ‘We are talking about high six figures. There will be worldwide interest. All the tests have proved its authenticity so far. There is just one final test left and the results are due in early March. If that confirms the authenticity then it will be sold. ‘The auctioneers have been thoroughly professional and painstaking over this. They have been on the case for seven years.’ Auctioneer Henry Aldridge said previously: ‘When I first saw it five years ago I was amazed. If I did not think that the probability was there I would not have bothered. ‘The research is expensive business . but because of the historical importance of this item the money is . secondary. We cannot rush the scientists.’ During . his research for The Band That Played On, a book that tells the story . of all eight of the Titanic's musicians, top British author Steve Turner . came across a collection of photographs purporting to show the violin, a . leather case, and various sheets of music. He said: ‘I was suspicious at first . but when I looked closely I could only conclude that this was the real . thing or the result of an extremely elaborate and well informed hoax. ‘I . am convinced that it is genuine and impressed by the scope of the . scientific and historical tests that have already taken place. ‘I can’t imagine anything more valuable connected to the Titanic.’ Hartley's fiance Miss Robinson moved to the Yorkshire seaside resort of Bridlington after his death but never married. She died alone in 1939. Among . the supporting evidence that she retrieved the violin after his death . is a 1912 diary where she had apparently drafted a letter to the . authorities in Nova Scotia thanking them for acceding to her wish to . have the violin sent to her. The . draft letter in her diary reads: ‘I would be most grateful if you could . convey my heartfelt thanks to all who have made possible the return of . my late fiance’s violin. May I take this opportunity to express my . appreciation to you personally for your gracious intervention on my . behalf.’ Mr Turner said: . ‘When I checked the name of the provincial secretary for Nova Scotia it . corresponded with what was written in the diary although Robinson had . written F. Walthers instead of F. Mathers. The band played on: The band play on as the Titanic begins to sink in a scene from James Cameron's 1997 film version. All eight band members perished . ‘The most convincing thing about the violin, which was in a brown leather case with the initials W. H. H stamped on it, was the inscription on the tail-piece. It said: “For Wallace on the occasion of our engagement from Maria”. ‘This seemed not only to explain why she wanted it back so badly, and why it didn't automatically go to Hartley's parents, but perhaps why Hartley kept it with him in the water.’ Mr Turner also points out that the ink letters that were found on Hartley were near perfect and had not been affected by the sea. He said: ‘Because the violin was a gift from Maria to Wallace on their engagement it makes sense that she was the rightful heir rather than Hartley's parents. ‘I wonder whether Hartley clung on to it so tightly because it was a gift from his wife-to-be. Otherwise he might just have let it go. ‘If this turns out to be what everyone involved hopes and believes it is, I think it will; be the most expensive Titanic artefact ever offered for sale. It was not only once on the Titanic but it played a key role in the story. On top of that, it symbolises the love of two people.’","Wallace Hartley's violin, if proved authentic, will be auctioned on April 20 .

A government official who sparked outrage by marrying a child bride could be sacked after divorcing her by text message four days into their marriage. Aceng Fikri, 40, chief of Garut district in West Java province, Indonesia, was already married with two children when he wed the young girl. In another case that highlights attitudes towards women's rights in the Southeast Asian country, a judge joked during a supreme court job interview that women might enjoying being raped. Outcry: Indonesian official Aceng Fikri divorced his child bride by text message four days after their wedding . But both officials are now at risk of losing their jobs, which has been seen as a small step forward by campaigners. The supreme court has . recommended the president dismiss Fikri for violating the marriage . law, and police are investigating the case because it involves a minor. The country's judicial commission has also . called for Judge Muhammad Daming Sunusiat to be sacked for his comments about rape. Unregistered polygamous marriages, such as Fikri's, are common in the  archipelago. Although divorce by text message is rare, it is allowed under Islamic sharia law. His ex-wife Fani Oktarahas, who was the legal age of 16 when she married him, denied his claims that she was not a virgin. A photo of the wedding last summer was posted on the internet and caused a public outcry in the local media and on Twitter, blogs and Facebook. . Divorce: Fani Oktarahas was just 16 when she married Fikri and has denied his claims that she was not a virgin . Thousands of people took to the . streets in December to protest, with student and women's rights activists demanding he resign. Protesters trampled and spat on photos of his . face before setting them ablaze outside the council building in Garut. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono . responded by issuing a rare public condemnation of the 40-year-old . official and his illegal marriage. There has also been anger last month over the comments made by Judge Muhammad Daming Sunusiat at a parliamentary selection panel for a supreme court position. Anger: Judge Muhammad Daming joked during a supreme court job interview that woman 'might enjoy' being raped . He said it could be a mistake to impose the death penalty for rape because both the attacker and the victim 'might have enjoyed' it. The remark reportedly drew laughter from panel members. Sunusi later apologised and said he had been joking. Not only was Sunusi rejected for the . job, but the country's Judicial Commission recommended that he be dismissed from his position on the South Sumatra high court. But the supreme court would have to . agree, and it has said such punishment would be too severe because he . made the remark in an interview, not during a trial. Husein Muhammad,of . the commission on violence against women, said: 'Enough is enough! 'Our officials should no . longer mess around and issue ridiculous statements even as a dumb joke.' Women in the social-media-obsessed country have been rallying, online and on the streets, against sexists comments and attacks on women for some time. The movement in a country of 240 million people, most of whom practice a moderate form of Islam, appears to be having some impact on the largely secular government. Husein Muhammad added: 'We are living in a different era now. Now we have supporting laws and social media to bring severe . consequences and social sanctions.' But rights groups argue the country remains far behind on many issues involving gender equality and violence. Rape cases often are not properly investigated, and victims are sometimes blamed. In 2011, after a woman was gang raped on a minibus, then-Jakarta governor Fauzi Bowo drew protests after warning women not to wear miniskirts on public transportation because it could arouse male passengers. Bowo lost his re-election bid last year. A sex-trafficking case involving a 14-year-old girl prompted education minister Mohammad Nuh to say last year that not all girls who report such crimes are victims. He said: 'They do it for fun, and then the girl alleges that it's rape.' His response to the criticism he received was that it's difficult to prove whether sexual assault allegations are 'real rapes.' Changing views: The fact both officials are at risk of losing their jobs shows a change in attitudes in Indonesia . Growing concern in Indonesia over women's rights reflects that in India, where a brutal and deadly New Delhi gang rape in December has drawn nationwide protests and demands for change. That case also resonated in Indonesia. 'Let's imagine the suffering of women who are treated badly by their husbands and the rape victims. What if it happened to our own families?' said Ellin Rozana, a women's rights activist in Bandung, capital of West Java province. 'We need government officials who will be on the front line to protect women, and judges who can see that violence against women is a serious crime.' In the West Java official's case, it was the text-message divorce that prompted outrage more than his unregistered second marriage, though such weddings raise issues about women's rights. They are regularly performed for Indonesians ranging from poor rice farmers to celebrities, politicians and Muslim clerics. Polygamy remains common in many Muslim countries, based on Islamic teachings that allow men to take up to four wives. In Indonesia, men are allowed to marry a second wife only after the first gives her blessing. Since most women refuse to agree to share their husbands, unregistered ceremonies, or 'nikah siri,' are often secretly carried out by an Islamic cleric outside the law. Women's rights: Protesters in Garut, West Java, demanded in December that Fikri is sacked over the divorce . Some of the marriages are simply a cover for prostitution. A cleric is paid to conduct 'contract marriages' as short as one night in some parts of Indonesia, usually for Middle Eastern tourists. Practices differ slightly elsewhere, with men in places such as Malaysia sometimes marrying outside the country to avoid informing existing spouses and seeking permission from an Islamic court. Ceremonies in Iraq are often held in secret for the same reason. No approval is needed in the Palestinian territories, but contract marriages are banned. Without a marriage certificate, wives lack legal rights. Children from the marriage are often considered illegitimate and are typically not issued birth certificates, creating a lifetime of obstacles ranging from attending schools to getting a passport. However, in another sign of Indonesia's changing attitudes, the supreme court this month ordered all judges to obey an earlier constitutional court ruling granting rights such as inheritance to children born out of wedlock, and to punish fathers who neglect them. The women's commission on violence is now pushing for a revision of Indonesia's 1974 marriage law to grant more protections to women and children. 'I hope Indonesian women can take a lesson from Fikri's case,' said Ninik Rahayu of the commission. 'At least it has awakened their awareness to not marry in an illegal way.'","The fact both could be fired shows attitudes to women's rights are changing .

Photographer and retired NYPD detective G.N. Miller got into the altercation with Baldwin as he staked out the actor's Manhattan home following news that his wife is being sued by a yoga student. Following the spat, the police were called and Miller, 56, and Baldwin, 54, both filed harassment claims against each other. The 30 Rock star allegedly called . Miller, who is black, a racial epithet, a 'coon', 'a drug dealer', a . 'crackhead' and made disparaging remarks about his mother, according to . Miller's police statement. Low profile: Alec Baldwin keeps his head down while out in Manhattan the day after police were called after he allegedly unleashed a racist rant on a newspaper photographer outside his home . Keeping quiet: Baldwin claimed that he was the victim of harassment and had been assaulted by the man . He also told the photographer to . 'suck my d***' as pedestrians walked past, and when Miller showed him ID . to prove he was a retired police officer, Baldwin branded it 'fake', . Miller said. 'He was saying some serious racist . stuff,' Miller told the New York Post. 'He could have said a lot of other stuff. But he used all of the stereotypes associated with black people.' Before . the altercation on Sunday morning, Baldwin had been approached by a New . York Post reporter and was asked for a comment about the lawsuit . against his wife, Hilaria. The Post claims that Baldwin then grabbed the female reporter by her arm and said: 'I want you to choke to death.' Accused: Alec Baldwin got into an altercation with a photographer who was staking out the actor's home after his yoga teacher wife Hilaria was accused of failing to properly oversee a class . Scene: Baldwin allegedly directed racial slurs at the photographer outside his East Village home, pictured . She allegedly recorded the comment and played it to police. But Baldwin took to Twitter to share his side of the story, referring to the photographer as 'Ralston'. 'Moments after I tweet about the Post, . Ralston, the ex-crackhead ""photographer"" shows up at my door w 1 of . Murdoch's nieces in tow,' he wrote, in a tweet that has now been deleted. 'Ralston claims he's ex NYPD!! That can't be!!!

In other tweets, that still remain on his page, he added: 'Thank u 2 NYPD officers who came to my . home 2day so that I could file a formal complaint against NY Post ""photographer"" who assaulted me.' Anger: Baldwin disputed the claims on his Twitter account, and thanked the NYPD for intervening . Defense: He noted he had given money to a foundation in the legacy of Arthur Ashe - a black tennis player . Sticking up for her man: Hilaria Baldwin also used Twitter to attack the media and defend her husband . In his own complaint, Baldwin told police that the photographer 'pushed into him' and asked him to keep his distance, but Miller said it was the actor who bumped him in the chest, the Post reported. Through his spokesperson, Baldwin . responded to accusations of racist remarks, saying: 'That's one of the . most outrageous things I've heard in my life.' Neither of the complaints will go any further, except in possible civil action, the Post reported. It is not the first time Baldwin has got into a spat with a photographer. In June, the New York Daily News captured the actor shoving one of their photographers after he picked up his marriage license. The altercation with Miller came after a distraught New Yorker filed a suit against Baldwin's wife, claiming he endured harsh conditions during a yoga class she conducted. Not the first time: Baldwin, pictured right in New York, has a tempestuous history with photographers . Lashing out: He is also pictured pushing away a videographer, left, and photographers, right, in New York City after they approached him about his relationship with a woman accused of stalking him .

The lawsuit does not specify exactly how Wolff was injured. But he does cite the 'overcrowded' class and Ms Baldwin's 'negligence' as two of the causes of his alleged injuries. Ms Baldwin, 28, has been teaching yoga since 2005, according to Yoga Vida’s website. The couple married in June and Ms Baldwin is pregnant with their first child.

Social media giant Facebook has announced that several company computers were victims of a cyber attack that occurred sometime last month. ‘Our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack,’ read the statement dated February 15. Warning signs: Often accused of being loose with user data, Facebook recently announced it recently came under a 'sophisticated attack' The company says the infiltration occurred when ‘a handful of employees’ visited a website that, in turn, infected their laptops with security compromising malware. This, the statement says, despite the laptops being ‘fully-patched and running up-to-date anti-virus software.’ According to the statement, the compromised site installed software that bypassed internal security through a so-called ‘zero-day,’ or previously unseen, vulnerability and exploit the company’s built-in protections. Under investigation: Reports say Facebook knew about the attacks, which likely exploited a Java software flaw, well before the announcement . As reported by the New York Times on Friday, the security hole was a ‘well-publicized vulnerability in Oracle’s Java software.’ Facebook says they immediately quarantined the affected laptops and alerted authorities. ‘We have no evidence,’ the company stated on a blog post announcing the incident, ‘that Facebook user data was compromised in this attack.’ All atwitter: On Feb. 1, Twitter announced a breach and 250,000 of its users' data was potentially accessed . Weeks before the announcement, on February 1, Facebook was provided a patch for the software from Oracle, the makers of Java. That same day, ubiquitous microblogging site Twitter announced its security had been breached and 250,000 of its users’ data potentially accessed. Twitter then suggested that other companies had fallen victim to similar attacks. Today's Facebook’s announcement made similar claims. ‘Facebook was not alone in this attack,’ the statement read. ‘As one of the first companies to discover this . malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the . infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected.’ Dark forces: Twitter and Facebook have named not their attackers, but both have claimed that multiple organizations were similarly affected . Facebook, says a New York Times source close to the investigation, has known of the problem for at least a month. A Facebook spokesman says the company chose to wait longer than the companies it claims were also ‘attacked and infiltrated’ made their own announcements in order to fully investigate the origin of the breach along with authorities. Facebook’s announcement does not cite Twitter or what other specific companies were affected along with them. Nonetheless, the events come at a conspicuous time for high-profile cyber attacks. In late January, both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal announced they’re systems had been infiltrated by Chinese hackers in apparent attempts to monitor the outlets’ coverage of that country. Meanwhile, neither Facebook nor Twitter have suggested who might be responsible for their security breaches.","Official statement claims no user data was compromised, as far as they know .

Lynne Turner, 50, was jailed for nine months for stealing £28,000 to pay back loans from Wonga.com . A parish council clerk was in jail today after she got into deep debt and took out high interest cash loans with controversial Wonga.com. Mother-of-two Lynne Turner was in charge of the village’s finances so decided to help herself to the funds, moving £1,000 at a time into her own bank, a judge heard. As clerk to Hughenden Parish Council in Buckinghamshire, she had access to all the money in their bank and 'borrowed' at least £28,000 of taxpayer’s money to try to cope with her huge loan repayments. A judge told her on Friday that she had betrayed the trust placed in her by the council and the villagers and had to be sent to prison immediately. Judge Ian Pringle heard that Turner had amassed £90,000 worth of loan arrears, on top of her £380,000 mortgage. She had fallen into debt after building an extension on her home and had taken out numerous loans and credit cards, the hearing at Oxford Crown Court was told. The 50-year-old stole a total of £28,200 between August 2010 and May 2011 from the council where she had worked for 16 years. Turner was convicted by a jury on 10 counts of fraud. The jury took less than an hour to reach unanimous verdicts after a three-day trial last month. Prosecutor Jermone Silva told a hearing: 'The fraud comprised of some 31 transactions and involved two accounts, which belonged to the defendant and the account held by the Parish. 'Initially the transfers were of £300 pounds for the first two or three months. 'Those transactions then became transactions of £1,000 and they amounted to - in just under a year - a total of £28,200.' The fraud was uncovered when Turner resigned in June 2011 and her replacement, Charlotte Watts, noticed that six separate sums of £1,000 had been marked with 'correction.' At Oxford Crown Court Lynne Turner was sentenced to nine months in prison for stealing £28,000 . There was also £21,900 pounds that had been labelled 'cash in transit' on the council’s accounting system, a hearing has been told. 'She (Ms Watts) initially spoke to the defendant. She didn’t receive satisfactory answers and dug a bit deeper and contacted the bank in question,' said Mr Silva. 'She found that money had been transferred in this way by this defendant via internet banking into her (Turner’s) account. 'On closer inspection it also appears that this defendant had actively been working out her accounts because some of her workings, I understand, were on numbers on some of the documents, that were Tipexed out.' Turner, of High Wycombe, Bucks, transferred the first sum of £300 from the council’s account on August 28, 2010 after she had received £400 from high interest, short-term loan company Wonga.com. Dejan Mladenovic, defending, said: 'This defendant is 50 years of age and was of previous good character. 'That is something that weighs heavily in her favour.' The first sum was stolen by Lynne Turner after she took out a loan of £400 from high interest, short-term loan company Wonga.com . The barrister said a psychological report carried out by doctors showed his client had difficulty in coming to terms with her wrongdoing. He said: 'Mrs Turner has suffered from an adjustment disorder where she does seem to behave in a way, which is inextricably linked with her ability to acknowledge any wrong acts which she may have committed. He added: 'Mrs Turner does intend and does want to repay all the money that she took and defrauded the Parish Council. 'She will be in a position to start paying that back in six or seven months. Addressing the defendant, Judge Ian Pringle said: 'You are 50 years of age and have no previous convictions of any sort. 'Until 2010 Mrs Turner, it seems you worked hard all your life and brought up your family in what I’m sure was a commendable way. 'As a clerk of the Parish Council, you, in effect, were in charge of their finances. 'Many of the Parish councillors in the time you served there got to know you well and you were completely trusted by them. 'The plain fact of the matter is, Mrs Turner, that you abused that trust - the trust placed on you by the Parish Council and by all the residents of that Parish.'","Lynne Turner, 50, stole £28,000 of taxpayers money to repay £90,000 debts .

A mother who was left paralysed and unable to speak by a blood clot on her brain has learnt to walk and talk again - after copying her toddler daughter. Sam Furniss, 35, was given the life changing news that she had two aneurysms when her daughter Ella was just 10 months old. And her life hung in the balance when she suffered a massive bleed to the brain following an operation to remove them. Miracle recovery: Sam Furniss, left, recovered from a bleed on the brain which left her paralysed by learning to walk and talk again at the same time as her daughter Ella . Doctors warned devastated husband Michael, 36, that even if she did survive, Sam could be left with terrible brain damage. Though she survived, she was left unable to walk, talk or sit up. But two years on she has stunned doctors with her recovery - learning to walk and talk alongside her daughter. Sam, from Sheffield, said: 'I couldn't have recovered as well as I have without the support of Michael, and of course, Ella. 'I was so determined to get better to look after Ella - I wanted to run around with her in the park and be the best mum I could. 'I didn't want her to be running around while I was still stuck in my wheelchair - so it became a bit of a race to see which one of us would take our first steps. She added: 'Ella beat me by a week - but once we'd both mastered taking one step, we progressed together, one step at a time. 'She's actually slightly better than me now - she can stand on one leg, which I'll never be able to do. 'Ella is such a caring little girl, and wise beyond her years - I was lucky to have such a wonderful medical and nursing team both in hospital and after I was discharged at home.' Mother-of-one Sam was diagnosed with the aneurysm after suffering numbness in her right side while putting Ella to bed on New Year's Day 2010. Support: Sam, pictured with daughter Ella and husband Michael, was diagnosed with two aneurysms when Ella was just 10 months old . Long struggle: Sam is pictured recovering after surgery left her unable to walk, talk, or even sit up . She thought that she had suffered a stroke but later found it was her nerves were being affected by the mass of blood vessels growing on her brain. Although surgeons thought that surgery would solve the problem, they discovered that she had an extra bone in her skull that ruled out a successful operation. She was eventually admitted for surgery after 10 months of tests and 17 brain scans she was admitted in October 2010. Medics initially thought that the three-and-a-half hour operation had been a success. But her condition began to deteriorate and a specialist spotted a blood clot on her brain while examining her several days later. When the clot started to bleed she was rushed for more emergency surgery with doctors fearing she would die. Devastating: Mother-of-one Sam, pictured, left, with husband Michael, was diagnosed with the aneurysm after suffering numbness in her right side while putting Ella, centre, to bed on New Year's Day 2010 . Sam said: 'The surgeons took Michael to one side and told him I was very, very ill, and I might not pull through the surgery. 'They told him that if I survived, the chances were that I'd be seriously brain damaged, and they didn't know to what extent I would recover. 'He was obviously devastated, and now it hurts me so much to think of the pain he must have gone through, which I was totally unaware of. 'When I came round after the surgery, I couldn't move. I wanted to speak, and sit up and get out of bed, but I couldn't move. 'I was terrified and frustrated - and I didn't know whether I would ever be able to walk or talk again. 'The nurses would come to me every day and hold up a pen and ask me if I knew what it was. 'In my head, I was screaming the word ""pen"", but it wouldn't come out of my mouth. 'I practised and practised while I was lying there by myself, and after two weeks, I was able to say it. 'It took a long time before I was able to speak coherently, and in long sentences, though. 'When Ella said her first word in March 2011, we were suddenly both trying to talk all the time, with our speech eventually getting more and more sophisticated at the same pace. 'She took her first step in May 2011, and I took mine two weeks later in June. However, it took months before I was able to walk long distances - and when we both got tired of walking, we both had a sit down in my wheelchair together. Sam underwent tests in December and doctors say that her body has made an 85 per cent recovery. She said: 'I sometimes get a bit tired if I've been on my feet all day, but Ella is always there to look after me. I don't know what I would have done without her. 'I have thrown myself into fundraising for my own charity, the Samira Furniss Charity Fund, and Headway, which helps support people who have suffered brain or head injuries. 'Two years ago, I didn't know if I'd ever be able to sit up and give my daughter a cuddle - I'm so happy we can run around and play together now.' Learning: While the pair were learning to walk, both Sam, left, and Ella, right, would rest by sitting together in Sam's wheelchair .","Sam Furniss was diagnosed with two aneurysms in early 2010 .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 21:03 EST, 15 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:04 EST, 15 February 2013 . Labour is looking at proposals to hit taxpayers with a £250 tax rise – the equivalent of adding 2p to the basic rate of income tax – if it wins the next election in 2015. The party’s equalities spokesman Kate Green revealed that it could reject George Osborne’s austerity plan – which is three parts cuts to one part tax increases – in favour of a 50-50 split, which would send taxes soaring. Miss Green said: ‘The choices are about how you allocate the spending cuts and tax increases and I think that is seriously unbalanced under this Government.’ Asked about Labour’s plans, she said ‘plenty of proposals’ were being looked at but indicated a 50-50 split would be fairer. Labour is still officially committed to plans drawn up by former chancellor Alistair Darling which would call for £67billion of savings in 2014-15. A 50-50 split would mean tax rises of £33.5billion. Labour's equalities spokesman Kate Green revealed the party could reject Chancellor George Osborne's, left, austerity plan - three parts cuts to one part tax increases - in favour of a 50-50 split. The insight into Labour's private came as Ed Miliband vowed to force a Commons vote on plans to introduce a mansion tax . By contrast, the Coalition’s plan would see £26billion coming from tax rises. That means Labour could increase the tax bill in 2014-15 by £7.5billion, and increase borrowing by £39billion to cover the difference in spending plans. A Labour source said: ‘We will not make tax and spending commitments for the next Parliament until our manifesto.’ Details of Labour’s private thinking were laid bare as Ed Miliband vowed to force a vote in the Commons on his plans to introduce a mansion tax. The Labour leader announced on Thursday that he would bring in a 1 per cent levy on properties worth more than £2million - a policy pioneered by the Liberal Democrats - to pay for a return of the 10p income tax rate. In a bid to split the coalition, Mr Miliband will hold a vote in the Commons before next month’s Budget calling on the Lib Dems to back the plans in defiance of the Tories. Labour wants a debate in opposition time but if they don’t get it they will seek to amend the government’s Finance Bill. Mr Miliband will unveil his plans as he campaigns in the Eastleigh by-election today. He will say: ‘We will force a vote in the House of Commons on the mansion tax in the coming weeks. 'We know the Conservatives oppose this measure, even though it would only affect a small number of houses worth over £2million. ‘There could be a majority in the House of Commons when it votes on our proposal but only if the Liberal Democrats vote with Labour. 'Now the Lib Dems say they are in favour of a mansion tax. Here is a chance for Nick Clegg to prove he can keep at least one of his promises.’ The 10p tax pledge was Labour’s first major economic policy announcement but Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has refused to say what mix of tax rises and cuts he would use to tackle Britain’s debts, let alone what the overall spending total would be under Labour. Chancellor George Osborne’s austerity measures have meant that for every pound of savings made by the coalition around 25p has come from tax rises and 75p from reductions in government spending. Miss Green cited former Prime Minister John Major in her Radio 5 Live interview as using a 50-50 basis to recover from the 1990s crash . But Labour’s Equality spokeswoman Kate Green denounced that policy as ‘seriously unbalanced’ and indicated that a 50-50 split would be fairer. In an unnoticed interview with Radio 5 Live, Miss Green cited former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major in arguing for a different mix. ‘When John Major was trying to adjust after the 1990s crash he did it on a 50-50 basis. This is about public policy choices’. Asked whether that is secretly Labour’s policy, she did not deny that a radically different policy is being drawn up. ‘There are plenty of proposals,’ she said. Chancellor George Osborne came under pressure from Tory backbenchers to abolish Air Passenger Duty and slash business taxes again in the Budget. Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘Scrapping this unproductive tax would boost inward tourism as well as helping British people afford a holiday - but most importantly, we could expect an immediate year one economic boost of nearly 0.5 per cent of GDP.’ A Labour source said: ‘We have never said what split we would have between cuts and taxes. We’re not getting into what we would do in 2015 at this stage. The important thing is to get jobs and growth.’",Labour's equalities spokesman Kate Green reveals plan to Radio 5 Live .

David Cameron has said he is ‘disturbed’ that Muslims were forced to abandon plans for a mosque in his constituency because racists threatened to burn it down. Islamic leaders were given the go-ahead to build a mosque in an empty shop in Chipping Norton, within Mr Cameron’s Witney constituency. The mosque would accommodate 40 worshippers. But the shop’s landlord, George Wissinter, received threats within hours of the council granting planning permission. He was told by an anonymous caller that his shop would be burned down if the mosque went ahead. Mr Wissinter, 79, said he had also encountered strong verbal opposition from locals. Mr Cameron said: ‘I am greatly disturbed to learn of threats being made in Chipping Norton following the District Council’s decision to grant permission for a prayer room for the Muslim community. ‘Chipping Norton has an excellent record of supporting the rights of minority groups [...] and I sincerely hope that this will continue.’ Tory councillor Tahirul Hasan, who has campaigned for the mosque for seven years, said he hoped to meet with the Prime Minister to discuss the issue. The councillor said: ‘I have to travel 14 miles to Banbury to pray. This is why we need a mosque in Chipping Norton.’ On Friday, Mr Hasan met with Thames Valley Police, who are investigating the arson threat.
