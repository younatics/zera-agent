"Television presenter Lorraine Kelly has called the police over diet pill adverts which use her before and after weight-loss images without her permission to promote the product. The Scottish star, 55, has alerted police to the advertisements for raspberry ketone pills and tea, which feature photographs of her and fraudulently claim she used the products to lose weight. It is claimed raspberry ketone capsules and herbal tea are used to quicken the metabolism, which results in weight loss. Scottish television presenter Lorraine Kelly, 55, revealed she has called the police over diet pill adverts which are using her before and after weight-loss images (above) without her permission to promote the product . The 55-year-old took to her Twitter page today to confirm she had informed the police of the advertisements . The mother of one took to her Twitter page today to warn fans that she did not give her permission for the weight-loss photographs to be used, nor did she endorse the products. The morning television presenter told her 504,000 followers: 'I'm extremely angry that a bogus company is using my image to promote their weight loss ""ketone"" tea. It's being going on for months. 'I've informed the police. PLEASE do not fall for this! I lost weight by eating sensibly and doing 2 classes a week with @MaxZumbaQueen.' Her spokesman added: ‘Lorraine is extremely angry that her name and image are being used in this way and that women are being duped into spending their money. 'She believes the only way to lose weight and keep it off is through exercise and eating healthily.’ It is believed the adverts have been generated by a bogus company to dupe people into parting with their credit card details. It is believed that the customers do not receive the pills once they have paid the money for the bogus product. They first appeared in June last year and Lorraine threatened to take legal action in January when they continued to appear online. It was unclear tonight which police force in the country the television presenter reported the issue to. It is also unclear which company is behind the adverts. However, Gerard Cukier, a partner specialising in media law at Kingsley Napley, said he could understand why the television presenter had gone to police, if the advertisements were being produced by a bogus company. Mr Cukier said: ‘If it is the case that it is a bogus company that is responsible for these advertisements, and some form of fraud has been committed, then one can understand why Miss Kelly has gone to the criminal authorities to seek to put a stop to these harmful activities.’ He said that if the company was a legitimate trading firm then it could still face civil and criminal proceedings under English law. He said: ‘On a civil side, the fact they have used her name to suggest she has endorsed their product - her name, image and reputation - that constitutes false endorsement and passing off which would entitle her to bring proceedings, to stop them using her name and image in this way, and for damages. ‘If Lorraine Kelly has a registered trademark in her name, then it is possible that a criminal offence may have been committed under the Trade Marks Act 1994, and if that is the case there are criminal penalties for unauthorised use of trademark under the act.' The television star said she was 'extremely angry' about the adverts and said she lost weight by eating well . Television presenter Fern Britton has previously been forced to deny using diet pills after being linked to a scam advertising campaign for a weight-loss supplement. She lost weight through gastric band surgery . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which is responsible for making sure UK adverts are responsible and not misleading, said using a person's image in an advert without their permission was 'likely to be a problem under the advertising code'. Regulations imposed by the ASA warn that companies using endorsements in advertising must 'hold documentary evidence that a testimonial or endorsement used in a marketing communication is genuine’. With Kelly denying any involvement with ketone products, it appears the advertisements using her photographs have breached the code. However, an ASA spokesman said that the issue 'appears to go beyond our role and remit.' The spokesman said: 'We’re aware of several bogus operators, often based abroad and outside our jurisdiction, who peddle Ketone products. 'We regulate the advertising of legitimate UK companies, we’re not a statutory or law enforcement body. 'In this instance, it looks like a legal issue surrounding image rights/copyright and a problem best tackled through appropriate legal channels.' The TV personality was also caught up in a similar situation last year when several companies selling raspberry ketone tablets stated that she, along with the Duchess of Cambridge, Victoria Beckham and Adele, had used their product to lose weight. The companies all issued their adverts through Facebook. Images of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have been used by  the so-called Raspberry Ketone diet . Popstar Adele (left) and Victoria Beckham (right) have both previously had images used in scam advert . At the time, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that the adverts were misleading and upheld complaints which had been made. The adverts were subsequently banned from appearing on the internet. Television presenter Fern Britton was also forced to deny using diet pills after being linked to a scam advertising campaign for a weight-loss supplement. The 56-year-old rubbished the claims via Twitter saying she had never used raspberry ketone capsules, and warned: It's a scam! Not me!' The adverts featuring the TV star included the words: 'Fern proves critics wrong. Drops 22st without cheating – no weird exercise or ugly diets!' It also featured a photograph of her face, despite the former This Morning presenter having not given her consent to be linked with the product. People who attempted to purchase the pills became locked into costly monthly contracts that they struggled to get out of after handing over their bank details or end up paying for goods that do not arrive.","TV star has called police over adverts using her images without permission .

"The PM, pictured today in New York, has announced Parliament is to be recalled for an emergency vote on Britain joining airstrikes in Iraq . David Cameron tonight announced Parliament is to be recalled on Friday for an emergency vote on Britain joining airstrikes against ISIS militants in Iraq. The Prime Minister is in New York where he today held historic talks with the Iranian President to build a global alliance aimed at driving the murderous militants out of Iraq. MPs have been summoned to Westminster to endorse sending the RAF to join the effort in finding and destroying ISIS bases as soon as Saturday. But ministers are at pains to stress the move will not involve British boots on the ground. Mr Cameron hopes to secure cross-party backing for military involvement in Iraq, more than a decade after Tony Blair’s deeply unpopular invasion to topple Saddam Hussein. Downing Street stresses there are no plans to have boots on the ground, and the decision comes after a formal request for help from the Iraqi government. The move tonight comes after growing pressure on Mr Cameron to act against ISIS which has beheaded three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning. However Mr Henning's brother-in-law Colin Livesey last night appealed for air strikes to be called off, arguing that the raids would reduce the chance of him being released alive. In a statement Mr Cameron tonight said: 'I have requested that Parliament be recalled to debate the UK response to the Iraqi government's request for support against Isil. 'The Speaker has accepted my request to recall Parliament on Friday.' Mr Cameron has stressed that the British government will not act without the request of the Iraqi government. There are no plans to carry out air strikes in Syria, where no agreement has been reached with the Assad regime. Mr Cameron was humiliated a year ago when he lost a Commons vote on military action to support rebels seeking to overthrow Assad. Number 10 has deliberately taken its time in building consensus on military action. Mr Cameron will open the debate on Friday morning, and his deputy Lib Dem Nick Clegg will close it before the vote. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron met with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani today at the UN headquarters in a bid to persuade the leader to join international efforts in the fight against ISIS militants . The Iranian leader tweeted a photo of the meeting with Mr Cameron during the 69th session of the UN General Assembly . Tonight Mr Clegg said: 'When this issue is debated and voted on in parliament on Friday, the Liberal Democrats will support the airstrikes in Iraq for the following reasons: firstly because it is legal, it’s been requested by the Iraqi government to help them rid themselves of the threat of ISIL. 'Secondly it’s part of a much bigger coalition, a whole array of countries crucially including a number of Arab countries which deprives ISIL of the ability to somehow portray it as a West versus the rest crusade. Nick Clegg said the Liberal Democrats will support military intervention . 'Thirdly it will not now nor in the future involve British combat forces on the ground. 'And fourthly because the decision will only be taken after a debate and a vote in the House of Commons, not just by the Government – on behalf of the country as a whole. 'I think there are many people across the country who see what this medieval murderous organisation does, slaughtering people regardless of their ethnicity or their religion; an organisation which is actively plotting to do us harm in this country. 'I think most people across the country want the British Government to play our part in ridding the world of this vile threat.' Mr Cameron is expected to chair a meeting of the Cabinet tomorrow at 1pm. Labour leader Ed Miliband convened a meeting of his shadow cabinet at his party conference in Manchester to agree its position. He said: 'We cannot turn away from the threat of ISIL which is a murderous organisation, has taken British hostages, threatens the stability of the region and is therefore a threat to the UK's national interest. 'That is why we will be supporting the Government's proposal for UK airstrikes in Iraq against ISIL. 'I want to reassure people there is no question of committing UK ground troops. There is an alliance which includes countries in the region. 'We will learn the lessons of the past - but we will not turn away from threats to our national interest.' Iraqi Premier Haider Abadi made the formal request for help in a meeting with Mr Cameron this afternoon, giving him the legal cover he believes is needed to go ahead. Interviewed last night on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the IS group posed a direct threat to Britain. Aerial warfare: British Tornado bombers could be hitting ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq this weekend. File picture . The guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in the Arabian Gulf yesterday . 'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.' Britain has six RAF Tornado fighter-bombers based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus armed with fearsome Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs which can fly within minutes. More than 130 jihadists were killed in Monday's US-led attacks focused on the ISIL stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. The decision to return to military action in Iraq comes three years after troops British troops left the war-torn country. Mr Cameron - who is desperate to avoid a repeat of last year's damaging Commons defeat over air strikes against Syria - said he was confident he would get the support of the House ""on an all-party basis"". 'What we are doing is legal, it is right, it does not involve British troops on the ground,' he said. Syrian children hold up debris as they check a damaged house, reportedly hit by U.S.-led coalition air strikes, in the village of Kfar Derian in the western Aleppo province . 'As ever with our country, when we are threatened in this way we should not turn away from what needs to be done.' A separate debate and vote would need to be held before any action was taken in Syria. Earlier Mr Cameron held an extraordinary meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani to seek help in defeating ISIS militants. The PM declared ’a little bit of history made’ after emerging from the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy. Mr Cameron has made clear that a global alliance is needed to tackle the rise of ISIS. As the talks got underway, Mr Rouhani tweeted a photograph with a message urging 'constructive engagement'. In a major development, the US told Iran of its plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to reassure them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be targetted. The communication appears to signal a cooling in hostilities between the US and Iran for the first time since a 1979 hostage crisis prompted Washington to sever ties with Tehran. Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of Assad, who remains the Shia Islam-dominated nation's closest regional ally and the recipient of Iranian military support during a Syrian Civil War. Mr Cameron will use a speech to the UN General Assembly tonight to set out his reasons for joining a coalition of more than 40 nations, including the US, France and Arab states. He will echo US president Barack Obama’s call for the world to come together to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and ’dismantle this network of death’. Speaking to the General Assembly this afternoon, Mr Obama said that ISIS understood only 'the language of force' and called on those who have joined up to fight with the group to ’leave the battlefield while they can’. The president condemned atrocities against women and religious minorities in ISIS-controlled areas and described the beheading of hostages including British aid worker David Haines as ’the most horrific crimes imaginable’ He added: 'No God condones this terror. No grievance justifies these actions. 'There can be no reasoning - no negotiation - with this brand of evil.' He added: 'The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force. So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.' Mr Obama said the US would not send troops to ’occupy foreign lands’, but will 'support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities'. He added: 'Today, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who have joined Isil should leave the battlefield while they can. 'Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats; and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build - not those who destroy.'","MPs have been summoned to endorse sending RAF to Iraq by Saturday .

"A woman's body has been discovered stuffed inside a refrigerator in a Houston apartment and now police are searching for her missing infant son and the baby's father. According to investigators, a foul odor led a maintenance worker to a second-floor unit at the Braeswood Oaks apartment complex on Fondren Road at around 2.30pm Monday. The woman, identified late Tuesday afternoon as 27-year-old Anastacia Oakihena-Lambert, had not been seen in a week. Scroll down for video . The body of Anastacia Oakihena-Lambert, left, was found crammed inside the refrigerator of a Houston apartment on Monday. She had been stabbed to death.

Shocking find: A maintenance worker found a woman's body inside a foul-smelling apartment at the Braeswood Oaks apartment complex on Fondren Road in Houston Monday . On November 20, the city’s electrical company cut power to the unit over a late payment, but the apartment was still occupied and the family have not been facing eviction, reported the Houston Chronicle. Investigators are not sure at this time how long the body had been in the fridge. According to the news station Click2Houston, which was the first to name the victim, Mrs Oakihena-Lambert was stabbed to death. There is also no word on a possible motive behind the killing. Police say Oakihena-Lambert, a native of West Africa, had been living at the address on Fondren Street with her husband and baby son since June. Mystery: The woman had not been seen in a week, and on November 20 the electrical company turned off the power at the unit over a delayed payment . Writing on a social media page earlier this year, Mrs Oakihena-Lambert described herself as a computer programmer who had recently moved from Hawaii to Houston. 'Married and blessed with a beautiful son,' the 27-year-old wrote. Detectives have now named the woman's missing spouse, 38-year-old Patrick Lambert, a person of interest in connection to the death. They have also issued an Amber Alert for her 11-month-old son, Achilles Lambert, who is believed to be with his father. They say the toddler, who turns one next month, may be in danger.

"A woman is fighting for life after being hit by a police car on a 999 call which friends claim was not using its siren. Laura McEwan was out celebrating her 33rd birthday with pals when the accident happened as she walked along a busy road. She was rushed to hospital with life-threatening head injuries and more than a week later remains in intensive care in a critical condition. Laura McEwan was struck by a police car as she celebrated her 33rd birthday in Bristol late last month . Friends claimed that this police car, pictured, was not using its siren at the time of the incident . Ms McEwan is currently being treated in Southmead Hospital in Bristol where she is in a 'critical condition' The accident in the Stokes Croft inner city area of Bristol is now being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. One of Laura's distraught friends, who has given evidence to the IPCC, said she didn't hear any sirens before the marked police Ford Focus hit her. The friend, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was out with her in Stokes Croft that night. It was terrible. 'One minute we were celebrating her birthday, the next the road was closed off and Laura was in an ambulance. 'I've given evidence to the IPCC. 'I saw a number of police cars speeding up the road with their blue lights on, but I didn't hear any sirens. Not one.' The crash around 10pm on Saturday November 29 happened as a number of police vehicles responded to reports of a man making threats with a knife. A man was later arrested on suspicion of assault and a knife was seized. The road near the accident was closed after the collision as a detailed examination of the scene took place. Ms McEwan, who is believed to be originally from Wales, is being treated in Bristol's Southmead Hospital but her friend claimed she has been denied access. The accident happened at the junction of Nine Tree Hill and Cheltenham Road in Bristol on November 29 . She said: 'What concerns me the most is that Laura's friends are her family and we can't get into the hospital to see her. 'We're all distraught. She's lying there in a critical condition and we're all feeling totally helpless.' The IPCC said: 'The 33-year-old woman involved in the road traffic collision on November 29 is still in a critical condition. 'The witness appeal has been successful with several people contacting the witness appeal line over the phone and email. Several witness statements have been set up. 'We are investigating all elements of the incident.' A police spokesman confirmed Ms McEwan was in a life-threatening condition, but both Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Southmead Hospital refused to comment on visiting access. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said they were still investigating all aspects of the incident and wanted any further eyewitnesses to come forward. It is understood that investigators will try and determine whether the squad car was using its emergency sirens and lights at the time of the collision. Ms McEwan is a past pupil of King Henry VIII School in Abergavenny, Wales, and worked in internal communications with Lloyds Bank before taking up a job at the University of Bath. Following the crash, IPCC investigators visited the crash site and handed out letters appealing for any information. IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'There will have been a number of people enjoying a Saturday night out in the vicinity of where the collision happened, and we would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward and assist our investigation. 'Our investigation is at an early stage and my thoughts are with the woman and her family at this difficult time.' Following the collision Avon and Somerset police said the police car which hit Laura was 'on an emergency blue light run'. A spokesperson for the force said: 'Because a police vehicle has been involved, the force's professional standards department have been advised. 'The incident has also been referred to the IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission). 'We are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the area at the time who may have information to help our investigation.'","Laura McEwan was struck by a police car in Bristol on November 29 .

"Two Australian writers have been praised for donating prize money they received from Prime Minister Tony Abbott to organisations that have been left short by recent government policies. Mr Abbott handed out a total of $600,000 at the Prime Minister's Literary Awards, the country's richest prize for writers in a range of categories. Richard Flanagan, the co-winner of the fiction award for his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North, accepted the prize from Mr Abbott - then promptly announced he would be giving the $40,000 to the Indigenous Literacy Foundation. The organisation, which supplies new books and funds literacy projects in remote Indigenous communities, is one of many programs that will be affected by the $534 million the government has announced it will cut from Indigenous programs over the next five years. Scroll down for video . Richard Flanagan (right), was co-winner of the Prime Minister's Literary Prize for fiction for his novel The Narrow Road to the Deep North, and immediately announced he would donate his $40,000 in prize money to the Indigenous Literacy Foundation . In a second wave of irony and a double-whammy for Mr Abbott, the winner in the children's writing category, Bob Graham, announced he would donate $10,000 of his prize money to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. A well-known controversial topic for the Coalition government which promised to 'stop the boats', the ASRC is currently lobbying against the government's new migration laws which it claims neglects more than 150 asylum seeking children in detention at Nauru. The indirect slights came after a tough week for Mr Abbott and his government, who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions. In his acceptance speech, Mr Flanagan, who has said previously the Abbott government's environmental policies made him 'ashamed to be an Australian', said 'the measure of any civilised society was its willingness to look after its weakest'. 'Money is like sh**, my father used to say. Pile it up and it stinks. Spread it around and you can grow things,' Mr Flanagan said, according to the ABC. Children's writer Bob Graham (second from right) donated $10,000 of the prize money he was awarded for his book Silver Buttons to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. Pictured: The Prime Minister poses with all of the Prime Minister's Literary awards winners . The past week has been a tough one for Mr Abbott and his government, who have been scrutinised on talk shows and voting polls over their policies and actions . 'If just one of those children in turn becomes a writer, if just one brings to Australia and to the world an idea of the universe that arises out of that glorious lineage of 60,000 years of Australian civilisation, then I will think this prize has rewarded not just me, but us all,' he said. Mr Graham's speech about his book's character, also appeared to include a hint of irony when taking into account the presenter of his award. 'I like to think that after the book is closed that he will grow into a man who will have empathy and understanding and compassion for what he sees out there,' he said before announcing where his prize money would be directed. The two authors have been commended across social media for their generous donations, with many people being quick to point out the irony.

One meme being circulated depicting Bob Graham said: 'That awkward moment when the asylum seeker persecuting PM gives you a literary award and you donate 10K to the asylum seeker resource centre'. Meanwhile the ASRC also took to Twitter to tell Tony Abbott: 'You could learn from this, PM'. The executive director for the Indigenous Literacy Foundation, Karen Williams, also told Daily Mail Australia that she hoped Mr Flannigan's example would one day would be followed by Australia's leaders. Meanwhile the ASRC also took to Twitter to tell Tony Abbott 'You could learn from this, PM' 'Ironically we don't receive any government funding so we're not affected [by government funding cuts] as of yet, but we are started to see the impact of cut backs because more communities are approaching us about our programs,' Ms Williams said.

"It looks like it started off with a curious critter hoping to make a friend and play in the snow, but as these pictures show, the the invitation was harshly rejected. These two voles were captured fighting tooth and nail, tumbling through the ice and snow with their claws at the ready. It appears one of the voles did not take lightly to the other entering its territory on Hokkaido Island, Japan, and a fight ensued. Tooth and claw: These two voles ended up locked in a fierce battle after starting a squabble in the snow . They're even cute when they're angry! As hard as you try to find them scary, it's impossible . Furry fury: The bigger vole appears to scream in pain, as the smaller one bites down on its back, taking friendship (and snowmen) firmly off the cards . Unwilling to share its space, the enraged rodents were then seen tumbling in the frozen fields of Hokkaido Island. Japanese wildlife photographer Masasugu Ohasi,  cape upon the altercation whilst out on a walk near his house on the island. Despite being known for their timid nature, the voles paid no attention to Masasugu as they brawled in the snow. Masasugu said: 'I was walking near my house when I noticed some movement in the snow. 'After taking a closer look, I noticed the voles wrestling, grappling and chasing one another.' Moment of suspension: The two voles tumble through the snow, hardly noticing that they fall of a (tiny) cliff . Kung-fu skills: As they land, the smaller vole throws the other off its back, continuing the fight . It all started so nice... A tiny vole peaks around a snow-covered rock on Hokkaido Island, Japan . 'Do you wanna build a snowman?' He approaches the other vole, an innocent expression on his tiny face . 'NO.' The other vole is clearly not a Frozen fan, and is not interested in construction of humanoid snowsculptures of any kind . 'There was a small hole nearby that would be a perfect shelter for a little vole so I think they were fighting for territory. 'I also know that these fights become more commonplace in the winter as food and shelter become harder to find. 'Mice owners never house males together as they will often fight but in the wild it's a different story. 'The fight looks very cruel but rarely is a vole severely injured, it normally ends with one of them surrendering and escaping. 'It was very hard to keep track of them as they move so quickly, I believe this happens in the wild a lot but it is rare that someone gets the chance to photograph it.'","Two voles started a fierce fight after one sneaked up on the other .

"Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said firms were not operating in an ‘ethical manner’ Private firms which ripped off taxpayers to the tune of millions of pounds were handing their managers profit-related bonuses worth up to half their salaries, MPs have said. Big businesses given public sector contracts were condemned by the Commons Public Accounts Committee for a culture of ‘profit-driven performance incentives’. Such bonuses meant managers could be encouraged to manipulate performance data, the committee heard, which could allow them to falsely claim they reached targets, for example. Last year Serco and G4S were exposed for overcharging the Ministry of Justice by tens of millions of pounds for electronic tagging of criminals, including some who were dead, in jail or had left the country. Both have since agreed to repay vast sums. Written evidence provided by G4S showed the most senior managers’ bonuses could be up to half their salary. Up to 40 per cent of the sum was related to profits extracted from the contract and 20 per cent from growth. Other managers could receive bonuses of up to a quarter of their salary. Up to half of that bonus was linked to the profits extracted from the contracts. Details of Serco performance bonuses were not handed to the committee. Its report exposed how the firms continued to be awarded Whitehall work even while under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. The MPs said this showed the ‘dependence’ of Whitehall departments on the major outsourcing companies. As a result of overcharging, G4S has agreed to pay back £109million to the public purse and Serco almost £70million. The most senior civil servant at the Ministry of Justice, Dame Ursula Brennan, told the committee there was now a ban on contracts containing bonus schemes which encouraged staff to manipulate data or ‘game the contract’. Margaret Hodge, the committee’s chairman said outsourcing firms were not operating in an ‘ethical manner’, adding: ‘The legitimate pursuit of profit does not justify the illegitimate failure to conduct the business in an ethical manner. Dame Ursula Brennan told the committee there was now a ban on contracts containing bonus schemes which encouraged staff to manipulate data . ‘A culture of revenue and profit driven performance incentives has too often been misaligned with the needs of the public who fund and depend on these services. ‘Departments have … placed too much trust in contractors and relied too much on the information contractors supply.’ The report found the Government was over-reliant on a small number of contractors to provide around £90billion of public spending – half of all its expenditure on goods and services. That amounts to half of all government spending on goods and services. Poor contract management left taxpayers paying ‘outdated costs’ and firms making ‘excessive profits’, the report added. The report said ministers created the impression that all business with the firms had been suspended after the tagging scandal emerged. But in reality, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence the Department of Health, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and HM Revenue & Customs all continued to award them more work while fraud investigations were going on. Two other G4S contracts with the Ministry of Justice have been referred for investigations and a Serco contract is being probed by the City of London Police. Serco’s was also found to have altered performance data on a contract for out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall. The Ministry of Justice said bonus schemes for contractors which encouraged them to game the contract would not be permitted in future.","Businesses given public sector contracts condemned for bonus culture .

"Cambridge graduates are the most employable in the world, according to a global league table. The ancient university is the best at producing graduates who are ‘ready to work’, a poll of major employers found. Oxford slipped to fourth place in the rankings having taken top spot last year. Harvard and Yale – part of the US ‘Ivy League’ of universities – were second and third respectively. Five British universities were ranked in the top 20 – one more than last year – and 12 were in the full list of 150, with only the US boasting greater overall representation in the table.

Asian universities claimed 20 per cent of the top 150 places in 2014 compared with only 10 per cent when the tables were first published in 2010. The other British universities in the top 20 were University College London, in 14th place, Imperial College London, in 15th, and Edinburgh, 18th.

Laurent Dupasquier, managing partner at Emerging, a French human resources consultancy, said: ‘The top tier players, global brands (which tend to be all American and British), continue to lead, while other Anglo-Saxon universities, those that are mainly regional players, tend to fare less well, with an average of five places lost in comparison with last year. ‘Like the premier league, the champions have an international community of students and think internationally, unlike their more locally oriented counterparts.’ The table was compiled following a survey of 2,500 major recruiters in 20 countries. Employers were asked to rank universities against a range of criteria including their production of graduates who are ready to work and their links with business. The study claimed that ‘the days of ivory towers are over’. Graduates ‘should be firmly planted in their field of expertise as a result of practical training and internships’, it said.","Employers say university is best at producing graduates 'ready to work'

"A buyer in California has spent $16,000 on the high-backed leather chair used by evil genius Blofeld in the James Bond films. The iconic piece of furniture, in which the Bond baddie sat while stroking a white cat, had been expected to sell for around $3,000. But fierce bidding drove the price up to more than five times that estimate before it was finally snapped up, and will make the perfect Christmas present for a horrible boss. The chair used by Bond baddie Ernst Stavro Blofeld in You Only Live Twice has sold for $16,000 at auction, and will make the perfect Christmas present for any ill-tempered boss . The sight of Bond's nemesis, full name Ernst Stavro Blofeld, sitting in the high-backed, black leather chair is one of the defining images of the film franchise and can now be recreated in the boardroom. The sight of Blofeld sitting in the chair stroking his white cat has become one of the defining images of the whole Bond franchise . Blofeld, head of the terrorist organisation SPECTRE, was played by British actor Donald Pleasence in the 1967 film You Only Live Twice, the fifth to star Sean Connery as 007. The chair was among a host of props from Bond films sold at Julien's Auctions in California as part of a liquidation sale by Pinewood Studios. A model helicopter, which was named Little Nellie and was used for filming aerial fight scenes in You Only Live Twice, fetched $23,000. The mobile phone remote control Pierce Brosnan used to drive his BMW in the 1997 film Tomorrow Never Dies was also snapped up for $6,000. Darren Julien, the auction house CEO, said: 'James Bond 007 lived up to his bigger than life persona in our recent auction event. 'Blofeld's chair from You Only Live Twice as well as the helicopter prop from the same film were highlights amongst the bidders.' The next installment in the Bond series is due out next year and will star Christoph Waltz, from Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, as the villain. The film will be called Spectre, the name of Blofeld's organisation, raising the prospect that Watz could reprise the role originally brought to life by Donald Pleasence. Among the other items up for sale was the model helicopter Little Nellie, piloted by Sean Connery and used to film aerial combat scenes in You Only Live Twice, fetching $23,000 .

"The whistleblower who caught an MP playing Candy Crush Saga during a Commons meeting will face no punishment, a Parliamentary watchdog revealed today. A leaked photo showed Tory Nigel Mills playing the game on his taxpayer-funded iPad when he was supposed to be listening to evidence on pensions and insurance. But instead of investigating the MP, who remains on the Work and Pensions Committee, Commons officials launched a probe into who leaked the photo. Scroll down for video . No punishment: The whistleblower who leaked this photo of Tory MP Nigel Mills playing Candy Crush Saga on his iPad will not be punished, Commons authorities have confirmed, after a 'mole-hunt' to find the culprit . Could one of these be the Candy Crush whistleblower? Footage  showed these two people were alternately sitting behind the MP - although it is possible the incident was filmed by someone hidden from view . That sparked criticism over the decision to pursue the 'mole' rather than Mr Mills himself. Footage of the meeting, held last Monday, showed a male and a female sound technician sitting behind Mr Mills who both appeared to be using mobile phones. However, it was not clear if one of them was responsible for filming him or whether another person off-camera captured his gaming on film. A Commons spokesman insisted the investigation was 'standard procedure' because it is against Parliamentary rules to film inside Westminster without permission. Those who break the rules can be barred from the Parliamentary estate, which includes MPs' offices and meeting rooms. Today, just a day after the probe was launched, it was confirmed the whistleblower will face no further action. Distracted: The MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire was spotted closely studying his iPad and swiping the screen with his finger as he attempted to complete levels of popular app the Candy Crush Saga . Apology: Mr Mills vowed he would not play the game - popular even with David Cameron - in meetings again . A House of Commons spokesman said: 'It is standard procedure that any breach of the filming and photography rules brought to the attention of the House is investigated. 'The Serjeant at Arms has concluded the investigation into this breach and has issued a reminder of the current rules; no further action will be taken.' The Serjeant at Arms, a post which dates to the 1400s, has scope to impose low-level punishments while 'serious breaches' are reported to the Commons Administration Committee. The spokesman could not confirm whether the whistleblower was actually tracked down or whether the 'reminder' was a general one. Mr Mills, who is defending a majority of just 536 in Amber Valley, initially told The Sun he would 'try' not to be distracted by the game again. He later issued a full apology, saying: 'I apologise unreservedly for my behaviour at the committee meeting and realise it fell short of what is expected of a Member of Parliament. Addictive: Candy Crush is incredibly popular - with more than 700 million games played on mobile devices . ‘I guarantee it will not happen again. 'It is a fantastic privilege to represent Amber Valley and I hope constituents will continue to support my campaigns.' Gail Dolman, a Labour councillor in his constituency, said: ‘I think it’s disgusting. He’s an MP and I find it very worrying.’ More than a billion people every day play the 'addictive' game Candy Crush Saga, in which players have to line up at least three sweets of the same colour in a row on a constantly-shifting grid. David Cameron – himself a self-confessed games addict – defended Mr Mills. ‘I know him well, he fights very hard in his constituency for people in Derbyshire, he works very hard in Parliament,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘I’m sure he will be embarrassed and he will work even harder in the future.’ Mr Cameron previously admitted to being addicted to mobile games Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Asked what level the PM had reached on Candy Crush, his spokesman said: ‘On that line of questioning, Game Over.’","Tory Nigel Mills caught playing on tax-funded iPad in pensions meeting .

"It's one thing having a laugh at other people's expense, but when the joke involves ebola and Australian commuters, don't expect to have them rolling in the aisles. That's what YouTube 'prankster' Adrian Van Oyen found out after projectile vomiting green liquid on a Queensland Rail train and later claiming he had the disease that has so far killed thousands in Africa as well as aid workers from around the world.

Scroll down for video . Prankster Adrian Van Oyen thought it would be funny to vomit on train in front of disgusted commuters . But it wasn’t all fun and games for Van Oyen, from Beenleigh, south of Brisbane, who was taken to court over the stunt where he was banned from Queensland Rail for life and had to pay a cleaning fee. 'I also got charged for public nuisance,’ Van Oyen told Daily Mail Australia. A caption along the video said: 'I tried telling them I had ebola. But nope, still got a life time ban from Queensland Rail. I guess I'll be getting the bus from now on for my hospital appointments lol.' The footage has received a significant amount of mixed responses from the public, with some offended by the ebola remark, while others are defending the prankster. After drinking three litres of milk and green food colouring, the 20-year-old started throwing up . In the YouTube clip commuters are heard laughing and yelling 'gross' 'that's disgusting', 'ewwwwww' and 'put that s*** on Facebook' while one woman is seen getting up and moving away from the repulsive scene. ‘I drank three litres of milk filled with some green colouring – that’s why it was green and why I projected so much,' Van Oyen told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It was actually quite painful drinking so much but I wanted to create a really epic scene. 'After we filmed it, I was quite hungry so my camera guy and I went to KFC.' Donning a pair of grey-washed jeans and a  t-shirt, Van Oyen, is seen taking in deep breathes in the video before he continues his cheeky stunt. ‘You always see stupid little videos of people puking on trains, from being drunk and stuff – so I thought, psh, I can do that. So I did,’ he said. ‘Only I tried to make it a little more extraordinary, which I like to think I did.’ Disgusted commuters are heard screaming out 'ewwww' 'gross' and 'put that s*** on Facebook' The prankster was recently taken to court and is now 'banned from Queensland Rail for life' The video was uploaded to Van Oyen's Facebook page on Monday night and has already been viewed more than 400,000 times. It comes after the comedian filmed himself pretending to trip over and spill the items from the shelves at some of Australia's leading retailers. 'I released a video last week, which got me banned from all Coles, Woolworths, Big W and BI-LO for a whole year after the video went viral,' he said. ‘I was  taken to court by Coles and then Woolies came along and took me to court after it created a lot of controversy.' Despite the ban from giant retailers and Queensland Rail, Van Oyen added: ‘No regrets filming it – it was worth it!’ Van Oyen is an Australian comedian prankster and is known for his YouTube channel, along with his one million subscribers.","YouTube prankster thought it would be funny to vomit green nuclear-coloured liquid on a train .

"Valuable teeth have been stolen from some of the carcasses of the seven beached sperm whales that died on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, as authorities warn people of hefty fines if they go near the dead animals. Locals believe that the whales washed ashore on Sunday night while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out. The whales were found  50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan. Environmental department animal welfare manager Dr. Deborah Kelly told The Advertiser, they had been sent photos of the jaw which show teeth missing, each believed to be worth hundreds of dollars. Scroll down for video . Seven beached sperm whales have been confirmed dead on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia after getting into trouble during a low tide . 'The teeth contain a lot of biological information and it’s an important part of the skeleton so we would ask people to respect the prohibition zone,' she said. The South Australian government reminded people who were thinking of going near the whales, they could cop a fine, with anyone that is seen to come within 50 metres of the mammal, facing a fine of up to $100,000. The reasons are to protect the safety of beach-goers with the corpses likely to attract sharks. The SA National Parks and Wildlife (Protected Animals Marine Mammals) Regulations state that a person who is on land must not move closer than 50 metres to a marine mammal, whether it is on land or in the water, if it shows signs of disturbance, appears to be sick or injured, is stranded, is entangled or is a calf or pup. Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources Animal Welfare manager Deb Kelly with  standing in front of one of six sperm whales washed up dead in a rare mass stranding on the South Australia coast . When all the whales were found six were dead, with a seventh whale dying later on Monday. A fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty. The whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the Environment Department. The trained staff were able to coax the huge whale into deeper water and prevent another death. Speaking to the ABC, Ardrossan caravan park manager Steve Ruddock said he smelt the whales before her saw them and revealed that some of them were splashing in the shallow water, desperately trying to reach deeper waters. 'Because they are so fresh, there's no smell, but it won't be long until they get on the nose, I'd say,' he said. 'There's three that are about that size, and the other three are a fraction smaller,' he said. 'We talked to a lot of the locals and there's been the odd sighting now and then on the sea, but this is very unusual,' Mr Ruddock said. Locals believe that the whales washed ashore last night, while on the hunt for salmon and became stranded when the tide went out . Environment Department regional co-ordinator Grant Pelton told Adelaide Now that the eighth whale was deeply distressed and was very close to breaching. 'DEWNR staff and a Department of Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Marine Safety officer located a live seven-metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at Pt Vincent,' regional co-ordinator he said. 'The animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they haven't seen it since. They will remain in the area to confirm it doesn't come into the shallows again.' Experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble. One such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water, when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod. Another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide. The whales were found 50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan . Dr Deborah Kelly said she was distressed to see the whales on the beach. 'This is rare,' she said. 'Unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years.' Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event . Twitter has been set alight byt the mass death of seven whales in Ardrossan . It is still uncertain when the whales will be removed from the beach. With each whale weighing up to 50 tonnes the task may take a while. The Environment Department is hoping that post-mortems on the whales will lead to an explanation. A witness at the scene told the Advertiser that the whales covered an area of about 500m. A fisherman also spotted an eighth sperm whale in shallow water north of the silo jetty today.The whale was apparently ushered back out to sea by rescuers from the Environment Department . The witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it's tail this morning at 8am, but stopped a short while later. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50-70-years-old. They say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes, they are known to mass strand. Twitter users have taken to their social media accounts to express their shock at the freak event. Sam Jacobs said: 'Pretty sad to hear about the 6 beached whales in my hometown Ardrossan,' Another Twitter user deb d said: 'Fingers crossed they make it back out to sea safely,'","Valuable teeth have been stolen from the carcasses of dead sperm whales .

"Just when you think you've seen it all, the hipsters manage to surprise again. The news yesterday, that an advertising company in east London had launched a range of beard baubles seriously tickled MailOnline readers.

The teacher told police that the student had given her the brownie during third period and that she suspected it contained marijuana. The student, from nearby Arnold, was charged with juvenile counts of administering a dangerous substance, assault and reckless endangerment. Police did not release his name, and they say he was released to a guardian. The school is taking action through its own Code of Conduct separately. 'Possession and use of drugs can have very, very serious consequences,' schools spokesman Bob Mosier told The Capital Gazette. 'The very thought that a student would give a teacher something laced with drugs is, quite frankly, appalling.'","Student gave teacher a piece when asked for a bite of the treat .

"There was a point when Dinushka Vethavanam couldn't bring herself to look in the mirror. Having suffered a one-in-a-million allergic reaction from everyday painkillers, which burnt the top half of her body including her face, she was fearful of her own reflection. Ms Vethavanam, of Melbourne, had taken some Nurofen as she was suffering from body aches last year. They were over-the-counter drugs she had taken previously and hadn't experienced any side effects. But this time, her body decided to reject the medication as it burnt, blistered, scabbed and peeled a layer of her skin. Family and friends were by her bedside, ready to say goodbye, as doctors thought she wouldn't make it. Scroll down for video . Dinushka Vethavanam (left) who was diagnosed with Stevens Johnson syndrome. She is pictured with her partner Cameron Sheehan . Ms Vethavanam, of Melbourne, was placed in ICU as a burns patient. She was suffering from a rare allergic reaction from an over-the-counter painkiller she had taken . The pain relief caused her body to break out in a rash and burnt the upper half of her body - including her face . Ms Vethavanam had never heard of Stevens Johnson syndrome - a severe adverse reaction to a medication - when she as diagnosed with it in July last year. The condition, caused by any prescribed medication or off the shelf such as Ibuprofen, affects around one to two people per million and is more common among women. It begins with flu-like symptoms, such as sore eyes according to The Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation, exactly what Ms Vethavanam had suffered before she went to the doctors. She vividly recalls the day she started to feel unwell. 'It was a Friday afternoon - I know that because I was supposed to meet my friends for a drink,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Vethavanam - who was 28 at that time - went home to rest, only to find the next day she still felt awful. Ms Vethavanam says her skin has recovered but SJS has left her body in white patches . Family and friends were ready to say goodbye as doctors said Ms Vethavanam may not survive . It was when she was admitted to The Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, north-east of Melbourne, that doctors realised Ms Vethavanam had Stevens Johnson syndrome . The doctor gave her a dose of antibiotics, saying she had an infection. But symptoms rapidly became worse. Ms Vethavanam, who lives in Eaglemont which is north of Melbourne, was then taken to the emergency room and was told she had conjunctivitis. Doctors prescribed her with eye drops and more painkillers. Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It was named after two US paediatricians who described it in 1922. It affects around one to two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. 'I went home then discovered that I was breaking out in a rash, pink spotty dots, so that's when I started panicking,' she said. 'It then began turning into a black shade. At that point I didn't have a lot of strength and my face started to turn black by Monday.' It was when she was admitted to The Austin Hospital in Heidelberg, north-east of Melbourne, that doctors realised she had Stevens Johnson syndrome. 'At that point I was burning from the inside out so I was treated as a burns patient and transferred to the burns unit at The Alfred [a major hospital in Melbourne],' Ms Vethavanam said. 'My skin was peeling off so there were sheets of skin. 'I was also coughing up blood because my mouth was bleeding and was kept in ICU for over two weeks.' Although she was heavily sedated, Ms Vethavanam still remembers her lowest point. 'I had no strength, couldn't walk, couldn't talk, couldn't even open my eyes,' she said. 'I was going in and out of consciousness and I remember hearing the nurses saying they need to shave my hair off because my scalp was scabbing and shedding. 'I remember waving my arm and trying to tell them ""no"". It was like a nightmare but when I woke up my hair was gone.' Ms Vethavanam pictured again with her partner during her recovery from SJS . One year on, the 29-year-old revisits the nurses at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne to thank them for their help . With her body covered in black welts from her face to her torso, Ms Vethavanam wanted to keep what was left of her identity. 'My whole appearance changed over a weekend,' she said. 'So when they told me I had to lose my hair - that was a massive down point for me. I adored my hair and it was very precious to me.' Ms Vethavanam battled through the condition as her parents flew to her beside from Sri Lanka after being told by doctors that their daughter may not survive. 'When my mum and dad came to the hospital, they walked straight past my bed because they didn't recognise me,' she said. 'So I had trouble looking at myself in the mirror. But the doctor told me it wasn't too bad so I thought I'd give it a go. 'When I saw my own reflection, it scared me. It wasn't the person I knew and I wasn't sure whether the people in my life would still love me looking like this.' Ms Vethavanam pictured with her father Duleep, who jumped on the next flight from Sri Lanka to Melbourne when he heard his daughter was in hospital . More than a year later, Ms Vethavanam is still on the mend but has been left with permanent scars. 'My skin has recovered a lot but there are still white patches all over my body,' she said. 'My face is back to normal but when the temperature changes my skin is so sensitive that I can feel the flush of heat instantly. 'My eyes are severely dry and sensitive to light. We're still trying to work out the best medication for them but for now I have to put in eye drops every 10 to 15 minutes. 'I have a high risk of going blind if I catch an infection and I have to keep my eyes protected at all times. That's why I wear contact lenses but that also dries out my eyes so it's just this vicious cycle.' The healing process has been tough as the 29-year-old began blaming herself. 'I guess afterwards I felt a lot of anger because I kept thinking that I should've never taken those tablets,' she said. 'I cried a few times but I'm grateful that I was able to fight this thing. It's a rare condition and many kids who go through it don't make it. 'Now the irony is that I can't produce tears anymore. I've actually run out of tears as a result of SJS. That's why my eyes are so dry. My tear ducts don't function anymore so I don't produce tears anymore.' Brother Dinesh and mother Delanie, who also live in Sri Lanka, spent some time in Melbourne with Ms Vethavanam . Ms Vethavanam's blog gives a detailed account from the moment she fell ill through to her road to recovery. 'As a way of healing I decided to document how I'm learning to live in my new skin,' she said. ' I think this was a way of teaching me a lesson because I never felt happy in my old skin. So you must be grateful for what you've got. 'It hasn't been easy but I'm better at accepting myself now with the help from my family and my partner Cameron.' Ms Vethavanam is urging others to be wary of all kinds of medication. 'It's important that you don't take meds lightly, even if they're painkillers and especially if they're for kids,' she said. 'I'm not blaming Nurofen in any way. It wasn't the product that caused my body to react this way, it was the Ibuprofen which I now have to avoid. 'I'd taken the medication before, it wasn't my first time but my body just decided to reject them. 'You've got to be more careful of what you put in your body.' A Nurofen spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the 'exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable' and such allergic skin reactions are 'extremely rare'. 'Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold,' she said. 'All Nurofen packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a doctor immediately if an allergic reaction occurs.' The spokeswoman further advises consumers to 'carefully read and adhere to the instructions provided on Nurofen packs'. 'Nurofen is sorry to hear about Dinushka Vethavanam’s condition and are glad to hear she is recovering after her diagnosis last year. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is an extremely rare but known reaction to a multitude of triggers such as infections, medications or illness. The exact cause for the reaction is currently unknown and the reaction is unpredictable. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), a group of medicines that includes ibuprofen, have also been associated with rare cases of SJS, there is no confirmed causal link. Allergic skin reactions of this type are extremely rare. Based on our adverse event collection data, the incidence of SJS is 1 case per 100 million packs sold. All Nurofen packs include warnings for consumers to stop taking and see a doctor immediately if an allergic reaction occurs. As with all medicines, we would urge consumers to carefully read and adhere to the instructions provided on Nurofen packs. The labelling clearly lists the conditions each product is suitable to treat, the precautions for use, the recommended dose and the occasions on which it should not be taken and that a healthcare professional should be consulted by consumers in any doubt.'","Dinushka Vethavanam, of Melbourne, was suffering from body aches and took painkillers last year .

"A Louisiana teenager was killed while playing a game with friends on train tracks this weekend when some equipment threw him under one of the cars. Brandt Torres, 17, and three friends had been placing coins on train tracks to watch them be crushed early Sunday, law enforcement officials told The Advocate. His death comes just two years after Torres almost died in a hunting accident. Brandt Torres (pictured after his 2012 hunting accident) was tragically killed on Louisiana train tracks . Torres lay on the ground inches from the passing cars as a ladder hanging off one of the cars caught him, tossing him under the train. He was just south of a Union Pacific rail yard in Livonia, and he died about 1:30 a.m. Authorities say Torres nearly died two years earlier in a hunting accident when he stood up in the path of a fellow duck hunter. A sheriff's spokesman, Steve Juge, called his recovery 'close to a miracle.' 'He was critically injured to the point that they didn't know if he would make it', Juge said. The fatal train tracks incident is being investigated by Union Pacific as part of standard policies and the other teenagers will be interviewed.

"An Arizona couple have been charged with child abuse for allegedly forcing their 16-year-old son to live outdoors for more than a month at the height of the summer in retaliation for being disrespectful. Brian Romine, 44, and his wife, 45-year-old Shelly Anderson-Romine, from Chandler, are facing charges of physical abuse of child or vulnerable adult. According to court records released last week, Mr Romine's 16-year-old son, who suffers from a speech impediment, sought refuge with his uncle, Tray Romine, in July telling him that his parents threw him out of the house mid-June after an argument over cake sprinkles. Tough love: Brian Romine (right), 44, and his newlywed wife, Shelly (left), have been charged with child abuse for allegedly forcing the husband's 16-year-old son to live outside for a month . Outdoor living: The boy told police that he was locked out of his room and forced to sleep in the backyard of his family's Chandler, Arizona, home in triple-digit heat . Brian Romine allegedly had urged his son to run away from home and go live with other relatives. His stepmother, Mrs Anderson-Romine, told police the boy was a dishonest and disrespectful troublemaker . When questioned by police July 19, Brian Romine said that his son was misbehaving by opening peeling off foil lids from containers of cake sprinklers, which he then proceeded to smell or eat before replacing them on the shelf. The teenager also allegedly angered his parents by taking loose change from their pockets and using headphones from a video game console, reported KPHO. The child told detectives that following the sprinkles dispute, his father handed him a sleeping bag and a pillow, and told him to go sleep in a lawn chair on the back patio. The boy also said he had to use the backyard as a bathroom. ‘[They] treated their dog better than they treated [their son],’ the uncle, Tray Romine, told ABC15. Brian Romine admitted to detectives in July that his son, who has a learning disability, had spent more than a month living in the backyard through summer heat, monsoon rains and dust storms for failing to show him respect. According to police, Romine's wife of 10 months, Shelly Anderson-Romine, confirmed her husband's version of events, describing her stepson as a troublemaker who was disrespectful and dishonest. Cry for help: The boy came to his uncle, Tray Romine (pictured), in mid-July telling him that his parents had kicked him out of the house for eating cake sprinkles . Shelly-Anderson Romine claimed that her stepson had not complained once about the heat . The 45-year-old woman also claimed that the teen did not complain even once about the triple-digit heat during his backyard exile, according to AZCentral. The young victim has claimed that his father had encouraged him on several occasions to run away from home and go live with other relatives. The teenager, who had lost his biological mother as a young boy, was taken into state custody with his father’s blessing and was later placed with a foster family.

"A Colombian teenager who choked three women unconscious before sexually assaulting them in the street been bashed in the youth detention centre where he is being held. The 18-year-old, who was 17 at the time of the attacks, was due to appear in County Court in Melbourne for sentencing on Tuesday but could not appear because of his injuries. The court heard the teenager, who pleaded guilty earlier this year, was having surgery on his eye socket after he was bashed on November 28, The Age reported. A teenager has pleaded guilty to three horrifically violent sexual attacks in Melbourne's CBD, on of which took place near Southern Cross Station . The 18-year-old, who targeted three strangers on separate occasions in Melbourne's CBD between November 2013 and January 2014, will be held in isolation at the centre until he can be sentenced at a later date. The skateboarder pleaded guilty to a number of charges including rape, attempted rape, robbery, assault with intent to rape and indecent assault, The Age reported. In each case the teen choked each victim unconscious before sexually assaulting them, sometimes multiple times, according to the prosecution. The teenager, just 17 at the time of the attacks, was arrested on January 25 more than 200 kilometres from where the assaults took place - at camping grounds in Johanna, near Apollo Bay. The prosecutor said the teen's family had bought him a one-way flight back to Bogota, Colombia, and had tried to assist him in altering his appearance. He had been due to leave the country the day after his arrest. The three assaults were launched on women in their twenties between November 2013 and January 2014 at three separate locations . In the Victorian County Court earlier this year Prosecutor Dr Nanette Rogers, SC, described the terrifying nature of each of the attacks, all on young women in their early twenties. On November 9 2013 around 12.30am the first one took place, when a 22-year-old was grabbed on Bourke Street in Melbourne's CBD and shoved in to a laneway where she was assaulted. The second victim, a Chinese international student, 24, was speaking on the phone outside a car dealership on Kings Way near Albert street when she was attacked from behind. She was sexually assaulted some time between 2.30 and 3am. In her victim impact statement the woman expressed her distress over the fact that such an horrific crime could happen in Australia. 'Sexual abuse is an unforgivable offence ... It should not have happened here [in Australia],' she said, according to The Age. The Colombian teenager's third victim was another 22-year-old who according to Ms Rogers had a shard of glass held to her throat on Flinders Street around 6am on January 18. The Colombian teen, just 17 at the time of the brazen attacks, pleaded guilty to a number of charges in the Victorian Country Court on Wednesday . Her attacker then marched her more than a kilometre through the city before dragging her into a stairway near Southern Cross Station and raping her twice, the court heard. This victim told the court she could not escape the traumatising memories of the violent rape, and was terrified while waiting for the results to see if she had contracted HIV from her attacker. The 22-year-old also revealed the devastating impact the incident had on her emotional connection with others, and said she no longer wanted to go to the gym as she believed the less attractive she was the less likely it was she would be assaulted again. The case was moved from the Children's Court to the County Court because of its severity, and the fact the attacker could have faced a maximum of three years behind bars if he had been tried as a child. The court heard the teen had moved to Australia to be with his mother late last year. He apologised for the horrific attacks but said the second two were due to alcohol abuse. He will be sentenced at a later date, and will most likely be deported when he is released on parole.","A teenager attacked and sexually assaulted three women in Melbourne .

"The menu features breadsticks,  ice-cream, chips, and handmade cheeses with apple and ginger chutney. So far, so ordinary. But closer investigation reveals that all is not what it seems. The breadsticks are made from ground almonds, the salted caramel ice-cream has coconut cream and honey instead of milk, chips are cut from carrots and those cheeses... well, there's not an ounce of dairy in there as they are made with nuts. Scroll down for video . The UK's first Paleo restaurant, Pure Taste in Westbourne Grove, London, has an specialised menu catering to diners on a variety of diets including vegan, gluten-free and low-carbohydrate . The future of healthy eating: Low-carbohydrate compliant duck with spiced clementines and cranberry sauce . Paleolithic diets mimic the types and quantities of foods our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. Pastured and wild meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, eggs, plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily. The basic premise of the Paleo diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics, which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years. It is said to be much better than the grains, dairy, and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution. While they may not be most conventional of ingredients to feature in kitchens, they are the most used items in the kitchens of the UK's first Paleo restaurant, Pure Taste. Popularly referred to as the Caveman Diet, Paleo is the latest food trend to take the world by storm. Focusing on food groups generally consumed during the paleolithic era, Pure Taste restaurant in Westbourne Grove, London, has a menu that excludes dairy products, grains, legumes, processed oils or refined sugars, in favour of protein-rich and high-fibre options. Pudding with a difference: Quinoa pancakes with blueberries, honey and cinnamon . Each item on the carefully curated menu has a string of letters underneath it. As well as notations indicating gluten, and dairy-free items, together with the more conventional vegetarian and vegan indicators, these letters explain each menu item and what the  diet it is compliant with. For example LC denotes low carbohydrates, with less than 20g net of carbs per portion. Another example would be SCD (Specific Carbohydrates Diet) meaning it is suitable for those following a SCD/GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome) eating plan, and WAP means Weston A Price diet. Chicory, activated walnuts and rocket salad is one of the starters on offer at the restaurant . The restaurant originally launched as a pop-up in Sussex and nutritional therapist and head chef, Holly Redman has brought the eaterie to London. Ms Redman said: 'The premise of Pure Taste is one that combines a passion for healthy living with high quality dining and premium flavours. 'Our extensive menus are a testament of our commitment to providing exceptional food and exhibiting the benefits of paleo cooking.’ Dr Caroline Orfila, Associate Professor of Nutrition at the University of Leeds, explained: ‘Nuts are essentially the seeds of nut trees – apart from peanuts, which are related to peas, not nuts. ‘When you soak seeds, including nuts, in water, two phenomena occur: leaching of protease inhibitors [molecules that inhibit digestion] into the water and activating of the germination process, so the amount of starch and fibre reduces, while the protein and vitamin content raise. ‘This is why germinating seeds and nuts are easier to digest than dry, raw nuts. However, most nuts bought at British supermarkets have been blanched [quickly cooked in boiling water] or roasted, which also inactivates the protease inhibitors. ‘Roasted nuts are not alive any more, so they will not activate.' The restaurant was originally launched in Sussex  by nutritional therapist and head chef Holly Redman . Menu highlights include fresh mussels in a Thai-spiced coconut broth, pan-seared breast of wild mallard duck, grass-fed rib eye steak with carrot chips and breast of wood pigeon with activated walnuts. The menu changes every eight weeks and features fresh, seasonal ingredients including free range fish and meat. Wines are  biodynamic and beers gluten-free. Tapioca and almond flour as well as almond and coconut milk are used in all the dishes. 'One of the biggest challenges in achieving optimal health is discovering what works best for you. We create dishes around the foods you can eat, rather than the foods you can’t,' Ms Redman said. LC: Low-carbohydrate diets are dietary programs that restrict carbohydrate consumption. They’re often chosen to assist weight loss, aid blood sugar management or for a specific medical reason. Foods high in easily digestible carbohydrates such as sugar, bread, pasta etc. are limited and replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of fats and protein. WAP: Weston A Price diets eliminates all processed industrial foods and anything containing modern refined vegetable and seed oils and refined sugar.Meals are based around vegetables, traditional fat sources and high quality proteins from pastured or wild animals. The diet also includes  raw and fermented dairy, bone broth, fermented foods, and organ meats and is rich in natural fats and the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. SCD/GAPS: The Specific Carbohydrate Diet, or SCD, aims to eliminate foods that are hard to digest if you have a damaged intestine, for example, if you suffer from colitis. The Gut and Psychology Syndrome diet (GAPS), is a modified version of the SCD diet. The aim of the GAPS diet is to heal the gut in order to help those with conditions such as autism, ADHD and depression.","Pure Taste in Westbourne Grove is the UK's first Paleo restaurant .

"Pouting into the camera with all the assurance of a teenage bombshell, these exclusive pictures show a teenage Monica Bellucci in some of her earliest shoots. Taken an incredible 32 years before she was selected, aged 50, from among the world's most beautiful women, as the latest Bond girl - these images show how the remarkable Italian actress has remained virtually unchanged by time. The raven-haired beauty will become officially the oldest-ever Bond girl when she appears in the new 007 film Spectre opposite Daniel Craig next year. 'Just look at her lips,' her father Pasquale Bellucci insists, as he opens the family archive for MailOnline. 'Everyone says she has had work done. But here is the proof. Her lips really were that full even at the very beginning. She's completely natural.' Scroll down for video . Unchanged: Monica Bellucci aged 18 (left) and last week, aged 50, at the launch of the new James Bond film, Spectre . Natural model: Monica Bellucci, here aged 18, was completely self-confident in her first photoshoots and comfortable posing for the camera, according to the hairdresser who discovered her . Stunning: Monica Bellucci styled at 18-years-old by Piero Montanucci, the hairdresser who discovered her . Family portrait: Pasquale Bellucci (pictured, back) says his daughter (pictured at 12, left) was ugly as a toddler . Her father, who ran his own lorry company before he retired, and her mother, a housewife, couldn't be prouder of their only child, who found fame on the catwalk before posing nude in Vanity Fair and starring in dozens of films including Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mel Gibson's The Passion. The supermodel's pictures - which Mr Bellucci insists have not been seen before - hang everywhere in the family home in the village of Selci Lama near Citta del Castello, Umbria where she grew up 'surrounded by love'. Stacks of VHS tapes of her interviews from all over the world stand next to the TV. 'It's lucky we never had another child. They would probably have been jealous of Monica', her mother Brunella laughs. But despite her breathtaking beauty as an adult, the sex siren wasn't a cute baby or toddler. 'She was so ugly', Pasquale says, pealing into laughter as they bring out 'Monica's first nude' aged 4 months. Until she was a teenager they even kept her hair short like a boy, as her father had a theory that it would make it stronger and thicker in the long run. 'That's why she still has that long beautiful black hair today,' he insists. But by 12 it was clear that she was exceptional -- she had an early instinct for fashion and already wore high heels, makeup and a chic turban to cover her short curly hair. Aged 18, Monica Bellucci was a great beauty who has remained 'completely natural' and has never had any work done, her father told MailOnline . Enchanting aged 18: Mr Bellucci says keeping her hair short as a child is the reason it's so long and beautiful today . Captivating: Monica's father recalled that she'd come straight home after school because people would stare at her in public. Pictured far left aged 18, above . Happy childhood: Portraits of Monica adorn the walls of her family's home in Umbria, Italy, where her parents say she was 'surrounded by love' First shoots: Piero Montanucci (right), the hairdresser who 'discovered' Monica, says she was completely self-confident in her first professional shoot aged 18 (left) Her beauty was utterly captivating even then. Complete strangers propositioned her with offers of millions of lira and a new life abroad, friends say. Waiters and waitresses at restaurants offered her the opportunity to eat for free. Teachers at school lost concentration – one presented her parents with a sketch he had done of her while supposedly teaching her in class. But such beauty in a small town was not always a blessing. Monica at one point became reclusive because the attention was overwhelming, her father remembers. 'All the other kids would go and hang around in the piazza after school, as teenagers do. But Monica would hide away, taking a detour through the backstreets and then coming straight home. 'One day I asked her why she didn't want to be in the square with the others and she said: ""When I go in the piazza everyone looks at me. The men look at me. The women look at me. All the kids from school. I feel ashamed"".' Her father continued: 'I told her ""You need to get used to it. Looking like you everyone is going to stare at you for the rest of your life. You have to be strong."" From that day she blossomed. She became strong'. These early words of wisdom boosted her self-assurance and she was soon 'discovered' by a local hairdresser who she met when she hitched a lift off him into town. Piero Montanucci, who is a still a friend today, says Monica 'had total self confidence' from their first shoots. He released pictures which he said had never been seen before to show how her natural beauty is unchanged. Making history: At 50, Monica will become the oldest-ever Bond girl in the upcoming film, Spectre, where she will appear opposite Daniel Craig . Bond girls: 50-year-old Bellucci poses with her younger co-stars, Naomie Harris, aged 38, (right) and Lea Seydoux, aged 29 (left) The flamboyant hairdresser who still has a salon in Citta di Castello remembers the heady days of the 1970s: 'One day we did a shoot for some hair mousse with a photographer. 'But somehow the pictures turned out nude. The boss called me after two days and said 'Piero you've shot everything but her hair'. We had to do it all over again.' Monica dressed 'almost androgynously' in the village, he said, as she didn't like to exhibit herself. 'One day she was wearing some sexy outfit on a shoot and I said she should dress more like that in Citta. She said, ""Piero do you really think I can go around the village wearing this?"" I had to admit no. It might have caused chaos!' Half the town was in love with her, friends say. But Monica herself has said she found it annoying. She told an Italian newspaper: 'I was born in a provincial town. 'There any beautiful girl elicits a morbid curiosity just for existing. It was annoying. If you spoke to anyone people said you had gone to bed with them. For the men you are an object, for the women a whore.' With all the attention, the diva's first lover came when she was 14 - in a Fiat Lancia. Monica told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. 'I was 14 and a half. Precocious. He was four years older... I could have done it far earlier as I was very free but I did it with a boy who I was very I love with who I liked physically and everything happened in the most beautiful of ways.' But the Dolce and Gabbana muse refused all offers of fame and fortune saying she wanted to finish school first. Old friends: Piero Montanucci (pictured, right) still remains friends with the actress, who posed nude in Vanity fair and starred in Bram Stoker's Dracula . Even at 18, above, Monica's father says her beauty was 'utterly captivating' and even complete strangers propositioned her with offers of millions of lira and a new life abroad . Her former mentor Piero explains: 'She didn't want to become famous -she always said she wanted to study 'and then we'll see'. Everything just happened to her. She did everything slowly, little by little. That's why her career has lasted. That's why she's still at star at 50 years old.' After their final shoot together aged 19, before she went off to Milan signing a contract with Elite, Piero saw the contact sheet and said 'But Monica you are a beautiful girl', he remembers. 'She said: 'Hadn't you noticed before now?' Despite her celebrity credentials, the Matrix actress returns to Citta di Castello often. But she and her two daughters Leonie and Dava will spend Christmas in Brazil with former husband Vincent Cassel whom she divorced this year. In a storyline fit for a Bond girl, she was briefly rumoured to be dating Russian oligarch Telman Ismailov, but her parents scotched reports of a relationship. Her mother said: 'She wants to be single. She has had a marriage – it lasted 20 years-now she's not looking for anything. She wants to give her love to her children. If love happens it happens.' Striking brunette Brunella, who is a clothes size 8 and still works out at the gym - diva style - in full make-up, looks at least a decade younger than her real age of 71. She puts the family's longevity down to a diet high in fish – and homegrown vegetables from their garden. And if the latest Bond star is anything like her mother she'll still be gracing our screens in 20 years.","Exclusive pictures show the glamorous actress before she became famous .

"There's nothing too flash about Captain Charles Teige's bridge room. But it's about the only only spot on the massive cruise liner Voyager of the Seas left untouched by an $80million make over that has made it one of the most salubrious ships ever to set sail. Whether it's intentional or not, his office has quite evidently escaped the glitz and glamour of the Royal Caribbeans'  refurbished Voyagers of the Sea. Despite his ship's sparkling new interiors – which cost $80 million – it appears the captain's commanding room was left untouched. The bridge room - with uninterrupted views of well, the sea – has a classic old school feel but a touch of retro with its soft velvet blue lounges and traditional navigation gadgets to an intriguing scooter sitting in the middle of the room. Up on deck 10 of the biggest ship to sail in Australia, this is what can be considered the best seat in the house. Then there's the world's first smart ship - Quantum of the Seas which cost $1billion - complete with a robot bar and a skydiving simulator. Daily Mail Australia gained behind-the-scenes access to two of these revolutionary cruise liners. Scroll down for video . On board the world's first smart ship - Quantum of the Seas which cost $1billion - has a rock climbing wall and a giant pink bear named Felicia . It sits next to a giant eight ton bear statue which the crew have affectionately named Felicia . The ship also features a skydiving simulator - iFly by RipCord . The iFly marks the first time such a simulator has appeared on a cruise ship . The Voyager - which set sail for the first time since its multi-million dollar refurbishment - embarked on a 14-day journey from Singapore and arrived in Sydney on Monday morning. Aboard the exclusive part of the ship, just outside the bridge room, hangs a collage of landscapes which capture Norway's natural beauty – the home of Captain Charles Teige. What's notably different about the captain's room from the rest of the luxurious ship is an apt and simple colour scheme of sea blue carpet, curtains, lounges and ceilings. The room lets the wall-to-wall windows do all the talking, taking advantage of the panoramic water views which are stunning from this part of the deck. Although for security reasons not too much was revealed on the background of the bridge room, there was one particular feature that stood out from the rest. The scooter, with a plaque engraved 'captain' on the front,  holds historic value. It was gifted by the ship yard in Finland that built the Voyager back in 1999, hence is just as old as the vessel itself. Having taken over the reigns of the ship since then - back in 2002 - Captain Charles is proud of the Voyager and how far it's come over the years. The ship sailed from Singapore through to Darwin, Brisbane and then Sydney . Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Sea set sail for the first time since its $80million makeover for a 14-day journey and arrived in Sydney on Monday . A view of the top deck of the Voyager, featuring one its newest and main attractions the FlowRider - a surf pool . The Royal Promenade in the ship, which features high end stores, was also part of the major refurbishment . Captain Charles Teige, of Norway, pictured in the ship's bridge room during the journey to Sydney . Most of the bridge was left untouched despite the major refurbishment of the vessel . The scooter hold historic value as it was gifted by a ship yard in Finland when the vessel was first built in 1999 . The bridge has a classic old school feel with an apt yet simple colour scheme of sea blue carpet, ceilings, lounges and curtains . The 50-year-old spoke to Daily Mail Australia just before his vessel ended its first trip in Sydney since its major makeover. 'She's a fantastic ship,' he said. 'This ship is about 14000 tonne and we are three times bigger than the Titanic.' The 15-deck Voyager, which is 311m long and 38m wide, can hold up to 3,989 passengers and 1,176 crew. In 1999, when the Voyager was first built, it was the biggest cruise ship in the world. Now it's the Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas. Commanding the Voyager, which recently underwent a major dry-dock in October and finished just two weeks ago, has fulfilled Captain Charles' childhood dreams. He explained his father and grandfather were both commanders of a ship. 'I knew I wanted to be a captain when I was five years old but I never dreamed of being a captain of a fantastic ship like this,' he said. 'It's something that all Norweigians dream of being and I come from three generations of captains.' While the new and improved cruise liner boasts the addition of three specialty restaurants and a mammoth poolside cinema to virtual ocean views from staterooms and new pool surfing attraction called the FlowRider - Captain Charles remained unfazed that his office merely underwent a few upgrades to the bridge facilities and was also recarpeted. 'If you like the ocean this is an amazing place to be,' he said. The 15-year-old Voyager of the Seas arrived in Sydney Harbour on Monday morning . A view of the vessel's outdoor features including a wide-screen cinema and several pools for guests . But the Voyager isn't where it stops for the Royal Caribbean. The world's first smart ship - the Quantum of the Seas - features a robot bar, a skydiving simulator and a pod that takes voyagers 90 metres into the sky. Built in Germany, the vessel cost over $1billion and will be based in New York for several months before migrating to Asia. Daily Mail Australia were also given a behind-the-scenes tour  of the vessel, including the captain's cockpit, engine room and waste management rooms. Quantum houses 17 restaurants, 11 complimentary ones and seven specialty. Some of the special establishments include Jamie Oliver's Jamie's Italian, Biggest Loser chef Devin Alexander's Devinly Decadence and Michael Schwartz's Michael's Genuine Pub. Feeding over 4000 passangers, it's various kitchens go through 6800 kilograms of rice and over 216000 eggs every week. Royal Caribbean's  Quantum Of The Seas is touted as the world's first 'smart ship' thanks to a series of new technological innovations . The crew members on board the 16 deck 348m x 41m vessel are on constant watch . The ship cost over $1billion to manufacture, with techological innovations inside and outside the control room . Green: The vessel is touted as the most environmentally friendly cruise ship in operation, a full 20% more fuel efficient than Royal Caribbean's already established Oasis and Allure Of The Seas lines . Feeding over 4000 passangers, it's various kitchens go through 6800 kilograms of rice and over 216000 eggs every week . The kitchens are manned 24 hours to help prepare for the day ahead . The ship is dubbed a 'smart ship' for several reasons, most notably it's various technological innovations. A cruise ship first, the Quantum vessel sports a skydiving simulator called iFly, developed by RipCord. Above the iFly is the North Star, a glass sphere which voyagers step into which is then craned 90 metres into the sky. Beyond the 'first at sea' features is a 'first ever' - the Bionic Bar, which has two robotic arms - named B10 and N1C - serve up cocktails that patrons order through tablets. When it comes to entertainment the ship has a music hall as well as Two70, an entertainment venue that presently houses productions Mamma Mia and Starwater. A wall to the side shows the cue of drinks, and customers can either chose an established cocktail or design their own . Chief among them is the Bionic Bar - where patrons are served by robotic bartenders . The cyborg arms - named B10 and N1C - spring into pouring, stirring and shaking action after cocktails are ordered through tablet devices . Another first is the North Star, a glass sphere that circles the vessel and takes voyagers up to 90 metres high . The North Star is designed to give views that are usually only experienced by helicopter passengers . The Quantum has been touted the most environmentally friendly cruise ship in operation, a full 20 per cent more fuel efficient than Royal Caribbean's already established Oasis and Allure Of The Seas lines. It's the first to introduce an Advanced Emission Purification system, which rids its emissions of sulfur dioxide, and Quantum runs exclusively on LED light bulbs, ridding itself completely of incandescent lights. The 16 deck, 348m x 41m vessel is further equipped with a rock climbing station - beside an ornamental pink bear statue, which the crew have playfully named Felicia, a 'FlowRider' surfing simulator and the SeaPlex, a venue for the younger travelers which features bumper cars, basketball courts, ping pong tables and video games. The vessel is supported by approximately 450 times the industry standard of bandwidth, allowing for smooth internet access when the ship is far out at sea. For the kids is the SeaPlex, a venue which features bumper cars, basketball courts, ping pong tables and video games . Quantum houses 17 restaurants, 11 complimentary ones and seven specialty . Two70 is the cruise's entertainment venue and utilises 18 projectors and six screens seen here during a performance of Starwater .","Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas arrived in Sydney on Monday after an $80million makeover .

"Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao scored his first international goal since November 2013 as Colombia eased past El Salvador in New Jersey. Making his first start for his country in 11 months, Falcao, who missed the World Cup in Brazil with a serious knee injury, took just eight minutes to break the deadlock.

"The mother of a dying four-year-old girl has spoken of her heartbreaking wish to give her daughter the gift money cannot buy – a cuddle with her unborn baby sister. Isabella Coomber, from Greenwich in London, dreams of being a big sister but was given less than a year to live in October 2013. Now her mother, Jolene Hale, 33, is hoping that little Isabella, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged two, will live long enough to meet her new sister. Tragic: Isabella Coomber, four, is dying from a terminal brain tumour diagnosed when she was two . Excited: Isabella is desperate to live long enough to meet her new baby sister, who is due in April . Isabella was having chemotherapy until last October but the treatment was stopped to enable her to enjoy what remained of her life - and what her parents thought would be her last Christmas. But, much to the surprise of doctors, Isabella outlived the initial prediction of six to 12 months and is likely to celebrate this Christmas as well. Last year, MailOnline readers were among the well-wishers to rally round and raise funds to make Isabella's dream trip to Disneyland Paris come true. But this year there are no big presents on her list because all Isabella wants for Christmas is to be a big sister to the new baby, which is due in April. 'I’m sure some people will criticise me for falling pregnant while my daughter is dying but I can honestly say Isabella has never been more excited or happy since I told her there was a new baby coming,' explains Miss Hale. ‘I believe it’s given her something to live for and I pray that they get to meet. The pregnancy has brought us all a lot of joy during this time and I have always tried to keep life as normal as possible for Isabella and her sisters. Involved: Isabella's mother Jolene says her daughter has been with her at every scan . Exhausting: Brave Isabella was given just one year to live in October 2013 . Too much: Her parents agreed to stop her chemotherapy to make her final months easier to bear . 'It's heartbreaking to think they will not grow up together but I just pray they can at least meet.' Sadly, Isabella's tumour is thought to have grown since treatment was stopped, and her mother is expecting a scan later this month to confirm her grim prognosis. 'There will never be good news because Isabella is incurable,' adds Miss Hale, 'but all we can hope for is time as a family so Isabella can enjoy being a big sister to the new baby.’ Isabella's illness was diagnosed in November 2011 when she was just two after her mother noticed she was failing to meet milestones like her older sister Rebecca, now eight. She was already pregnant with her third child, Sophia, now two, when a scan revealed Isabella had a brain tumour and she underwent emergency surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unfortunately the stress led to the breakdown of her relationship with the girls’ father and they separated in 2012. Then tragically last year they were told nothing more could be done to save Isabella and the family set about making her wishes come true. Thanks to an appeal on MailOnline, enough was raised to take the youngster and her sisters to Disneyland. Extraordinary: Isabella, with sister Rebecca, eight, has outlived the original prediction of 12 months . Biggest wish: Her mother Jolene now hopes the little girl will live until April when her sister is born . And more happiness followed when Miss Hale found love for a second time, this time with a former school friend. 'I asked him if he was totally mad when he told me he wanted to take me out,' she says. 'After all, as a single mother-of-three caring for my terminally ill daughter I’m not exactly a great catch.’ But love blossomed and in February this year, she was shocked to discover that she was pregnant for the fourth time. 'Contraception failed and I questioned how I would cope looking after Isabella and a new baby.’ Weeks later she miscarried. 'It was a lesson to me that any new life is a blessing no matter what the circumstances.’ The couple tried again and in August, Miss Hale discovered that she was pregnant again, breaking the news to a delighted Isabella at 12 weeks. All three accompanied their mother and her partner for the first scan to ‘meet’ the new baby and were also there for the 20-week scan which revealed that another sister was on the way. Close: Isabella with her mother Jolene and sisters Rebecca, eight, and Sophia, two . 'Isabella was beaming from ear to ear,' says Miss Hale. 'She was delighted to hear she was going to have another sister. 'But the truth is nobody knows if Isabella will be here when the baby is born. All we can do is pray that she will be and until then I want her to be as involved as possible. 'All she talks about is the baby. She is always rubbing my tummy and talking to her sister. The scans have been bittersweet because I don’t know if they are the only time Isabella will ever see her sister on the screen. 'Thanks to the generosity of people we have made all her wishes come true but this one is out of our hands. ‘It feels like a race against the clock but at the same time I don’t want to wish this time away. We are fundraising to make magical memories as we always have been but Isabella’s dream is to hold her baby sister and I pray it comes true.’","Isabella Coomber, four, was diagnosed with a brain tumour aged two .

"A couple who weighed a combined 32st were shamed into slimming by their own family - during Christmas dinner. Margaret Gibson, 37, and her husband, James, 41, from Biddulph, Staffs, started piling on the pounds after the birth of their two children just over a decade ago. But after taunts during the festive feast - and a warning from James's doctor that he couldn't undergo a procedure because he would 'die on the operating table' - the pair took action and have lost more than 7st between them. Wake up call: James, 41, and Margaret Gibson, 37, have shed a combined 7st in the last 11 months . By last Christmas Margaret tipped the scales at 12st 5lb and James weighed an unhealthy 20st. But the mother-of-two received a stark wake-up call when her father made a hurtful comment about her size. Margaret, a law firm secretary, said: 'I can't remember exactly what my father said but he made some sort of flippant comment to me about our appetite and I was really embarrassed. 'It was literally while we were having Christmas dinner and I wasn't very impressed at all, but that's when I decided it was time to start losing weight.' Since joining Weight Watchers in January, Margaret lost 2st 5lb to reach a healthier 10st and husband James shed 4st. Margaret, has dropped from a hefty size 18 to a size 12, and James's waist measurement has shrunk from 44in to 34in. James weighed an unhealthy 20st (right) until he and wife Margaret pledged to slim-down as a pair . Secretary Margaret dropped three dress sizes from a hefty size 18 since joining Weight Watchers in January . 'It was literally while we were having Christmas dinner and I wasn't very impressed at all, but that's when I decided it was time to start losing weight.' The pair piled on the pounds after buying a house, having children and enjoying a 'blow out' for a while . 'We have just changed our style of cooking. Instead of buying a jar of sauce, we make our own with the Weight Watchers recipes. We make sure to eat as a family. 'I feel much better than before. I have more energy. Our weight loss has helped the kids as well. 'Being heavier did not stop us doing things before, but we are more active now.' Self-employed hairdresser James added: 'I went to the doctor about a varicose veins operation and the consultant said 'If I operate on you, you will die on my table'. 'It was a kick up the backside. And then Margaret had the comments about her weight over dinner last year, so we decided to do something about it. 'Weight Watchers is easy to follow. We tried other diets before, but this is the one we have done well with. 'We used to eat fairly healthily, but on a weekend, we would go to McDonald's with the children and we would go to the local chip shop one night a week. 'Now, we eat less takeaway and try to make things from scratch. Our children have benefited from the meals as well. 'We go to meetings together to support each other, if one has a bad week, the other is there. 'We are finally getting back to the size we were when we got married. 'You do not realise, you don't see the weight creeping on to you. 'People ask where the ""big, fat hairdresser"" has gone and I am like ""I am still here"".' Margaret ensures the family eats together and she has swapped out store bought food for homemade dishes . The Gibsons followed the ProPoints system, which allots food a value depending on the amount of protein, carbohydrate and fat it contains. Just weeks away from December 25, the family is looking forward to enjoying slimline seasonal festivities. Margaret said: 'We can enjoy our Christmas dinner this year without having to feel too guilty.'","Couple started piling on pounds after the birth of two children .

"The grandfather of a missing two-year-old autistic boy whose body was found in a lake near his home has described him as a 'happy, affectionate and loving' boy. Police located the body of Sam Trott in a lake near his home in Landsdale on Wednesday, just before 10am Perth time. Speaking on behalf of Sam's parents Matthew and Lyndal, Geoff Trott said the family were 'devastated' and are still coming to terms with the tragedy. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Sam Trott pictured here with his mother Lyndel and father Matthew Trott . 'Sam was very dear to us all and his premature passing is a tragedy we're still struggling to deal with,' Mr Trott said. 'He was a happy, affectionate and loving child, with an infectious smile and brought so much sunshine into our lives.' 'Sam could not have been blessed with more devoted parents than Matt and Lyndel, who have loved him unconditionally since the day he was born.' Mr Trott said Sam's parents had strived to give him a better life since he was diagnosed with Autism. 'They've been unrelenting in their goal to create every opportunity for him to thrive and fulfil his potential,' Mr Trott said. Two-year-old Sam Trott has been missing since 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door at Lansdale in Perth . He thanked the police, SES and all the volunteers who helped in the search for Sam. Mr Trott also mentioned how lucky they were to be part of such a 'wonderful community'. He said they were overwhelmed by the compassion shown by the community and the outpouring of grief. 'We'd like to thank the media for enablising the support of the community and for the respect they've shown our family in reporting on Sam's disappearance. 'We are especially grateful to the police for their rapid response and for the professionalism, and support, keeping us informed and staying with us at all times during this terrible ordeal.' Sam's parents have asked for any donations to be made to the Autism Association of WA in lieu of tributes. Incident Controller Inspector Gary Lewis said he wanted to make a particular note of the 'immense community support' the family received during the difficult time. Divers and emergency workers were searching Landsdale Lake near Perth on Wednesday morning when they discovered a body in the search for Sam Trott . 'At 3am we had people from as far as Rockingham and Warnbro arriving to assist in the inquires.' 'We'd like to thank those people.' 'I'd like to pay particular thanks to the vast numbers of SES, fire brigade, police and other emergency services who came out to assist. 'I'd like to make a request on behalf of the family that you respect their privacy at this time. 'When news broke this morning there was approximately 200 to 300 volunteers and they all looked visibly shaken.' Sam Trott's body was found in the lake at Landsdale's Warradale Park near Perth  by divers and emergency workers on Wednesday morning just before 10am local time. The two-year-old went missing at 10.30am on Tuesday when he wandered out of his front door after workmen left it open. The news of his death comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as  rescue teams  scoured the lakes and streets looking under cars, behind fences and in bushes. Volunteers near the lake where Sam was found sat in silence after hearing the news, before starting to sing the toddler's favourite song, 'Wheels on the Bus', Nine News reports. Divers were searching the lake near Sam's home on Tuesday, but returned on Wednesday to search again . Police cordoned off the area and were supporting the little boy's family. 'It is with great sadness that we provide this update.. We thank the community and SES volunteers for the strong support we received during the search for Sam,' WA Police said in a statement. Sam's grandfather Geoff earlier issued a plea for search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song, Perth Now reports. Police were also considering playing the song out loud to coax the two-year-old out if he has found a hiding space. 'It was a tough night,' Mr Trott said. 'Matthew (Sam's father) is beside himself. He is out on his bike searching this morning.' At least 100 extra State Emergency Services volunteers joined the search on Wednesday morning as police and search teams comb the streets, parks and bushland on foot and horseback. 'Our hearts go out to #SamTrott's family and the officers who recovered his little body from the lake. Devastating news,' WA's Police Union tweeted. It comes after hundreds of nearby residents joined the search for Sam as search and rescue teams scoured the streets . Police dogs and the air wing unit were also been called in. 'Reminder to all, before you leave to work or leave your drive-ways to please check under, around and inside vehicles just in case Sam has crawled under or inside any of those places overnight,' WA Police said on Wednesday morning. Police also called on residents in neighbouring streets who may have CCTV cameras outside their homes to come forward. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, gave a statement on Tuesday afternoon pleading for people to help look for their little boy. 'Check your backyards, your frontyards, check your bushes ... he could be hiding in your garden,' Mr Trott said. 'He can be quite sociable but by the same token he could run away. If you see him and he runs away run after him, catch him please because we really need him to come home. Sam's parents, Lyndal and Matthew, say their little boy went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors . Sam's grandfather Geoff has asked search teams to start singing 'Wheels on the Bus' in the hope he might respond if he hears his favourite song . 'If you've got little drains, you know, he's autistic, so he may not play with normal toys, so he could be hiding in the garden. 'He could be hiding somewhere, he could be wandering around he may well have got tired and laid down for a sleep.' Police have praised the community saying the help so far has been 'overwhelming'. Sam went missing in a matter of seconds after workmen left the front door open as they were installing mirrors. 'I heard the fridge door beep because he was in the fridge, I said 'shut the door Sam'. Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn't there,' Ms Trott told Perth Now. 'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore. 'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn't see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name. 'He doesn't know how to open doors but the door was wide open.' Hundreds of nearby residents joined the renewed search for little Sam on Wednesday . One hundred extra SES volunteers joined the search and trawled the streets near Sam's home . Rescue teams searched under bushes in case Sam had taken refuge underneath them . Just before 10am on Wednesday, volunteers and media were pushed back from the lake where Sam's body was subsequently recovered from . Hundreds of neighbours lined up early on Wednesday to volunteer to search for Sam . Hundreds of people have since taken to social media to express grief and pay tribute to Sam, his family and those involved in the search. 'My heart is broken. Such a tragic ending. Credit to all the Perth community and emergency services who put in such a tremendous effort to search for this gorgeous little boy, I feel very sad and overwhelmed,' Brittaney McCulloch posted on Facebook. 'The whole city cries with them. Rest peacefully little man. Deepest sympathy to Sam's family and all involved,' Kerrie Broun. Cidalia Francis: 'Sam, Sam, Sam....I never met you, but you have stolen my heart! Keep close to mummy, daddy and big brother. They need you right now. You are such a little adventurer and my big hero! Rest in peace angel.' WA Police briefed the residents who showed up to help looked for little Sam on Wednesday . Some residents even left out containers of food and water for the little boy in case he reappeared overnight . The land search and rescue operation is continuing on Wednesday with the assistance of State Emergency Service volunteers . Lakes surrounding the nearby school are also being combed by police divers with Sam known to like water .

"Recent thunderstorms in NSW could have a direct impact on the number of Sydney rock oysters available  in the lead up to Christmas. Heavy rain has halted harvesting of the oysters grown in the majority of waterways on the NSW far south coast from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, the ABC reports. Growers, who have been forced to stop harvesting until storm water run-off subsides, now fear they won't meet Christmas demand for oysters. The harvesting of oysters on New South Wales' south coast has halted due to heavy rain . Wholesalers may be forced to source rock oysters from Tasmania and South Australia if the harvest is delayed by long periods. Farmer Andy Baker said the torrential rain caught him off-guard and he wasn't able to bring in the oysters at his Pambula Lake farm prior to the storms. 'I've been at this job a long time. I read it wrong on Saturday,' he said. Oyster farms like this one in Coffin Bay have been affected by the recent rain storms . 'I thought we might have got up to 25 millimetres of rain but I didn't think we'd get over 70 millimetres as quickly as we did.' Mr Baker and several other farmers managed to bring in several oysters prior to the storms. 'Pambula Lake is probably going to be shut for at least a fortnight,' he said. A few farmers were able to save their oyster harvest by storing them before the storms hit . While Mr Baker admits he might not be open again until the New Year, he is remaining optimistic. 'There's money in mud and this is an inconvenience at the moment, but in the next weeks and months and even the season ahead, this rain is a blessing,' he said. Oysters could now be off the menu at Christmas because of the bad weather .","Heavy rain has halted oyster harvesting on NSW's far south coast .

'The Chimpanzees received some extra treats today, with some brightly-coloured boxes full of special treats and shredded paper to encourage them to have a bit of a forage. 'These enrichment activities provide important mental and physical stimulation for our animals, providing them with opportunities to show off the skills they have developed to be successful survivors in the wild.'

"Scotland Yard detectives probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann today grilled a convicted rapist over her disappearance for over six hours. Operation Grange chief, DCI Andy Redwood, arrived in Portugal this morning for three days of questioning with 11 witnesses. It is the third time the  pig farmer, Joaquim Jose Marques, has been quizzed about the youngster's disappearance from her  holiday apartment in May 2007. Marques - initially linked to Madeleine's disappearance after being identified by an artist's drawing of the potential suspect - assaulted two cameramen as he left Faro Police Station following his interrogation. He fell to the ground as he tried to throw a punch at one, and threw a bottle of water at another when he returned from a quick lunch. Scroll down for video . Questioned: Joaquim Jose Marques (right) is one of the 11 people being questioned over the disappearance . Witness: Marquez, a convicted rapist, assaulted two cameramen after being interrogated in Faro today (left). He threatened reporters with a gun outside his Algarve pig farm when he was first identified as a suspect in January 2008 (right) Interrogated: Mario Marreiros (pictured), who worked as a laundryman  at the holiday resort where Madeleine went missing, was also quizzed . Investigation: Last month it emerged the British police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (pictured) has cost almost £8million . Marques threatened reporters with a gun outside his Algarve pig farm when he was first identified as a suspect in January 2008, but was understood to have been ruled out of the investigation after providing an alibi. He was questioned 20 days after Madeleine vanished in May 2007, and again after the release of a sketch done by a forensic artist from the FBI, based on descriptions by British tourist Gail Cooper. She told the police a 'creepy man' came to her villa in the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine disappeared from to ask for donations for a nearby orphanage -- days before the youngster went missing. Marques, who was living with his British hairdresser girlfriend and their three-year-old daughter at the time, was then identified as a convicted rapist by Portuguese press. Diario de Noticias reported he was sentenced to five years in jail in 1996 for raping a British teenager in Praia da Luz in 1995, while an accomplice targeted her friend. Police also questioned a former laundryman at the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine was staying at when she vanished. Mario Marreiros, 48, revealed last year how he told police about a man wearing sunglasses lurking in a stairwell near Madeleine McCann's apartment just 24 hours before she vanished. The man who claimed he had never spoken to British police told a newspaper: 'My theory is that guy must have been involved, either in the kidnapping or studying what to do - their movements. 'He was there for something, for sure.' The potential suspect, later identified by the ex-Ocean Club worker, is also understood to have been ruled out of the Madeleine McCann inquiry after turning out to be a tourist. Scotland Yard detectives arrived in Portugal this morning to oversee the fresh round of interviews over her disappearance. Seven of the men and women due to be questioned have been described as people of 'high interest' to the Madeleine McCann probe. Four others thought to be of lesser importance include a former British suspect, Robert Murat, and his wife. Mr Murat's lawyer confirmed he has been asked to attend Faro Police station as a witness, along with Michaela Walczuch. The pair are due to arrive tomorrow morning at around 9.30am for questioning. Probe: DCI Andy Redwood (left) has arrived in Faro, Portugal to oversee the questioning of 11 witnesses over the disappearance of Madeleine McCann (file photo, right) Rushed: The Operation Grange chief (right) refused to comment as he made his way into Faro Police Station . Interview: The lawyer of a former British suspect, Robert Murat, has confirmed he and his wife will be questioned at Faro Police Station tomorrow morning (file photo) Francisco Pagarete said: 'Mr Murat will be questioned tomorrow. I will be attending the police station with him. 'He has been asked in for questioning as a witness. Michaela has also been asked in for questioning on the same day.' John Hill, manager of the Ocean Club holiday resort where Madeleine was staying when she vanished on May 3, 2007, is also expected to be interviewed. British police have reportedly supplied over 250 questions for the Portuguese authorities to ask the 11 witnesses. DCI Nicola Wall from the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command Unit, who is due to take over leadership of the investigation when Mr Redwood retires on December 22, is expected to arrive in Faro later this week. British detectives are expected to ask for permission to carry out new tests on DNA material held at a lab in Coimbra, northern Portugal, once she's in charge of the Operation Grange case. The interviews arranged for this week follow a fifth international letter of request from the British authorities. They are the first since four men were quizzed as 'arguidos' or suspects at the start of July. All four, who included Russian businessman Sergey Malinka and a schizophrenic heroin addict, insisted they had nothing to do with Madeleine McCann's disappearance. Individuals in Portugal are given 'arguido' status if authorities suspect their involvement in a crime but are not in a position to arrest or charge them. The 11 men and women due to be questioned this week could in theory be made arguidos at any time. If that happens, they can only be quizzed in the presence of a lawyer and can refuse to answer questions. IT consultant Mr Murat, who had his arguido status removed in 2008 when the first Portuguese probe into Madeleine's disappearance was shelved, has said his conscience is clear and he is happy to speak to police again if required. Vanished: Madeleine McCann was three years old when she disappeared from her holiday resort in Praia da Luz (pictured) in May 2007 . Brtitish police maintain the belief that Madeleine was killed during a bungled burglary -- a theory their Portuguese counterparts have privately rubbished. Parts of the Praia da Luz resort where Madeleine vanished were dug up in June at Scotland Yard's request in a grim search for her body which failed to yield any clues. Last month it emerged the British police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance has cost almost £8million. DCI Redwood and his colleagues, who normally fly with British Airways, jetted to Portugal yesterday morning with budget carrier, EasyJet.

"Bali Nine inmates Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be killed by firing squad after Indonesia's new president Joko Widodo  ruled out issuing pardons for any drug convicts on death row. The two Australians, jailed in Kerobokan Prison, applied for clemency from the country's former president two years ago but it was ignored. 'I will reject clemency request submitted by 64 death convicted of drugs cases,' Mr Joko said during a lecture at Gadjah Mada University on Tuesday. If Mr Joko's comments are taken at face value it means Chan and Sukumaran now have no hope for avoiding the death penalty. According to Indonesian news website Kompas.com, Mr Joko said most of the prisoners had 'destroyed the future of the nation'. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine enforcer, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and mastermind Andrew Chan in a holding cell at Denpasar Court after they were sentenced to death for heroin trafficking in Denpasar, Bali, on February 14, 2006 . Sukumaran has turned to art during his time in the notorious prison and entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize this year . He said the rejection of clemency served as 'important shock therapy' for drug dealers, traffickers and users. Mr Joko also revealed during an appearance at a Yogyakarta State University for Human Rights Day that the requests for clemency had remain untouched for years under his predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. 'I'm asking now, what should I do? For years no decisions have been taken. I say now I will issue no pardon for drugs [criminals],' he clarified. Mr Joko's new policy will condemn Chan, Sukumaran and more than 60 other drug prisoners to the firing squad.

Chan and Sukumaran's family appealed for clemency from the President in 2012 and have been anxiously waiting for mercy . Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan outside his cell inside Kerobokan jail in Bali in 2012 . The comments come just a week after the president's office announced that five convicts would be executed by the end of the month. Chan and Sukumaran, from Sydney, were arrested in 2005. Chan was stopped at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali's capital Denpasar and Sukumaran was arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta with three others. According to court testimonies of convicted drug mules, Chan and Sukumaran were the co-ringleaders of a heroin smuggling operation from Indonesia to Australia. Police found 334 g (11.8 oz) of heroin in a suitcase in the room with Sukumaran which was allegedly going to be smuggled. After a criminal trial, on 14 February 2006 Chan and Sukumaran were sentenced to execution by firing squad by the Denpasar District Court. The men's friends and family have been running an appeal, pleading for mercy, for years and say since they have been in prison they have admitted and apologised for their crimes . They both pleaded for clemency from former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before he left office. In June, Daily Mail Australia reported how Sukumaran had entered a self-portrait for consideration for the Archibald Prize from his jail cell in Bali - but his painting wasn't considered because he was locked up abroad. He had hoped to compete for the prestigious art prize that includes $75,000 in cash. Sukumaran turned to art while serving his death row sentence in Bali, while Chan has turned to Christianity and hopes to become a pastor if he is released. Both criminals pleaded for clemency from former Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono before he left office . Sukumaran flew a self-portrait of himself to the Art Gallery of NSW for consideration . The men's friends and family have been running an appeal, pleading for mercy, for years. Brigid Delaney co-founder of the Mercy Campaign, an online petition collecting signatures of people appealing for clemency for the men, said that the campaign would continue. 'Please visit the Mercy Campaign website and sign our petition if you believe that the lives of Myuran and Andrew should be spared.' Article 14 of the Indonesian Constitution gives the President a broad power to grant clemency. It doesn’t mean the prisoner walks free from jail; in a death penalty case it means the prisoner stays in jail but does not face execution. The Mercy appeal says: 'Andrew and Myuran have now admitted and apologised for their crimes. They are doing their best to better themselves and help those around them. 'Andrew and Myuran were convicted of trafficking drugs from Indonesia to Australia. They admit they committed that crime. They admit that they were selfish and greedy and they have now completely reformed. Their crime was not a violent one. 'Andrew and Myuran agree that they deserve punishment. They do not deserve to be executed by firing squad.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sukumaran's lawyer for comment.","Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, from Sydney, are on death row .

"For years, it has brought smiles to the faces of Britain’s celebrities – not to mention the odd permanently startled expression. But it seems that Botox’s days as the wrinkle-removing treatment of choice could soon be over. Instead, growing numbers of the rich and famous claim to have found a new way to turn back the clock – without ending up with that tell-tale frozen stare. Yesterday Amanda Holden (pictured left)  and Mel B (right) became the latest celebrities to admit to using collagen wave therapy, which works by blasting the skin with radio frequency waves . Yesterday Mel B and Amanda Holden became the latest celebrities to admit to using collagen wave therapy, which works by blasting the skin with radio frequency waves. This apparently encourages cells to produce collagen, which tightens the surface of the face – although it is not yet known whether there are any side effects. Their confessions come just days after singer Tulisa Contostavlos, 26, admitted the procedure is responsible for her extraordinarily smooth forehead. X Factor judge Miss Brown, 39, said: ‘I’ve been having it for a few months and my skin has never looked better. Collagen wave therapy could soon replace Botox as the natural-looking wrinkle-removing treatment of choice . 'I don’t want to have Botox or surgery because I want to have expression in my face. But I want to look after myself. 'I’m not an idiot. Looks do count in this business.’ Miss Holden, 43, a mother of two, said she gave up Botox after the birth of her two-year-old daughter Hollie. Singer Tulisa Contostavlos, 26, 9pictured) recently admitted the procedure is responsible for her extraordinarily smooth forehead . The This Morning presenter said: ‘For the last three years I haven’t bothered [with Botox] and have instead been having collagen wave facials. It’s done amazing things to my face.’ Numerous stars have admitted using Botox, including Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman and Lulu. The procedure involves injecting chemicals into the skin that prevent muscles from moving. This can produce the frozen look which often reveals when someone is a user. Beauty therapist Lisa Harris said it is a short-term treatment that ultimately causes damage. She claimed that collagen wave is better because it promises long-lasting effects. Miss Harris, who offers the treatment at her clinic in Weybridge, Surrey, said: ‘It gives you an even skin tone, helps to smooth the pores out and prevents the aging process by encouraging skin to produce collagen. ‘It’s very good for the neck and it just gives the skin a fantastic lift.’ Most customers do a course of three to ten treatments, costing from £150 to £250 per session. Each lasts between 30 and 60 minutes and they are usually carried out weekly or fortnightly. Botox is cheaper – injections for one area of the body can cost around £200 in total.

"Online shopping has grown to such an extent that for the first time it now accounts for almost one third of household purchases, apart from groceries. One in three home appliances, items of clothing and furniture are bought using the internet, according to research by the British Retail Consortium. Overall, more than £1 in every £5 of all non-food spending is now being done online. The latest growth, a 12 per cent rise on last year, was revealed in statistics for last month, including Black Friday – November 28 – when £810million was spent online in a single day. Scroll down for video . Changing habits: One in three home appliances, items of clothing and furniture are bought using the internet, according to research by the British Retail Consortium. File picture . The astonishing demand left many websites unable to cope, with the result that shoppers suffered ‘screen freeze’ and some retailers are still struggling to make deliveries. Customers at Marks & Spencer face a wait of ten days to get their purchases, while Tesco has suffered delays in its click-and-collect service, and the online fashion chain ASOS has suspended a large part of its next day delivery system. Further pressure was put on delivery services yesterday with websites expecting a further shopping binge on what is known in the industry as ‘Manic Monday’. The deals offered online by specialist web stores such as Amazon as well as high street giants including Tesco, Asda, M&S, John Lewis, Currys PC World and the big department stores have triggered an unprecedented spending splurge. The £810million figure for internet sales on Black Friday was almost 50 per cent higher than expected by the industry. As a result of extreme demand, Tesco has suffered delays in its click-and-collect service. File picture . The BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, said: ‘This month brings fantastic news for retailers who have worked hard on their online presence, as the online penetration rate of non-food sales is at an all-time record. ‘Every £1 in £5 of non-food purchases is spent online. Online sales are also contributing a larger proportion of growth to non-food sales compared to in-store. ‘Black Friday was the retail event of the month and retailers offered consumers impressive discounts both online and in-store. The high volume traffic to websites meant that consumers also bought a large amount of full priced items and not just those on sale. ‘Online sales growth was good for the month but there may have been a distortion caused by Black Friday with consumers delaying purchases until the end of the month in the hope of grabbing some bargains.’ The BRC ranks retail sectors in terms of their annual growth. Health and beauty products saw the biggest increase in sales, ahead of household appliances, particularly flat screen TVs. The BRC said: ‘There were widespread discounts for Black Friday, with particularly aggressive deals among fashion retailers, who used the opportunity to lower their stocks after the unseasonably warm autumn quarter we’ve just seen. ‘Household appliances – for its first appearance in the monitor – moved straight to second position and finished the month on a very strong note, thanks to Black Friday.’ David McCorquodale, the head of retail at KPMG, said: ‘Online orders reached record breaking penetration levels this November, as shoppers snapped up a bargain in the Black Friday sales. ‘However, retailers’ online systems have been tested and some have been found wanting. ‘The sheer weight of consumer demand caused some websites to buckle under the pressure and these retailers need to sort this capacity issue out and quickly or face losing sales to competitors with more robust systems. ‘Online sales will help to drive growth for retailers this Christmas and are a crucial element of their overall strategy.’ He added: ‘After years of slow growth this Christmas could be a cracker for the retail sector, with sales surpassing last year’s levels. Online sales will be launched as early as Christmas Day and shoppers will be able to pick up a bargain while tucking into their turkey.’","Over £1 in every £5 of all non-food spending is now being done online .

"Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, who allowed Goodwyn to be freed after a panel of judges sitting at the High Court said it would be unlawful to keep him locked up . A ‘very dangerous’ paedophile who attacked children as young as seven has been freed from jail on a technicality, it emerged yesterday. A judge had wanted Jeffrey Goodwyn – convicted of two separate sex attacks on young girls – to stay locked up indefinitely for the public’s protection. The courts say he is a grave threat to children, and even the sex attacker’s own lawyers say he has made ‘no progress whatsoever’ behind bars. Yet he was freed after his sentence was ruled ‘unlawful’ because it pre-dated the introduction of legal powers to lock up offenders indefinitely. Incredibly, police have refused to release a photograph of the newly-freed predator in case it makes it harder for Goodwyn to ‘rebuild his life’. Last night the case sparked fury among MPs and victim groups. Goodwyn, 48, was sentenced in 2012 for indecently assaulting a seven-year-old girl. The sickening attack took place in 2004 or earlier, with the young victim unable to remember the precise day. He had a previous conviction for raping a nine-year-old. The judge called Goodwyn ‘a very dangerous offender’ and gave him an IPP (imprisonment for public protection) sentence – which means a person can be held indefinitely. IPPs were introduced in 2005 and, by the time Goodwyn was sentenced, they had been in force for seven years. But, because the actual date of his crime pre-dated the introduction of the new powers, the Court of Appeal ruled its imposition was ‘unlawful’. As a result, he was released from jail two weeks ago. Mr Justice Coulson, sitting with Britain’s most senior judge Lord Thomas, said yesterday that he had reached his decision ‘unhappily’. He added: ‘Despite the danger to the public which this applicant clearly represents, we are in no doubt that... the IPP was unlawful.’ The appeal court heard that while in prison Goodwyn refused to transfer to open conditions. The Parole Board described his conduct as unsatisfactory after he threatened staff and was punished for fighting. He also refused to discuss his sexual offending. An indeterminate prison sentence is where a minimum jail term is set before a defendant can be considered for parole. Goodwyn had received an IPP, an imprisonment for public protection sentence after being convicted of raping a nine-year-old and sexually assaulting a girl aged seven. IPP sentences had allowed the authorities to keep the most dangerous criminals locked up indefinitely until they have proved they are safe. However the Court of Appeal ruled that IPP sentences can only be passed for offences, which happened after April 2005. In Goodwyn's case, the two offences had occured in October 2001 and May 2004, meaning it was before the Criminal Justice Act 2003 came into force. Therefore judges ruled that there had been no power to impose an IPP on Goodwyn, which led to his sentence being quashed. Mr Justice Coulson said: ‘This applicant remains a very dangerous man. Because of his failure to engage with the relevant assistance available to him in prison, he has not begun to address his offending.’ The news sparked immediate demands for police to release a picture of the paedophile, which would be normal when a person is convicted of such a serious offence. But Gwent Police, which covers the area, last night refused. A spokesman said Goodwyn was now ‘back in the community trying to rebuild his life’ and releasing a picture could disrupt that. Des Mannion, head of service at the charity NSPCC Wales, said: ‘It is extremely frightening that a child rapist described as “very dangerous” and unrepentant has been released back into the community due to what seems like a legal technicality surrounding the timing of the offence. ‘Sexual offending can be compulsive. Any offender with a history of child sex abuse should be considered a risk to children’s safety for the rest of their lives.’ Mr Mannion called for the disclosure of details about the paedophile. He added: ‘Every measure needs to be taken to ensure our children are kept safe.’ Jenny Willott, Liberal Democrat MP for Central Cardiff, said last night: ‘This is really worrying. ‘Given that both the original sentencing judge and the judge today described Jeffrey Goodwyn as “very dangerous”, I am really concerned that he has been released. ‘I’m sure parents in Cardiff will be worried given the nature of the crimes he has committed. I appreciate this a legally complex case but... I hope safeguards have been put in place to keep children safe.’ The three judges sitting at the Court of Appeal, pictured, allowed Goodwyn to be freed after his sentence was ruled unlawful .","Jeffrey Charles Goodwyn had been jailed indefinitely for child sex offences .

"Single parents finding a job have taken the number of working families in Britain to a record high. New figures today showed 87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work, the highest since records began almost two decades ago. Ministers claimed the data was proof that welfare reforms are ensuring that people will always be better off in a job than claiming benefits. 87.3 per cent of families have at least one person earning in work, the highest since records began almost two decades ago . Compared to 2008, the biggest rise has been among lone parent families finding work, the Office for National Statistics said . The government insists that efforts to tackle so-called troubled families, where no-one works, have helped to tackle long-term unemployment. The Office for National Statistics found that 87.3 per cent of families were classified as working families, the highest since comparable records began in 1996. The biggest increase was among lone parent families with dependent children up from 57.4 per cent in 1996 to 71.1 per cent this year. In the 2million workless families, more than half (53.8 per cent) have had no one in work for three or more years. More than one in 10 children (12.6 per cent) were living in workless families, also the lowest percentage since records began in 1996. Thera er now almost 14million working families in the country, up from 12million in 1996, the figures show . Parents of children under five were almost twice as likely to be in employment if they were in a couple (78.6 per cent) than if they were lone parents (40.9 per cent), the ONS said. Employment of single mothers was also at a high, hitting 62.3 per cent this year. Women were more likely to be in work if they had children than if they did not. Almost 70 per cent of women with dependent children have a job, compared to 67.5 per cent of women without children. Young mothers aged 16 to 24 were around half as likely to be in employment (36 per cent) as mothers aged 25 to 64 (71.6 per cent) in 2014. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the Government's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to work. He said: 'The benefits system this Government inherited was broken, often trapping the very people it was designed to help in cycles of worklessness and welfare dependency. 'We are reforming the system so that people are given the skills as well as the opportunities to get into work, with Universal Credit meaning that they can take employment safe in the knowledge that they will be better off than they would be on benefits. 'And our reforms are clearly working - with figures released today confirming that the proportion of families where no-one works is now at an all-time low. Furthermore, lone parent families have seen the biggest increases in employment rates and lone mothers now have the highest employment rate on record. 'As part of our long-term economic plan, we’ll be continuing to help people to break free from welfare dependency so they can look forward to a better more secure future for themselves and their families.'","87.3% of families now have at least one person in employment .

"Britain’s EU budget contributions are set to soar by almost £500 million this year. Brussels has sewn up a deal to increase its overall budget by £3.8 billion to an eye-watering £110 billion a year. The inflation-busting increase takes Britain’s annual contribution to the EU's budget to £12 billion - up to £420 million once a rebate has been applied. Scroll down for video . George Osborne has boasted about keeping a lid on Britain's contributions to the EU - but is facing another £500 million increase this year . The decisions will be discussed by ambassadors later today and will be voted on by the European Parliament later this month. The £420 million comes on top of the approximately £11.6 billion that David Cameron has already agreed to pay in 2014. It is also separate from the £700 million ‘surcharge’ which George Osborne agreed last month to pay Brussels after Britain’s economy was found to have outperformed other European countries. Downing Street said the EU’s next seven-year budget, which starts this year, would still be smaller than the last seven-year budget in real terms. Open Europe’s Pawel Swidlicki said: ‘The latest inflation busting increase in the EU Budget shows why it is so important for David Cameron to push through radical changes to the way the EU spends taxpayers cash. ‘Cutting back outdated farm subsidies and returning control over regional development funds for wealthy countries like the UK would save billions.’ EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has agreed an increase in the EU budget to £110 billion . Campaign group Business for Britain warned the budget hike was likely to only be ‘the start’. Matthew Elliot, the chief exec, said: ‘Increases in the EU Budget are more frequent than visits from Santa Claus, but a lot less welcome. ‘The bill for a increased EU spending will inevitably land on the UK’s doormat, at when our EU contributions are already at a record high.’","Brussels wants to boost overall budget by £3.8bn to £110 billion a year .

"Federal and local investigators are trying to determine whether an arsonist set a fire that turned an unfinished downtown apartment tower into an inferno so hot it melted freeway signs and cracked windows in office high-rises as far as a block away. More than 250 firefighters battled flames that engulfed the wooden frame of the seven-storey Da Vinci complex around 1:20 a.m. Monday. It took hours to douse the flames and left an unsafe, smoldering heap of wood and metal. Heavy equipment tore into the remaining scaffolding Monday night. It was one of two destructive early morning fires in the city. The other heavily damaged a building that houses multiple businesses in a neighborhood a couple of miles away. Scroll down for video . More than 250 firefighters battled flames that engulfed the wooden frame of the seven-story Da Vinci complex . Devastation: The building became a block of flames so hot that it melted freeway signs and caused massive traffic problems . A Los Angeles city firefighter examines some of dozens of melted and shattered windows on a building more than 100 yards away from the site of the raging fire . A Los Angeles city firefighter works amid the ruins of the fire, which saw a seven-storey building completely destroyed . The Da Vinci fire caused an estimated $10million in losses to the complex, city fire Captain Jaime Moore said . Los Angeles Fire Department said more than 250 firefighters are battling a blaze, which can be seen for miles around . Firefighters do not yet know what caused the massive blaze, which towered over downtown Los Angeles on Monday morning . The fire engulfed an apartment tower that was under construction and spread to at least two other buildings before crews could bring it under control . No one was injured in the first blaze and there was one minor injury in the second blaze, which appeared to be unrelated, authorities said. The Da Vinci fire caused an estimated $10million in losses to the complex, city fire Captain Jaime Moore told the Los Angeles Times. Another $1.5 million in damage was done to a freeway where a sign melted and traffic-monitoring fiber-optic cables under the pavement may have to be replaced, authorities said. Arson investigators were unable to immediately enter the unsafe structure, but fire officials said the fact that the fire erupted so quickly over so much of the building might point to arson. 'It's very rare for the entire building to be engulfed at once,' Moore said. 'There may have been foul play.' Investigators from the city Fire Department and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were looking into the cause of the Da Vinci blaze. The blaze at the seven-story building filled the surrounding area with smoke, causing the the 110 Freeway and the 101 Freeway to close . The northbound lanes of the 110 Freeway remained shut through Monday morning because firefighters feared that the smoldering remains of the building could collapse on to the highway . Investigators will look at surveillance recordings from surrounding buildings and will use dogs that can sniff fire accelerants. The fire sent up sheets of flame that were visible for miles and rained ash onto freeways flanking the construction site. Some signs melted and portions of U.S. 101 and Interstate 110 were shut down for a time as burning debris fell into lanes. Commuter traffic - slow-moving on good days - remained jammed long after rush hour, with vehicles backed up for miles even after the freeways reopened. Kin Isamov, 28, was heading downtown on the 110 freeway when he passed the blaze. 'You could feel the fire,' he told the Times. 'You drive through it, and you kind of imagine what Armageddon would feel like. You feel like any second the fire is going to get in the car, burn you.' Daniel Reese, 38, who lives in an apartment across the freeway from the Da Vinci, said he was awakened by sirens and then police ordered residents to evacuate. He went to the balcony and watched the flames as embers rained down. 'I grabbed my wallet and my dog,' he said, standing with his British bulldog, Marley. Three floors of a nearby 16-story city-owned building had fire damage and the other floors sustained water damage. That building was closed for the day. The intense heat also broke glass and melted blinds in three stories of the 15-story Los Angeles County Health Department building. Rubble: The wood frame apartment building burned quickly and was reduced to little more than cinders. Much of the debris fell on the 110 Freeway, causing the northbound lanes of the major artery to close . Firefighters say they were shocked by how quickly and uncontrollably the blaze spread. Five stories of wood frame construction were fully engulfed in just minutes . Two other building - both of which house municipal offices - were damaged by the fire. One of the buildings - a 16-story high-rise - had all but two floors damaged by smoke and water . The flames cross the 110 freeway and melted road signs. Only three lanes of the highway were open by Monday afternoon . Scorched asphalt: Flames and smokes poured across the 110 and 101 freeways, causing authorities to shut down both until the fire could be contained on Monday morning . The chief of LA's fire department tweeted this picture of his men bringing the blaze under control . Inferno: The fire is burning at a building site planned to be a tall residential structure . Downtown: The fire turned an apartment complex near a key Los Angeles interchanged to cinders . The fire all but leveled the apartment building and burned several floors of another high-rise . The fire broke out just down the block from a LAFD fire station. Firefighters emerged from the station house to see the blaze . Parts of the 110 Freeway were charred and remained close into rush hour on Monday morning . The seven-storey building, at 909 West Temple Street, is slated to be residential with offices on the ground floor . A block away, the city Department of Water and Power reported cracks in at least 160 of its 10-by-4-foot windows at its headquarters. The blaze also set off sprinklers in a nearby building housing the city's Department of Aging, and the water ruined 2,000 Christmas gift bags containing items such as socks, sweaters and food that were going to be distributed this weekend to senior citizens, mainly the poor and those who live alone, department General Manager Laura Trejo told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1senwFq ). Trejo set up a fund through the Los Angeles Foundation on Aging to accept cash donations to replace the gifts. The burned apartment complex was planned to be a 1.3-million-square-foot residential building - one of a series of large complexes that have gone up around downtown in recent years. The Da Vinci was to be an Italianate complex with hundreds of units and amenities such as a pool, full-sized basketball court, library, theater and business center. The developer, Geoffrey Palmer, also built the Orsini and Medici complexes. 'We would like to thank the men and women of the Los Angeles Fire Department for their bravery, swift actions and effective response in putting out the fire,' he said in a statement. 'Though we have temporarily lost Building B, we will be opening Building A across the street at the end of January to those families looking forward to occupying their new homes.' Shortly after 4 a.m., another large fire was reported at a mixed-use building undergoing renovations about 2 miles to the west. More than 100 firefighters from multiple agencies responded and had the flames under control in less than two hours, according to Chief Deputy Mario D. Rueda. One person in a nearby apartment building was treated for minor smoke inhalation, he said.","More than 250 firefighters were called to tackle an inferno that raged in downtown Los Angeles on Monday morning .

"The last remaining French citizen held abroad by a terrorist group has been freed by Al Qaeda militants kidnapped him in Mali three years ago. Serge Lazarevic, 51, was freed by his captors in the desert city of Kidal this morning and is in 'relatively good health',  French President Francois Hollande revealed. He was snatched by armed men from the group known as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on November 24, 2011 while on a business trip with fellow Frenchman Philippe Verdon. There was no immediate information on how the release was secured or whether France paid ransom money to the group, as is often been demanded by Islamist groups after a kidnapping. Hostage: After Serge Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter Diane urged the French President to do everything possible to secure his release . Lazarevic is the last of more than a dozen French citizens taken captive in recent years, with those held in Africa reaching a high of 15 last year. Four journalists held by Syrian jihadists were released earlier this year. 'Our hostage Serge Lazarevic, our last hostage, is free,' Hollande said this morning. 'There are no more French hostages in any country in the world,' he added. Hollande said Lazarevic would be met by his daughter in Niger's capital Niamey before making his way back to France where he and his family would be welcomed by the president. 'He is in relatively good health, despite the gruelling conditions of his long captivity,' Hollande said. A Malian security source explained that the final stages of Lazarevic's release took place in the city of Kidal but refused to say whether a ransom payment or prisoner exchange took place. During his three years in captivity, Lazaravic appeared in several  videos released by Al Qaeda. The most recent video emerged in November and showed Lazaravic claiming to be so gravely ill that he believed his life was in danger. Fears spiked for the safety of the towering Frenchman of Serbian origin in September after hiker Herve Gourdel was abducted in neighbouring Algeria and beheaded  by ISIS-linked militants. Captive: During his three years in captivity, Lazaravic appeared in several videos released by Al Qaeda . After Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter Diane urged Hollande to do everything possible to secure his release in time for Christmas. Kidnapped at a small hotel in Hombori in northern Mali, Lazarevic and Verdon were held captive during one of the most turbulent periods of the country's history. The pair, who worked in security and construction, were accused of being French intelligence agents  by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Their men's families have always denied these allegations. They paid were in the hands of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as it and other hardline Islamist groups launched a takeover of vast areas of northern Mali in 2012, and as they were in turn ousted by the French army who intervened in January the following year. Statement: Francois Hollande (pictured) said Lazarevic would be met by his daughter in Niger's capital Niamey before making his way back to France where he and his family would be welcomed by the president . Verdon, who suffered from an ulcer and tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - was found shot dead last year, and those close to his family suggested he had been executed as he was unwell. Uncertainty remains over the fate of another French hostage, Gilberto Rodrigues Leal, whose death was claimed by an Al-Qaeda splinter group but whose remains have never been found. 'We have the grimmest information concerning him. His family knows this. But, France has no more hostages, it must have no more hostages,' Hollande said. Hollande thanked authorities in Mali and Niger for their assistance in securing Lazarevic's release. 'This liberation was the result of intense and continued efforts from authorities both in Niger and Mali,' the presidency in Niamey said in a statement. While the details of Lazarevic's release were not given, France has repeatedly denied paying ransoms despite being accused of using back-channels to do so by other Western nations. 'France does not pay ransoms, nor does France engage in prisoner exchanges,' Hollande said in September. But he added: 'This does not mean that countries do not do it. It has happened that some countries, to help us, do it. That I concede.' Failed rescue: Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers (left) was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen after U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation rather than make a ransom payment to the terror group. South African teacher Pierre Korkie (right) was also executed . Former anti-terrorism judge Alain Marsaud was far more sceptical on the subject of a paid ransom. 'There is no reason for heated debate. We pay, we pay and that is all,' he told RTL radio. 'There is no release if there is no payment. Someone paid, if not the government, a business or insurance company.' The practice of paying ransom money to terrorist organisations is highly controversial, as the common view is that they only encourage further kidnappings at a later date. Nevertheless the majority of foreign nationals held by the likes of Al Qaeda and ISIS have been freed, with the terrorist groups themselves claiming Britain and the United States  are the only countries who do not make secret payments, often totalling millions of pounds. Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen while U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation. The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists had on Thursday threatened to kill photographer Luke Somers, 33, within 72 hours unless a ransom was paid. Another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by captors in the midst of the raid, US officials said.","Serge Lazarevic, 51, kidnapped by Islamist militants in November 2011 .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced the government will ditch plans for the $7 Medicare co-payment. Instead, an optional co-payment will be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced he will dump his unpopular Medicare co-payment on visits to the GP . Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July 2015. Mr Abbott said the move came after the government consulted with backbenchers, the public and crossbench senators who raised concerns over the co-payment. He made the announcement, which passes the buck to doctors, with Health Minister Peter Dutton. The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP . Now it is up to doctors whether or not they will charged the optional and reduced $5 co-payment . The prime minister told reporters on Tuesday this change in policy would provide savings of $3.5 billion over the forward estimates compared to the previous one, which would save $3.6 billion. Mr Abbott said the new package had significantly improved the government's co-payment measures, while at the same time maintaining the desired price signal. 'But I do want to stress ... bulk billing stays for young people and for pensioners, and the co-payment is at the option of the doctor,' he said. The government announced plans for the co-payment in the May budget, which would have seen all patients pay $7 upfront when they went to see their GP. It was opposed by Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers in the Senate as well as doctors. Australian Medical Association president Brian Owler has welcomed the policy change but said they would have to take a closer look at the specifics of the partial backflip by the government. 'I'm pleased vulnerable patients are being protected and that's something the AMA argues for,' he told Daily Mail Australia. But Dr Owler did add that the onus had now been put on GPs and the more important issue was the freeze on medicare rebates. He said Tuesday's announcement was a 'mixed bag' but it was a significant improvement on what was originally set out in the budget. The decision to scrap the compulsory co-payment comes as Tony Abbott's popularity hits a new low. Mr Abbott closed out the parliamentary year trailing Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as preferred leader by eight points on 39 per cent compared to 47 per cent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll.","The plan to introduce the co-payment was announced in the May budget .

"Amazon is to allow customers to bid on items for the first time in a move designed to take on eBay. The new feature represents a renewed attempt by Amazon to move beyond the fixed-price model on its site. Sellers who are open to bargaining can enable the 'make an offer' button. Once a price is agreed on, the item is placed in the customer's cart and they're free to complete the transaction before their new deal is shipped to their doorstep. Sellers who are open to bargaining can enable the 'make an offer' button. When a customer proposes a lower price, the seller will be notified and will have the option of accepting, rejecting or countering the offer.

Once a price is agreed on, the item is placed in the customer's cart and they're free to complete the transaction before their new deal is shipped to their doorstep. Peter Faricy, vice president of Amazon Marketplace, said the company heard feedback from sellers who said they believed 1:1 negotiations would help drive more sales and loyal customers. 'The new 'Make an Offer' experience is a game-changer for Amazon customers looking for great prices on one-of-a-kind items, and for sellers looking to communicate and negotiate directly with customers in an online marketplace environment just like they do normally in their own physical store or gallery,' he said. In 1999, Amazon launched an online auction site, but the effort failed to compete with eBay Inc. Amazon went on to create a lucrative marketplace for third-party sellers which now accounts for about 40 percent of its quarterly unit sales. In a recent survey of sellers conducted by Amazon, nearly half of the respondents said the ability to negotiate prices 'would be important to drive more sales on Amazon', said Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon Marketplace. The move is the latest in a huge number of launches from Amazon, which include smart speakers and courier delivery in New York. Here, Jess Bezos shows off the firm's Kindle tablets. The largest U.S. online retailer said the new 'make-an-offer' was distinct from an auction because price negotiations are private and a customer will never pay more than the listed price. Sellers have 72 hours to reject, accept or counter an offer from a customer. If the seller counters, the customer has another 72 hours to respond. Amazon plans to expand the 'make-an-offer' option to 'hundreds of thousands' of items in 2015. Items that can be negotiated now include an 1863 document signed by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln sold for $150,000 and a mint-condition baseball signed by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig with a nearly $10,000 price tag.","Make an offer button allows customers to name their own price .

"The Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 killed more than 230,000 people in 14 countries, when waves up to 100ft high swept in over Southeast Asia, displacing millions and destroying infrastructure worth billions. The worst hit country, the archipelago nation of Indonesia, suffered more death and destruction than any other, when the Indian Ocean earthquake was followed by a tsunami on December 26, 2004. Ten years later, communities in Indonesia's Aceh province have rebuilt their homes, towns and villages, rising from the ashes of the single worst tsunami in human history. Scroll down for video .

Indonesia was seriously affected by the tsunami, suffering at least 167,000 casualties, a number which is thought to be closer to 200,000, but it is unlikely that this will ever be confirmed as thousands of bodies could never be recovered as they were swept out to sea by the powerful waves. The tsunami was the effect of an underwater earthquake in the Indian Ocean just after 1am on Boxing Day 2004, the third largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph, with a magnitude of 9.0-9.3 . The gigantic water movement that followed saw waves of up to 100feet hit the coasts of Indonesia, Sri LAnka, India and Thailand. The 14 countries that suffered casualties and damage were situated maily in Southeast Asia but also in Africa. In total, 45 countries lost citizens abroad in the tragedy. In Europe, Germany and Sweden, where Thailand is a popular destination around Christmas time, lost 552 and 571 citizens respectively.

"The former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters . Tony Blair has repeatedly attempted to duck out of an inquiry into the ‘comfort letters’ sent to IRA fugitives by claiming that his ‘commitments’ will make an appearance ‘challenging’. The Northern Ireland affairs committee has spent more than six months attempting to question Mr Blair over secret deals that he made with Sinn Fein. In the negotiations struck with the party, Mr Blair made promises to more than 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences that they would not face prosecution. But in correspondence seen by The Times newspaper, the former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters. He also added that he had nothing ‘new’ to say. In a letter sent last month, he wrote that he had ‘nothing to say which will be new to you, the members of your committee or the people of Northern Ireland.’ The former Prime Minister also noted that he had already given evidence in private to the Hallett Review. He added that, if he came before a public inquiry his evidence would be even more scant. The letter reads: ‘Giving information in public means that I would have rather less to say.’ The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982. The assurance letters came to light during the trial of John Downey - accused of murdering four soldiers in the attack. During the case, it emerged that Mr Downey had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution. A three-month inquiry into the ‘comfort letters’, led by Lady Justice Hallett, concluded that the scheme was not unlawful. Instead, she said that there had been cases where ‘not wanted’ notices were issued to the wrong parties. The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982. Pictured, the bodies of dead horses, covered by blankets, lay on the ground after the explosion in Hyde Park killed members of the Household Guards . But MPs say that their investigation would be more open than the Hallett inquiry, as no transcripts were published following the initial investigation. Laurence Robertson, the Conservative chairman of the Northern Ireland affairs committee, told The Times: ‘We don’t know what he said to the Hallett inquiry,’ he said. ‘We haven’t had a chance to question him on any of the issues.’ Mr Blair concluded his letter by saying: ‘However, if you continue to insist on my attendance, then I will ask my office to look for a date in the new year, but I must emphasise that my commitments... will make this challenging.’ The committee has already said that they would accept video evidence from Mr Blair instead of a personal appearance. A spokeswoman for Mr Blair told The Times last night: ‘We are considering all the options proposed by the committee, given that they have refused to accept the offer of written evidence. ‘It should be noted that Mr Blair has already given evidence to the government’s inquiry led by Lady Justice Hallett and his commitment and respect for the people of Northern Ireland remains undiminished. We will respond to the committee shortly.’","Blair made promises to over 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences .

"Alex Salmond is under pressure to hand back a £65,000 ‘golden goodbye’ he received from taxpayers when he last stood down from Westminster. The former First Minister received a so-called ‘resettlement grant’ when he gave up his Banff and Buchan seat in 2010, but is now plotting a return to the Commons in next year’s election. The money is intended to assist outgoing MPs in ‘adjusting to non-parliamentary life’, even though Mr Salmond has remained in politics. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond announced that he will seek the SNP’s nomination to stand in the north-east seat of Gordon, which overlaps his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency . There was an outcry in 2010 when he received the grant, which in total was just below £65,000 – the equivalent of his annual Westminster salary. The first £30,000 was tax free, leaving a net sum of around £50,000 – half of which Mr Salmond donated to a charity named after his late mother. The resettlement scheme has since been reformed and will be restricted to a maximum of six months’ salary come next May, with only those MPs who fight and lose their seat eligible. It is set to be watered down once again after 2015. Last night, Scottish Conservative North East MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘With Alex Salmond seeking a return to Westminster, the public would generally accept that this money has been paid inappropriately.' Mr Johnstone added: ‘When cash from the taxpayer has been paid out inappropriately, it should be returned. And that’s not just the cash he kept, but the money he gave away too.’ On Sunday, Mr Salmond announced that he will seek the SNP’s nomination to stand in the north-east seat of Gordon, which overlaps his Aberdeenshire East Holyrood constituency. It is held by LibDem grandee Sir Malcolm Bruce with a commanding majority of 6,748, however he is standing down and support for his party is expected to collapse in May’s election. Mr Salmond was previously an MP for nearby Banff and Buchan from 1987 until 2010, with his length of service entitling him to the full £65,000 resettlement grant when he stood down from the Commons. Labour's Margaret Curran stood down from Holyrood for her seat in Westminster and gave her entire resettlement grant to charity . During a televised leaders’ debate in 2010, Scottish Tory MP David Mundeall asked him: ‘The resettlement grant is for people leaving politics so, Alex, are you intending to leave politics?’ Mr Salmond replied that he would make a ‘further substantial donation’ into a charitable trust named after his late mother that helps youth organisations in Aberdeenshire. ‘I know of no person previously in Westminster politics who has said he will donate from the resettlement grant to worthy work in the North-East of Scotland,’ he said. Mr Salmond added: ‘Unfortunately for you and your party, David, I intend to be here for some time to take this nation to freedom.’ If he is successful in his attempt to represent Gordon, Mr Salmond will still be an MSP for Aberdeenshire East until at least 2016. He will receive a ‘dual mandate’ salary made up of his MP wage and a third of his MSP salary, and has promised to donate the extra cash to charity. An SNP spokesman said: ‘The fact that the Tories seem to have conceded that they expect Alex Salmond to be elected in Gordon is a welcome one, but must do little for the morale of their own candidate. ‘After tax paid, half of the resettlement grant was donated to charity and Mr Salmond has made clear that if he is elected and holds a dual mandate, one of his salaries will also be donated to support good causes in the North East - just as he did previously. ‘To date the Mary Salmond Trust has already received £100,000 in this way to support young people in the North East of Scotland.’ The former First Minister is also the final recipient of a controversial non-contributory pension scheme which entitles him to a sum equivalent to half his salary. However, he has vowed to hand the £42,000-a-year deal to the Mary Salmond Trust. In 2011, Labour’s dual mandate MP/MSP Margaret Curran stood down from Holyrood and gave her entire resettlement grant to charity. Meanwhile, Mr Salmond yesterday said he wants to be an MP to ‘to keep hope alive’ for people who voted for Scottish independence. He said the Lib Dems are now a ‘busted flush’ but he expects ‘strong competition’ from the Conservatives in Gordon. However, sitting MP Sir Malcom Bruce said: ‘The people of Scotland and the people of the UK have got to make a decision: what kind of government do you want? ‘Do you want chaos, multi-party inability to make decisions? We've had a strong government that has been able to do that. Or do you want the SNP causing disruption and not representing the interests of the people, certainly of Gordon, who didn't vote to send members to Westminster to break up the UK but actually want Scotland and the UK to work together for the people of Gordon?’","Former First Minister received a 'resettlement grant' when he gave up seat .

"A 2-year-old Florida boy has died after being attacked by four large Rottweilers at his grandfather's home. Citrus County Sheriff's Office says it responded to the residence Saturday afternoon and discovered the body of 2-year-old Christopher Joaquin 'Jack' Camejo in the backyard of the home. Sheriffs say the boy's parents, 29-year-old Christopher Camejo and 31-year-old Claudia Scarbrough, were both inside the residence on West Oak Street in Crystal River at the time, along with friends and two other children. Scroll down for video . Too young: Christopher Camejo, 2, pictured with his father, Chris Sr, was mauled to death by four dogs over the weekend in Florida . Four-legged killers: These four Rottweilers invovled in the deadly attack were taken away by animal control officials  and will likely be destroyed . The mauling took place at this residence on West Oak Street in Crystal River . The toddler, known to his grandfather Joaquin Camejo as 'little man,' was in the care of his mother and his grandfather's girlfriend, Kimberly Fisher. Speaking to WFLA, Miss Fisher tearfully recounted how just after 4pm Saturday she went to use the restroom when the little boy slipped out of the house and was attacked by his grandfather's Rottweilers. 'Had I not gone to the bathroom, this would've never happened,' she said. Devastated: Kimberly Fisher says she went to the bathroom for a moment when her boyfriend's grandson, Christopher, slipped out of the house and was attacked . Spared: Several Rottweiler puppies and a Chihuahua have been left at the Crystal River house . Caged: The animals responsible for the mauling will remain in a shelter pending an investigation . Fisher noted that the four pets had never shown any aggression towards the children. Officers responded to the house at around 4.30pm and discovered the boy's lifeless body covered in teeth marks lying in the backyard. The boy's father was arrested after he was found to be in violation of an unrelated injunction for protection stemming from a domestic violence incident involving his wife of six years. Animal Control officers also responded and removed four Rottweilers and an additional dog from the home, which were taken to a shelter. A Chihuahua and several Rottweiler puppies were left at Joaquin Camejo's home.

"Police who investigated a rape complaint from a young woman who killed herself after being put on trial accused of making up the ordeal have maintained she should never have been prosecuted. Eleanor de Freitas, 23, a brilliant but vulnerable A-grade student, was charged with perverting the course of justice after the man who allegedly attacked her spent up to £200,000 on bringing a private prosecution. Detectives believed Miss de Freitas, who suffered from a psychiatric illness, had told the truth about the rape when she reported it, but they decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction. Eleanor de Freitas (pictured), 23, took her own life on April 7 this year, three days before her trial for perverting the course of justice was to start at Southwark Crown Court in London . The Crown Prosecution Service, however, accused her of making up the rape. Her family said she was so terrified of giving evidence that she took her own life on April 7 this year, three days before her trial was to start at Southwark Crown Court in London. Police investigators said Miss de Freitas, who had bipolar disorder, should never have been charged. But they were overruled by Martin Hewitt, an assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, after lawyers from the CPS held a meeting with him. Detective Inspector Julian King, of Sapphire, the Met’s sexual offences investigation unit, said in a letter this month: ‘I stand by my decision in that I do not believe that Eleanor should ever have been prosecuted for PCJ [perverting the course of justice].’ Police received an allegation of rape from Miss de Freitas (left) in January last year but the case was dropped after Alexander Economou (right), the son of a shipping tycoon, was arrested and released due to a lack of sufficient evidence . CCTV images of him and Eleanor the day after the night of the alleged assault show Mr Economou and Ms de Freitas sharing kisses while shopping together in a lingerie shop . The letter emerged yesterday after the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, who reviewed the case, vigorously defended the decision to take Miss de Freitas to court. Mrs Saunders, who described it as ‘one of the most complex’ cases she had seen, said: ‘The evidence was strong and having considered it in light of all of our knowledge and guidance on prosecuting sexual offences and allegedly false rape claims, it is clear there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction for perverting the course of justice. ‘This was evidence including text messages and CCTV footage that directly contradicted the account Ms de Freitas gave to the police. I am satisfied that the decision-making in this case was correct.’ Miss de Freitas, a former Durham University student, told detectives that Alexander Economou, 35, raped her just before Christmas 2012. Following a police investigation, wealthy financier Mr Economou, from Chelsea, was told he would not face charges, but he then paid for his own inquiry in an attempt to show he was innocent. He assembled emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas sharing kisses. He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Alison Saunders (pictured), said the decision to pursue a criminal case against Ms de Freitas was 'correct' Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year. Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges. But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it. To the horror of Miss de Freitas and her family, it decided to continue. Miss de Freitas killed herself on April 7, three days before she was due to stand trial. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out. Mr Economou says police refused to look at video and text messages that he believes would have exonerated him – a claim the student’s family deny. He had also revealed that he had found photographs of scantily-clad Miss de Freitas on websites where she called herself ‘Goddess Olivia’ and had a secret life offering ‘tantric’ sensual massages to paying customers. Miss de Freitas’s father, David, from Fulham, West London, said CPS lawyers had never met or interviewed his daughter about her allegations. ‘We are disappointed that even in light of the subsequent tragedy, the DPP is digging her heels in,’ he added. An inquest into Miss De Freitas’s death was adjourned in November.","Eleanor de Freitas killed herself days before facing trial over false claims .

"The best tasting ring doughnuts are said to be those straight from the fryer with just the right level of softness, a crispy crust and a light dusting of sugar. And now a mathematician has established the formulae needed to create these perfect doughnuts every time. Dr Eugenia Cheng found that a ring doughnut with a 0.4-inch (11mm) hole has the best ‘squidgy to crispy’ ratio of 3.5 to 1 - and 5.8g of sugar is needed to add the right amount of taste. To get the optimum level of softness to crispness, a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4-inches (11mm). This gives it a 'squidge to crisp' ratio of 3.5 to 1. Its diameter should be between 2.8-inches and 3.2-inches (72mm and 82mm), and then a total of 5.8g of sugar is needed to evenly coat the doughnut . ‘The doughnut, aka torus, is an important mathematical object, as well as being delicious,’ explained Dr Cheng, a senior lecturer of Pure Mathematics at Sheffield University. Commissioned by Domino's Pizza, Dr Cheng devised formulas to find the volume and surface area of doughnuts, the sugar to doughnut ratio, the mass of sugar and the ‘squidge to crisp ratio.’ The optimum 'squidge to crisp' ratio of a ring doughnut formula is pictured . To get the tastiest level of softness to crispness, a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4-inches (11mm). This is a 'squidge to crisp' ratio of 3.5 to 1. Its diameter should be between 2.8-inches and 3.2-inches (72mm and 82mm). A total of 5.8g of sugar is then needed to evenly coat the doughnut. All being equal, the bigger the hole, the crispier the crust and the smaller the hole, the softer the inside. While the sugar to doughnut ratio was established as two over r. Dr Cheng identified the ‘squidge to crisp ratio’, confirms that, all else being equal, the bigger the hole, the crispier the crust. While the smaller the hole, the softer the inside. To get the tastiest level of softness to crispness, a ring doughnut should have an average hole size of 0.4-inches (11mm). This gives it a ratio of 3.5 to 1. Its diameter should be between 2.8-inches and 3.2-inches (72mm and 82mm). ‘This relatively small hole means that the doughnuts are 78 per cent squidge and 22 per cent crisp,’ explained Dr Cheng. ‘You imagine that as the doughnut grows, it has to keep adding on an infinitely thin surface area amount of doughnut, like putting on extra layers of clothing. ‘Of course, there’s no such thing as an infinitely thin layer of doughnut around the outside - in reality it has some thickness. 'This is the crispy part around the outside.’ She took the overall volume of the doughnut and then subtracted the volume of the soft part on the inside, which is itself in the shape of a doughnut. The radius of the doughnut is denoted by R, measured from the centre of the hole to the middle of the dough. While the smaller radius of the dough inside is shown as 'r', measuring the thickness of the dough. Starting with a circle of 5g of caster sugar, Dr Cheng found it covered a radius of 70mm. She then worked out the mass of sugar needed to cover an average doughnut with an R of 30mm and a r of 15mm, before using the ratio to determine 5.8g of sugar is need to evenly coat the Domino's doughnut. The radius of the doughnut (pictured) is denoted by R, measured from the centre of the hole to the middle of the dough. While the smaller radius of the dough inside is shown as r, measuring the thickness of the dough . Dr. Cheng's formulas for the volume of doughnut, surface area, sugar to doughnut ratio, the mass of sugar needed for the doughnut and the 'squidge to crisp ratio' are pictured . The sugar to doughnut ratio was established as two over r. ‘Admittedly if we fix the volume of dough, the amount of sugar we get is proportional to the square root of the size of the hole.’ But Dr Cheng concluded: ‘It’s easy to get carried away messing around with calculus. ‘Go ahead and eat your doughnuts however you like them.’ Dr Cheng recently calculated (pictured) while smaller pizzas have more topping per bite, there is a larger risk of the pizza having a soggy bottom . Dr Cheng recently calculated that in relative terms, the average bite taken from an 11-inch pizza has 10 per cent more topping than the average bite from a 14-inch pizza. Her formula also reveals that while . smaller pizzas have more topping per bite, for home cooks seeking lots of extras on their creations, there is a . larger risk of their pizza having a soggy bottom. She created another formula, alpha, divided by the radius of a pizza, squared to work crust sizes for pizzas of different diameters. She explains the size of the pizza's crust is proportional to the thickness of the pizza - the larger the pizza, the thinner the base, so the smaller the crust. Dr. Cheng has found that the secret lies in proportions of the 14 inch pizza as it cooks just as evenly as the smaller version but the topping is spread over a larger area and goes close to the edge of the pizza. However, technically, pizza lovers in search of the most topping per bite should opt for the 11-inch classic version, based on the research.","Mathematician Dr Eugenia Cheng used calculus to study ring doughnuts .

"Today we call them 'trolls' but in 1911, ground-breaking physicist Albert Einstein coined a different term for relentless critics: 'reptiles.' In a newly unearthed letter he wrote to fellow-physicist Marie Curie, Mr Einstein urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors concerning her heritage and her love life which were circling her at the time. 'If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don't read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated,' Mr Einstein, then 32, wrote on November 23, 1911. Ignore the trolls: In a newly unearthed letter Einstein (left) wrote to fellow-physicist Marie Curie (right), Mr Einstein urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors that were circling her at the time . Astrobiologist David Grinspoon found the letter in a newly-released archive published by Princeton University Press. At the time, Mrs Curie, the first women to win a Novel Prize and a then-38-year-old widow, was being hounded by accusations not only that she was Jewish, and thus undeserving of a position at the French Academy of Sciences, but also that she was having an affair with a married man. The former rumor was false, and the latter turned out to be true. In 1911, Mrs Curie, based in Paris with her two daughters, was competing against 66-year-old Edouard Branly for a physicist seat at the esteemed French Academy of Sciences. Right-wring French newspaper Excelsior was among those who attacked her candidacy, asking incredulously in one headline 'will a woman enter the Institute?' and claiming she was secretly Jewish based on 'scientific' analysis of her facial characteristics and handwriting. That autumn, amid the media storm, Mrs Curie joined Mr Einstein as the only woman at an international physics conference in the Belgian capital of Brussels. Wise words: Astrobiologist David Grinspoon found the letter (pictured) in a newly-released archive published by Princeton University Press . In Mr Einstien's subsequent November letter to Mrs Curie, he wrote: 'I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty, and that I consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance in Brussels.' When Mrs Curie arrived back in Paris, even more accusations had built against her; this time in regards to her relationship with fellow physicist Paul Langevin, who was married but estranged from his wife. The French press got their hands on intimate letters exchanged between Ms Curie and Mr Langevin, and promptly declared her a home-wrecker, according to the American Institute of Physics. 'On her return to France, Mrs Curie discovered an angry mob congregated in front of her home in Sceaux, terrorizing 14-year-old Irène and seven-year-old Eve. 'Mrs Curie and her daughters had to take refuge in the home of friends in Paris,' the site states. Mr Einstein's letter in response to the scandal begins: 'Do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to say. 'But I am so enraged by the base manner in which the public is presently daring to concern itself with you that I absolutely must give vent to this feeling.' Mr Einstein goes on to presume that Mrs Curie probably 'despise[s] this rabble' and blasts the rumor-mills and their 'lust for sensationalism.' He then refers directly to her relationship with Mr Langevin and states he is 'happy' to have Mrs Curie and Mr Langevin as 'personages', describing them as: 'real people with whom one feels privileged to be in contact.' Laugh it off: In 1911, Mrs Curie (right) was facing scandalous rumors that she was secretly Jewish and a home-wrecker, accusations that led Mr Einstein (left) to 'vent' his disapproval . Although Ms Curie didn't get her seat at the French Academy of Science, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry that very same year. It was her second win, having won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. When members of the Swedish Academy of Sciences wrote to Mrs Curie to dissuade her from coming to Sweden to accept her 1911 Nobel Prize based on her bad press, the plucky scientist responded: . 'The prize has been awarded for the discovery of radium and polonium... I cannot accept that the appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by libel and slander concerning private life.' Mrs Curie died in 1934 at the age of 66 from aplastic anemia, which was believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation. In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the 'most inspirational woman in science.' Mr Einstein, who developed the  general theory of relativity in 1916 and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, was famed for his outspoken manner, and his letter to Mrs Curie was characteristic of this approach. He died in 1955 at the age of 76 and left a long legacy of wise-cracking wisdom. 'Only two things are infinite,' he once said. 'The universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.'","In 1911, physicist Marie Curie was facing scandalous rumors that she was secretly Jewish and a home-wrecker .

"A judge has banned app-based taxi company Uber from operating in Spain, following similar actions in countries around the world. Spanish phone companies have been ordered to block the Uber app while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the capital's court services said. Yesterday, Uber was banned from the Indian capital New Delhi, after one of their drivers allegedly raped a customer. App-based taxi service Uber has been banned from Spain after a court ruled their drivers carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition' and lack the 'administrative authorisation' to drive taxis in Madrid . The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the services said in a statement. They also accused drivers hired through the app of  'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job.' The ruling was a 'cautionary measure' adopted while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the service said in a statement. Founded in 2009 in California, Uber is best known for its smartphone app that connects passengers with local drivers, and the company then  charges a commission for each ride. When a journey is complete, customers are invited to 'rate' the driver on a five-star system, and the driver can do the same with the customer. Taking action: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has promised to help police with criminal drivers . The company said last week it was valued at £25.5billion ($40 billion), a double in market value in six months. Uber is now present in more than 200 cities across 45 countries, but that is set to decrease if the bans continue. Dutch judges on Monday banned one of Uber's services, UberPOP, from taking bookings via its smartphone app and threatened the company with fines of up to 100,000 euros ($123,000), saying unlicensed drivers were breaking the law. A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it 'will continue to offer UberPOP.' Monday's decision 'is simply the first step in a long-running judicial battle,' the San Francisco-based company added. A court in Paris is due to decide on Friday whether Uber's services constitute unfair competition to traditional taxi drivers. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have also filed complaints against Uber. In Germany, a court in Frankfurt threw out an injunction against Uber in September. Uber was able to resume operating legally in Germany pending a final ruling on a complaint by the taxi federation. The city government in New Delhi on Monday banned Uber from operating in the Indian capital after a passenger accused one of its drivers of rape. Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement. Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. Uber said there were no defined rules in India on background checks for commercial transport licences and it was working with the government to address the issue. 'What happened over the weekend in New Delhi is horrific,' Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive officer, said in a statement. 'We will do everything, I repeat, everything to help bring this perpetrator to justice.'","Madrid court bans app-based taxi company Uber from Spain .

"Glowing brightly on the tree, these colourful fairy lights look like they could have been bought yesterday. But they were actually purchased on a trip to Woolworths – 45 years ago. Vina Shaddick has displayed them proudly in her living room every Christmas since 1969, and has only had to change one bulb. Vina Shaddick, 65, bought this set of Christmas lights 45 years ago - and has only had to change one bulb . Mrs Shaddick believes the lights (pictured left and right) could be the oldest Christmas lights in Britain . She bought the lights during a lunch-time trip to Woolworths - and shelled out just £3 for the set . They remain in place all year round because they are now too fragile to disassemble, but the 65-year-old says they are ‘still going strong’ - and reckons they are the oldest Christmas lights in Britain. ‘I can still remember buying them,’ said Mrs Shaddick, who lives in Plymouth with her 35-year-old son Ross. ‘Word had got round that Woolies had a special delivery of lights from Germany. 'It was the second year I was married and I went in my lunchtime. They hold a lot of memories for me.’ It is estimated that the lights – which cost just £3 for the set – have been shining for nearly 30,000 hours. This equates to around three years of continuous use. And while they may be doing remarkably well for their age, they are far from the oldest decoration in the house. Mrs Shaddick also has a Christmas tree bought by her mother-in-law in the 1950s, which she displays in another room. The lights have been collectively shining for nearly 30,000 hours (left) - but are not as old as this Christmas tree (right) which was bought by her mother-in-law in the 1950s . Talking about her lights previously, she commented: ‘They really don't make them like this anymore. ‘I can't imagine a set bought today - which are much pricier - lasting as well as these. 'I guess you could say I've had my money's worth from them. 'They've never let me down and it's looking as though they might outlast me now.’ Her son Ross, 35, a music teacher, said: ‘I can't remember a time before the lights, they've always been around. Her son Ross, 35 (pictured), a music teacher, said: ‘I can't remember a time before the lights, they've always been around' Young Ross, pictured left and right, in 1982 with the reliable lights - which are older than he is . ‘They are older than me and have been here all my life. It's been a constant and I hope they keep on working.’ And lights are not the only thing that have lasted since that shopping trip. Mrs Shaddick said: ‘I remember buying some wine glasses and tumblers at the same time. We still have those wine glasses. ‘You wouldn't expect to buy glasses now and expect to still have them in 40 years.’","Vina Shaddick, 65, from Plymouth, bought £3 lights during her lunchtime .

"Chaos on Qantas airlines continues with the fourth flight in 48 hours forced to do an emergency landing due to technical problems. A Melbourne-bound flight was turned back to Hobart Airport just 20 minutes after take off on Tuesday evening. A warning system in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that there was an issue with the aircraft. The aircraft was grounded for two hours while engineers at Hobart Airport investigated the Boeing 717, ensuring it was safe to take off again. The plane was approved for flight and passengers safely arrived in Melbourne just before 9pm (AEST). Three Qantas flights were forced to land on Monday due to various technical malfunctions. A Qantas spokesperson insists that each incident was unrelated. 'It's just an unfortunate series of events,' the Qantas spokesperson said, according to The Age. Scroll down for video . The fourth flight in 48 hours forced to do an emergency landing due to technical problems, with a Melbourne-bound flight turned back to Hobart Airport just 20 minutes after take off on Tuesday evening . While the Qantas spokeswoman said there were 'no reports of any passengers affected', a St John Ambulance spokesman said paramedics were treating 75 people at the airport for smoke inhalation . Travellers took to social media to complain about their flight malfunction, explaining that '400 people at 11pm were being processed by two staff members' as they waited for luggage . On Monday, a Qantas flight from Sydney to Dallas was forced to return to Sydney airport four hours into its journey due to a ‘technical issue’ which affected power to seats, in-flight entertainment and some toilets on board. The flight landed at Sydney airport at 10.30pm. The airline emphasised that the problem was 'non-safety related' and the decision was purely a matter of 'customer comfort.' Earlier that day, two aircrafts were forced to land at Perth Airport in separate incidents. In the early hours of the morning, a Dubai-to-Sydney flight was forced to land when air pressure in the cabin suddenly dropped, whilst in the afternoon a domestic Qantas flight was turned back to Perth  due to a 'strange odour' in the cabin. The disasterous day began with good news for the airline, when Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announced a $550 million improvement on the airline's finances. It had appeared Qantas' fortune was turning around as shares had increased by 14 per cent. But the good luck quickly ended when flights began to turn around instead. Both flights which with unscheduled landings on Monday were grounded at Perth Airport (pictured) It had begun as a positive day for Qantas when CEO Alan Joyce announced a half-year profit of between $300 and $350 million . Just hours before, a domestic flight was turned back to Perth when ‘strange odours’ were smelt in the cabin of Karratha-bound flight QF904. A spokeswoman for Perth Airport said a warning system had also lit up. However, passengers began to complain that they felt unwell and were attended to by paramedics after they safely disembarked the vessel at 3pm, according to ABC News. Up to 80 people were 'assessed for smoke inhalation at Perth Airport', according to a St John Ambulance spokesperson. It was confirmed that all patients, which included pilots and passengers, were cleared and no transportation was required. It's claimed the first grounded plane dropped from 39,000 feet to 9000 feet in just minutes . A Qantas spokeswoman insisted that smoke inhalation would have been impossible as there was no smoke in the cabin at any point . Passenger David Robertson explained that everyone on the flight remained calm after a smell similar to kerosene or 'a dry-cleaning smell' was detected, ABC News reports. 'They just made the announcement that (there was a) strange smell around row five or six, and they're just turned it back for precautionary reasons,' he told ABC. 'Qantas flight QF 904 from Perth to Karatha did an air return at 2.40pm Perth time today following reports by cabin crew of an unusual odour in the cabin,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'The flight landed normally with emergency services on standby as a precaution.' 'The 737 aircraft will undergo an engineering inspection to try and locate the source of the odour.' Passengers were moved to a later Qantas flight. The aircraft was being investigated by engineers and Qantas personnel on Monday. The incident with Flight QF904 was just hours after a Qantas airbus was grounded at the same airport, due to 'a drop in air pressure in the cabin'. Passengers on the plane, travelling from Dubai to Sydney, experienced a dramatic descent into Perth Airport in the early hours of Monday morning. The aircraft experienced technical issues, when reportedly air pressure in the cabin dropped and the plane’s air conditioning unit malfunctioned. Passengers appeared calm as they waited on the tarmac in Perth after the first Qantas incident . A Qantas passenger has documented his terrifying emergency landing experience after the huge double-deck airbus plane was forced to abandon its path when its cabin lost air pressure. The QF2 flight reportedly dropped from 39,000 feet to 9,000 feet in just minutes on its way from Dubai to Sydney. Traveller Nigel Richardson, from Melbourne, documented the dramatic landing on Twitter, and reported those on board were told: ‘Cabin crew this is an emergency descent. The aircraft is in full control’. He commented it was 'sort of a good news / bad news thing.’ ‘Fastest descent I've ever experienced in a plane. Always interesting when you see cabin crew running too,’ he added. ‘Air conditioning problem. Aircraft not in danger. Crew very calm and professional,’ he said, before later being told by staff that the air con was not the problem and they would need to leave the plane at Perth. Live tweeting the terrifying experience, the frequent flyer joked: ‘Look on the bright side. I've never been to Perth before. Unplanned stopover. How long we are here for – TBD.’ Courtney Atkinson tweeted a picture of the flight path and called it an 'interesting start to the day' after the plane dropped in just 'four minutes' Frequent flyer Nigel Richardson was woken up by the plane's quick descent . He kept his Twitter followers updated with the situation and said there was 'full show down of air conditioning system' Mr Richardson joked he had never been to Perth before . ‘Full shut down of air conditioning system that keeps plane pressurised at altitude was the problem,’ he clarified. He said despite the oxygen masks not dropping the incident ‘seemed to scare the crews as much as us’. As the giant plane waited on the tarmac at Perth airport for a decision to be made on what to do next, Mr Richardson tweeted a photo from inside the cabin of people calmly reaching into the overhead lockers, talking and reading on their Kindles and laptops. After first being told an air conditioning problem was at fault, he then said: ‘Air con fault not identified. Expect that ground crew need to talk to Airbus to resolve. Decision to de-plane...’ The passenger said the Qantas crew were 'very calm and professional' Another passenger said the pilot was keeping them informed . Mr Richardson was later told the air con was not at fault . Fellow passenger Gabriella Southwell said that after the plane had made its emergency landing a pilot walking down the aisle ‘keeping people informed’. The AirLive website reported that the A380 was 'circling to burn/dump fuel before landing to Perth'. A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Qantas Flight QF2 travelling from Dubai to Sydney diverted to Perth due to a fault with the air conditioning. The fault occurred about 1 hour from Perth. 'As a precaution the aircraft descended to 10,000 feet and the Captain requested a priority landing . 'The aircraft landed safely and was inspected by engineers. 'As the crew reached their maximum duty limits before the issue could be fixed on the ground, customers have been provided with overnight accommodation and will be booked on the next available services today to their destination.'","Qantas Melbourne-bound flight forced to return to Hobart Airport .

"Millions of motorists admit to driving ‘the morning after’ a night of heavy drinking - even when they suspect they might be over the legal limit, an alarming new AA survey reveals today. One in five of us admit getting behind the wheel next day with enough alcohol still in our system to fail a breath test. Drinking lots of water and eating a fried breakfast were the two favourite hang-over ‘cures’ used by drivers attempting to reduce their alcohol levels after a late night session. Millions of motorists admit to driving ‘the morning after’ a night of heavy drinking - even when they suspect they might be over the legal limit, an alarming new AA survey reveals today . Guzzling water is favoured by nearly four out of ten (37per cent) with a hearty fried breakfast cited by one in six (16per cent), fruit juice by nearly one in ten (9per cent), aspirin by one in 17 (6per cent), going for a run by just 3per cent, the Irn Bru drink and chocolate by 2per cent. However, the motoring group warns that many of the so-called sober up ‘remedies’ are ‘urban myths’. And although some doctors have indicated that these techniques may help soothe a hangover, there is no evidence that they reduce alcohol levels more quickly. So the AA urges motorists that if they are going to drive, even early the next day, then they should not drink. The figures are based on responses from 19,887 adults in an AA/Populus survey. The figures were released to coincide with a Christmas anti-drink driving campaign from the AA and drinks company Pernod Ricard UK. But more than half (54per cent) of drivers do try to avoid drink-driving by agreeing a designated driver before a night out. Drinking lots of water and eating a fried breakfast were the two favourite hang-over ‘cures’ used by drivers attempting to reduce their alcohol levels after a late night session . The poll showed that nearly six out of ten women (58per cent) were likely to nominate a designated driver before a night out drinking compared to just over half of men (52per cent) But only just over four out of ten (43per cent) 18 tp 24 year olds would do so compared with nearly six out of ten (58per cent) of those aged 65 or over. Londoners (40per cent) were the least likely to agree a designated driver but the most likely to plan to use public transport or taxis. Drivers in the east of England (61per cent) and in south west England (60per cent) were most likely to agree a designated driver. In Scotland, where the legal drink-drive limit has just been lowered from 80mgs to 50mgs, nearly one in ten (9per cent ) of drivers opted for soft drink Irn Bru as a alcohol-reduction measure compared with just one in every hundred (1per cent) in the rest of the UK. Figures in Scotland show that of 434 failed breath tests during last week’s four week drink-drive campaign, 10 per cent were after 6am. One in five of us admit getting behind the wheel next day with enough alcohol still in our system to fail a breath test. The ‘drinking-lots-of-water’ method of trying to sober up was most popular in London and south east England, said the report. By contrast the fried breakfast strategy was favoured most by Londoners, those in north east England and by younger drivers. It also noted: ‘Some 9per cent of drivers in Scotland opted for Irn Bru compared to just 1per cent in every other part of the UK.’ AA president Edmund King said: ‘Alcohol levels in the body can still mean that drivers are over the limit the following morning and we want to ensure that people are fully aware of this when they are making the decision whether or not to get behind the wheel.’ He noted: ‘There are many urban myths and rituals used to try to counter hang-overs and reduce blood alcohol levels but the only save method is to drink less or give adequate time for the alcohol to leave your system. ‘But the same penalties, such as minimum year’s ban, for drink driving apply the morning after as they do the night before.’ But Mr King said: ‘It is encouraging to see that many people are choosing to select a designated driver before a night out but it’s really important that they also consider arrangements for the morning after too. Pernod Ricard UK managing director Denis O’Flynn said: ‘It’s clear that a lot of people are making the right choices but often they don’t realise the dangers of driving in the morning after a night of festivities.’ Breath test data shows that in 2013, 3 per cent of drivers and riders failed a breath test following a reported personal injury accident. Drink drive casualty estimates for 2012 show that there were 230 drink drive deaths in 2012. There were 1,430 drink drive killed or seriously injured casualties (KSIs) in 2012. In that same year about 6 per cent of killed motorcyclists and around a quarter of vehicle drivers were found to be over the legal alcohol limit when they died.","Drinking lots of water and eating a fried breakfast are two favourite 'cures'

The twins were born to Curve, a 31-year-old cow, and it is thought the father is Ingani, a 44-year-old elephant bull that died just over a year ago. Although the twins’ father is no longer in the picture, Curve is getting plenty of help from the rest of the herd in caring for her young ones. Pongola Game Reserve management have yet to establish the sex of the twins, as they are giving Curve space to nurse and feed her young ones to ensure they have the best start. ‘Mortality of one of the twins usually occurs as the increasing demand for milk by two calves cannot be met by the mother and the less dominant of the two calves usually cannot gain access to its share, so this is the best start,’ Elephant specialist, Dr. Ian Whyte, formerly of the National Parks Board at Kruger National Park said.

"Every school will teach teenagers how to check for signs of cancer under Labour plans to speed up diagnosis and save lives. A third of young people with cancer only find out after going to A&E, when it can often be too advanced to treat effectively. The plan has the backing of Jane Sutton, whose son Stephen raised more than millions for research into the disease before he died in May after a four year battle with colorectal cancer. Labour has promised to extend cancer awareness lessons to every secondary school in England, inspired by the campaign of Stephen Sutton, who raised millions for the Teenage Cancer Trust,  before his death in May after a 4 year battle with the disease . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said too many students leave school without knowing about the 'warning signs' until it is too late. Under the plan, Labour would make the Teenage Cancer Trust's cancer awareness course available to every secondary school in England. The sessions are designed to 'demystify; the disease and encourage young people to take control of their health. Mr Burnham said: 'Too many young people are leaving education without knowing some of the basics about cancer and how to look out for the warning signs. 'Every young person should, as part of their education, have the opportunity to learn more and know where to go if they are worried.' He said the Teenage Cancer Trust is 'doing brilliant work' and with 'a bit more support' from Government the sessions can be made available to every school in the country. Stephen's mother, Jane, said her son struggled with being diagnosed and backed the idea of giving young people more information about how to spot signs of cancer . Stephen Sutton launched a fundraising appeal for the Teenage Cancer Trust while undergoing treatment for colorectal cancer which eventually raised £5million. His mother, Jane, said he struggled with being diagnosed and backed the idea of giving young people more information about how to spot signs of cancer. She said: 'It is really important that young people are taught the signs of cancer at school. 'Stephen experienced significant issues being diagnosed and who knows what a difference an earlier diagnosis could have made. 'Unfortunately, this situation is not unique to Stephen and many young people with cancer have similar problems being diagnosed. 'We must do all we can to stop this happening to others. Students need to be taught the common signs of cancer and they must be given the confidence to go to the doctors, and to keep on going back if they feel their diagnosis isn't right.' Stephen was awarded a posthumous MBE by the Queen for his work raising money for charity while he underwent treatment. He was told his cancer was terminal in 2012, and documented his treatment in a blog called Stephen's Story which was shared around the world and promoted by celebrities. He pledged to raise for the Teenage Cancer Trust and set a modest target of £10,000, but increased his goal to £1million after he posted his 'final thumbs up' selfie on Facebook in April. His story and the image captured the interest of celebrities and the public, and was shared around the world and people started donating in droves. Before he died on May 14 at the age of 19, the teenager had raised more than £3million and donations continued to be made after his death, tipping £5million. Siobhan Dunn, Chief Executive of Teenage Cancer Trust, said: 'We know young people with cancer have a poorer diagnosis experience than any other age group. 'We hear every day how they and their families often feel angry that they've not been listened to. 'We owe it to young people with cancer to be more vigilant and young people can play their part too if we teach them the signs of cancer and build their confidence to seek help and be persistent at the doctors. 'We are very grateful to Andy Burnham for his support and we urge the other parties to step up too.' Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham too many young people are leaving education without knowing some of the basics about cancer . According to the Teenage Cancer Trust, the five most common signs of cancer in young people are persistent and unexplained: . For more information about cancer in young people visit www.teenagecancertrust.org . Meanwhile, Labour is promising to establish a £330million cancer treatments fund to improve access to cutting-edge surgery and radiotherapy as well as the latest drugs. Mr Burnham said the fund will build upon and expand the current cancer drugs which are due to expire at the end of March 2016. It will be established by adding £50 million from the rebate paid to the government by the pharmaceutical industry to the budget of the existing fund. Labour pointed to figures from Cancer Research UK suggesting that while half of radiotherapy patients should receive the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), only a third actually get it. It said that the number of patients receiving the stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), which is used in the treatment of lung and other cancers, fell by 10% last year. At the same time, 124 patients were sent abroad to receive proton beam therapy as it will not be available in the NHS until 2018. A Conservative spokesman said: 'Only a few weeks ago, Labour's (shadow) health secretary Andy Burnham spoke out against the Cancer Drugs Fund in England, and they are still denying it to NHS patients in Wales. 'Not only is today's promise unfunded, but the Cancer Drugs Fund is only affordable in the first place because of our long-term economic plan that's building a stronger economy. As a result, we've been able to back this GBP1.1 billion fund, which has helped 60,000 cancer patients get the treatment they need. 'Labour, on the other hand, simply don't have a plan, and they wouldn't be able to afford a well-funded NHS or a Cancer Drugs Fund.'","A third of young people with cancer only find out after going to A&E .

"A Polish mother and stepfather who murdered her four-year-old son using 'unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality' have lost an appeal against their 30-year prison sentences. 'Callous and wretched' Magdalena Luczak, 27, and  Mariusz Krezolek, 34, killed Daniel Pelka after they force-fed him salt, beat him and locked him in a tiny room in a 13-month campaign of torture. The couple, jailed for life in August last year, claimed their sentences were 'excessive' but a legal challenge was thrown out by the Court of Appeal today. 'Callous and wretched': Magdalena Luczak, 27, and Mariusz Krezolek, 34, killed her son Daniel Pelka after they tortured him and locked him in a tiny room - but they claimed their 30-year sentences were 'excessive' Shocking: The murder of four-year-old Daniel Pelka was described as one of the worst to ever come before the British courts . Three judges in London also rejected a bid by Mariusz Krezolek to appeal against his murder conviction - describing his application as 'unarguable'. Lady Justice Hallett, announcing the decision of the court today, said the trial judge was 'fully entitled to treat this as one of the most serious offences of murder to come before the courts'. She described the story of Daniel's suffering and death as 'heartbreaking'. Daniel Pelka suffered ‘chronic and systematic’ starvation, which stopped him growing and left him a ‘bag of bones’. She added: ‘He was literally wasting away.’ He weighed less than a toddler and stood six inches smaller than average when he died a few months short of his fifth birthday with at least 30 injuries to his emaciated body. Krezolek beat Daniel around the head and then the couple left him to die alone on March 3, 2012, even having sex as he lay unconscious. THe judge in their murder trial said: 'Harrowing details of the unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality inflicted on little Daniel, over many months, have exposed both the torment and despair he must have suffered and your callous disregard for his pain and distress'. A Serious Case Review into the death found Daniel was effectively ‘invisible’ to officials in Coventry, who failed to speak to the Polish child about a home life in which he was starved, poisoned with salt and held in a bath until he passed out. Police were called to his home 27 times in his short life as his drunk mother got into violent rows with various lovers, often with the schoolboy watching. Before his death Daniel resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’, weighed just 11kg and was so hungry teachers saw him eating food from bins and the school sandpit. The report concluded 'at no point were practitioners who had contact with him prepared to think the unthinkable and consider that he might be suffering abuse'. Luczak’s minimum term of 30 years is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in Britain. It is the same as child-killer Beverley Allitt and is exceeded by only Rose West and Myra Hindley. Convicted killers: Magdelena Luczak, Daniel's mother, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek who were found guilty of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. Krezolek failed to get that overturned . Prison: The tiny unfurnished box room that Daniel was locked in for hours on end. The door had been tampered with so Daniel could not get out . Filthy: A dirty mattress Daniel Pelka was forced to sleep on during his confinement in the box room in his home in Coventry . Murdered schoolboy: The catalogue of injuries inflicted on little Daniel Pelka, which were found when his body was examined . Yet at the time not one professional who came into contact with Daniel and his mother and stepfather from his school, social services, the NHS or the police has been disciplined. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Edis, said Daniel was subjected in the months before his death to a campaign of escalating cruelty including starvation. 'That anyone could treat a child this way is incomprehensible. That his mother and stepfather could is beyond any belief and understanding.' 'In the context of weeks, if not months, of sustained cruelty designed to cause suffering to a four-year-old child, culminating in that child's death, in our judgment, a lack of intention to kill adds very little by way of mitigation.' It was not a case where a child died as a result of one blow, because of an unexpected burst of anger by an uncaring parent, but where there was at least one final fatal bow to an already 'dreadfully abused and neglected child'. Even after that blow was administered, help was not sought until it was far too late, said the judge. 'Both applicants were plainly far more concerned about their own future and their own responsibility than about getting help to a dying child. 'This was an extraordinarily serious case of its type and, in our view, clearly justified the impositon of a very long minimum term. 'That is what they received, and we do not find that the sentence was in any way excessive.'","After 13 months of torture Daniel Pelka died after massive blow to the head .

"Shocking footage has emerged on social media of two young women arguing before one of them throws a punch at the other. Believed to be taken place outside a shopping mall in Melbourne, one female dressed in a black jacket over a white top and denim jeans can be seen confronting the other woman, who is donning a grey jacket, scarf and black tights. 'Nah don't do s***,' the woman dressed in the black jacket said. 'Done what? Am I meant to stop talking to him? Fine, I'll stop talking to him then - I'll block him off Facebook', the one in the grey jacket responded. Scroll down for video . Shocking footage shows two women having a public spat before punches and kicks were throw in Melbourne . They both continue their public spat, which was filmed through a mobile phone camera. The one in the black jacket warns the other woman that if she goes near the guy, she will 'f*****g hit you.' 'Why would you hit me? What did I ever do wrong to you?' the woman in the grey jacket responded. 'You're tuning my mate. And you're f*****g  razzing your boyfriend', the one in the black jacket said before the other one responds: 'I'm not razzing him.' 'Oh really?' as she steps closer to the grey jacket woman but  it appears she has had enough and responds: 'oh f*** off' before walking away slowly. The woman in the black jacket is seen punching and kicking her opponent before a passerby jumps in to stop . But the black jacket pulls her arm back and said: 'No! Come here b****!'  before taking the first swing at her opponent as she falls to the ground. She continues kicking the woman in the grey jacket a number of times in the face and then she grabs her opponent's hair but a passerby quickly jumped in and pulled the attacker away. 'Hey! Hey! Get the f*** off her! Get off her you f*****g idiot!' the man yelled as he intervened the brawl and ripped the attacker off the victim as she's squealing on the ground. It is unclear what followed after the video ended but it seems the brawl ended when the man stepped in. The video, captioned 'WTF! Girl knocks out girl in Melbourne! SMH' was posted onto Facebook by Brisbane rapper Fortafy on Tuesday morning and has received more than 200,000 views.","Shocking footage shows two women having a public spat in Melbourne .

"British nurse William Pooley who survived Ebola, has described the new Band Aid charity single as 'cringeworthy' The British nurse who survived Ebola has described the new Band Aid 30 charity single as 'culturally ignorant and cringeworthy'. William Pooley - who went back to work at an isolation unit in Sierra Leone in West Africa, just weeks after he was airlifted to London for treatment - described the lyrics as 'a bit much'. His comments come after pop star Emeli Sande, who featured in Band Aid 30, said the song needed rewriting and celebrities, MPs and charities have joined a backlash against it, claiming it 'patronises' Africa. Pooley criticised the lyrics in the reworked version of Do They Know It's Christmas? featuring One Direction, Bono and Ed Sheeran and put together by Bob Geldof. 'On the way into work I heard the first half of it. It's definitely being talked about here among my colleagues,' he told Radio Times magazine. 'But stuff about Do They Know It's Christmas? - it's just like, actually people live normal lives here and do normal things. 'It's Africa, not another planet. That sort of cultural ignorance is a bit cringeworthy. There's a lyric about 'death in every tear'. It's just a bit much.' Asked if he had a message for people back in Britain, he said: 'I would say that it's a good idea to read as much as you can about what's going on in West Africa, and if you feel so inclined then donate some money to one of the charities, like King's, that are working out here, directly caring for Ebola patients.' It has faced a barrage of criticism from those who say the lyrics are outdated and perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries. Emeli Sande, who featured in Band Aid 30, said the song needed rewriting. His comments come after pop star Emeli Sande, who featured in Band Aid 30, said the song needed rewriting and celebrities, MPs and charities have joined a backlash against it, claiming it 'patronises' Africa . Pooley criticised the lyrics in the reworked version of Do They Know It's Christmas? featuring One Direction, Bono and Ed Sheeran and put together by Bob Geldof . She apologised 'if the lyrics of the song have caused offence' and said that new lyrics she and African artist Angelique Kidjo recorded did not make the final version. Lily Allen also said  she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was 'something smug about it'. She added: 'I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.' Meanwhile British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG revealed he pulled out of the project because he disagreed with the lyrics, which have been revised since the first Band Aid track in 1984. Writing on Twitter, the 26-year-old said he felt the message of the song was ‘not in line’ with his own thoughts on how to help Africa. Sir Bob supported his decision, adding: ‘He said he just felt awkward’. But the Boomtown Rats star, 63, responded furiously to his other critics. Appearing on Sky News he said their concerns were a ‘complete load of b*******’. The new recording - which became the fastest selling single of the year - marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. One Direction were projected onto the Houses of Parliament on Sunday night to promote the single . Sir Bob Geldof bought the first Band Aid 30 single the morning it went on sale at ASDA Trafford in Manchester . Checkout worker Ali Hallam handed over a few copies of the single to the Boomtown Rats hitmaker on Monday morning . Liberian academic Robtel Pailey, 32, who studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, has previously labelled the lyrics are ‘incredibly patronising and problematic’. She told Radio 4’s Today programme:‘It paints the continent as unchanging and frozen in time. If you look at the revised lyrics, there are references to ‘them’ versus ‘us’. ‘And the fact of the matter is, if you look at countries that have been most affected by Ebola, the vast majority of the population in Sierra Leone is Muslim, the vast majority of the population in Guinea is Muslim. Yes, we know it is Christmas, but not all of us celebrate Christmas.’ When it was first released in 1984, the Do They Know It’s Christmas? came under fire for perceived inaccuracies and offensive lyrics. At the time, the line ‘There won’t be snow in Africa’ was criticised by those who pointed out there is snow in some parts of the continent. U2 singer Bono – who also recorded the latest version – later admitted he ‘loathed’ another line which said: ‘Well tonight thank God it’s them instead of you.’ This year, it was replaced with the words ‘Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you’, while the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ was replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear.’ Mr Pooley, from Eyke in Suffolk, became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August. He was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp and left hospital in September after making a full recovery. The nurse said that money coming in from governments was 'filtering through at a glacial pace'. 'Governments pledged money months ago... I don't know whether it's working. I'm sure it's better to donate than not, but it's just a shame it gets tied up in lots of bureaucracy,' he said. He added: 'There are still people outside the front of the hospital dying of Ebola because there aren't enough beds for them. I had hoped that by now that would have been over.' Mr Pooley, who will be celebrating Christmas with a meal 'and a few beers' after his shift ends at Freetown's Connaught Hospital, dismissed the idea that he was a hero. 'I'm working with masses of local staff who are risking death,' he said. 'The big problem at the moment is they haven't been paid for months -which sounds bad enough to English ears, but in Sierra Leone if you're not getting paid, then you're facing starvation. But they're still coming to work. They are the heroes.'","Nurse William Pooley was the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola .

"Police are hunting for a ginger-haired man who raped an 11-year-old girl as she walked home from school. Pictured: A police e-fit of the suspect . An 11-year-old girl was  raped in broad daylight after being dragged into bushes on a secluded footpath as she walked home from school. The male attacker, described as having ginger hair and wearing a black beanie, carried out the sexual assault in Crawley, West Sussex, in September this year. Police said the victim was left so distressed by the alleged attack  that she only found the courage to report it recently. The young girl told a member of staff at her school three months after the attack how the man forcibly grabbed her and shoved her into nearby bushes. The staff member immediately contacted Sussex Police, which launched an investigation. Detectives have now released an efit, in an attempt to track down the main suspect. The girl's attacker is described as aged about 40, with ginger and grey hair. He also had ginger face stubble and was wearing a black fleece beanie hat and a knee-length khaki-coloured coat, police said. Although the girl is unable to remember the exact date of the attack, police believe it happened at around 3pm on September 22. Forensic investigators have scoured the area searching for DNA clues  the identity of the attacker. Police have also carried out house-to-house inquiries in the area where the attack took place, between Blackwater Lane and Balcombe Road. The young victim and her family are being looked after by specially-trained officers, police say. Detective Inspector James Norbury, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'This was an extremely distressing incident for the young victim who has only just built up the courage to report it and she and her family are now being supported by specially trained officers. 'Although she can't remember the exact day it happened, she believes it is around September 22. 'It was light and a busy time of day so we are appealing to anyone who might have been in that area of Maidenbower around 3pm. 'An e-fit of the suspect has been put together and the rapist is described as being aged about 40 years, with ginger and grey hair, gingery face stubble and wearing a black fleece beanie hat and knee length khaki coloured coat.'

"Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have been provided with a chilling list of dos and don'ts explaining how to treat the thousands of sex slaves held in the terror group's prison-brothels. A document issued earlier this month by the group's 'Department for Prisoners and Women's Affairs' explains in sickening detail exactly who can be made a sex slave, when a woman should be beaten, and under what circumstances it is justified to rape prepubescent girls. Up to 5,000 kidnapped women and children are held as sex slaves in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq controlled by ISIS, many of them in the group's stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa. The vast majority of the captives are members of the Yazidi religion who were kidnapped during the Mount Sinjar massacre in early August. The rules state that these women can be imprisoned and raped on a daily basis by militants who purchase them as slaves for as little as £27 each. Scroll down for video . Supporters: Taking the form of a 'Slavery for Dummies' guide, the document is laid out in a notably simplistic question and answer format designed to assist even the least intelligent jihadi in his treatment of sex slaves . Slavery: This 15-year-old Yazidi girl - who did want to be identified for fear of retribution -  escaped ISIS militants by drugging and shooting the two 'husbands' who bought her as a sex slave . The document outlining the rules by which Islamic State militants can take and hold slaves was released by the terror group's 'Department for Prisoners and Women's Affairs' on December 3. The department, headed by a militant known as Abu Suja, helps the terror group enforce policy decisions made by the Shura Council - a kind of religious advisory body appointed by leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to study the Koran and make rulings based on their interpretation of sharia law. Taking the form of a 'Slavery for Dummies' guide, the document is laid out in a distinctly simplistic question and answer format designed to assist even the least intelligent jihadi in his slave treatment. The U.S.-based Middle East Media Research Institute obtained an original copy of the document, and published full details of it on the  monitoring group's website. Answers are provided to sickening questions such as 'Is it permissible to have intercourse with a female captive immediately after taking possession?', and 'If the female captive was impregnated by her owner, can he then sell her?'. Horror: The vast majority of the captives are members of the Yazidi religion who were kidnapped during the Mount Sinjar massacre in early August. This young woman is one of the lucky few who managed to escape . While ISIS' sale of oil on the Middle Eastern black market has long been known, far less has been written about the terror group's import taxes and sale of antiques. ISIS is believed to generate several million pounds a day, with approximately £400,000 of that coming from the sale of oil. A further £250,00 comes from extortion and protection money paid by companies and individuals operating in areas under its control, while ISIS also makes money from farming, water services  and electricity production. Revenue obtained from ransoms paid by the families or governments of kidnapped individuals in less easy to calculate, but the price for release is usually millions of pounds. Companies and lorry drivers are forced to pay road and import taxes to use roads in areas under ISIS' control - with lorries charged £500 per journey, plus a further £250 tax for electronic good and £200 for food parcels. However one expected source of income is the looting of antiques from the many ancient religious sites in areas under its command. For example, one Iraqi intelligence official claimed that ISIS earned £23 million in early 2014 alone by selling £8,00 items stolen from the ancient city of Al-Nabk near Damascus. According to the document, slave women are known as al-Sabi by ISIS militants, and can only be taken from 'ahl al-harb' - any group of people with which the terror groups considers itself at war. It goes on to make detailed cases for why polytheists and 'People of the Book' such as Christians and Jews are permissible to take as slaves, but explains the Islamic State 'leans toward accepting the consensus view' among Islamic scholars that ex-Muslims are not allowed to be captured. The rape of a female captive, the document explains, is perfectly acceptable even for married men. It then uses a passage from the Koran, which says Allah rewards Muslims who are chaste with everybody other their wives and 'those their right hands possess'. The ISIS guide claims the above 'right hands' statement is a reference to captured women. One chilling passage in ISIS' sex slave document explains that virgins can be raped immediately after their 'owners' purchase them. Those who have previously had sexual intercourse must have their uterus' 'purified' first. Another line says it is legal to have sex with a prepubescent child providing she is 'fit for intercourse.' There is no further explanation as to what such a horrific statement may mean. Yazidis (pictured) - whose belief system mixes elements from a range of religions and whose central figure of worship is a 'Peacock Angel' - are believed to be satanists by fighters loyal to the Islamic State terror group . Jihadis: According to the document, slave women are known as al-Sabi by ISIS militants (pictured) and can only be taken from 'ahl al-harb' - any group of people with which the terror groups considers itself at war . The document was released as it emerged dozens of young British women are using social media to boast of joining the Islamic State's terrifying all-female police force – claiming to be doling out savage beatings, punishment lashings, ordering executions and managing brothels where thousands of Yazidi sex slaves are imprisoned and raped daily after being sold for as little as £27. Britons including privately-educated Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood, 20, and Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, are understood to have joined the Al-Khansa Brigade in ISIS' Syrian de facto capital Raqqa, helping to patrol the city with guns and daggers hidden beneath their religious robes. The group, which is largely made-up of educated Western women, operates as an ultra-oppressive police force monitoring the behaviour of females in Raqqa - meting out brutal punishments to anyone wearing shoes that aren't black, or those wearing veils made from the wrong material. One woman notorious for the references to the Al Khansa Brigade is British national Umm Farriss, who also calls herself Umm Anwar. Earlier this year she described a chilling encounter with a Yazidi 'slave girl'. Umm Farriss claims she entered a building in the city of Raqqa and greeted the entire room. She then described in sickeningly mocking tones how the abused Yazidi sex slave offered a 'salam' [hello] in response. Sex slaves are believed to be controlled by an all-female police force known as the Al Khansa Brigade in ISIS stronghold and de facto capital city Raqqa. One woman notorious for references to the brigade is British national Umm Farriss. She uploaded this photograph of herself to Twitter earlier this year . Sick: Umm Farris recently  described an encounter with a Yazidi sex slave in a mocking post on Twitter . ISIS has attempted to justify the keeping of sex slaves by claiming that members of the Yazidi religion are devil worshippers - making them worse than so-called 'people of the book' such as Christians and Jews, who can escape imprisonment by paying a monthly tax known as jizyah. A woman aged 40 to 50 - 50,000 dinars (£27) A woman aged 30 to 40 - 75,000 dinars (£40) A woman aged 20 to 30 - 100,000 dinars (£53) A girl, aged 10 to 20  - 150,000 dinars (£80) A child under nine - 200,000 dinars (£106) Captured Yazidis - whose belief system mixes elements from a range of religions and whose central figure of worship is a 'Peacock Angel' - are not able to pay their way out of jail, however. Men and boys are told to convert to Islam or face immediate death, while women and children are often transported to Raqqa, where the Al-Khansa Brigade force them into sex slavery. Earlier this month a chilling document emerged purporting to show the 'price list' for sex slaves. According to the document, obtained by website Iraqinews.com, just £27 will fetch a Yazidi or Christian woman aged between 40 and 50. Chillingly, a child between one and nine will fetch four times that.","Document explains in sickening detail who can be made a sex slave .

"A Melbourne woman who climbed into her unit garbage chute and fell to her death was in a sleepwalker-like state, a coroner has found. Police determined Phoebe Handsjuk, 24, had committed suicide on December 2, 2010, but her family rejected that finding. Ms Handsjuk was found dead beneath the chute in the luxury St Kilda Road unit complex where she lived with her partner, events promoter, Antony Hampel, some 20 years her senior, who is also the son of retired Victorian Supreme court justice, George Hampel. It has now emerged she suffered a 'catastrophic severance injury' to her lower right leg after falling down the chute,The Age reports. The tragic death of 24-year-old Phoebe Handsjuk was ruled to have been an accident . Coroner Peter White found Ms Handsjuk was in an alcohol and Stilnox sleeping pill stupor, or a 'state similar to that of sleepwalking', when she climbed into the chute and began climbing down. He determined Ms Handsjuk's 'enthusiasm for climbing and penchant for physically challenging activity' had played a part in her descent down the chute. But he categorically ruled out suicide or murder, saying no one had a motive for killing her. Mr White said Ms Handsjuk's death was set against a backdrop of depression, talk of suicide, a troubled relationship with Mr Hampel and alcohol abuse. He said she was either in an unconscious state with a level of motor control or deeply confused and unable to think rationally. Either way, he determined she climbed into the chute without any awareness of the danger of her behaviour. The Melbourne woman's body was discovered at the bottom of her luxury apartment building . 'The precise effect that (sleeping pills) and alcohol had upon her cannot be established to a great degree of certainty,' Mr White said. 'I am satisfied however that her use of these substances in combination did in fact impact upon her mental state in a significant way and directly led to her entry into the chute.' He also said the cut to her leg was a major contributing factor to her death which occurred after she put a bag of rubbish in the chute first. Mr White explained how a compactor in the garbage room almost removed her right foot and said she 'fought bravely' to escape. Handsjuk's grandfather, Lorne Campbell, conducted his own investigation into her death and said it was absurd to suggest she could have climbed into the garbage chute while intoxicated. 'It is my opinion ... that she was killed by one or more people,' the retired detective told the Victorian Coroners Court inquest in August. A coroner ruled she climbed into the chute outside her 12th-floor apartment in an alcohol induced or sleepwalking-type state . But Mr White said the nature of her injuries suggested she climbed a significant way down the chute in a 'controlled passage'. 'The evidence does not suggest that she undertook this conduct either intending to end her own life or as the result of an assault by, or with the aid of, any other person,' he said. Mr Hampel said in a statement on Wednesday: 'It was hard enough to lose Phoebe Handsjuk, who was a vibrant and loving young women in her mid-20s when she died four years ago, but it was even harder dealing with the false claims and totally unjustified allegations which followed.' 'These wild allegations have now been put to rest by the robust coroner's investigation and report handed down today. None of this will bring back Phoebe. My hope is that we can allow Phoebe to rest in peace,' he added. Ms Handsjuk was dating events promoter Antony Hampel at the time of her death. He said on Wednesday: 'My hope is that we can allow Phoebe to rest in peace' Coroner White recommended that the dosage of Stilnox to female patients be reduced by 50 per cent. He also recommended that Stilnox only be available in 5mg tablets in Australia, rather than both 5mg and 10mg forms. On a tribute website set up for Ms Handsjuk's family she is described as 'extremely sensitive, caring and compassionate. She was artistically gifted and creative. Strong willed, and often quick tempered, she had a cheeky, playful sense of humour.' The article explains: 'Phoebe started experimenting with drugs at quite a young age. She struggled with alcohol and used it to overcome her anxieties. 'She suffered from depression and was taking medication and seeking counselling to assist her.'","Melbourne woman's death on December 2, 2010 has been ruled as accidental .

"Britons pay one of the highest proportions of property tax in the world, it has been revealed. Researchers have found that £1 in every £8 which is paid to the taxman is levied on people’s homes and business premises. This includes stamp duty, inheritance tax, council tax and business rates and has risen from £1 in every £12 in 1990. Startling figures show the Government raked in almost £65billion in property taxes in 2012 – an increase of £6billion in just three years. As a proportion of the total tax received, UK property tax is higher than in any other country analysed by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The figures will put pressure on Labour to quash its plans for a mansion tax, which would place an additional levy on those with homes worth more than £2million. The OECD looked at 34 mostly rich nations, from Japan to the United States, and found that, on average, £1 in every £18 of tax paid was on property. In Austria the figure was just £1 in every £77, while in Australia and France it was £1 in £12. UK taxpayers also pay the highest property taxes as a proportion of the country’s economic output, or GDP, according to the OECD. Startling figures show the Government raked in almost £65billion in property taxes in 2012 - an increase of £6billion in just three years. Stock image used . Property tax in Britain is the equivalent of 4 per cent of GDP compared to an average of 1.8 per cent across the other 34 nations – and just 1 per cent in Germany, Sweden and Chile. Britons also hand over a higher proportion of income tax than the OECD average, but a lower percentage of national insurance contributions. The figures come just days after the Treasury unveiled reforms to stamp duty in a bid to reduce the tax burden on people buying homes. Chancellor George Osborne replaced the much-hated ‘slab structure’ with a gradual system, which he claimed would benefit 98 per cent of house-movers. Only those buying a home for more than £937,500 will find themselves paying more under the new rules, he said. Responding to the OECD figures last night, Paula Higgins, of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘These are quite shocking statistics. ‘Taxation of people’s property is a tax on the aspirations of hard-working families and removes the incentive to buy a home.’ The figures come just days after Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) unveiled Stamp Duty reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on homebuyers . Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘From business rates to council tax, the Treasury uses punitively high taxes on bricks and mortar to fill the holes in the coffers. ‘The Chancellor took some promising steps in the right direction with his reform of stamp duty, but there remains much more to do on that, and other taxes, before British taxpayers get a fair deal.’ Property tax includes business rates, which retailers pay on shops they rent. Critics say this puts bricks and mortar stores at a disadvantage compared with online retailers. Stephen Herring, of the Institute of Directors, welcomed a review of business rates announced during the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement, saying it should focus on reducing the burden for small and medium-sized firms. Last night a Treasury spokesman said: ‘Reforms in the Autumn Statement mean we have cut stamp duty for 98 per cent of people who pay it and the tax bill for the average home is more than halved. This is a fairer system. ‘The UK’s property taxes are at the right level when compared to other developed economies.’","Britons are paying the highest proportion of property tax in the world .
This includes stamp duty, inheritance tax, council tax and business rates .

"A senior Sun reporter walked free from court yesterday after being cleared of illegally paying a public official. Nick Parker, 53, was acquitted of aiding and abetting Surrey police officer Alan Tierney, 42, to commit misconduct in a public office. It was alleged Parker paid him for stories in 2009, including a tip-off that Chelsea footballer John Terry’s mother had been caught shoplifting. Cleared: Nick Parker, 53, was acquitted of aiding and abetting Surrey police officer Alan Tierney, 42, to commit misconduct in a public office. But the jury did find him guilty of handling stolen goods . But the chief foreign correspondent was found guilty of handling stolen goods, after provisionally agreeing to pay £10,000 for a Labour MP’s mobile phone, and handed a three-month suspended sentence. The Old Bailey heard he went through dozens of texts and emails on the phone belonging to Siobhain McDonagh – then a whip in Gordon Brown’s government. She had received messages about the Miliband brothers as they battled for the Labour leadership, including one that said: ‘I will kill myself if Ed wins.’ Parker, from London, had claimed he had no idea the phone had been stolen when he looked through it in 2010. Acquitted: Former Whitehall editor Clodagh Hartley was cleared of illegally paying for Budget leaks . Michael Ankers, 30, who snatched the phone from Miss McDonagh’s car, was jailed for six months for theft. The thief, who is currently in prison for drug dealing, demanded £10,000 from The Sun for the phone. But Parker found nothing newsworthy enough for publication and handed it in to police the next day. The verdict comes two weeks after another Sun reporter was acquitted of corrupting a public official. Clodagh Hartley, 40, was cleared of illegally paying £17,000 for leaks from the Budget in 2010, after telling jurors she was trying to expose political spin.","Nick Parker, 53, was acquitted of aiding misconduct in a public office .

"A new crackdown has been launched against the estimated six millions drivers who fail to declare endorsements on their licence when taking out car insurance. Figures from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) show that 16 per cent of the UK's estimated 35 million motorists fail to disclose their driving record accurately, including disqualifications and serial speeding convictions. The deception is usually committed by drivers who fear their insurance policy may be refused or made too expensive if they told the truth. However, if they have an accident, the failure to declare can make their policy invalid. Around 16 per cent of the UK's estimated 35 million motorists fail to disclose their driving record accurately which includes disqualifications and serial speeding convictions . Recent figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) suggest that last year some 180,675 attempts were made to obtain cheaper cover by providing false information or withholding details such as past convictions - equivalent to nearly 3,500 every week. This adds on average an extra £50 to every household's annual insurance bill. The ABI said examples of fraudulent applications include a motorist with a poor credit rating tried to use an alias to buy motor cover, an applicant failing to disclose four previous claims and an unspent motoring conviction which had led to a 3 year prison sentence. Another driver attempted to alter his driving licence to remove driving convictions. The new licence-checking system called 'MyLicence' involves a partnership between the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). The two groups will supply a data-sharing service to the motor insurance industry with insurers able to use accurate information about drivers' records to assess risk and prevent fraud at the point of quote or renewal. It was developed in partnership with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) in response to the Government's Insurance Industry Access to Driver Data programme and the DVLA's aim to digitalise the data it holds. The money raised by insurers from the crackdown could be use to cut up to £50 from the premiums of honest law-abiding motorists and reduce the bills of over two million motorists who make the mistake of 'over-declaring' convictions that may be spent. But insurers say the system will not spot the millions more drivers who tell 'little white lies' to cut the cost of their premiums – such as stating a vehicle is parked in the driveway when in reality it is parked out on the road. The new licence-checking system create a data-sharing service to the motor insurance industry with insurers able to use accurate information about drivers' records to assess risk and prevent fraud at the point of quote or renewal . A spokesman for ABI said it will allow the motor insurance industry to have 'instant access to accurate driving history data' via a secure MIB hub and the use of a driving licence number.' She added: 'The MIB Hub is expected to receive and respond to tens of millions of insurer requests each day and will enable insurers to capitalise on the advantages of using accurate data to assess risk and prevent fraud at the point of quote or renewal. ' ABI policy director and deputy director general Huw Evans added that the new system was the latest in a series of legal reforms designed to crack down on fraudulent insurance claims and practices which had led to the motor insurance claims system being branded as 'dysfunctional' and Britain 'the whiplash capital of Europe' by MP watchdogs. Transport minister Claire Perry said: 'MyLicence is good news for motorists and good news for the motor insurance industry. 'This Government is investing in the service which will allow insurers to price much more accurately and should reduce premiums for honest motorists.' Janet Connor managing director of AA Insurance noted: 'Insurers are getting better at detecting both claims and application fraud where those applying for cover are 'economical with the truth'. Yet the number of attempts to make a deceitful buck from insurers shows no sign of falling. She added: 'These are serious issues for the industry and it's not acceptable that the majority of honest people have to stump up to pay for the dishonesty of others.' Julie Daniels, head of motor Insurance at comparethemarket.com said: 'Any efforts to increase accurate information being provided to insurers can only be good news for consumers as this should help lower motor premiums. 'I believe that there will be little material change in premiums until the My Licence initiative is used across the industry and would therefore encourage take up.' She said: 'Driving down motor premiums is a priority for the insurance industry and the government. It is vitally important that running a car remains affordable as an increasingly mobile society means that families are working and living further apart – so as well as the practical, everyday benefits of car ownership, there is the social advantage of better connectivity to friends and family.'","Last year 180,675 people gave false information to get cheaper cover .

"It's the little newsagency that just keeps on giving back. Over $2.2 million worth of prize money has been won from tickets purchased at the Evatt Newsagency in Canberra in just over six months. Most recently, the store sold Friday's $1 million dollar winning Lotto ticket to an anonymous victor. The Evatt Newsagency in Canberra has sold three division one winning Lotto tickets in just over six months . Clearly a case of 'third time lucky', it was the third division one winning ticket to be sold by the store since May. The newsagency has been swamped by customer hoping to get lucky since only the second win according to Sateesh, who owns and runs the store alongside his wife. 'I can see a lot of new faces in the shop who come to buy the tickets only here because it's now considered lucky,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The most recent win of $1 million on Friday was won by one of the store's customers who prefers to remain anonymous . 'New people are coming in every time and a lot of people are also winning small amounts too. 'It is its very exciting and the people who won are having their wishes come true.' The first lucky customer to win at the store was a man in his 60s whose entry into the Saturday Lotto won him over $687,000 back in May. The newsagency, located in Canberra, has been swamped by customer hoping to get lucky since only the second win according to Sateesh, who owns and runs the store alongside his wife . The Canberra man, who said he planned to spend some of the money on a holiday, first said: 'are you kidding me? Blimey, I've cracked the big one,' upon being informed of his win, the Canberra Times reports. Five weeks later, a local father won more than $708,000 from his first division purchase.

"Police officers who used their positions to get into 'sold-out' gigs have been allowed to keep their jobs - and will not be formally disciplined, it has emerged. The four Greater Manchester Police licensing officers asked for 'favours' from venues in the city, such as access to tickets to music events they would not otherwise have been able to get. Afterwards, the veteran officers, who worked in Manchester city centre, failed to declare what they had done on the force's gifts and hospitality register. Four police officers who used their positions to get into 'sold out' gigs will not be formally disciplined (file picture) They have since been moved out of the unit and into other jobs after they were deemed to have broken the force's ethical code of conduct. A two-month police professional standards investigation found they had not acted illegally - or that they required formal disciplining. The officers were told on Friday that they were being moved from licensing into the division's response unit as a result of the findings. It is not known which music events and venues were involved. Nick Adderley, chief superintendent for Greater Manchester Police's northern division, said: 'We have high standards, including the code of ethics, and I'm saying I will not tolerate any officers or member of staff who breaches that code of ethics.' It is understood the practice came to light as part of a separate investigation, which unexpectedly opened up an email trail suggesting officers had been seeking and accepting favours while not declaring them. On more than one occasion an officer had called up a venue whose gig had sold out and used their position in licensing to get hold of a ticket - but then did not declare it through the official channels. The Greater Manchester Police licensing officers asked for 'favours' from venues in the city, it has been revealed. The force headquarters is shown above . They had never obtained the tickets for free, however, and had always paid the full value. It is unclear how long the practice had been going on but investigators who looked back over recent months found at least two cases per officer where a deal of that kind had been struck. All the officers had been in their posts for a significant length of time. Nothing criminal was found to have taken place and the officers have not been formally suspended or disciplined. Senior officers are expected to sit down with the city's Pub and Club Network later this week to discuss the matter. The network's spokesman Phil Burke said: 'We don't know the full facts of this yet. 'But the officers concerned are well liked and well respected in the city's licensing trade and have always worked closely with us.'","Four licensing officers in Manchester broke force's ethical code of conduct .

"A Canadian YouTube user has posted a video of what he claims is the 'world's ugliest Christmas sweater', which features a working toy train set and colorful festive lights. The sweater is showcased in a newly-released video by YouTuber bd594 and was made using a knitted sweatshirt found at Goodwill which the anonymous Canadian accessorized using a variety of over-the-top festive decorations, including a toy train set and snowy scenery, and a string of colored festive lights. And as if that wasn't enough, the video also highlights a variety of other functions for the quirky knitted creation, including using the train set scenery to serve drinks at a party or wearing the warm sweater while out walking your dog. Scroll down for video . The ultimate upcycle: YouTube user bd594 created the 'world's ugliest Christmas sweater' using a knitted sweatshirt he found at Goodwill . How handy: The Canadian highlights a variety of other functions for the sweater, including using it as a drinks tray . bd594's festive upcycle video will no doubt serve as inspiration to anyone out there who is eager to create their own ugly Christmas sweater at home, rather than shelling out upwards of $50 for the more fashionable options currently available in stores like Target, Macy's and Nordstrom. This holiday season has already seen a huge increase in the number of ugly Christmas sweaters being sold - and bought - throughout the US. Last week, fashion website Rent the Runway announced that it has launched a Christmas sweater hire scheme, which enables customers to rent ugly festive knitwear for the bargain price of $15 for four days, rather than splashing out and buying their own. The website's Christmas capsule collection features 12 different vintage designs, ranging from the awkwardly traditional to the over-the-top ridiculous, with one sweater even featuring a 3D puppet which had been sewn onto the front of it. See full video here . Going into detail: The scenery featured on the sweater is incredibly ornate - and festive . WARNING: bd594's video comes complete with a number of cautions for anyone who dares to try and recreate the sweater themselves . But nothing in Rent the Runway's selection - nor indeed in any other ugly sweater retailer's collections - quite compares with bd594's creation. Wearing such an ornately-decorated sweater does have its drawbacks however, as the YouTuber makes sure to point out in his video with a number of clearly-demonstrated warnings. 'Caution!!! When wearing outdoors,' one clip says, while another, no doubt aimed at any holiday party-goers, advises: 'When drinking remember not to put your sweater on backwards.' The sweater has certainly proved popular with bd594's YouTube viewers, many of whom have been quick to congratulate the video maker on his festive innovation.",Canadian YouTube user bd594 upcycled a knitted sweatshirt found at Goodwill by adding lights and snowy scenery .
"People smugglers are using Facebook pages to advertise their illegal services to migrants desperate to escape Africa and the Middle East in search of a better life across the Mediterranean. Criminal gangs in North Africa have reportedly branched out into social media to make contact with refugees who are willing to pay thousands of pounds for a place on a boat. Everything from routes, contact details and even risk assessments for would-be migrants can be found on Facebook pages offering a passage across the Mediterranean according to The Telegraph. Immigrants wait to be disembark a vessel  in the port of Crotone, southern Italy, after a rescue mission by the Guardia Costiera . 'There are Facebook pages that advertise the smugglers' services,' Ewa Moncure, a spokeswoman for Frontex, the European Union's border control agency, told the Telegraph. 'They are using all sorts of digital means, including social media, to expand their operations. They've become very well organised and they're very adaptable.' After making contact with the smugglers through Facebook, a reporter was offered passage on a boat from Egypt to Italy at a cost of 30,000 Egyptian pounds (£3,000). Smugglers have trafficked a record 150,000 refugees on boats to Italy so far this year, driven by the huge profits to be made in what has fast become a multi-million pound industry. But thousands of migrants have died as a result of overcrowded and inadequate vessels, and many more have been rescued after their overloaded boats got into difficulties. Last week, 17 migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean were found dead by the Italian navy, after suffering hypothermia and dehydration. In a separate incident, another 29 people are feared to have drowned after their boat from Morocco was hit by strong waves  off the coast of Spain. Immigrants part of a group of more than 580 people, most of them from Syria, disembark from the Congolese cargo 'Sandy' after a rescue operation by the Guardia Costiera as part of the Frontex joint operation 'Triton' Italy launched the Mare Nostrum (Our Sea) operation last year after 366 would-be migrants drowned off the coast of Sicily. Italian ships and aircraft involved in the £7.5 million ($11.9 million) per month mission patrolled close to the Libyan coast, rescuing over 100,000 people who had paid smugglers to bring them to Europe. But the costly operation proved unpopular, with critics arguing that patrolling so close to Libya encouraged migrants to take the risky trip out to sea. Twenty-one European Union countries are now contributing to a smaller mission called Triton, overseen by border control agency Frontex, which will patrol 30 nautical miles from Italy's coast. Migrants sit in a boat during a rescue operation off the coast of Sicily. Seventeen migrants died before the boat was found, apparently from hypothermia and dehydration . The mission saw a group of more than 580 people, most of them from Syria, rescued from Congolese cargo 'Sandy' on Tuesday in an operation carried out by the Guardia Costiera. According to the Telegraph, European officials say smugglers use maritime tracking websites to identify the location of military and civilian ships in the Mediterranean, banking on the vessels rescuing the boats full of hundreds of migrants. Jose Maria Duenas, the commander of the Rio Mino,  told the newspaper that migrants are typically traumatized when they are  rescued. But he said that with conflict and poverty across the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa - along with the breakdown of law and order in Libya which allows the criminal gangs to thrive - the trade in transporting humans shows no sign of slowing. 'The politicians need to find a deal with Libya to solve this problem,' he added. 'But Libya right now is in chaos, so the boats will keep coming, and we'll be here to rescue them.' Syrian children are helped to disembark from a vessel in southern Italy on Tuesday, after being rescued as part of the Frontex operation 'Triton'.

"A ten-year-old girl has raised over £30,000 for a children's hospice in just eight months simply by playing her violin to passers by in the street. Talented Madison Glinski raised the astonishing sum by busking on the streets of St Ives and Truro, Cornwall. Her original target had been just £500, but since she began in Easter, Madison has raised a staggering £32,520 for the Children's Hospice South West. Talented Madison Glinski (pictured) raised more than £32,000 by busking on the streets of Cornwall . The youngster, who has played violin since the age of four, started busking earlier this year with the aim of hitting her fundraising target before Christmas. So many people got behind the young violinist she ended up raising 60 times her target for the charity's Little Harbour hospice in Cornwall. As well as busking Madison, who plays grade four standard, also raised money by attending car boot sales and auctioning off her own toys. Madison pictured with some of the funds raised by her violin playing which will be donated to the Children's Hospice South West . The altruistic youngster's original target had been just £500 but generous passers-by saw Madison raise her target on sixty occasions . And to top it all off her exploits are being recognised on the Christmas edition of TV show Surprise Surprise after being nominated by proud mum Terrasa, 48. She said: 'Madison is very caring. She made a New Year's resolution to help poorly children and decided to try and raise £500 for the Children's Hospice South West. 'She thought that was all she would be able to raise but so many people have donated it just grew and grew. 'When she started she just had her violin case open for donations but as she went on she started putting up signs saying what she was doing it for and it grew from there. Madison, pictured playing her violin in the street in Cornwall, only began busking over Easter with the aim of hitting her original fundraising target before Christmas . The youngster who has played violin since the age of four and now plays to grade four standard, pictured here busking inside a shop, also raised money by attending car boot sales and auctioning off her own toys . 'People were leaving £20 notes sometimes - it was astonishing. Then she started a JustGiving page and people how saw her busk would then go and donate money through that.' Terrasa added: 'She has a bit of a musical talent and has used it to help others. 'She has a special passion and dedication for it.' It's not the first time Madison has reached out to help others. The family normally go away over Christmas but a few years ago Madison asked her parents if they could all go to Africa instead to help children there. Madison collected unwanted items from friends, neighbours and used her own pocket money and managed to collect 700Ibs worth of toys, shoes, clothes and school equipment to take to Africa. As soon as the family returned Madison started to plan for the next trip.

"Swinging might not be the obvious way to spread the word about religion but for Cristy and Dean Parave, from Florida, it is ideal. The couple, both of whom are devoted Christians, have even set up a website called FitnessSwingers.com which enables them to meet couples who, like them, are both religious and fans of keeping fit. But not everyone who asks to meet them is Christian and so the undecided and atheist are given a gentle lesson in faith along with a good time between the sheets. Scroll down for video . Spreading the word: Cristy and Dean Parave, pictured with daughter Britney (right), are fans of swinging . 'I don't think God would be mad at what we are doing,' smiles Mrs Parave, 44. 'At first I was conflicted but the more we looked at it the more it makes sense to us. 'Dean and I are both in agreement with this lifestyle, so we're not committing adultery. God put people on the earth to breed and enjoy each other - I feel God is always with me and he has put us here for a reason.' The couple met on a dating website eight years ago, after Mrs Parave, who has three children from a former marriage, Brittany, 23, Daryl, 20, and 17-year-old Rose, decided to start meeting people again following the end of her relationship. Mr Parave, a fitness instructor, had been an alcoholic and drug addict before finding Jesus following a drink-drive arrest. Enjoyable: The couple say that swinging helps them spread the word of God in addition to being enjoyable . Wife swapping: Megan Verhooks, 49, (left with Dean) and John Betts, 59 (right with Cristy) regularly join in . 'For me every day used to involve a case of beer and a bottle of Jack Daniels,' he remembers. 'After my fifth arrest for driving under the influence I begged God for help. 'I should have been looking at 10 years but the judge sentenced me to just 10 months in prison - for me that was a sign.' After he was released Mr Parave built a 40ft cross in his back yard and pledged to do the Lord's work for the rest of his life. Despite their past difficulties, the pair quickly hit it off. But it was in bed that the real fireworks took place, with the 44-year-old admitting that her first husband wasn't quite as compatible. 'I've always been adventurous when it comes to sex,' she says, candidly. 'The sex between my first husband and I was miserable. 'I was undersexed before I met Dean but now we do it twice a day. It's incredible.' Passion: Along with swinging, the couple are body-building fans and regularly take part in competitions . Keeping fit: The fitness-obsessed couple set up their website after getting fed up with regular swingers . Living clean: Mr Parave turned his life around after being jailed for 10 months for drink-driving offences . Despite their penchant for twice-a-day sex, their antics would have stayed behind closed doors, had it not been for a chance meeting in a supermarket. 'A couple approached me in Home Depot out of nowhere and asked if we were swingers,' remembers Mrs Parave. 'I was so naive I thought they were talking about swing dancing. I said, ""I used to love to but my husband doesn't, I'd love to get him lessons"". Afterwards we went home and looked it up online and it sounded exciting.' Inspired, Mrs Parave invited a friend over a few days later and the two women surprised her husband in the shower. 'I had a very sexually adventurous friend who knew about swinging. I asked her if she wanted to try with Dean and I,' she explains. Getting close: According to Mr Parave, having sex with someone is by far the best way to get close to them . 'Dean didn't know what was happening, he thought it was a trick and I was trying to catch him out.' Two years ago they set up their website and now travel around the US, meeting people within the swinging community. 'Both our parents know about it and they are happy for us,' adds Mrs Parave. 'When we told Brittany she was not surprised, she knows we enjoy sex a lot. 'Rose knows about the website but we are yet to sit her down and tell her what we do.' 'I turned my life around, began bodybuilding and now I try to live pure,' adds Mr Parave. 'God has put me here to spread his word and our lifestyle community is a great place to do it. 'You can't get closer to someone than having sex with them.'","Cristy and Dean Parave, from Florida, run a Christian swingers network .

"The staggering scale of Britain’s foreign criminal population is exposed today. There are more than 700 murderers and 500 rapists among nearly 12,000 foreign offenders in this country, figures show. For the first time, the Home Office has published a detailed breakdown of the offences and nationality of every criminal from around the world, who is currently on its books having been convicted of offences in this country. Scroll down for video . In total, nearly one in six has been found guilty of an offence categorised as ‘most serious’ – including murder, rape, terrorism and sex offences against children. Murderers and rapists alone make up more than one in ten of the total. The nationality breakdown shows Britain hosts a ‘United Nations of Crime’, with offenders from 177 different countries. It shows there are more Jamaican criminals here than any other nationality – a total of 1,026 – or around 2 per cent of the entire Jamaican population in the UK. Second on the list is Nigeria, followed by Poland and Somalia. The top ten countries alone account for more than 5,500 criminals. The figures were uncovered by Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson using a question tabled in Parliament. He told the Mail: ‘Foreign criminals have no place in Britain and there is no excuse for ministers not deporting them as early as possible. Among the group of foreign criminals living in Britain there are more than 700 murderers, 500 rapists, 155 child rapists and 228 paedophiles . ‘Yet under this Government fewer are being removed and it’s taking longer; Labour has clear plans for making it easier to deport foreign criminals but Theresa May still won’t get a grip and remove people who shouldn’t be here.’ But Tory MP Michael Ellis, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee said: ‘The hypocrisy from Labour is nauseating. It was the previous Labour government’s ramshackle immigration arrangements that facilitated entry of many of these individuals in the first place. ‘And the Human Rights Act created an imbalance in favour of foreign criminals which we are having to correct.’ The full list, entitled the Foreign National Offender Caseload, includes all 11,719 convicted foreign criminals the Home Office is managing, whether they are in prison, in immigration detention or at large. It excludes those who have been given the right to remain permanently in this country under human rights laws. Their numbers include 775 murderers, 587 rapists, 155 child rapists, and 15 convicted terrorists. Also in the category of most serious offences are 99 other killers convicted of manslaughter, and 228 paedophiles. There are also 88 criminals found guilty of attempted murder, 1,022 of serious violent assaults, 497 burglars, and 43 arsonists. In total, 2,247 were convicted of the production, supply, or importing drugs. More than 8,000 offences are listed simply as ‘other’. The breakdown shows that of the total, more than 1,100 are unlikely to face deportation because they were jailed for less than a year – the threshold for automatic deportation of criminals outside the EU. A total of 1,075 were handed indefinite or life terms and 2,831 five years or more.

"The sheer savagery of the CIA torture programme was exposed to all the world last night. Cruel and inhuman techniques – euphemistically referred to as ‘enhanced interrogation’ – were used to try to break more than 100 Islamic terror suspects. Staff at the US intelligence agency were given around $200million (£130million) to use any means necessary to elicit information in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Scroll down for video . Shackled: A military policeman gives water to chained prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, the US base in Cuba . Among the torturers were agents with backgrounds so violent and abusive they should have been barred from the agency altogether, according to a Senate report. Secret jails known as ‘black sites’ were turned into dungeons in a string of countries apparently willing to turn a blind eye. Prior to the report it was known that detainees were subjected to waterboarding, hooded beatings and sleep deprivation. But yesterday, the committee described in chilling detail how this violent coercion spiralled into acts of sadistic cruelty. In the first months of the programme, a beating left one suspect in hospital on life support and unable to communicate. Another died from hypothermia, naked and chained to a concrete floor. A third was told by his interrogator that he would not escape alive as ‘we can never let the world know what I have done to you’. Torture was already known, but the violent coercion spiralled into acts of sadistic cruelty (file photo) The methods in question, based on ‘torturous’ techniques used by Cold War regimes, were already known to lead to false confessions. And so it proved. The CIA, led by two inexperienced psychologists, spent seven years torturing suspects for information that was of little value. Almost every section of the 499-page report contains deeply disturbing revelations: . Forced to stand for hours with broken legs . Detainees – some with broken legs – were forced to stand in stress-inducing positions for hours and bullet wounds were left untreated. Victims were interrogated non-stop for weeks with some prevented from sleeping for up to 180 hours at a time. One was subjected to 66 hours of ‘standing sleep deprivation’ before the CIA realised he was the wrong man and released him. Another suspect was confined to a coffin-sized box for a total of 266 hours. Some were shackled with their hands above their heads, forced to walk around naked or hooded and dragged up and down corridors while being beaten. Stripped naked and chained to the floor . One of the most notorious sites located in Afghanistan became known as the ‘salt pit’ among the Americans and the ‘dark prison’ by former captives. Opened in 2002, and referred to as Cobalt in the report, it was described as a ‘dungeon’ by its own chief of interrogations. The site was run by a junior officer with no relevant experience and who had ‘issues’ in his background that should have disqualified him from the CIA. It was here that an inmate died from hypothermia and prisoners with broken legs were kept standing. Rooms were flooded with bright light and white noise to disorientate inmates. Anally fed: Alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed was 'tortured with a rectal tube' Force fed through a rectal tube . In one of the most shocking acts, CIA staff used rectal feeding and hydration tubes as instruments of torture. The use of the technique for control is highlighted in the case of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. The report describes how a detainee’s ‘lunch tray’ of hummous, pasta with sauce, nuts and raisins was ‘pureed’ and ‘rectally infused’ when he refused to eat it. Another suspect was fed via nasal tube, a process one lawyer described as like ‘having a razor-blade pulled down your throat’. Drowning, vomiting and convulsions . The full horror of waterboarding, in which a damp cloth and trickle of water is used to simulate drowning, is laid bare in the Senate report. Officials rubbished claims by the agency that it used the technique on only three detainees. They described their horror at seeing a ‘well worn’ waterboard, surrounded by buckets of water, at a detention site where the CIA said the technique was not used. Victims, including Sheikh Mohammed, suffered convulsions and vomiting. He was waterboarded at least 183 times, which the report describes as escalating into a ‘series of near drownings’. In his case operatives abandoned the damp cloth. Instead they used their hands to form a standing pool of water over his mouth to increase the sensation of dying. Another victim was left completely unresponsive with bubbles rising from his open mouth after he was violently waterboarded at a black site in Thailand. The treatment left hardened CIA employees distraught and concerned about the legality of what they had witnessed. Several asked to be transferred afterwards. You will leave this place in a coffin . CIA officers routinely threatened to harm detainees’ children, sexually abuse their mothers, and in one case ‘cut [a detainee’s] mother’s throat’. Several suspects were led to believe they would die in custody, with one told he would leave in a coffin. Another was told his mother would be brought in front of him and sexually abused if he did not cooperate. The report revealed that some of the staff should never have been working for the agency in the first place. They were already known for engaging in ‘inappropriate’ interrogations or had ‘anger management issues’. One had admitted to a sexual assault. Techniques: A detainee from Afghanistan is carried on a stretcher after being interrogated in 2002 . The psychological ‘masterminds’ Two contract psychologists were at the root of the entire programme, devising techniques and playing a central role in managing the programme. Neither had any experience as an interrogator, or any specialised knowledge of Al Qaeda, counter-terrorism or languages. Nevertheless they developed ‘learned helplessness’ methods, in which prisoners are totally dominated. They personally interrogated the most prized suspects. In 2005, they formed a company for the work and received £52million before Barack Obama terminated the contract in 2009. The 26 who should not have been held . The CIA claimed it held about 100 people but the Senate investigation found at least 119 were in the agency’s custody. One aide said they lost track and ‘didn’t really know who they were holding’ because of the chaotic and unmonitored way in which the prisons were set up. Emails were uncovered in which CIA personnel were ‘surprised’ to find some suspects in their custody. At least 26 detainees were wrongfully held. The ill-treatment left many detainees exhibiting symptoms of mental illness, including hallucinations, paranoia, convulsions, self-harm and mutilation. One prisoner slashed his wrists and attempted to chew into a vein through his elbow and cut his arm with a filed toothbrush. In 2003 one senior operative described it as a ‘train [wreck] waiting to happen’ and that ‘I intend to get the hell off the train before it happens’. The report demolishes claims that the abuse of inmates in Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison in the second Gulf War were isolated incidents.","Disturbing 499-page report reveals horrors at US naval base in Cuba .

"A bishop threatened to sue a  parishioner who speculated that he would not read an email about church closures. Philip Bannister wrote an open letter to the Bishop of Lancaster, expressing his upset about the decision to shut the Roman Catholic churches in Preston, Lancashire and merge their congregations into a new parish. However, it was the final paragraph, in which he questioned whether his email would even be read by the Right Reverend Michael Campbell and instead looked at by his secretary, which sparked a response. Row: The Bishop of Lancaster (left) threatened to sue Philip Bannister (right) after the seriously ill parishioner accused him of not reading an email about church closures . His wording prompted Bishop Campbell to accuse Mr Bannister of making a 'most serious - and defamatory - allegation.' He threatened to take libel action, saying the comment had 'no basis in truth whatsoever,' adding he received all his correspondence and replied to all of it in person. Mr Bannister, a regular worshipper at St Augustine's church in Preston suffered a heart attack five weeks ago and is awaiting a bypass operation. It is not known if Bishop Campbell was aware of Mr Bannister's health problems. Closed: Bishop Campbell authorised the closure of two churches, including St Augustine's in Preston last month in order to form the new Parish of the Pope St John XXIII . Upset: Worshippers at both St Augustine's and St Igantius (pictured) have voiced their anger, claiming the closures were unnecessary and carried out without any consultation . His contentious paragraph read: 'I have serious doubts whether you (Bishop Michael) will read this letter personally due to a Dioceses’ wide acknowledgement that your secretary filters mail from you and takes the initiative to provide his own response. 'For this reason I felt obliged to make this an open letter which I have passed to others who will have an interest in the issues and may widen the media focus on the challenge and opportunities we all face together.' However, the parishioner has now issued an apology to the Bishop. Seriously ill: Mr Bannister, a regular worshipper at St Augustine's suffered a heart attack five weeks ago and is awaiting a bypass operation . He said: 'After taking a bit of advice I decided to just apologise and withdraw the remark. 'But as regards the other nine-tenths of my letter, the Bishop has avoided responding to any of the issues contained in it. 'I won’t be pursuing those points now. I think I’ve probably said enough. I will leave the fight to have these church closures to others now.' Bishop Campbell has accepted the retraction and has said he would not be taking the matter further. Feelings have been running high in Preston since Bishop Campbell authorised the closure of St Augustine's and another church, St Ignatius last month in order to form the new Parish of the Pope St John XXIII. A shortage of priests was cited as the key reason. Worshippers at both churches have voiced their anger, claiming the closures were unnecessary and carried out without any consultation. Church secretary Moira Cardwell even threatened to chain herself to the railings of St Ignatius in protest. Parishioners are still campaigning for a U-turn, even though both churches have now closed down. Mr Bannister took Bishop Campbell to task in an email which he also forwarded to the Papal Nuncio and local media. In it he said he was 'quite at a loss to understand' why St Augustine’s had been shut down. He added: 'I believe that, apart from the process being faulted, it has been contemptuous of parishioners.' After being brought to task by the Bishop, he said: 'I never meant to hurt anyone. Looking at it I was probably a bit harsh. 'It was probably an error of judgement on my part and I’ve been given a slap-down. 'I have made a public apology and I don’t think I can comment any further.' Bishop Campbell said: 'I am happy to accept your retraction. With this email I now draw this correspondence to a conclusion.'","Philip Bannister wrote an open letter to the Bishop of Lancaster .

"A bride who spent her wedding night in police cells after hurling racist abuse at staff in a luxury hotel has today walked free from court. Mother of four Kirsty Bigland, 30, who was still wearing her white wedding dress, shouted racist language when a card payment was refused as she and her husband Nick tried to check into their hotel room. Staff ushered the newlyweds out of the four star Hilton Hotel in Manchester city centre's Deansgate due to their foul mouthed tirade before Bigland began running at security staff swearing and spitting. Kirsty Bigland (right) leaving Manchester Magistrates Court today, after being given a suspended sentence after admitting hurling racist abuse at hotel staff on her wedding night along with husband Nick (left) Police were called to the Hilton Hotel in Manchester City Centre following the incident, which led to Bigland, pictured still in her wedding dress, spending her wedding night in the cells . Both she and her new husband had to be restrained until police arrived at the £300 a night hotel before the pair were both taken to a nearby police station where they spent the night in neighbouring cells. At Manchester Magistrates Court today, Bigland, from Salford admitted racially aggravated assault upon hotel doorman Mustapha Muhssen and was given a 20 week jail sentence suspended for 12 months. She was also ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work and pay the victim £150 compensation plus £250 prosecution costs. Her husband, 25, who had pleaded guilty to disorderly behaviour at an earlier hearing failed to turn up for sentencing and a warrant was issued for his arrest. At an earlier hearing the court heard how the incident occurred in May this year after the couple married and had their reception in Manchester city centre. After the function they were due to book into the Hilton at 11pm for their wedding night as customers were queuing outside a lift to go to the trendy Cloud 23 bar on the 23rd floor of hotel building. Bigland, and her new husband Nick, had been due to stay at the Hilton after holding their reception at a venue in Manchester city centre . But trouble began when the couple tried to use a friend’s credit card and it was denied. It was then that Bigland hurled racist abuse and the couple had to be restrained by security staff. Today the court was told that the security guard had wanted to drop the assault complaint as it was the Biglands’ wedding night. He said his injuries had been 'very minor' and dismissed the incident as 'name calling, picking out differences in my appearance like calling someone fat'. John Wolfson, defending said: 'She accepts the facts but she can’t recall everything. She had something to drink and she’d had a very happy day, described as ""bridal bliss"". 'They turned up at the hotel, but her husband had been drinking heavily. 'When she arrived she was wearing her wedding dress. She was very happy, had a case with her with a view of spending the night in the hotel but it was the honeymoon, that never happened. 'Instead she ended up in her wedding dress in a police cell, in separate cells to her husband.' Today the court was told that the security guard had wanted to drop the assault complaint as it was the Biglands’ wedding day . Mr Wolfson spoke of the mix up with bookings and added: 'Mr Bigland at that point got very upset and irate and made it known his views to staff, he became noisy and offensive and abusive. 'Kirsty became upset, she felt utterly humiliated standing in the middle of the hotel with people coming and going, she wanted to disappear.' It was claimed Bigland told her husband she wanted to go and he gave her taxi money and and sat on a wall outside before Mr Bigland was escorted out by security. Mr Wolfson added: 'She didn’t know what had happened inside to cause that. 'She saw him sat on the barrier. He was removed forcefully from that and taken down. 'She was very upset. The police came and she was taken to the police station.' The court heard that Bigland had been 'very upset' by a comment that said she had looked 'cheap'. She was detained in a cell until 7pm the following day. Mr Wolfson explained: 'She has lost an awful lot, vilified in the media, very nasty unpleasant comments made. She has been sorely punished. 'Her marriage is in a precarious situation. He started it. She sought to walk away but became embroiled in it.' But during sentencing district judge Mark Hadfield told Bigland: 'You proceeded to spit into the guard’s face and proceeded to punch him to the chest. 'When he was seen to restrain you, you kicked him. I simply don’t accept you don’t remember using racial language or spitting in his face. 'It seems clear to me that the incident did commence as a result of Mr Bigland’s behaviour and they were forced to deal with him. 'You became involved using particularly racist language and then assaulted him. Those who indulge in racially aggravated behaviour must expect to be punished. 'It’s a very serious offence and a repeated assault on a gentleman - not only a punch but kicking and spitting in his face. 'It occurred in the hotel reception then spilled outside. It was very late at night, you are not willing to concede that you were intoxicated, I expect drink played a part.'","Kirsty Bigland spent wedding night in the cells after hurling racist abuse .

"Jason Britcher, 40, pictured outside of court was alleged to have attempted to rape a woman barrister at a Christmas party . A barristers' legal clerk attempted to rape a junior woman lawyer after a solicitors' Christmas party, a court heard. Married Jason Britcher, 40, crept in to the sleeping woman's hotel room after texting her at 3am to ask where she was. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not initially alarmed and mistook the father-of-one for her husband. As she began to wake up she discovered that it was Britcher and she was assaulted twice, Hull Crown Court heard. Britcher later claimed he had stumbled into her room through an interconnecting hotel door, as he was looking for the bathroom. He said the woman consented to what went on. A second woman has also complained that she too had been assaulted by Britcher, but  five years earlier than the attack on the barrister. Britcher, who has a teenage daughter, denied to one charge of rape, two charges of sexual assault and one charge of attempted rape, on two separate women. In the more recent incident the jury was told the pair had gone independently to the party for solicitors and barristers in the south  of the country. 'It was a typical Christmas party in which people would drink, dance and socialize,' said Mr Thackray. He explained the victim booked a room at a nearby hotel because she did not live locally. Britcher had the room next door. He sent her a text at 3.44am saying: 'Sorting a little room. Are you guys in main building, or pleb X.' She did not reply. He sent her room-mate a text offering his bed while he slept on the floor. Neither woman replied. 'You may wonder what was going through his mind at this time. Was he about to crash out and fall asleep or was he wanting some company?' said Mr Thackray. 'There was no intimacy between them whatsoever, nor had there been any intimacy between them on a prior occasion. 'He said at around 3am the woman returned to her hotel room. He said unfortunately she did not lock the door, as she had offered a spare bed to friend also at the party to avoid a lengthy journey home. 'She went to sleep still wearing her dress,' said Mr Thackray. 'She thought her friend was returning share her bed and didn't want to be naked.' 'Her next recollection was of someone being next to her, cuddling up to her. She was still half asleep and she thought it was her husband who was in bed with her. 'She wasn't immediately alarmed. She felt the person she thought was her husband touching her. 'At this point the complainant still believed that it was her husband behind her, and she reached around to assist, what she thought was her husband.' He said Britcher was attempting to rape her. 'It was at that point that alarm bells started to ring.' He said Britcher then committed a further sexual assault. Britcher is on trial at Hull Crown Court after he denied charges of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault . 'That woke her up completely and she opened her eyes. She turned her head and saw it was the defendant. She told him to f**** off. She said he looked shocked and left quickly.' Mr Thackray said after Britcher left, the woman was in a state of distress. She could not face speaking to her husband, so called her sister in tears, saying she had woken up to find a man on top of her. 'She did not immediately call the police,' said Mr Thackray. The woman then rang a member of her chambers as others were still socializing at the party. The police were then informed by a solicitor and arrived at the hotel to arrest Britcher whose fingerprints, DNA, and photograph was taken. He said cocaine was found in Britcher's body in a concentration consistent with him having taken it during the evening. The earlier victim told police Britcher indecently assaulted told her after she got into bed and went to sleep following a party. On the occasion she told him to get off her. The woman, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said there was a second incident a year later when he raped her. In police interview, Britcher denied the first sexual assault with the first woman had taken place and said the second incident he accepted sex took place, but said it was consensual. Crown barrister John Thackray said: 'It is the prosecutions case that whilst under the influence of alcohol, and on one occasion cocaine, on three separate occasions, the defendant has committed sexual acts in the clear and obvious knowledge that both women were not consenting. 'These are two entirely unconnected complainants, who have each made remarkably similar allegations against the same man, in complete ignorance of the other's allegations.' The trial continues.

"A Japanese scientist who published a paper claiming ordinary cells could be turned into stem cells by bathing them in acid has today been forced to apologise after she was accused of falsifying data. Haruko Obokata, 30, choked back tears during a televised news conference packed with hundreds of reporters, but insisted she did not tamper with the data to fabricate results. She said she did not agree with retracting the research, claiming that cell transformation had been 'confirmed many times for a fact' and vowed to prove it if she is allowed back into a lab. Scroll down for video . Japanese scientist Haruko Obokata, 30, has been forced to publicly apologise after being accused of falsifying data in a report on stem cells . The paper claimed ordinary cells could be turned into stem cells by bathing them in mild acid. But the company Obokata works for says she used some incorrect images and wrongly altered another . A distraught Obokata struggled to contain her emotions during the press conference, choking back tears . She has contested allegations of research malpractice made by a panel of scientists at the government-funded Riken Center for Development Biology, where she is employed. Obokata said the company had advised her not to speak publicly about the controversy and today's press conference, which lasted for over two hours, marks her first public appearance in weeks. The decision to appear was made despite doctors' orders to stay at home after she went to hospital for treatment treatment Monday. 'I wasn't able to sleep well and was feeling worse and worse,' she said. 'I take this responsibility severely. I am deeply sorry.' Obokata apologised repeatedly for using wrong images and for having altered an image in the report. She attributed her mistakes to inexperience and her 'limited abilities,' and appealed to fellow researchers to continue the work. She added: 'The research was done accurately and the data exists to prove it so I would like to ask for your understanding that the research paper was not completed with a malicious intent.' Despite being forced into a humiliating public apology, Obokata stands by her research, saying she can prove the results if she is allowed back into her lab . Today's appearance is the first time in two weeks that Obokata has been seen in public, and comes despite medics warning her to stay at home . Obokata opposes pulling the report from the scientific journal in which it was published, saying that the conclusions of the report are correct even if there are mistakes in the method . Obokata said she opposes retracting the paper, published in the journal Nature, because it would give the international community the impression that the whole project was incorrect. Kazuhiko Murotani, a lawyer who appeared alongside Obokata, went through Riken's findings in detail and concluded with a call for a review and more investigation of the research. He said: 'The investigation was inadequate. It was carried out very quickly. It needs to be redone.' Announcing its findings, Riken also faulted Obokata's fellow researchers and senior staff for failing to fully verify the results in the paper. However, it held Obokata solely responsible for fabricating information and other mistakes in the data. Obokata said she needs access to her computer in the laboratory and to her research notebooks to be able to prove she succeeded in turning cells from spleens of newborn mice into stem cells by exposing them to a more acidic environment than they are used to. If replicated with human cells, the research would mark a huge leap forward in the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer’s, heart disease and stroke. In an emailed statement, company Riken said Obokata had the right to appeal its findings.","Haruko Obokata, 30, accused of falsifying data in stem cell report .

"The only thing most teenagers have to worry about is going to school and their friends. But in 2007 at the age of 16, Joey Lynch was in a hospital bed after he had just been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, deciding whether or not to freeze his sperm so he could have the chance to have children in the future. Due to the treatments he has received since then - including chemotherapy, total body radiation and two stem-cell transplants - the now 22-year-old's reproductive system is no longer viable. Joey Lynch (pictured here with a friend in 2013) was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at 16 years of age . He said this was not a decision he had even thought about when he was diagnosed until a nurse suggested it. 'When she suggested it I wasn't take aback because I had been in hospital for three days already. I thought it was a smart thing to do,' Mr Lynch told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a very important [decision]. I wasn't in a relationship at the time but it wasn't at the forefront of mind. 'You have no idea what the treatment will do to you. Three days after his diagnosis, Mr Lynch (pictured here in 2009) made the decision to freeze his sperm to give him the best chance of having children in the future . 'I'm that age now that I see my friends and family members having babies on Facebook and Instagram. 'It’s not going to be a pleasant experience with IVF but I'm glad I have that chance than no chance at all.' Go see your GP if one or more of these symptoms are persistent or unexplained: . These are only one of the many issues Mr Lynch had to consider as a young cancer patient, which is more common than most people think. Every day another three young Australians aged 15 to 25 are diagnosed with cancer. Mr Lynch said when he found out he had cancer he was 'obviously shocked'. 'It was a kick in the guts. It's not something you anticipate hearing when you go to the doctor,' he said. 'Until you actually get it and realise the amount of young people with cancer, you never think of young people and cancer, it never crosses your mind.' In the days after he was diagnosed, Mr Lynch said he thought about how he was going to make it through high school and other study plans - whether or not part-time study and distance education were options. Mr Lynch, who is now 22, is still being treated for lymphoma and a disease called Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), where his stem-cell transplant's immune cells are attacking his body . Due to his cancer and GVHD, Mr Lynch has been in and out of hospital since 2007 - when he was diagnosed.  He is now treated at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne - Australia's only public hospital solely dedicated to cancer treatment . He also worried about how his cancer would affect his bone density, which may prevent him from returning to sports, and survival rates. '[Death is] always at the back of your mind, even though you don't want to acknowledge it,' he said. 'You're worrying about mortality rates of lymphoma, what is the mortality rate of healthy people my age. You try to find out about mortality rates as much as possible.' It was not just the long-term things Mr Lynch thought about but also the short-term like losing his hair and getting a job. 'I thought... am I going to lose my hair and the way I looked,' he said. 'I was in the ward with other adults and they didn't look very healthy. They had lost a lot of weight and I was worried all this stuff. 'I thought with jobs that 16-year-olds can get they're [employees] probably not going to bend over backwards [to arrange shifts] around chemo appointments.' He said freezing his sperm was the last thing on his mind when he was 16, but is glad he did it . He said other things he thought about when he was in his hospital bed was how he was going to finish school and whether or not he was going to lose his hair and weight . Mr Lynch - who hopes to study exercise science - is still in the treatment stage of his lymphoma but is also being treated for Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), where his donor immune cells from his stem-cell transplant are attacking his body. It is an indefinite disease that leaves him susceptible to infection and landed him in hospital a number of times - once even in intensive care. When asked how he deals with his illness, Mr Lynch said it had put a lot of things into perspective for him. 'I'm always trying to ensure that I don't make anything bigger than it needs to be,' he said. 'I make sure that I keep things in my life to look forward to and plan for that aren't related to cancer; be they CanTeen experiences, sporting events to attend, opportunities to hang out with friends or even simply my next workout. 'Nothing in life has to be a huge thing unless you allow it to be, including cancer. 'That's a vital skill I feel young people lack - the ability to properly determine what is under ones control and what is not, what should be worried about and what shouldn't be worried about.' Mr Lynch hopes to study exercise science at university and urges young people who may have cancer to get diagnosed as soon as they can . As for young people who unsure or scared to see the doctor, Mr Lynch said it was better safe than sorry. 'There’s no points for finding out you have cancer too late but there are a heck a lot of points for discovering cancer in the early stages,' he said. 'If you think something is wrong get it checked out.' In her 12 years as a oncologist, Antoinette Anazodo - from NSW/ACT Youth Cancer Service - said cancer sufferers between 15 and 25 rarely bring up the issue of fertility. Dr Anazodo is the service's lead clinician and is working to establish the Australasian Oncofertility Registry by collecting data from cancer and fertility specialists for the development of evidence-based national guidelines. 'For a majority of patients in this age range, it still comes as a surprise. Fertility preservation is not openly discussed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'When they think of cancer diagnosis or treatment, it's not even on their radar. It's usually vomiting, losing their hair or losing weight. 'It's a double whammy for them - it's the cancer diagnosis as well as fertility.' Dr Anazodo said more cancer specialists needed to discuss this issue with their patients.

"Prince William said he was nearly moved to tears after watching Steven Prescod, 22, perform and asked the young man to contact him . They have visited the White House, watched basketball with Jay-Z and Beyonce, and rubbed shoulders with creme-de-la-creme of New York high society. But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said today that the best event on their New York tour was watching a former hoodlum perform a one-man show in a youth center in Brooklyn. Prince William said he was nearly moved to tears while watching playwright and actor Steven Prescod, 22, recount his life story, and offered to help him bring his show to London's West End. At the end of the performance the prince, who left New York with pregnant wife Kate last night after three days in the city, even handed Prescod his number, telling him to 'reach out'. Prescod performed extracts from his play Brooklyn Boy for the Royals, including music, dance, and a powerful monologue, recounting his early life. Born to a 15-year-old mother, Prescod's father went to jail when he was just one year old. He avoided a seven-year jail sentence himself for assault and battery by opting for five years' probation when he started working with the CityKids Foundation who helped bring his story to life. According to The Mirror, Prince William, 32, told Prescod: 'We want more. That was amazing. We should get you on in the West End. 'All I can say is, it was really impressive. It nearly had me in tears.' Prescod added: 'He told me that he really wanted to help me put the show on. He said he's been the Barclays Center last night to watch the basketball but he'd pay to see this a million times. Scroll down for video . Prescod performed sections of one-man show Brooklyn Boy for the Royals, recounting his early life in which he was born to a 15-year-old mother and saw his father go to jail when he was just one year old . After the performance, William said the event was the best thing he had done during his three-day tour of New York which included meeting with the Clintons and watching basketball with Jay-Z and Beyonce . William and Kate also took a tour of The Door project where the performance took place, suggesting a collaboration with their own Royal Foundation back in the UK . 'It's all about my own life. I didn't really learn about writing. I didn't have to learn about developing characters because I used my own experiences.' William and Kate visited The Door community center in Lower Manhattan yesterday afternoon and were shown a sample of the work they do with disadvantaged youngsters. The organisation works with young people aged 12-24, helping 10,000 every year and provides services free of charge. The Royals watched Prescod perform alongside 28 others, and were full of praise for the work that was being done. Prince William also discussed a possible collaboration between The Door and CityKids Foundation and the Royal Foundation, which carries out similar work in the UK. William said he was impressed with the confidence of the youngsters, saying it was something that young people in the UK struggled with, and suggested taking some of their techniques back home. After visiting the youth center in Lower Manhattan the Royal couple spent the evening at a black tie event to help raise money for St Andrews University where they met and fell in love . The dinner, which cost up to $10,000-a-head, was to help raise money to pay for scholarships and bursaries at the University to help underprivileged people earn a place . After a dinner and speeches in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the couple went straight to the airport where they flew back to the UK . Before visiting the project, the Royal couple paid a solemn visit to the 9/11 memorial a short distance away, laying a wreath of white flowers. After touring the adjoining museum, Kate said she had been left 'in awe' at the scale of the tragedy, adding that she had not anticipated how emotional the visit would be. Their daytime schedule for Tuesday also included lunch with members of the British community, and a visit to the Empire State Building. Yesterday evening the couple swapped Lower Manhattan for an elegant black tie event to help raise money for their Alma Mater: St Andrews University, where they met and fell in love. the pair were the guests of honour at the lavish $10,000-a-head 600th anniversary event at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the couple's final engagement of their three-day visit. After a reception on the museum's Velez Blanco patio the couple were taken for dinner in the Temple of Dendur, a vast room decorated with statues of Egyptian gods that was built specifically to house an Egyptian temple built just before the birth of Christ. The sandstone temple was given to the U.S. in its entirety in 1965. After a speech given by comedian Seth Myers, drafted in  last-minute after Tom Hanks pulled out for personal reasons, the Duke and Duchess were whisked straight to the airport for a flight home. Earlier in the day, before the youth center in Lower Manhattan, the couple paid a solemn visit to the 9/11 memorial and museum a short distance away . William and Kate laid a bunch of white flowers in front of the memorial, with Kate later saying that she had been 'in awe' of the site . Kate added she had been under-prepared for the emotional impact of visiting the 9/11 museum yesterday .","William and Kate visited youth center in Lower Manhattan yesterday .

"A teenager is behind bars after being charged with murdering his brother. Charged: keandre Washington (above) allegedly beat his brother to death with a hammer . Keandre Washington of Northwoods, Missouri, allegedly beat his brother Bobby to death with a hammer early Tuesday morning. This all happened as their mother ran from the house in search of help. According to KSDK, officers responded to a call of a domestic disturbance and found Bobby, 25, dead on the floor of the home, having suffered numerous blows to the head from a hammer. The boys' mother said she had been 'scared' of what was happening when she left the house. Both boys, and their mother, lived at the home together. Now Keandre, 17, has been charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action, and is being held on $200,000 bail. Authorities are still not certain what the boys were fighting about, and an investigation is ongoing. As of Tuesday there have now been 148 murders in the St. Louis area this year, a staggering number. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay is now considering a special gun court in hopes that the city can get that number lower moving forward. 'We should have no tolerance for violence in the city, we have way too many guns,' Slay said. As for hammers, this is the second recent death in the city as the result of the hardware tool. A group of teens has been charged with beating a man to death with hammers just last week. Some report that the teens had targeted the man, Zemir Begic, because he was a Bosnian immigrant.","Keandre Washington of Northwoods, Missouri has been charged with murdering his brother Bobby .

"Police forces across Britain were on alert last night after a warning of an Islamic State-style plot to kidnap and behead an officer. More than 7,000 officers in the West Midlands were warned they were in imminent danger following a telephone threat. Police chiefs in Britain’s second largest force were so concerned at the ‘anonymous but credible’ threat that they stopped officers going off duty until they had attended a security briefing. Police forces are warning officers not to wear their uniform or ID badge when off duty due to an Islamic State-style plot to kidnap and behead an officer . However, it was reported that senior officers feared a female officer would be targeted for 'shock factor'. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'It is known police are worried jihadists are going to behead an officer. 'They believe they want to target a WPC for shock factor. The fear is a terror cell will think female officers make easier targets.' Other forces urgently reviewed safety precautions and warned officers not to wear their uniform or ID badge when off duty – normally they are allowed to wear uniform when travelling to and from work. The alert came after Islamic State called on followers to launch ‘lone wolf’ attacks on the West. The official threat level to officers was already heightened amid fears extremists will attempt to copy last year’s murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby – which, as the Mail reported last week, has led to soldiers being warned not to wear their uniform off duty. One concern is that a woman police officer or a civilian PCSO could be targeted. PCSOs do not carry a baton or other personal protection equipment, . Last night a 31-year-old man was arrested by counter-terrorism police investigating the threats against West Midlands Police. The threat to officers was already heightened amid fears extremists will attempt to copy the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby (pictured) Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: ‘We have received information relating to the safety of West Midlands Police officers and police staff. 'There is nothing at this time to suggest there is an increased risk to members of the public. We have taken the opportunity to remind all employees of the need to be vigilant.’ Mr Forsyth insisted officers remain on patrol in the same numbers, adding: ‘We’ve taken appropriate measures to ensure our staff have the information they need to continue to provide the business they do, day-in and day-out.’ Metropolitan Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he is considering strengthening his force’s security measures. ‘We’ve advised our staff to take reasonable precautions. We don’t tend to advertise what those are. We do not want to overreact,’ he added. Asked if police officers were in danger as never before, he replied that police were also a target during the decades of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The security services are increasingly concerned at the number of plots aimed at the police, military or Government. They have already uncovered evidence in at least three alleged conspiracies that frontline police officers and soldiers were in grave danger. They have also recovered evidence of suspected extremists monitoring a Territorial Army base and buying knives and Islamic State flags. The threat to West Midlands Police was apparently passed on in a telephone call on Monday evening. The national security level remains at severe, signifying a terrorist attack is highly likely. In October, the threat level to police officers was raised, following an Islamic State video telling followers to take retribution against countries leading the bombing campaign in northern Iraq and Syria. Dr Charlotte Heath-Kelly, an expert in counter-terrorism from Warwick University, said: ‘Attacking a single police officer or member of the forces is much easier than say, bombing a shopping centre. There is much less planning... and less chance of being caught by the security services.’ The Home Office declined to comment, describing the threat as ‘purely an operational matter for the police’.","7,000 West Midlands officers said to be in 'imminent danger' following call .

"Channel 4 has come under fire for 'glorifying shoplifters and drug addicts' in the latest episode of its controversial programme Skint. The second series of the show - which has been labelled 'poverty porn' by critics - is set in one of Britain's most deprived areas, East Marsh in Grimsby, once the largest fishing port in the world. But since the collapse of the industry, the area has been plunged into unemployment, and the documentary claims to follow the lives of fishermen out of work after a lifetime at sea, and people doing 'whatever they can to make ends meet'. Last night's episode, however, sparked fury with viewers after it showed a jobless drug-addicted couple shoplifting and trying to sell their furniture after they discovered their benefits would not be paid because they missed an appointment at the Job Centre. Channel 4 has come under fire for glorifying 'shoplifters and drug addicts' in the latest episode of its controversial series Skint. Last night's episode saw one contributor stealing flowers for a funeral to order . Meanwhile, her boyfriend Will was shown donning a high-vis jacket and daubing himself with paint in order to convince shop staff he had just finished work, before heading off out, apprently to shoplift . Left with just 'six potato croquettes and two tins of soup in the cupboards' they instead steal for food and to feed their drug habit. But Twitter users were quick to point out that the contributors were able to afford cans of alcohol and can be seen smoking on camera. 'Will' was seen donning a high-vis jacket and daubing himself with paint in order to convince people he had just finished work, before heading off out - apparently to shoplift. His girlfriend is seen returning home laden with flowers after stealing them to order for a funeral. Will told film crews: 'I walk in, high-vis, paint all over me, maybe some on my face, and on me hands and trackies, they think 'he's a worker - he's not a shoplifter.' He adds: 'It's all about what's up here', before tapping his head. Rosie Jackson tweeted: 'Absolute f***ing idiots just casually stealing and discussing it on tv. FFS. #Skint @Channel4 #proudtobeBritish (sic) Carl Johnson added: 'Shud b called 'thick' going on TV & exposing yourself as a shoplifter!!? Please do write from prison & let us know how that went 4 u #skint' (sic) Gavin Hosford added: 'Unrepresentative class stereotyping poverty porn tv with repeated narrow focussed images on loop. #skint@Channel4 - this is wrong#grimsby' The show has already faced controversy over one of its contributors - a woman called Kayleigh - who claims to have witnessed domestic violence as a child, and worked as a prostitute. Her relatives said they  asked the broadcaster to edit her contribution because of the possible impact the 'poverty porn' television could have on her children, the Guardian reports. Twitter users were quick to point out that the show contributors were able to afford cans of alcohol and can be seen smoking on camera . Others said the programme left them feeling 'heartbroken' and more fortunate about their own situation . MP Austin Mitchell, the MP for the constituency of Grimsby, has also criticised Channel 4 for commissioning a second series of the the programme, accusing show-makers of 'poverty tourism' after the success of controversial but popular Benefits Street. He accused the shows of 'concentrating hatred on the least well-educated' and the 'most deprived'. The Labour MP told Radio Times magazine: 'Channel 4 has discovered that poverty tourism does more for ratings than celebrity culture, missions to explain or any highfalutin attempts to hold government to account,' he added. 'Kicking people when they're down (and gullible) is so much easier and less expensive than intelligent programming. 'Victims don't sue, and when do-gooders complain, they can always be accused of wanting to censor serious seekers after truth. So we get a proliferation of misery telly and programmes like Benefits Street, Immigration Street and Skint.' The show also follows the touching story of former trawlerman Jeff, his partner Becky and their family who can be seen fundraising for a local hospice in the show . It also features Rev John Ellis, who has run the Shalom youth project on the East Marsh estate in Grimsby since 1972, and has defended the documentary . However, Rev John Ellis, who features  in the series and has run the Shalom youth project on the East Marsh estate in Grimsby since 1972, defended the documentary. He told Christian Today: 'We were very happy with the programme and the way we were portrayed in it. We looked at it very carefully before we decided to take part.' He described the 'poverty porn' label as 'nonsense' and denied that the programme could be seen as entertainment at other people's expense. 'We have 45 per cent child poverty, 30 per cent pensioner poverty and 44 per cent lone families. It's appalling the way these people have been treated – there are more and more burdens on the community and they are reaching breaking point.' Channel 4 insisted the programme highlights the reality of deprivation for many people in the UK, and gives a voice to those suffering the impact of long-term unemployment. A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'In the last half century, Grimsby has faced the almost complete loss of its fishing industry on which the town depended. 'Nowhere has this loss been more harshly felt than in parts of the East Marsh. This sympathetic observational documentary, filmed over a year, allows individuals and families to tell their stories about living in one of Britain's most deprived areas and suffering the devastating effect of deindustrialisation.'","The second series of the show has been labelled 'poverty porn' by critics .

"Spending cuts will have to last at least four more years, George Osborne suggested last night. The Chancellor said this was a price worth paying to ensure economic stability and create private sector jobs. With coalition divisions on the economy widening, he suggested the squeeze on the public sector would last until 2019. Spending cuts will have to last at least four more years, George Osborne suggested last night . ‘We are going to have to make savings – we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working-age people,’ he told the BBC. ‘But the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that’s a price that works for our country.’ Mr Osborne’s remarks came after days of what appeared to be a carefully choreographed coalition row over future plans on cutting the deficit. His Liberal Democrat deputy, Danny Alexander, suggested yesterday that the Conservatives were in a ‘pre-election panic’. He claimed the Chancellor and his colleagues wanted to inflict unnecessary pain because they were ‘economically committed to shrinking the state ever further’. Mr Osborne also came under fire from Labour. Stefan Stern, a writer for Labour List, an unofficial party supporters’ website, and a visiting professor at Cass Business School, said Mr Osborne’s remarks were ‘truly Lamontable’. This was a reference to Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont’s suggestion in 1991 that rising unemployment and the recession were a ‘price worth paying’ to get inflation down. Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems were 'all over the place' while Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Tories of wanting to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain' ‘The Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.’ David Cameron . ‘We are going to have to make savings... but the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that’s a price that works for our country.’ George Osborne . ‘I just think the Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services.’ Nick Clegg . ‘It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the coalition, to a policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain.’ Danny Alexander . While there are real differences between the coalition parties on the correct balance between tax rises and spending cuts, senior Government figures believe the latest round of sniping is planned. The Lib Dems and the Tories appear to have agreed to air their disagreements in public in the five months before the general election, even while exploring the viability of another pact. As well as energising their core supporters, the strategy crowds Labour out of the main political argument. Mr Osborne said: ‘There is a real choice for people between the competence offered by the Conservatives and the chaos of the other parties. What they are offering is a chaotic alternative of higher taxes, higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos. Britain doesn’t want to come back to square one. ‘We are offering a competent government with a clear plan that involves difficult decisions on spending and on welfare, and making the rich pay more through their tax avoidance schemes being closed down. And that is delivering economic security. ‘The alternative is economic chaos and people who are simply not being straight with the public about what their plan involves.’ The Chancellor gave his strongest hint yet that a pay squeeze in the public sector will have to go on for another four years, to limit the number of job losses. ‘What I would say is we can reduce the number that need to go if we take difficult decisions on public sector pay,’ he said. ‘This country has to live within its means. We have to have a government we can afford.’ Mr Alexander insisted there were big differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. He said: ‘What we are doing is something that should be totally unsurprising, which is two political parties – with very different ideologies – setting out their views about the future of this country in a clear and distinct way.’ A Labour spokesman said Mr Osborne had broken his promises on the economy and failed to deliver rising living standards. A small number of Conservative MPs, including Right-wing backbencher Peter Bone, have suggested Mr Cameron should break up the coalition and govern alone as leader of a minority administration. A larger group would opt for the coalition to end if the Tories were able to call an immediate general election. Conservative MP Nadine Dorries told London Live: ‘It’s almost certain that there will be a coalition government next time. A coalition of who, is the question.’ She said the likeliest result was a Conservative majority not big enough to govern alone.","Osborne said the squeeze on the public sector would last until 2019 .

"It's the quintessential way for Australians to start their day - and now a new study has revealed how many people eat Vegemite for breakfast on a typical day. The Roy Morgan research found that of the 7,550,000 people who eat the iconic spread in an average week, 6,405,000 were born in Australia. This figure equates to 45 per cent of people born in Australia and 83 per cent of the world's total consumption. Of the 7,550, 000 people who eat the iconic Aussie spread in an average week, 6,405,000 were born in Australia, a figure that equates to 85 per cent of the worlds total Vegemite-eaters . By comparison, 43 per cent of  New Zealanders, 30 per cent of those born in the UK or Ireland and just 12 per cent of Asian-born residents eat the yeast-based spread in an average week. Meanwhile, jam is the most popular spread among people born in the UK or Ireland with 39 per cent eating the spread in an average week. Those born elsewhere in Europe, 38 per cent, and Asia, 28 per cent, prefer honey as their spread of choice, while those born in the US are most likely to eat peanut butter at 49 per cent. 'With its unique taste and unappealing appearance, Vegemite inspires either love or hate in people,' said Angela Smith, Group Account Director of Roy Morgan Research. Vegemite is often viewed as one of the most quintessentially Aussie foods . 'It's no real surprise that Australian-born Aussies are most likely to eat Vegemite in an average week, while those born in other regions tend to favour spreads more prevalent in those regions: peanut butter for US-born folks, jam for people born in the UK or Ireland, and so on' she said. Ms Smith said the study was intended to recognise the differrent consumer preferences of people around the world. 'Understanding the demographics, attitudes and behaviours of consumers who favour different kinds of spreads is crucial for brands seeking to communicate effectively with their present and potential markets, and potentially even influence their preferences with some smart, targeted marketing.'","Study finds that of the 7,550, 000 people who eat the spread in an average week, 6,405,000 were born in Australia .

Luca Parmitano, the Italian astronaut who survived the harrowing experience with the spacesuit, said the work NASA and the hospital are doing is a step forward in preventing others from going through what he faced. 'I never thought about seeing a spacesuit lying on a surgeon's table. 'That is a first for me,' said Parmitano, as he stood next to the spacesuit, which was not the same one he wore during the spacewalk. The imaging technology was demonstrated on the spacesuit during 'Pumps & Pipes,' an annual conference that brings three of Houston's biggest industries — medicine, energy and aerospace — together to discuss technologies that could be shared by the fields. Parmitano, an officer in the Italian Air Force, described to an audience at the event how the water began building behind his head in his helmet and later started to cover his ears, eyes and nose. 'He said he imagined a newspaper headline that read, 'Italian astronaut drowns in space.' The imaging technology was demonstrated on the spacesuit for an annual event that brings three of Houston's biggest industries _ medicine, energy and aerospace . Inside the suit: Tis image reveals part of the helmet up sclose . Brian Macias, the spacesuit subsystem manager at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said a fan component that failed during the spacewalk was later examined with X-rays and N-rays, another form of radiography, but this gave engineers limited information. 'It's breaking new ground for us because we haven't used imaging a whole lot in finding out spacesuit anomalies,' Macias said. 'I see great potential.' During a demonstration Monday at the conference, the robotic arm rotated the CT scanner around the spacesuit's helmet, creating red, black and white 3-D images that can allow engineers to look at the integrity of different components. Dr. Alan Lumsden, the medical director of the Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center who led the demonstration, said techniques used in endovascular surgery to examine problems with blood vessels are the same kind that can diagnose future problems with the spacesuits. 'Here is a situation where we are going to use our technology to potentially look at a problem that helps NASA,' he said. 'We really want to help as much as we can.' A robotic arm rotated the CT scanner around the spacesuit's helmet, creating red, black and white 3-D images that can allow engineers to look at the integrity of different components.","Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano nearly drowned in his helmet .

"Judge Sir Richard Henriques (pictured above) overturned part of the Sexual Offences Prevention Order, forbidding the paedophile from living in his house . A paedophile has been allowed to keep living opposite his 14-year-old victim because it would cause him hardship to move. The Court of Appeal has overturned a legal ruling forbidding the convicted sex attacker from living in his home - which he bought from the council with a £75,000 discount - because he may suffer if he's forced to leave. Now the victim's mother has slammed the judge for putting the rights of a convicted sex offender above those of her daughter, who was just 12 when she was sexually assaulted. The 52-year-old paedophile was convicted last year and handed an eight-month jail term suspended for two years in May after being convicted of stroking the bottom and thigh of the young girl after inviting her round for strawberries and cream. After his conviction, the sex attacker was ordered to stay out of the street he shares with his victim, and to not have any contact with her. But Court of Appeal judge Sir Richard Henriques overturned part of the Sexual Offences Prevention Order, forbidding him from living in his house. The girl and her family are forced to move out of their home in Broadfield, West Sussex, because she cannot stand to be near her attacker, who cannot be named for legal reasons in case it identifies his young victim. The child's mother said:'How would it be causing him hardship? 'He was living with his mum and dad when he was banned from living in this street, so it's not like he would be left on the streets. Judge Sir Richard Henriques, sitting at the Court of Appeal, said the loss of the property would be 'most disproportionate' 'What about my daughter? There has been no thought for her at all. 'He is the one that's committed the crime and she's the one who's going to end up suffering, because we're going to have to move.' Judge Henriques ruled that the man may suffer hardship if he was denied the opportunity to live in his house. In his report, he said: 'We question whether the appellant can conceivably have contemplated that one of the consequences of any conviction might be the loss of this long-term, much cherished and highly valued home. 'The loss of it would indeed, in our judgement, be most disproportionate.' Adam Pemberton, Assistant Chief Executive for the charity Victim Support said:'Sadly, this family's experience is not an isolated case. 'All too often victims of sexual assault tell us they do not feel safe when the person convicted of a crime against them is released. 'It is critical that crime victims can have their say throughout the criminal justice process. Without their evidence and testimony, criminals would not be put away.'","The 52-year-old sex attacker's home is opposite his 14-year-old victim .

"PTA chairwoman Louise Daly, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, has been given a 12 month sentence suspended for two years after she stole thousands from her children's primary school . A PTA co-chairwoman, who stole nearly £20,000 from her boys' primary school, was handed a suspended prison sentence yesterday. Louise Daly, 42, took thousands of pounds between September 26, 2012 and January 3 this year, after she was put in charge of the St. Joseph's Roman Catholic PTA's debit card. The mother-of-two stole a total of £19,202 to help fund her household bills and husband's drinking problem, a court heard. None of the money has been recovered. Daly's theft was only discovered after a new committee went through the PTA's finances and found thousands of pounds were missing. Sentencing her to twelve months imprisonment, suspended for two years, Judge Douglas Moore told Daly she had 'brought  shame on your children and yourself'. The court heard she had been under pressure to cover bills and the rent and had begun stealing. Prosecutor Philip Levy said Daly had been given a PTA debit card in the name of the previous co-chairperson when she was named a chairwoman at the organisation. 'The fraud came to light because she was struggling with the job and a new committee took over six months early and went through all the bank statements,' Mr Levy added. 'A lot of money had been taken out of the PTA account and revenue raised at various functions had been taken and not banked.' 'There was no way this was not going to come to light and when interviewed Miss Daly was very upset and agreed to repay the money by instalments, but so far nothing has been received.' Daly's lawyer Hugh O'Donohue claimed his client, who receives £2,300  sick pay and £800 from her partner every month, was in a 'black psychological hole.' 'She was under pressure to pay day-to-day expenses and pay the rent,' he said. 'There are difficulties with her partner, who drinks two bottles of wine a night, and she dipped into the funds. 'She has not repeated her troubles to anybody, but it is obvious she needs counselling. She says there was a strain and she had not enough money from time to time so dipped into it.' Daly stole £19,202 from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary School, Hanwell (pictured) while she was a co-chairperson in the PTA . Daly took to the witness box to tell the court that she struggled to pay bills and that she was currently paying out  £20 for school dinners, their after school club was £50 per month; football training was £25 and she was paying the taxman £100 per month for a child tax credits overpayment. 'My partner would make me buy the alcohol,' added Daly, of Greenford Avenue, Ealing, who pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position with intent to make a gain. 'I thought I had taken about ten thousand.' But Judge  Moore told Daly, a psychiatric nurse, there was no excuse for the 'despicable' offence and gave her the suspended sentence, as well as placing her on a two-year's probation and ordered her to pay £500 compensation within seven days and then £100 per month the PTA. 'It's a despicable offence, clearly an abuse of trust. These are children and you know these are difficult times. 'Most people would think you can get by on the £3,100 a month you had coming into the household without stealing £20,000 from a children's primary school.' Judge Moore told Daly she had 'brought shame on your children and yourself' at Isleworth Crown Court yesterday . 'You are a grown woman and knew what you were doing and the only person who has brought misery upon you is yourself. You are not the only person finding things difficult at the moment. 'You just can't turn around and blame everybody else, this was a blatant dishonesty and under normal circumstances you would go into custody, but there are young children here that would suffer. 'You have brought shame on your children and yourself. Nobody is quite sure where this money has gone and you have let people down. 'If the school wishes to take you to court to recover the debt they can. This will take twenty years to repay and that's not going to work. That's nonsensical.' Remarkably, on the school's website is a message from the current PTA committee, which still states: 'We would like to thank the previous PTA team and Louise Daly for all their hard work and all their personal efforts and time they put into helping raise valuable funds towards school events and fundraising.'","Louise Daly, 42, was PTA chair at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Primary .

"The parents of 10 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre have begun legal steps to sue the manufacturers of the AR-15 assault rifle Adam Lanza used to commit his December, 2012, massacre. Twenty first-graders were shot dead and six teachers during the shocking school shooting and 10 parents have filed court documents as of Monday indicating they plan to file wrongful death lawsuits. The filings were made in a probate court opening legal estates in their children's names and most of those parents checked a box on the forms saying they intend to file wrongful death actions, with themselves as administrators. Scroll down for video . Grief: Lynn and Christopher McDonnell, the parents of seven-year-old Grace McDonnell, grieve near Sandy Hook Elementary after learning their daughter was one of 20 school children and six adults killed after a gunman opened fire inside the school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012 . While the initial documents do not state who the targets of these lawsuits could be, several families met with attorneys from Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, a Bridgeport, Connecticut law firm, to discuss legal action against Bushmaster. Bushmaster is the North Carolina based manufacturer of the AR-15 assault rifle 20-year-old Lanza used. In addition, according to the Hartford Courant, there have been discussions about suing Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza and Newtown because of a lack of security at the school. The statute of limitations in Connecticut dictate that Sunday is the last day any civil lawsuits could be filed. According to the Hartford Courant, the families would sue the insurance company that holds the policy against Nancy Lanza's Newtown home where her son shot her dead in the morning before his killing spree. Negligence:On December 14, 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his way into the school with a Bushmaster rifle and killed 20 children and six educators, then shot himself to death with a handgun. The school shooting came after Lanza killed his mother, Nancy (left), at their Newtown home . In this handout crime scene evidence photo provided by the Connecticut State Police, shows the Bushmaster Adma Lanza used at Sandy Hook Elementary School following the December 14, 2012 shooting rampage . The estate is worth $64,000. Several parents who filed the estate documents didn't immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday. The probate court filings involve 10 children killed in the massacre: Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Jesse Lewis, Ana Marquez-Greene, Grace McDonnell, Jack Pinto, Jessica Rekos, Avielle Richman and Benjamin Wheeler. State investigations into the shooting indicated that Lanza was interested in mass killings, played violent video games and had books that dealt with death. State police reports also included descriptions of Lanza's disturbing childhood writings, his access to his mother's legally owned guns and his mental health troubles and sporadic treatment. Horror: First-grader Henry Terifay and his sister, fourth-grader Kelly Terifay, are comforted outside the Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut . Home: Despite being handed over to Newtown, the home of Nancy Lanza would be valued as part of the estate should the parents of 10 children killed in Newtown sue . Days after the killings, lawyer Irving Pinsky asked a state agency for permission to sue the state for $100 million on behalf of an unnamed 6-year-old survivor of the massacre, saying state officials failed to shield his client from foreseeable harm. Pinsky withdrew the request days later.","December 14 is the two-year anniversary of the school shooting .

"T-shirts bearing an ironic slogan from the notorious 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite are being sold online in the run-up to Christmas. The t-shirts, currently available to buy on Amazon, are emblazoned with a quote from the terror suspect which references her former husband's involvement in the July 7 London bombings. Lewthwaite is one of the world's most wanted women and was widowed after her husband Germaine Lindsay's 2005 suicide bombing of the London underground - part of a wider plot which killed 52 people. The t-shirt (pictured) features a statement by Lewthwaite in which she condemned her husband's role in the 2005 London attacks. She has since gone on to become the world's most wanted female terrorist . Lewthwaite (pictured) is the subject of an Interpol red alert arrest warrant and has been linked to terrorist activities in east Africa . The t-shirts state: 'Jamal is accountable for his actions 100 (per cent) and I condemn with all my heart what he has done. Samantha Lewthwaite.' The quote is taken from an interview she gave to the press following revelations of her husband's involvement in the attacks, The Telegraph reported. It refers to him by his second name, Jamal. The manufacturer's listing states the 'amazing quote t-shirt will not go out of style', adding they make tops that are 'ageless' and are in 'admiration of incredible novelists, playwrights, creative thinkers, and philosophers that are icons to our generation. 'These popular writer tees convey the essence of self-assurance, knowledge, thought, inspiration, wisdom, love, the meaning of life, the universe and all sorts of things.' Despite her public condemnation of his actions, she is now considered to be the world's most dangerous female terrorist, with links to Al-Shabaab in Somalia. The  30-year-old, from Buckinghamshire, is believed to be 'alive and well' and living in southern Somalia with a jihadist husband, a wanted al-Qaeda suspect who calls himself Marco Costa. In a forged Mozambican passport obtained by MailOnline, his picture clearly identifies him as Fahmi Jamal Salim, who has been on the run from Kenyan police since he shot and killed two police officers in Nairobi in 2011. In love: Lewthwaite and her new husband Fahmi Jamal Salim appear in a 'selfie' taken at their home in Somalia . Major threat: Lewthwaite and her new husband Salim (pictured) are major operatives in Al-Shabaab . Lewthwaite and Salim also appear in a 'selfie' taken at their home. Police are using these and pictures of their two children in a countrywide manhunt for the couple. Counter-terrorism sources in Kenya revealed their updated profile of Lewthwaite last month in response to claims from a Moscow news agency last month that she had been killed by sniper fire while fighting with a Ukrainian volunteer battalion against pro-Russian rebels. Kenyan intelligence authorities are demanding to see Lewthwaite's body and say they refuse to believe she has been part of any militia outside East Africa. By marrying Salim, Lewthwaite has joined a family steeped in Muslim extremism and the jihad. Salim's brother-in-law was notorious al-Qaeda recruiting officer Musa Dheere, shot dead at a roadblock in Mogadishu in 2011 alongside Fazul Mohamed, a terror suspect with a $5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head. Dheere was wanted for the bombing of American embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in 1998 when several hundred were killed. Lewthwaite slipped through a British police net through a series of blunders after her former husband's involvement in the London bomb plot. Lewthwaite claimed to have known nothing of his extremist activities but she next surfaced in 2011 in a Muslim ghetto area of Mombasa where she was assembling bomb-making equipment with other Al-Shabaab suspects. Several were arrested and are currently standing trial while Lewthwaite fooled local counter-terrorism police with a false South African passport for herself and her two young children by Lindsay.","T-shirts being sold feature quote from world's most wanted female terrorist .

"The headmaster of one of Britain's leading public schools has said the Education Secretary needs to be more radical if she wants to help the have-nots. In a piece published yesterday, Sir Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington College where fees are more than £30,000 a year, also said of Conservative MP Nicky Morgan: 'She came to the job knowing little about schools and with no great interest in education.' He went on to write: 'Unlike Michael Gove, she is busy nursing a marginal seat. A big ask for anyone, let alone with only nine months in post before a probable departure at the general election.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (right) has been accused of 'knowing little about schools' by Wellington College headmaster, Sir Anthony Seldon (left). He has also claimed she has 'no great interest in education' Sir Anthony, 61, who has led the co-educational school in Berkshire for eight years, described Mrs Morgan as 'a practising Christian' who 'came to her job believing morality is essential in schools.' The piece comes after the Education Secretary pledged this week to spend £5million on soldiers visiting schools to teach children about 'grit' and 'determination'. Mrs Morgan replaced Michael Gove in the Prime Minister's cabinet reshuffle in July. In a comment piece written for The Times newspaper, Sir Anthony went on to recommend that funds should instead be spent on 'providing the means for all independent schools to sponsor academies'. Sir Anthony, who is one of Britain's most well-known headmasters, also said that Mrs Morgan should 'charge the well-off too for places at top state schools'. He added that a quarter of places at independent and top state schools should be kept for children from deprived backgrounds. Sir Anthony was knighted in June for services to education after he introduced his own curriculum, which includes lessons in happiness at the £33,000 a year co-educational school. Sir Anthony is headmaster of  Wellington College, Berkshire (above), where annual fees are more than £30,000 . He also founded Wellington Academy in 2009 with the aim of providing 'quality education to people who can't afford to pay fees'. In the piece, Sir Anthony expressed a concern that Britain is 'heading into the 2015 election with none of the three major political parties having any serious policies to tackle the deep social divide in Britain's education'. In a foreboding warning to the Government, he wrote: 'We will never see social mobility rise in Britain until young people from disadvantaged backgrounds acquire the confidence and character skills of independent school leavers.' He called for Mrs Morgan and Tristram Hunt, the Shadow Education Secretary, to 'embrace radical solutions if we are to make any progress'.","Education Secretary accused of 'knowing little about schools' and being busy 'nursing a marginal seat', says head of Wellington College .

"Alisha Mahmood, who has been jailed after she was found to have taken part in a sham marriage after investigators discovered crib sheets listing details about her new husband . A sham marriage gang has been jailed after a fake bride was caught with a crib sheet listing her bogus husband's height, shoe size, how they met and how often they had sex. Alisha Mahmood was part of a gang who staged fake weddings to allow Pakistani men to gain visas to live in the UK by marrying British brides they had never met. The women were allegedly paid up to £7,000 each to take part in bogus ceremonies in Nottingham, Leicester and Hertfordshire in a bid to get around border controls. The crib sheet was made to prepare Mahmood, 21, to answer questions if quizzed by the authorities about her new husband. Details included his height, weight, shoe sizes, the colour of the walls and carpets in his house and even how frequently they had sex. At Sheffield Crown Court yesterday, Mahmood was jailed for 21 months after being convicted of conspiring to facilitate a breach of the UK immigration laws following a four week trial. Gang leader Masoud Rasab, 38, who arranged the fake marriages was also jailed for four years, while another fake bride Sabrina Khan was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. Fake groom Umair Hussain was jailed for 21 months and will be deported once he has finished his sentence. During the trial the court heard how the Pakistani men all entered the country on student visas and took part in sham weddings before seeking Home Office permission to remain in the UK. Chris Smith, prosecuting, said: 'The women in this case were prepared for money to marry men they did not love. It was less about passion and more about profit.' The court heard how Mahmood had become a 'bride' in a sham marriage in Nottingham with a groom who had arrived in the UK in April 2006 on a student visa. The couple were reported to the Home Office by a suspicious registrar who said they saw 'little interaction between the couple'. Gang leader Masoud Rasab, left, was jailed for four years for his part in arranging the sham marriages, while Sabrina Khan, right, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after she acted as a fake bride . Suspicions were also raised when the groom claimed he had only just moved into his address when in fact he had lived there for four years. The couple were eventually arrested when they attended a Home Office interview in Sheffield after the crib sheet was found at Mahmood's home. Mr Smith added: 'It gave his height, weight, shoe size, details of the early stages of their relationship and the frequency of their love-making.' The court was also told that Khan, 29, married 28-year-old Umair Hussain, when he arrived in the UK on a student visa in April 2006. Umair Hussain, who was found to have been a fake groom at one of the weddings. He was sentenced to 21 months in jail and will be deported back to Pakistan . They married at Leicester Registry Office in November 2011, a month after they met, and just six weeks before Hussain's visa was due to expire. Investigators later found a 'fistful' of receipts under a mattress at his home in Sheffied showing he had paid £2,000 into Khan's bank account. The couple then applied for Hussain to remain in the UK and provided utility bills in their joint names. But Mr Smith explained: 'Sabrina Khan was somewhat single. Department of Work and Pensions records showed she was claiming benefit as a single person long after they had married.' Months later, mobile records showed she was having 'intimate conversations' with another man and she sent a text to her husband saying: 'Can you text your address? I need to change my address to your details.' Another sham marriage was then arranged involving Keeley Cox and another man, after she was recruited by her friend Mahmood. Three men turned up at her house including Rasab, and asked Cox if she wanted to marry someone for cash and discovered that Mahmood and Khan would get £250 for every willing bride they could recruit. In April 2012, Cox was picked to undergo a sham marriage at Nottingham Registry Office and 'vile' threats were made against her and her children when she tried to pull out. The court heard how Rasab organised a network of recruit agents to bring in new 'brides' with Khan in charge of groundwork and Mahmood acting as a scout. Judge Michael Murphy told Rasab: 'You are a businessman and entrepreneur and a thoroughly dishnonest person. It was motivated by greed.' As he jailed the gang, the judge told them that the UK's immigration laws reflected that human beings tend to meet and fall in love and wish to live together. But he added the group had undermined the system explaining: 'Where people like you four seek to exploit the system you undermine it for others and cause public confidence in the immigration laws to be reduced. 'It is no defence whatsoever for any one of you to say that you were hard up. Many people today are hard up.' Rasab, left, was described as the ring leader of the gang, while Khan, right, was said to be a 'recruiter and persuader' He said Khan was a 'recruiter and persuader' and Mahmood had played a part in getting vulnerable Keeley Cox to join the enterprise. He said he had to pass deterrent sentences because sham marriages had become a 'prevalent' crime in the UK. Speaking after sentence was passed, Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'These sentences send a clear message to the criminals who think they can cheat our immigration laws. While Home Office investigator Mark Bates added: 'This was a persistent attempt to trample over the UK's immigration laws by a gang driven by dishonesty and greed.' Cox has also admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach of the UK immigration laws and will be sentenced later this week. Tahir Siddique, 41, of Sheffield was found not guilty of allowing his home to be used as part of the conspiracy. A couple who allegedly took part in a fourth bogus wedding in Hertfordshire, Tracy Coulstock, 48, and Gul Khatab, 35, will face trial later this year. Two Pakistani nationals, Yasir Irshad Awan, 28, and Muhammad Ishaque, 35 are still wanted by investigators in connection with the sham marriage ring.","Alisha Mahmood, 21, had the sheet in case she was quizzed by officials .

"More than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years thanks to sky-high taxes and government red tape. The smoking ban, increases in alcohol duty and declining real wages since the recession have directly contributed to more than half of all closures since 2006. The Institute of Economic Affairs said that taxes on drink in the UK are so high that British drinkers pay 40 per cent of the amount raised in alcohol duty raised across the whole of the EU. A think tank has warned that more than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years, including this boarded up establishment in central London, due to high taxes and the smoking ban . The think tank called for an end to the thrust of recent government policy which it said had actively discouraged people from visiting their local. As part of a radical package of measures to save the British pub, it demanded the watering down of the smoking ban allow people to smoke in special rooms. Report author, Christopher Snowdon, said: 'British pubs may be suffering from long-term cultural shifts, but government policies have hugely exacerbated this trend. 'Taxation and regulation have been the leading causes of the decimation of the UK pub industry since 2006. 'The level of alcohol duty in the UK is hugely regressive, hitting the poorest the hardest. 'Taxes must be lowered, and one-size-fits-all policies like the current smoking ban must be reconsidered if we are to temper the rate of decline of the British pub.' The report said that although the last forty years have been characterised by a drastic decline in the pub industry, the rate of closures has accelerated over the past decade thanks to the smoking ban and tax hikes . Since 2006 the number of pubs has plummeted from just over 58,000 to 48,000, a drop of nearly 20 per cent. In his report, Closing Time – Who's killing the British pub?, Mr Snowdon found that changing social trends- such as changing tastes and the shift towards home drinking – did not alone explain the rapid acceleration of pub closures in recent years. Instead, policies such as the smoking ban and alcohol duty escalator are responsible for speeding up the rate of closures in the past decade compared to the last forty years of steady decline in the pub industry. 'In 2008 the government raised alcohol duty by six per cent in real terms and introduced a duty escalator that automatically increased alcohol taxes by two per cent above inflation every year thereafter,' he said. 'In 2011, VAT rose to 20 per cent. Combined with falling real wages during the recession, drinking has become much less affordable. The escalator was finally abandoned this year, yet taxes remain high.' Traditional pubs (like the one pictured) are under threat unless the government water down the smoking ban to allow people to smoke in special rooms . He argued there was no need to bow to calls for government intervention in the form of taxpayers' money to boost failing pubs. Instead, to end the downward spiral of the industry, Mr Snowden claimed ministers must lower alcohol duty and VAT, as well as reconsidering one-size-fits-all policies such as the smoking ban. The report said some cultural changes were also damaging the British pub, with a 16 per cent fall in beer purchases in supermarkets and off-licenses since 2003, but a 'colossal' 54 per cent fall in beer purchases in pubs. It means pubs are selling half as much beer as they did eleven years ago - largely thanks to a move towards cheap drinks in supermarkets. Economic changes have also led to better domestic living conditions, a shrinking of the working class and decline of heavy industry, which explain some changes to the health of the pub industry. The post-2006 decline, however, is exceptional and gradual cultural change cannot explain it. Much of the blame, however, is lain squarely at the door of the government. The report said: 'The past seven years have been characterised by a flurry of policies which have severely damaged the pub industry. The smoking ban, introduced in 2007, has also had a big impact. 'Although only 20 per cent of Brits smoke regularly, smokers have always been disproportionately more likely to drink and visit pubs,' the report said. 'Following the introduction of the smoking ban, the amount of pub customers who smoked fell from 54 per cent to under 40 per cent in just two years.' The IEA called on ministers to halve alcohol duty - pointing out that British drinkers pay 40 per cent of the EU's entire alcohol duty bill. Halving the duty would bring it into line with the European average, which would reduce both the cost of living and alcohol fraud. The think tank added that VAT should be lowered from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, with a lower rate of VAT for food sold in pubs and restaurants, as happens in many European countries . Calling the smoking ban 'one of the most uncompromising' in the world, the IEA said there is clearly a market for venues that allow smoking in one or more ventilated rooms. The think tank also said planning rules which currently prohibit new pubs from opening in areas of high demand should be scrapped.","Since 2006  number of pubs has fallen by 20 per cent from 58,000 to 48,000 .

"When choosing your Christmas dinner playlist, select carefully - it could improve the taste of your food and drink. Eating a festive meal while listening to Elton John's Step Into Christmas will reduce the intensity of flavours, while the sultry tones of Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby improves them, according to a study. The world's largest multisensory tasting experiment found that a change in colour and sound can immediately affect the taste of wine by nearly ten per cent - and also changes how we taste food. The multisensory experiment found that a change in colour and sound can immediately affect the taste of wine - and also changes how we taste food . Listening to Elton John's Step into Christmas and Wham!'s Last Christmas will reduce the intensity of wine . Everything from the colour of the tablecloth, and the scent of the candles to the songs playing in the background can significantly impact the taste of traditional Christmas dinner and drinks, says the research by Oxford University experimental psychologist Professor Charles Spence. The professor analysed the nation's favourite Christmas tunes to find out which ones will most affect the taste buds – creating a perfect playlist to enhance this year's festive experience. The traditional Christmas colours of red and green provided the perfect palette for the research and ten songs were divided into two categories to help identify key results. Music like Eartha Kitt's (pictured) Santa Baby intensifies the flavour of wine, according to the study . Eating brussel sprouts off a green plate  makes them more palatable as the colour counteracts the flavour . The experiment showed that drinking red wine while listening to 'sweet' music - such as Kitt - under a red light was the preferred combination, increasing enjoyment of wine by as much as 10 per cent. Green light and 'sour music' - such as Elton's track or Wham!'s Last Christmas - increased freshness and reduced intensity of the wine by 14 per cent. Sweet music has a high pitch and a consonant harmony, while sour tunes and dissonant harmony. Using a red tablecloth and serving a fruity red wine in red tinted wine glasses will make food taste sweeter . Sweet Christmas Tunes to enhance the taste of wine . Celine Dion – The Christmas Song . Eartha Kitt – Santa Baby . Bing Crosby – White Christmas . Rod Stewart & Dave Koz – Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Dean Martin – Baby, It's Cold Outside . Sweet music is associated with music that has a high pitch, consonant harmony, legato articulation, and slow tempo. The piano is an instrument often associated with sweetness. Sour Christmas Tunes to reduce the intensity of wine . Mariah Carey – All I Want For Christmas . Elton John – Step Into Christmas . Daryl Hall & John Oates – Jingle Bell Rock . Jackson 5 – Santa Claus is Coming to Town . Wham! – Last Christmas . People tend to associate sourness with music that has a high pitch, dissonant harmony, staccato articulation, and fast tempo. Brass instruments are often associated with sourness. Commenting on the findings, Professor Spence said: 'We knew that the results would have an impact on the environment created by restaurants, but it's now clear it can have a huge impact on the environment you create in your own home. 'This festive season applying the findings to your own dining table may well make the food and wine taste even better.' The research also found that serving food in different coloured plates and settings would increase the enjoyment of the item. 'Research has shown how everything from the glass we drink to the colour and shape of the plate we eat off can influence what we think about whatever we happen to be consuming,' he said. Guests  are more likely to enjoy sprouts served off a green plate because the visual cue counteracts the bitter flavour, the study found. And using a red tablecloth and serving a fruity red wine in red tinted wine glasses will enhance the sweet flavour profiles of cranberry sauce and pigs in blanket. People eat significantly more mince pies in an environment that looks, sounds and smells like Christmas, so pine needle and orange scented candles will help clear those plates. The research was commissioned by Spanish winemaker Campo Viejo and involved 3,000 people who took part in the brand's Streets of Spain festival.","Professor Charles Spence conducted multisensory tasting experiment .

"A Melbourne council has been forced to admit that ratepayers  have been let down after forking out for $153,000 worth of golden ribbons and cardboard stars to line shopping strips in the lead-up to Christmas. This is the first year Bayside council has put up decorations across nine shopping strips in Melbourne's southeastern exclusive waterside suburbs - and judging from the reaction of residents - it has been an epic fail. The village streets are lined with golden ribbon wrapped around trees and cardboard golden stars placed on the side of rubbish bins and fences with the occasional pieces of tinsel. Bayside council has spent $153,000 worth of golden ribbons and cardboard stars to line the shopping strips . Ratepayers say the decorations were a big waste of their money . Residents express disbelief about the Christmas decorations on the council's Facebook page . Beaumaris resident Renata Frith said most people were complaining about the lack of creative effort. 'Its lovely to have festive spirit but there has been no positivity about it - it's more of an embarrassment really,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's not really good use of money and it doesn't look that festive - it's just a ribbon around a tree.' A shop manager on Bay St in Brighton, who did not want to be named, told Daily Mail Australia that she expected more for a nice suburb. 'It's pretty pathetic - it's just gold paper wrapped around a tree - I think it's a pretty poor effort,' she said. 'We have a lot of clients coming in and saying it is a poor effort - it's not even Christmasy decorations - there's not much Christmas spirit here.' The decorations have been described as 'woeful', 'tragic', and 'embarrassing' by residents . The council admits to not meeting community's expectations with the first year of street decorations . Bayside Mayor Felicity Frederico has conceded that the council had needed lived up to the festive expectations of their ratepayers. 'In hindsight we probably tried to do too much with too little in our first year and spread ourselves too thin,' she said in a statement. 'We’re getting lots of feedback. We know we haven’t met community expectations in our first year.' 'We’ll review all that feedback in planning for next year to achieve a bigger impact.' Residents even took to the council's Facebook page to express their dissatisfaction over the decorations. One ratepayer described them as 'woeful', 'tragic' and 'very tacky'. Another said the decorations were disappointing and embarrassing. Cr Frederico added that the decorations were part of a package to create a festive vibe in the shopping centres and support local traders who struggle to compete with the likes of Southland at Christmas. 'We are also running a shop window display competition to encourage traders to decorate their shop windows and organising school and church groups to sing carols in our shopping strips,' she said. The council will review the feedback in planning for next year to achieve a 'bigger impact'","Bayside Council spent $153,000 on gold ribbons and stars across nine shopping strips in southeast Melbourne .

"An 87-year-old woman has expressed her thanks to four 'good looking' policemen who kindly transported her 350 miles cross-country to see her critically sick child. Helen 'Skeeter' Smith from Panaca, Nevada, was en route to see her son Randy on Friday evening when she got pulled over for speeding and accidentally pranged a patrol car in the process. Deciding she wasn't safe to drive, one officer transported her a quarter of the way on her journey before she changed to three other vehicles to reach her final destination. Thankful: Helen 'Skeeter' Smith from Panaca, Nevada, 87, has expressed her thanks to four 'good looking' policemen who kindly transported her 350 miles cross-country to see her critically sick child . 'She was very excited to tell me about her dogs, her cat and her hometown,' trooper Andrew Pollard told KUTV. Smith ran into trouble when she was pulled over for driving too closely to Trooper Jeff Jones' patrol car at about 7pm Friday in the central Utah town of Fillmore. But after speaking to him she was let go with a warning. However, as Smith drove away, she accidentally put her car in reverse and hit Jones' patrol car. Chain reaction: Trooper Jeff Jones (left) drove Smith north to Juab County, where Trooper Jared Jensen (right) picked her up and escorted her to Utah County . Quite a drive: There, they met up with Trooper Chris Bishop (left), and he drove Smith to Salt Lake County - Trooper Pollard (right) then completed the  180-mile journey to Ogden Regional Medical Center with Smith . Your carriage awaits: Dash cam footage shows Smith being escorted from vehicle to vehicle . She told him where she was going while they dealt with the dent. Convinced it might not be safe for Smith to drive, Jones arranged for her car to be moved to a secure place and be picked up by her family. He then drove Smith north to Juab County, where Trooper Jared Jensen picked her up and escorted her to Utah County. There, they met up with Trooper Chris Bishop, and he drove Smith to Salt Lake County. Trooper  Pollard then completed the approximately 180-mile journey to Ogden Regional Medical Center with her. Critically ill: Her son Randy, suffering from an unnamed condition, isn't doing well, but she's glad to be with him for treatment . They arrived at 10:30pm. 'To hold her hand walking into the hospital was very, very rewarding,' Pollard said. Smith said she was grateful she didn't have to brave the freeway alone late at night. Plus, she enjoyed her travel companions. 'Four good-lookin' patrol boys brought me,' she said.

"Hallmark Cards Inc. has removed blue and silver gift wrap from circulation after a customer complained that she saw a swastika embedded in the design. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company alerted retailers to the problem Monday after receiving a complaint on Sunday night from a Walgreen's customer in Northridge, California. The disputed wrap was featured in a Hanukkah display but Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Elliott says the gift wrap wasn't intended for the Jewish holiday. Offensive: Cheryl Shapiro displays the Hanukkah gift wrap with a swastika-like pattern she found at Walgreens in Northridge, California before being recalled . The Kansas City Star reports the gift wrap was distributed by Walgreen's, which is no longer selling it. Elliott said in a news release that Hallmark didn't intend to offend anyone. She said it was an oversight that no one at Hallmark noticed that intersecting lines in the paper could be seen as a swastika pattern. 'We apologize for the oversight and apologize to anyone who was offended. That obviously was not our intent,' said Hallmark spokeswoman Julie Elliott. 'It was an oversight on our part to not notice the intersecting lines that could be seen as a swastika pattern.' Elliott told The Kansas City Star that the gift wrap was  based on a design in the Hallmark archives that itself was inspired by an old Chinese vase. In some cultures, the interlocking lines were a symbol of good luck and prosperity. The Nazi's later adopted the pattern and that's when the design grew a stigma attached to it. Other companies such as Zara have faced criticism for using 'anti-Semitic' symbols. Zara has been accused of using lined designs that mimic a swastika. They were also criticized earlier this year for selling a t-shirt with a gold star on it that resembled stars on shirts that Jews were made to wear in Nazi Germany. Pulled: This is an example of the 'swastika like' pattern used on gift wrap that Hallmark removed from circulation after fielding complaints from customers .","Hallmark Cards Inc. has removed blue and silver gift wrap from circulation after a customer complained that she saw a swastika in the design .

"A judge is allowing a jailed Utah woman a goodbye visit from the baby she stands accused of dumping  in a trashcan and leaving to die. Alicia Englert will have one supervised 90-minute visit with the now 3-month-old baby, Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills decided during a conference in her chambers Monday. Prosecutor Robert Parrish said he opposed the visit because Englert never had a relationship with the child. Permission: A judge is letting Englert (left in her booking pictured and right, at a court appearance in September) have a goodbye visit with her infant daughter, who authorities say survived after the woman left her in a trashcan to die . The girl is in the process of being adopted by another family after the 23-year-old woman waived her parental rights a few weeks ago. 'I'm pretty sure Alicia said goodbye to the baby when she put the baby in the neighbor's trash can,' Parrish said. Other members of her family also will be allowed to attend the visit, scheduled for Monday. Hidden: Englert shields her face as she is escorted by police from a home in Kearns, Utah in this August 26 file photo . Defense attorney Weyher Fulkerson said in a statement the case is complicated and very sad, and the visit is separate from the criminal proceedings. Parrish said the visit was granted as an exception to a no-contact order in the case. Prosecutors say Englert gave birth at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. She left the baby without food or medical care for at least a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash August 26, police said. Prosecutors say the baby would have died if she hadn't been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a purring cat. The girl was inside a trashcan under bags of garbage and suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection. She was flown to a hospital and recovered after she was placed on a ventilator. Parrish said Tuesday the baby is doing well. Englert faces an attempted murder charge in the case, and a review is expected to determine whether she's mentally competent to stand trial. She was released on bail in October. If convicted, Englert faces up to life in prison. Englert's family has said she has a learning disability, didn't know she was pregnant and couldn't understand why what she did was wrong. Elizabeth Sollis, spokeswoman for the Utah Division of Child and Family Services, said goodbye visits are fairly common for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody. The visits are supervised by social workers. Ready to mingle? Englert maintained a dating profile, which stated she did not have any children . Social: Englert and her apparent friends were seen 'partying' in this image released by Fox 13 . In August, Fox13 published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said. The affiliate station also reported on Englert's 'Meet Me :)' profile, which stated she didn't have any children. In full, her 'About Me' section read, 'hi my name is alicia im 23 years old I work full time I have brown hair im 5'1 I have no kids I do drink but only on the weekends I have my own car I still live with my mom and dad for now!!! if you want to know more just ask ;)' Fox13 said its Facebook commenters, responding to Englert's story, said 'they don't believe she has severe learning disabilities because she had a driver's license, drove her own car, was normal at work and 'partied a lot.'' In August, Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill outlined the days prior to and of the birth. Gill offered new details about what happened in the 36 hours leading up to the baby being found by a neighbor in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. Englert gave birth in a bathroom inside the house she lived in with her family around midnight on Aug. 24, Gill said. She wrapped the baby in a towel and left it on the floor of the basement bathroom, he said. Bust a move: Englert seems to dance on the ground while at a party while apparently pregnant with her baby . Englert left for work the following day, leaving the baby alone without feeding her or getting her any care. She came back home that night and left the baby on the floor. The next morning, Englert put the baby in her neighbor's trash can just before 6 a.m., Gill said. A neighbor heard sounds of what she thought was a purring cat in her trash can. When she moved several trash bags, she spotted the baby, Gill said. She couldn't get the baby out and ran next door for help. There, she found Englert's father, Robert Englert, who helped get the baby out of the trash can. Emergency responders put the baby on a life-flight helicopter. The baby was dirty, smelly and had a blood-borne infection, Gill said. 'If the baby had not been discovered and not received medical condition, it certainly would have died,' he said. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. Robert Englert has said previously his daughter has a learning disability and has only recently begun to understand what she has done.","Alicia Englert will be allowed to see her baby before the child is given up for adoption .

"A 67-year-old fisherman who sent out a distress signal off the coast of Hawaii on Thanksgiving day has been found and rescued 64 miles out to sea - nine days after the US Coast Guard called off the search for him. Ron Ingraham reemerged with a simple distress call on Tuesday morning: 'We got a mayday here. Mayday. This is the Malia. Anybody picking this up?' He was dehydrated and hungry, but otherwise healthy. A Coast Guard cutter is towing his crippled 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, back to its port in Kaunakakai. Ron Ingraham, 67, was rescued on Tuesday morning after 12 days lost at sea. His friends and family had planned a funeral service for Saturday . Ingraham, center, was hungry and dehydrated by OK when US Navy personnel reached him on Tuesday after he sent out another distress call . Ingraham will arrive home in time to attend his own funeral - which friends and family had planned for Saturday, KITV reports. His son, Zakary Ingraham, told KHNL-TV that he got a call at his home in St Joseph, Missouri, on Tuesday morning. 'They said, ""Well, we found your dad. He's alive and well on his boat."" For him to be found is awesome. I can't believe it,' he said. Ron Ingraham, an experienced fisherman, was sailing alone from Kaunakakai Harbor to Manele Bay on Lanai on November 27, Thanksgiving Day - a journey that should have put him no more than five miles from land at any time. But something went horribly wrong. On the day he left, he sent out two distress signals that his boat was taking on water. The Coast Guard pinpointed his message as coming 46 miles west of Kailua-Kona - dramatically off his course. The Coast Guard mounted a massive search effort - flying 59 airborne mission that covered 12,000 square miles with in five days. However, the distress signal went dark and planes and helicopters found no signs of Ingraham's boat. On December 1, Coast Guard commanders called off the search effort after failing to find Ingraham. Crippled: Ingraham's 25-foot sailboat, the Malia, had both masts snapped and the outboard motor mangled. It was towed back to his home port . Rescued: Ingraham sent a distress call far off course - and was found 80 miles from his original mayday signal . This video from a Coast Guard seaplane shows US Navy crewmen providing aid to the crippled Malia . The Navy destroyer the USS Paul Hamilton happened to be just 14 miles from the Malia when the new distress signal came in. It rushed over and rescued the sailor . Then, nine days later, he resurfaced with a miraculous mayday call. A Coast Guard post picked up the distress signal and pinpointed it 64 miles south of Oahu - or about 80 miles from his first distress call. A Navy destroyer, the USS Paul Hamilton was nearby and rushed to Ingraham's aid. They found him healthy - though his board was crippled. Both his main masts had snapped and the outboard motor was mangled. He was sailing under the power of a tiny auxiliary sail, attempting to make it back to land. Coast Guard authorities have no idea how he ended up so far from shore. And it remains a mystery how Ingraham was able to survive for 12 days at sea. 'Twelve days, man. He's a champ! He's tough!' his son told KHNL. And now, the memorial service that had been planned in Kaunakakai to mourn Ingraham's death has been revised. It's not a welcome home party. 'We're going to turn it into a celebration instead of a funeral,' pal Chris Connor told KITV.","Ron Ingraham, 67, was sailing between two Hawaiian islands on Thanksgiving day when he was blown far off course .

"It's Christmas time - and that song is back. The Band Aid one I mean, originally (and brilliantly) released to bring relief to the terrible Ethiopian famine of 1984. They've changed the lyrics this time, mainly to focus on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but also to spare a few blushes. In the original, Geldof's stars sang of 'no snow in Africa… where no rain nor rivers flow'. That didn't quite key with the geography of the continent, still less so Ethiopia, where the Blue Nile originates, half the country gets more rain than London, and higher mountains are snow-capped all year round. Green and pleasant land: The Simien Mountains present a different side to Ethiopia than many expect . Ironically perhaps, one enduring legacy of the Band Aid song is that, even 30 years on, Ethiopia feels like a distinctly odd place for a holiday. You think of it as a country in need of aid rather than visitors. I'm not sure I would have gone there myself if I hadn't been a supporter of the charity Camara, which takes in unwanted computers and gives them a second life in East Africa. Camara has set up computer rooms in more than 200 Ethiopian schools. Come and see how it works, said the charity's UK chairman John Brown, and then we'll go for a trek in the Simien mountains. A few weeks later I was on a minibus being shuttled to Camara's HQ in Addis Ababa, a city of three million that feels like a small town. A visit to Camara in Addis is something I'd recommend to anyone going to Ethiopia, partly because the work it does is so good. Its HQ also happens to be next to the St George brewery, where waiters in bright blue jackets heft around trays of frothing Ethiopian lager. It is a fun place to start your travels. Hidden treasures: Ethiopia is home to the staggering rock-cut church of Bet Giyorgis, at Lalibela . If you're on a short trip, you'll want to move on pretty soon to the countryside. At the crack of dawn on day two, we were on a plane to Gondar, one of Ethiopia's medieval capitals. The town is most famous for its compound of royal palaces, outside one of which stands a lion cage where Haile Selassie kept the last living emblems of his imperial rule. But its modern life proved just as compelling. Ethiopia, as is swiftly evident, is a strange place. And the oddness begins with its staple food, injera. This is a kind of bread, disarmingly flannel-­like in texture, which is laid out as a tablecloth before mounds of hot curried beef and vegetables are piled on top. You tear off bits of injera to mop them up. Even odder, though, was the nightlife. We stumbled upon a strip of basement bars, and ventured into one rather jolly venue where locals danced in traditional fashion with rapid-fire jerks of their shoulders, before slithering to the floor. Travelling by minibus from Gondar towards the Simien mountains is one of the great journeys in Africa. A few miles out of town you are in a countryside that seems utterly of another era, one where people still harvest and thresh by hand. Into the heart of the matter: The rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are among the country's greatest wonders . And then you start climbing into the highlands, where mountain vistas open up for hundreds of miles across the rift valley. It is literally breathtaking as you climb to an altitude of about 11,500ft and the air visibly chills. A trek in the Simiens is an Ethiopian highlight. Its core is a national park, sparsely populated except by troupes of sandwich-stealing monkeys. We walked along the edge of a ridge, gasping in the thin air and at the endless ripple of peaks and valleys visible all the way to the Tigray - the area where the worst of the famine took place in the 1980s. Above us wheeled vultures, kites and eagles, and in the morning, after a night spent in a sub-zero camp, we emerged to frosty meadows and a mountaintop white with hailstones. A helping hand: Geaeteleawlmesai (right) has been a beneficiary of Camara's recycled computers programme . I thought it would be hard to beat the Simien experience but Lalibela, our next stop, did so. This isolated town, perched amid craggy mountains, is one of the more obscure wonders of the world. It was transformed in the 12th Century into a subterranean 'New Jerusalem' as its rulers set tens of thousands of builders to work, cutting chapels and churches into the rock. It sounds straightforward enough until you realise that they are cut vertically down into the stone, each one a perfect basilica. You wander around this extraordinary complex to be greeted by monks and priests dressed in white robes and guarding their innermost sanctums, in which are housed replicas of the Ark of the Covenant. It was at Lalibela, too, that I had my most memorable charity experience while visiting the local secondary school. We were greeted by a girl called Geaeteleawlmesai (par for the course in Ethiopian names). 'Welcome,' she said. 'My favourite subject is physics. One day I want to be prime minister of Ethiopia. We have very few books and not many teachers but now, thanks to Camara, we have computers. I want to thank you, but can you please send more?' A final note: another of the oddities of Ethiopia is its calendar. The country follows the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar (Britain changed to the latter in 1752), so Christmas Day will this year be celebrated in Ethiopia on January 7, 2015. Food for thought: Mark tried several Ethiopian delicacies, including wat and injera . And that's not the end of the matter. The current year in Ethiopia, which began on our September 11, is 2007. So if you fancy reliving Christmas 2007, there's still time to make plans… . Mark Ellingham travelled with Wild Frontiers (www.wildfrontierstravel.com, 020 7736 3968), which offers small-group and personalised tours of Ethiopia. Camara (www.camara.org, 020 8265 7681) welcomes visitors to its centres in East Africa and, by arrangement, to the schools it equips. If the company you work for has spare computers, Camara would love to send them to Geaeteleawlmesai.

"The widening gap between rich and poor has held back the economy in Britain, a new report warns today. In the last two decades rising inequality knocked almost 9 percentage points off growth in the UK, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said. The global think tank said taxes on the rich did not damage the economy, and could be used to help families with children to improve their lives. Economic growth in most major countries would have been much higher without the impact of inequality between the rich and poor, according to the OECD . Countries where income inequality is falling grow faster than those with rising inequality, the body's latest report states. 'The gap between rich and poor is now at its highest level in 30 years in most OECD countries, it said. As a result, income inequality has curbed economic growth 'significantly'. The overall increase in income inequality has been driven by the very rich 1 per cent of earners dramatically increasing their wealth, pulling away from the rest of society. But the biggest challenge to growth has been families on lower incomes 'slipping behind'. The OECD said: 'This negative effect of inequality on growth is determined not just by the poorest income decile but actually by the bottom 40% of income earners.' In part this is because people from poorer backgrounds are less likely to invest in and improve their education, making it harder for them to increase their earning potential. The report studied how changes in inequality between 1985 and 2005 affected subsequent economic growth between 1990 and 2010. It found that an increasing gap between the haves and have nots has knocked almost 9 percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK, 10 in Mexico and New Zealand and between six and seven in the US, Italy and Sweden in the two decades pre-recession. The report could put pressure on George Osborne to do more to target the wealthy in the tax system to support those on lower incomes . The OECD called for tax rises to be used to redistributed wealth from the richest to the poorest, insisting it would not harm growth, 'provided these policies are well designed and implemented'. OECD secretary general Angel Gurria said: 'This compelling evidence proves that addressing high and growing inequality is critical to promote strong and sustained growth and needs to be at the centre of the policy debate. 'Countries that promote equal opportunity for all from an early age are those that will grow and prosper.' It is the gap between the bottom 40 per cent and the rest of society, not just the poorest 10 per cent, that contributes to the effects of inequality on a country's growth, the paper said. The report is part of the think-tank's efforts to find the root causes and see what lessons can be learned from the global financial crisis. Anti-poverty programmes are not enough to tackle the problem, the OECD warned, claiming 'education is the key'. The paper claims to have discovered new evidence that the main way inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds, lowering social mobility and hampering skills development. While the children of parents who have had low levels of education see their educational outcomes deteriorate as income inequality rises, there is little or no effect on people whose parents have had a middle or high level of education, it said. The paper states that investment is needed in high-quality education, training and healthcare in order to create greater equality of opportunities, and it claims redistributing taxes and benefits does not harm a country's economic growth so long as the policies are 'well-designed, targeted and implemented'.","Inequality gap wider than at any point in 30 years in most countries .

"Television legends David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz are just hours away from their last hurrah as hosts of iconic show At The Movies and there is no more fitting tribute to say goodbye than honouring them through film. Parody video maker Huw Parkinson took a brief break from satirising Australian politics to cut together the well-known scene from Armageddon where Bruce Willis' character Harry delivers a heart-breaking message to his daughter, Grace, played by Liv Tyler with the ABC hosts' farewell. In the hilarious video, Stratton and Pomeranz take over Harry's part in a conversation he has with Grace. Scroll down for video . A parody video features a scene from movie Armageddon (above) cut together with the farewell speech of At The Movies hosts David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz . The scene in Armageddon has Liv Tyler's character in the scene talking to Bruce Willis' character . Grace approaches a screen with static on it before the pair suddenly appear on the monitor. Pomeranz starts with: 'Well as you might heard by now, we've reached the point where we're stepping down from our chairs…’. As it is in the movie, Grace replies: 'I don't understand.' The pair continue as Grace reacts to their dialogue exactly as she does in the movie to Harry's farewell, which makes for amusing viewing. When Stratton and Pomeranz cut out, Grace paws at the screen and cries 'No' with tears running down her face. The famous hosts have graced the silver screen for 28 years and have become a regular fixture in Australian households, giving their often frank reviews on upcoming releases. But Stratton and Pomeranz take the place of Wills in the one-minute long video . Tyler's audio is merged perfectly with Stratton and Pomeranz's dialogue as the video plays out . When the hosts suddenly cut out, Tyler paws dramatically at the screen with tears streaming down her face . Armageddon was released in 1998 and stars Bruce Willis (second from left), Ben Affleck (second from right) and Liv Tyler . Margaret, 70, and David 75, filmed their final episode for the ABC last Tuesday and speaking to The Daily Telegraph at their farewell function, Margaret said  it was an odd feeling to have wrapped. 'It has been really strangely confronting,' she said. 'It just doesn’t feel real. I’m not joking. I think when you bow out like this, you have got to bow out and move over.' Margaret went on to say she and her-co-host were comfortable with the decision to leave the show and would not be returning in the future, but leaving at a time when the ABC was facing cuts was particularly difficult. Speaking to Pedestrian TV, she said: 'I feel like I'm abandoning it in times of need.' While co-host David Stratton added the pair were 'both quite distressed about what's happened in the past two to three weeks' at the home of the public broadcaster. The successful duo were joined at the party by acting royalty Geoffrey Rush, who delivered a speech on the night. Other notable attendees included actors Bryan Brown and his wife Rachel Ward, as well as the managing director of the ABC, Mark Scott. Margaret Pomeranz (left)  and David Stratton (right) have been on television for 28 years on SBS and ABC . Pictured here in their early days, Pomeranz (left) and Stratton (right) are famous for their often frank movie reviews . Margaret and David also gave a farewell speech to their fellow guests. They first appeared together on the SBS channel in 1986, before switching to the ABC in 1994. Over their illustrious career, David and Margaret have interviewed a number of notable celebrities. The final episode of At The Movies will air on Tuesday at 9.30pm. Over the period of time of being on air together, they have also been awarded several times. At their farewell party, Geoffrey Rush was one of the stars who gave a speech to say goodbye to the pair . Margaret was made a Member Of The Order on Australia Day in 2005. In 2001, David was not only awarded the Centenary Medal for 'Service to Australian Society And Australian Film Production, but he also received the Australian Film Institute's Longford Life Achievement Award. While several films were given five star ratings during their time at SBS, only six films were given the highest ratings during the ten year run at ABC.","David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz are hosts of ABC's At The Movies .

"Ryanair is going to great lengths to improve its image and win over customers, but it has topped a list of the ten least client-friendly airlines, according to a new consumer survey. The list, which places British Airways joint sixth with four other major international carriers, is based on how passengers are treated when making complaints. Raclamador.es, a Spanish consumer organisation which conducted the survey, claims Ryanair 'does not accept to resolve complaints amicably. Ryanair has topped a Spanish consumer organisation's list of the top ten 'least client-friendly' airlines . Ticket surcharges and a lack of assistance during delays are common complaints about Ryanair . 'It always demands legal action, but does not want to see a judgement go against it, so typically settles out of court before a hearing.' Raclamador.es also claims that, in the vast majority of cases, the airline denies clients the right to meals and refreshments in case of delays exceeding two hours. In addition, Ryanair has a ticket sales surcharge of €2.50 (approximately £2) each way to fund compensation in case of delays. In a statement, Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'This survey, which was produced by a Spanish claims website, is of dubious merit when Ryanair’s traffic continues to grow strongly to 90m customers this year.' And according to the consumer organisation, British Airways has the same policy as Lufthansa, Air France, Finnair and Alitalia, which tied for sixth. Reclamador.es said: 'Never mediate. To summarise, the approach of these airlines would be ""step on you [the client], do not answer"". British Airways finished in sixth place with four other major international carriers . 'And if they do respond, it is to say that the traveller is not entitled to compensation without further explanation.' Spain's national carrier, Iberia, is listed on the consumer website as the third most unfriendly airline. The airline is part of International Airlines Group, which followed after its merger with British Airways. Spanish national airline, Iberia, is listed  as the third most unfriendly airline to unhappy passengers . Raclamador.es accused Iberia of setting a benchmark 'to hinder the claims process with unnecessary bureaucracy.' It said: 'Sell tickets at a click, yet when the time comes, even just to read claims, it requires signed handwritten documents, DNI [identity cards], commute tickets, AENA complaint forms, etc. for you to receive an answer. 'Different excuses are given on the same flight to different customers, using standard templates with ambiguous content. 'When you have to go to court, many times the company acquiesces, which means that it acknowledges guilt and pays one day before the hearing. 'With this attitude, one gets delayed payment to travellers and the collapse of the Spanish system to their advantage, showing a complete lack of respect to both.'","Consumer organisation Raclamador.es gave Ryanair poor marks .

"A desperate daughter begged police to save her mother and baby half sister as they were being hacked to death with a machete, hammer and screwdriver while she listened on the phone, a court heard today. Roland McKoy allegedly inflicted 'truly horrific injuries' on Valerie Forde, 45, and 22-month-old Jahzara at the family home in Hackney, north London, on March 31 this year. The brutal attack was heard by Mrs Forde's 28-year-old daughter Carrise who became 'hysterical' when she heard her mother and half sister's screams over the phone and called police, jurors at the Old Bailey heard. Flowers outside the Hackney, north London home of murdered mother and baby Valerie Forde, 45, and 22-month-old Jahzara. Roland McKoy is accused of killing them . In the weeks leading up to the deaths, McKoy, 54, who had become 'jealous and difficult', repeatedly threatened to kill her before committing suicide, the court heard . Heartfelt: A poignant note on a floral tribute left outside the family home . Three months earlier, Mrs Forde had ended her 18-year relationship with McKoy and had set that particular date as a deadline for him to move out of the three-bedroom terrace house. But in the weeks leading up to the deaths, McKoy, 54, who had become 'jealous and difficult', repeatedly threatened to kill her before committing suicide, the court heard. In January this year, Mrs Forde texted her sister saying 'I have to be very very careful and pray for my safety each day and night', jurors were told. The following month, she reported him to police after he told a neighbour that he was going to burn the house down with everyone including himself inside, the court heard. When her brother confronted McKoy, he insisted there was nothing to worry about and he had no plans to hurt his ex-partner or their baby daughter. Meanwhile, Mrs Forde began tape recording their conversations or ringing an aunt or her older daughter Carrise Forde on an 'open line'. On the day of the murders, McKoy had still not moved out and the argument that ensued was allegedly overheard down the phone by Ms Forde. She heard screams from her mother and half sister before the defendant said: 'This is the destruction that you have brought onto the family', jurors heard . The court heard that the young child had seen her mother being killed before McKoy slit her throat with the machete. The brutal attack was witnessed by Mrs Forde's  Carrise, 28, who became 'hysterical' when she heard her mother and half sister's screams over the phone and called police, jurors at the Old Bailey (pictured) heard . Prosecutor Ed Brown QC said: 'It is plain that the defendant had attacked Valerie Forde with the hammer, slashed her face and neck with the machete and stabbed her multiple times with the screwdriver. 'It is equally clear from the evidence that the defendant used that same machete to cut Jahzara's neck from one side to the other. Each attack was a brutal one.' Police went to the house in Oswald's Meade and found Mrs Forde and Jahzara dead on the first floor. Beside them, McKoy was curled up in a foetal position surrounded by weapons. When he was roused, he was sick and his vomit smelled of bleach, the court heard. Mr Brown told jurors that a note had been found on the dead woman's face that 'seeks in some perverse way to blame Valerie Forde for what had happened'. The note read: 'Valerie Forde you never stop playing derty ticks (sic) for many years on all people places and things you targets. Now the world must see the sudden destru..tions you creates in our families, our home and on yourself. Our fame in history. Roland.' Mr Brown said the motive for the double murder was 'beyond sensible comprehension' but the evidence suggested it was 'little more than anger and resentment'. The court heard how the Mrs Forde's relationship with McKoy began in 1996 but hit the rocks after she discovered that he was already married to a woman called Pamela McKoy. In 2006, Mrs Forde got a job working at a community project where she became centre manager. But McKoy could not hold down a steady job and in later years earned some money working as a handyman. Mrs Forde told friends that he was 'lazy and used her for money' and also that he was mentally abusing her. McKoy denies the murders and the trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Roland McKoy allegedly murdered Valerie Forde and baby Jahzara .

"A judge is preparing to rule on whether to grant prosecution lawyers an appeal against the decision not to convict Oscar Pistorius of murder after he admitted shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day last year . A  judge has postponed her decision on whether to grant a state appeal that could open the way for Oscar Pistorius to serve more time behind bars - or even allow him to temporarily walk free from prison. Prosecution lawyers have applied for an appeal after Judge Thokozile Masipa in October sentenced the Paralympic gold medallist to five years in jail after a trial that attracted worldwide interest. Pistorius, who was not in court for the hearing, admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013, insisting he thought she was an intruder. The judge found him guilty of culpable homicide, also known as manslaughter, rather than a more serious charge of murdering Steenkamp. Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria courtroom where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said she had made a mistake in her interpretation of the law. He told her: 'There is a very good prospect that we may convince an appeal court that the shortest possible incarceration in a case like this, my lady, is shockingly inappropriate.' Judge Masipa however says she will respond to the prosecution's appeal on Wednesday. Ahead of the application, Miss Steenkamp's mother, June, said she hoped any appeal hearings would finally get to the truth about her daughter's death. She told Alex Crawford from Sky News: 'I wanted the truth (at the trial), but it seems some of the puzzle is missing. 'There's only two people who know what happened. One of them's my daughter and she's not here anymore.' She said an extended prison sentence for the athlete would not make the grieving process any easier for the family. Scroll down for video . Miss Steenkamp added: 'What difference is it going to make to me? I wanted to see him go down the steps [to the court cells]. 'So it doesn't really matter how long - he's going to know that he can't go around hurting people.' Mrs Steenkamp and her husband Barry previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder. In a bizarre twist, Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's leading defence lawyer who specialises in murder trials, said Pistorius could apply for bail even though it 'would cause a public outcry'. He told MailOnline: 'They could reasonably ask the court why must their client wait a year or more in custody while waiting for an appeal against his conviction and sentence. 'The prosecution are appealing against his conviction and sentence and he could end up with a lesser sentence than the one that was handed down.' 'Shockingly inappropriate sentence': Addressing Judge Masipa in the same Pretoria court where the murder trial was conducted, prosecutor Gerrie Nel (above) said she had erred in her interpretation of the law . If Judge Masipa (above) grants the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital . Mr Witz, who predicted the collapse of the Dewani trial weeks ago, said he thought Judge Thokozile Masipa would grant prosecutors leave to appeal Pistorius conviction and sentence later today. Another lawyer said the decision to throw out the Shrien Dewani murder trial in Cape Town yesterday may have a bearing on the appeal because the courts would want to show they are rigorous and fair. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel argued in appeal papers filed last month that Masipa misinterpreted the law when she ruled Pistorius did not intentionally shoot Steenkamp, describing the sentence as 'shockingly light' and 'inappropriate'. Pistorius, a South African athletics superstar after the double amputee competed against able-bodied runners in the Olympics, can qualify for house arrest after serving one sixth of his sentence - 10 months - behind bars, which would mean he could serve the majority of his time outside prison walls. Should Masipa grant the appeal, the case will be heard in South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, the country's judicial capital. Reeva Steenkamp's parents Barry Steenkamp and June Steenkamp, previously said they felt 'let down' by South Africa's justice system after Pistorius was acquitted of murder, bit found guilty of manslaughter . But the judge may not necessarily grant the appeal, siding with defence lawyers representing the athlete who say her interpretation of the law was correct. 'It doesn't matter what the outcome of the appeal is, if the appeal is allowed then other judges will be able to comment on the decision, and that's critical,' said Hood, who has been following the Pistorius case throughout the year. Hood said that with the decision of a Cape Town court yesterday to throw out the Shrien Dewani case - another high-profile murder trial involving a beautiful young woman killed in the dead of night - South Africa's courts need to demonstrate they are rigorous and fair. 'From a perception point of view, both public and internationally, we need to tell everybody that we have a robust and effective legal system.' Pistorius, who celebrated his 28th birthday last month, has been serving his sentence in a Pretoria prison. Behind bars: Pistorius admits shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (pictured) four times through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day last year, telling the court he thought she was an intruder . If Masipa refuses to grant the appeal, the state can petition the decision, a common legal strategy in South Africa. 'I honestly don't think that Masipa would refuse leave to appeal, there's just too much controversy about the judgement,' said Martin Hood, a criminal lawyer based in Johannesburg. 'He's encountering many beautiful stories from prisoners. There are people there who have committed crimes but whose lives have changed,' said his older brother Carl, in an interview with You magazine, a South African tabloid. Pistorius has been accused of receiving special treatment in South Africa's notoriously corrupt prisons, where there is frequent reports of inmates using cellphones and even drinking alcohol behind bars. Yet Carl dismissed claims his brother is living the good life, saying Pistorius relies on weekly 45-minute visits with his family to leave cash at the canteen so he can supplement his standard prison diet with tasty snacks, including baked beans and canned pilchards. 'He now lives moment by moment,' said Carl. 'There's no fairytale.'","State lawyers applied for appeal after athlete was acquitted of murder .

"The creator of a mobile app which doctors selfies to make the user appear  a stone lighter in weight  has blasted critics who claim it is fuelling anorexia.

More than 75,000 SkinneePix apps have been sold since the software launched in March 2014, prompting critics to claim that use of the app could encourage eating disorders. However Professor Green, 51, said the 69p app was designed for ordinary people who simply need a touch of inspiration to begin losing weight. She said: 'I remember going on a diet when I was 11 years old - it was a horrible experience, and terrible for my self-esteem. I would never encourage that kind of behaviour. 'People are very concerned about anorexia, but on the other side there are legitimate concerns from people who are overweight or obese, and who need help to begin to live healthier.

Professor Sue Green, seen here, launched the app in March 2014, prompting critics to claim the app is used to encourage eating disorders - the creator, however, believes it helps people with their weightloss goals . 'Anorexia is a horrible problem, the discussion of which is dominated by very loud voices from passionate campaigners. 'Separate from that, there are people like me who are trying to lose weight who have found using this app a great help.' Prof. Green, from Arizona, who developed the app with her partner Robin Philips, said the most controversial aspect of the app was its name. She said she came up with the idea after going on holiday with friends who were not happy with how they looked in their snapshots. She said: 'Our friends threatened to defriend us if we put any on Facebook and tagged them in it. 'I work in broadcast and know what a camera can do to add 10-15lb to a picture.

The app's founder said it was designed for ordinary people who simply need a touch of inspiration to begin losing weight . Among the app's critics are award-winning blogger and author Emily Wierenga, 34, from Alberta, Canada, who battled anorexia both as a child and an adult. She said: 'The app declares that thin is good and anything else is bad. It does in one click what fashion magazines have been slowly doing for years - breeding a generation of anorexic children. 'The dangerous thing about anorexia is you can never be skinny enough. And eventually, it kills you.' However, Prof. Green said she was baffled by much of the criticism. She said: 'There are worse things out there, like curved mirrors in dressing rooms. 'People forget that SkinneePix has options to take off just 5lbs, or leave the image the same. If they want they can leave it, but most people will hit the 15lbs button. 'Even regular selfies are false, inaccurate images in the way they are often carefully posed. Someone who wears a lot of make-up or does spray tanning gives off a false image. 'People are critical but do not take the time to find out our intentions behind the app. If someone asks, we would be more than happy to explain. 'We wanted it to be an inspiration for people to lose weight. Other weight loss aids are hundreds of pounds, ours is only 69p.

"The fact that Mykaela Gibson walked out her front door on Tuesday let alone to be the face of an anti violence campaign is nothing short of courageous. The 44-year-old has been a prisoner in her own home in southern New South Wales ever since being the target of an unprovoked attack by a young woman under the influence of ice almost two years ago.

Although she is self-conscious of her facial scars - Mykaela's emotional scars run much deeper . However, Mykaela took a huge step outside of her comfort zone when she attended a press conference to be the face of the NSW police summer safety campaign on Tuesday. 'I still can't believe what I did today - I'm so proud of myself,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I don't want anyone else to go through what I have - glass is a deadly weapon.' Almost two years on, Mykaela still endures constant pain, which she describes as a burning and stabbing sensation, and has to tape her left eye shut every night as it does not close. 'I can't look at myself in the mirror,' she said. 'My kids have to look at me like this every day.' But it's not the physical pain that has impacted most on her life but the emotional torment of reliving that fateful day over and over in her head. 'The nightmares I suffer are the worst - I can't describe it,' she said. 'I suffer from depression and I cry a lot - it's really hard to focus sometimes.' She has not worked a single day since the horrific incident and doesn't leave the house unless she absolutely must do so.

Mykaela describes herself as 'hyper-vigilant' when she has to go out in public. 'It doesn't matter where I am - I always look behind myself - I'm just not the same anymore.' She said she was a 'jovial, happy and reliable person' before the attack but 'doesn't look or feel the same anymore'. The day and time that destroyed her quality of life will be etched in her mind forever - 5.30pm on February 10 in 2013. Mykaela went to the bar to buy a lazy Sunday afternoon drink for herself and a mate at the Commercial Hotel on Wentworth Street, Port Kembla. A 22-year-old woman, who was later discovered to be under the influence of ice, threw a schooner glass at the left hand side of Mykaela's face which smashed on impact.

'I had never met the woman in my life - I couldn't have told you what she looked like until the sentencing last month - it was totally unprovoked,' Mykaela said. If there is one message Mykaela would like to get across during the summer safety campaign it is for people to 'think before they act'. 'If you are angry - think clearly and think about the damage you could cause - and not just physically,' she said. 'People need to take responsibility for themselves and the people they're out with.' 'Don't get so drunk or high that you don't have control over your emotions and what you're doing.'

"A four-year-old real estate advertisement has emerged revealing the use of Aboriginal people moving out of the area as a selling point for luxurious apartments. The suburb of Redfern has long been the indigenous heart of Sydney's inner city but since residential development has started taking over the urban goldmine - a website used the fact that there would be less Aboriginal neighbours as a hook for potential buyers. The shocking ad has sparked outrage from the indigenous community with many describing it as ‘sickening’, ‘despicable' and ‘straight out racism’. Scroll down for video . The Great Fortune Investments ad on the website spruiks the fact that Aboriginal people have moved out . However, Developer DeiCorp, who employed Great Fortune Investments (GFI) in 2010 to assist in the sale of the 18 Dei Cota apartments, say they knew nothing about the ad until Tuesday and has since been taken down. The ad on GFI's website, which primarily targets Asian buyers, talks about the good rental return and convenient location before attempting to lure keen buyers with the fact that they wouldn't have Indigenous Australians as neighbours. 'The aboriginals have already moved out, now Redfern as the last virgin suburb close to city, it will have great potential for the capital growth in the near future,' the ad said. DeiCorp owner Fouad Deiri told Daily Mail Australia that he is mortified about the line and he would never have endorsed the advertisement as he prides himself on his company's relationship with the indigenous community. 'When our office moved here in 2000 the first thing we did was knock on Mick Mundine's door at the Aboriginal Housing Company,' he said. 'We would never do anything to harm that relationship.' Mr Deiri, who has not employed GFI for years, said the ad had clearly not been thought through properly. 'It is not in Deicorp's character to condone that - the ad was simply not expressed correctly but we knew nothing about it until yesterday.' The ad for the 18 Dei Cota apartments is four years old - the last sale was two and half years ago . DeiCorp has been appointed by the Aboriginal Housing Company's to construct its Pemulwuy Project, a $70 million redevelopment of the  area known as The Block in Redfern. The project will include student housing and 62 units of affordable housing earmarked for Aboriginal people. Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council chief executive Nathan Moran told Daily Mail Australia that he finds it hard to believe that Deicorp were unaware of the advertisement. 'Hopefully Deicorp will be held to account and not just deflecting it on to say it was someone else’s problem,' he said. 'That’s more arrogance than anything to claim that they didn’t know.' 'We are go gutted as the community rep body for all Aboriginal people in the area that this had been in the public domain for so long – it’s a very deceitful way of doing business in the community.' Mr Moran said he was horrified by the news that he described as 'deplorable' and 'despicable'. 'I find that unacceptable that someone would be trying to work with our community at the same time as marketing other opportunities based on our community being moved,' he said. 'It's the most sickening end of trying to work with people in good faith.' Aboriginal activist, Sol Bellear, described the ad as 'laughable' and 'straight out racism' Mr Moran is just one of many leaders in the indigneous community expressing outrage about the advertisement. Long-time Aboriginal activist and lawyer, Sol Bellear, who also lives in Redfern, described the ad as 'laughable' and added that this kind of mentality has been around for years. 'Even changing the names from east Redfern to west Redfern and that sort of stuff - and the funny thing about it is the postcode remains the same and this was before the gentrification,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I don’t know where these developers get off coming up with that – that’s just straight out racism - Redfern is a multi-cultural village - there are people of all colours there' Mr Bellear insisted that although some Aboriginal people have moved out of the area due to the exorbitant rent - the indigenous community was here to stay. 'Redfern has been the ideological address for Aboriginal people from all over Australia and we don’t intend to move,' he said. 'Anyone who wants to move to Redfern, and the surrounding suburbs, is quite welcome but Aboriginal people will always be there - so if you don’t like Aboriginal people don’t move there.' 'We are a great mob of people to live with so come and enjoy our company.' He also called on Redfern locals to show leadership and be a shining example. 'I would like to throw down that challenge to the residents of Redfern to get rid of those sorts of comments that are out there and become world leaders in race relations.' DeiCorp, who knew nothing about the ad until Tuesday, has been appointed to construct the $70 million redevelopment of The Block in Redfern (pictured) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda, told The Australian that he was 'sickened' by the advertising, and he called on the company to meet with Aboriginal local community. Mr Deira said he had already spoken to the community to explain his stance on the situation. Warren Mundine, the head of the Prime Minister’s Indigenous Advisory Council, told The Australian that the suburb's indigenous history should be 'honoured not trashed'.","A real estate ad spruiked Aboriginals leaving the area as a selling point .

"A French politician has reacted furiously to the German Chancellor's accusations that France and Italy have not done enough to trim their budgets. Angela Merkel's calls for the countries to make further cuts was met negatively by Jean-Luc Melenchon, who tweeted in German: 'Shut your trap, Miss Merkel! France is free!' The former Presidential candidate added she should concern herself more with the poor people in her country, and its 'ruined equipment'. Mr Melenchon's reaction mirrored that of his President, Francois Hollande, as he tries to claw back support from left-wing voters. Scroll down for video . Fractured relationship: French President, Francois Hollande (right), has rejected financial reforms demanded by Angela Merkel (left) and Brussels as he tries to win back support from left-wing voters . Angry: French politician, Jean-Luc Melenchon, took to his Twitter account to vent his disapproval. He wrote: 'Shut your trap, Mrs Merkel! France is free. Occupy yourself with your poor and your ruined equipment.' Furious: The former French Presidential candidate (pictured) hit back at Merkel's financial warnings . The president is reportedly shying away from radical reforms to France's faltering economy demanded by Germany and Brussels. France had pledged to bring its deficit down the EU-imposed limit of 3 per cent by 2013, but has since acknowledged that it will not reach that threshold until 2017. Mrs Merkel has warned the two countries to carry out 'deficit-reducing measures' by March, when the European Commission will decide whether their budgets are in line with the bloc's deficit rules. If further steps are not taken, France risks being fined by the Commission, and Italy could be placed under a disciplinary process because of its extreme levels of debt. Mrs Merkel told her conservative party's congress that Germany was not being 'fussy' in wanting to keep to the EU's Growth and Stability Pact. 'The Commission has made clear that what has been put on the table so far is insufficient. I would agree with this,' she said. 'If, in the end, we fail to adhere to what we resolved to do in this crisis, then we would gamble away confidence. And that would not be good for Europe.' In a television appearance shortly after he remarks were made public, France's Prime Minister announced the country was losing its enthusiasm for financial reform imposed by Brussels. A senior Italian official also hit back at Mrs Merkel - describing her comments as 'regrettable'. Sandro Gozi, Italy's undersecretary for EU affairs said: 'The Italian government has never permitted itself to hand out marks to a European Union member countries and we ask Germany for the same respect. 'Maybe Chancellor Merkel should focus on Germany's domestic demand, on its lack of investments, or on its balance-of-payments imbalances. 'It would be an important contribution that Europe has been waiting on Berlin to make for a long time and which so far has not happened.' Last year, the European Commission won new powers to assess national budgets to ensure they are in line with EU agreements. But sanctioning countries for failing to meet budget plans remains a highly sensitive issue. Chancellor Merkel's spokesman confirmed on Monday that she had to interrupt a television interview after suffering a 'dizzy spell', but carried on to finish it. She was in the middle of an interview with ZDF television, one of a series of media interviews before her party's congress meeting, when she suddenly felt unwell. Mrs Merkel, 60, who's in her 10th year as chancellor, later took part in the annual get-together with the media after finishing her series of interviews. Mrs Merkel was meanwhile resoundingly elected to a new two-year term as leader of her Christian Democratic Union today. Some 96.7 of delegates at the convention voted for the 60-year-old.","German Chancellor calls for France and Italy to make MORE budget cuts .

"Imagine being a young 28-year-old woman, a mother to two children, but instead looking like their grandmother. This is the reality for Hu Juan of Zhengzhou, of Henan province in north-central China. Hu is the only person in China, and only one of ten people worldwide who suffer from a rare condition called Cutis laxa, which has caused her to age prematurely. Scroll down for video . Hu Juan (pictured left earlier in her twenties and right at 28) suffers from a rare disease called Cutis laxa which has made her face age dramatically . The 28-year-old - who looks more like someone in her 60s or 70s - first noticed the changes after she gave birth to her first child 11 years ago, Shanghaiist reported. The condition means the skin on her face and neck has lost its elasticity, causing it to become loose and sag. It does not affect any other areas of her body, and there is no known treatment or cause for the rare disease. The disorder has previously plunged her into a deep depression and she once attempted to take her own life. Hu will not look in the mirror and often refuses to leave the house. Having a second child did nothing to change the condition of her face, as she hoped it may. The woman first developed the disorder after the birth of her first child 11 years ago, and is now seeking cosmetic surgery to try and reverse the effects . The mother of two also said Cutis laxa has caused a rift between her and her eldest son, as he is ashamed she looks so old. Despite this, the woman's husband has reportedly stuck by her side throughout the ordeal. Last week Hu arrived in Shanghai seeking cosmetic surgery to help alter her appearance to resemble her true age. Here an expert team has been assembled to help the woman, which includes a ppsychologist . Though optimistic about regaining her youthful looks, doctors said it's too early to say how successful any surgery could be.","Hu Juan suffers from Cutis laxa, a disease which made her age prematurely .

"The trail of destruction left in the wake of the devastating tycoon that swept in over the Philippines this weekend becomes painfully clear in these images, shot from the air above the Southeast Asian archipelago. On the eastern island of Samar, nearly 13,000 homes have been turned into rubble, and more than 22,300 are severely damaged, after Typhoon Hagupit made landfall on Saturday before making progress across the island nation. At least 27 people have died, according to the Red Cross, a number which the charity fears may rise, and thousands have been forced to seek shelter at public buildings, schools and sports centres. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: An aerial view of a village in Dolores, Eastern Samar, central Philippines, where Typhoon Hagupit made landfall on Saturday . The National Grid Corp said nearly two million homes across the central Philippines and the south of the main island of Luzon were still without power. The storm, one of several typhoons to hit the tropical archipelago each year, has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and was headed west towards Vietnam. Roofs were ripped from houses, wooden huts were reduced to matchwood and coconut trees torn up by the roots. Most of the victims, on Samar and in Iloilo province to the west, were washed away in floods and some hit by fallen trees, the Philippine Red Cross said, but so far, the official government death toll is only three. 'Access is very difficult. There are landslides, some are one-lane roads. In the inner barangays (villages), many of the roads have been washed out by flash floods,' Red Cross chairman Richard Gordon said. '...It's a long trek (to the villages), it's like Yolanda all over again,' Gordon said, referring to super typhoon Haiyan, which hit the same area of the central Philippines last year. Tragic storm: At least 27 people have died, according to the Red Cross, a number which the charity fears may rise as emergency workers struggle to reach villages on remote islands across the Philippines . No light at the end of the tunnel: Nearly two million homes across central Philippines and the south of Luzon island are still without power . Rescue workers are still struggling to reach towns in central provinces where Typhoon Hagupit destroyed 13,000 homes and damaged more than 22,300 houses, and killed at least 27 people . Hard to reach: This photographs shows damaged houses in a remote village in Dolores, Eastern Samar, central Philippines . But the damage was nowhere near that wrought by Haiyan, which destroyed or damaged more than a million homes. Learning lessons from Haiyan, which left more than 7,000 dead or missing, authorities launched a massive evacuation operation days ahead of the storm, emptying whole towns and villages. Bank employee Arnalyn Bula told Reuters how howling winds had pounded the walls of her aunt's two-storey concrete home in Dolores in Eastern Samar, where her family sought shelter. 'Our kitchen was wrecked. Around us, our neighbours' homes were flattened like folded paper,' said Bula, 27. Some residents in Dolores hung signs that read 'help us' as they appealed for food, water and shelter. Return home: Two young typhoon evacuees walk back home with their bed sheets and pillows after spending two nights in evacuation center . Seeking refuge: Thousands of people have been forced to seek shelter at public buildings, schools and sports centres across the islands . Save haven: Filipinos seek refuge inside a basketball court turned into an evacuation center in Quezon City, east of Manila, Philippines . Getting help: Residents, who fled their homes in anticipation of typhoon Hagupit,  undergo medical check up at the evacuation center . 'We were inside an evacuation site when the roof caved in,' a woman told local radio. 'God saved us. There were no casualties. There will still be Christmas for us.' President Benigno Aquino decided to skip the annual summit of Southeast Asian countries and South Korea on Thursday to focus on the cleanup. Domestic air and sea travel resumed, markets reopened and state workers returned to their offices. Some shopping malls were operating on emergency power but schools remained closed for a second day. Thousands of people emerged from shelters to fix wrecked homes and clean up debris, including fallen trees and power poles. Aid trucks were reaching some of the hardest-hit areas after soldiers reopened roads. General Gregorio Catapang, head of the armed forces, said two C130 planes were taking in food, water and relief supplies.","Typhoon Hagupit has crushed 13,000 homes and damaged more than 22,300 houses on one  island alone .

"Jill Finney (pictured) has received a £500,000 payout from the Care Quality Commission . A senior health official accused of a cover-up over an NHS baby deaths scandal has been awarded a pay-out of more than half a million pounds. Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, was alleged last year to have ordered the destruction of a damning report into why the watchdog had not stepped in to improve care at a struggling baby unit. Ms Finney always denied the explosive allegation she had told a colleague in a meeting to ‘read my lips’ and delete the critical internal review into its failure to act on concerns about safety at Morecambe Bay foundation trust. Up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit in Barrow-in-Furness general hospital. But, despite the failings, the CQC gave the trust a clean bill of health in 2010 following a two-day inspection. Last night the watchdog apologised to Miss Finney for the way they had released her name to the public. They said this had ‘disadvantaged’ her desire to ‘protect her reputation’ against an allegation she had always denied. They agreed an out-of-court settlement to pay her £60,000 in damages and £510,000 towards her legal fees - money that will be borne by the taxpayer. But they did not withdraw the allegation that it was likely that she was part of a cover-up. In a statement, the CQC said an IT bungle last summer had meant she was not told for 18 hours that her name was to be made public. By this time she had been sacked from her new job as chief commercial officer at Nominet, the internet organisation which hands out .uk domain names. The CQC said the mistake meant she could not defend herself against the allegation which she has always denied. ‘In addition, she suffered considerable distress,’ the statement said. Last night Miss Finney told Channel 4 News: ‘This has wrecked my life and my family’s.’ Since the cover-up scandal, Miss Finney has gone into business providing ‘reputation management’ advice to the public sector - a move branded a ‘sick joke’ by one MP. She set up the organisation with Cynthia Bower, the former CQC chief executive who was also at the critical meeting discussing the internal review. Miss Bower had earlier resigned following a critical government review of the watchdog, which found it had put its reputation above patient safety. Last night Miss Bower said: ‘I am delighted for Jill Finney. The fact that CQC have settled in the face of Jill’s legal action completely vindicates us as far as I’m concerned.’ The huge payout to a senior CQC official - equivalent to the salaries of 27 junior nurses - is likely to be met with anger from patients groups and relatives of those who died at the Furness hospital. Last summer it emerged that a meeting had been held at the watchdog to discuss why it had missed repeated warnings about maternity care at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay foundation trust. The dispute between CQC and Miss Finney was resolved  with an out-of-court settlement. Stock image used . Louise Dineley, head of regulatory risk and quality at the CQC, produced a document showing that the 2010 inspection had been seriously flawed. An independent study by chartered accountants Grant Thornton, published last summer, included claims by Miss Dineley that she had been told to destroy the report. Originally, none of those accused were named in the study - but the names were eventually released. At the start of this year, Miss Finney took legal action against the CQC for releasing her name - and had asked for £1.5million, saying it had cost her her job. Last night, in an out of court settlement, the two sides agreed that the CQC would hand over £60,000 in damages, plus a contribution of £510,000 to her legal costs. CQC’s chief executive David Behan said: ‘In January 2014 the Care Quality Commission’s former deputy chief executive, Jill Finney, instigated legal action against CQC. ‘This was following CQC’s publication of the Grant Thornton report into CQC’s regulatory oversight of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust in June 2013. ‘Ms Finney’s legal claim was based on two key elements: a libel action in respect of the Grant Thornton report; and a claim for damage to Ms Finney’s reputation resulting from the manner in which her name was released into the public domain. The total damages sought were £1.5million. ‘Parties to high-value litigation are encouraged to consider confidential mediation at an early stage before legal costs escalate for both sides. ‘As a result of successful mediation, CQC has this afternoon issued a statement jointly agreed with Ms Finney. Up to 16 babies and two mothers are feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the maternity unit in Barrow-in-Furness general hospital. Stock image used . ‘In addition, CQC has paid Ms Finney £60,000 in damages reflective of those matters set out in the statement, specifically the manner in which her name was released. ‘This represents a full and final settlement with Ms Finney over all aspects of her claim. CQC has also made a contribution to Ms Finney’s legal costs.’ The two parties also agreed a joint statement. It read: ‘The CQC has settled the proceedings brought against it by Jill Finney, its former deputy chief executive. ‘The proceedings arose from the publication on 19 June 2013 of a report into the CQC’s regulation of the University Hospital Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMB), produced by Grant Thornton LLP. ‘The CQC had previously committed itself to publishing Grant Thornton’s report, which came to the conclusion that Ms Finney may have been party to a “cover up” of a report into the CQC’s regulation and oversight of UHMB, something she and others have always emphatically denied. ‘From the interview stage, Ms Finney and others were highly critical of Grant Thornton’s fairness and processes including their interviewing, note-taking and record-keeping techniques. She complains that she was not even given advance notice of the allegations to be levelled at her in the interview. ‘The CQC deeply regrets its decision, taken on legal advice, to withhold the names of individuals in the report, as promised to Ms Finney and others. It then had to reverse that decision after names, including Ms Finney’s, appeared in the media as a result of speculation by journalists. ‘The consequences for Ms Finney were aggravated by the fact that some of the national media wrongly portrayed the internal report as being about maternity deaths at UHMB. ‘Further, due to confusion caused by an IT failure, the CQC failed to inform Ms Finney that her name had been released until 18 hours later, by which time she had been summarily dismissed from her then employment. ‘The CQC accepts that Ms Finney was thereby disadvantaged in protecting her reputation and giving her public defence to an allegation which she has always denied; in addition, she suffered considerable distress. ‘The CQC wishes to take this opportunity to apologise to her and is happy to repeat what its chief executive Mr Behan wrote to her at the time of her departure in February 2013: “You have been a rock of stability in CQC leading with passion, energy and dedication. You have given much, and people have testified to this”.’ Last year Miss Finney complained she had been the victim of a ‘media feeding frenzy’ over the report. She said: ‘At that meeting we agreed that the report required much further work. There was not a decision at that meeting to delete the report, nor was there an instruction.’ She said that while Miss Dineley believes there had been an instruction to delete her report, ‘the other three individuals in that meeting do not recall that instruction’. Last night the CQC said the damages and contribution to legal costs are insured by the NHS Litigation Authority. A spokesman said: ‘By going to mediation we have resolved matters in a quicker and less costly manner than by going to trial.’","Senior health official awarded a pay-out of more than half a million pounds .

"Most people would not let a spider within a metre of them but a brave young woman has voluntarily let a massive huntsman crawl all over her body.

"A female estate agent who avoided jail for glassing a man - despite it being her 18th conviction for assault - has been given yet another let-off for breaching her suspended sentence. Yasmin Thomas, 21, left victim Ronnie Lee with a deep gash very close to his eye after she set upon him with a broken glass following a row in a nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset. With all her previous convictions for assault and battery before she was 18, a judge branded her history ‘breathtaking’ - saying it was one of the worst he had ever seen of a woman her age. Attack: Yasmin Thomas (left), 21, left victim Ronnie Lee (right) with a deep gash very close to his eye after she set upon him with a broken glass following a row in a nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset . Yet she walked free from court in August after being handed a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, 80 hours of community service and ordered to go on an anger management course. Thomas, who was fired from her job as a result of her actions, has now been hauled back before the same court after breaking the terms of her ‘compliance sessions’ three times in two months. However Judge John Harrow, who sentenced her four months ago, said he was prepared to give Thomas ‘a chance’ and allow her to walk free from court. He also said he would not reveal details about Thomas’s past in open court in case she found them embarrassing. Venue: Thomas was arrested after she attacked stranger Mr Lee in Bar So (above) nightclub in Bournemouth . Judge Harrow told her at Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘Those guilty of a breach are almost all given one chance. I hope you understand that you had been given a chance.’ Thomas has displayed 'unacceptable behaviour' three times since she was sentenced for the attack . He warned Thomas she would be jailed if she broke the rules again. He added: ‘If you don’t comply with all conditions to the letter you are going to go through that door at the back.’ Thomas was arrested in February after she attacked Mr Lee, a stranger, in Bar So nightclub in Bournemouth. The pair got into a row over a dropped E-cigarette. Thomas picked it up and thrust it at Mr Lee saying: ‘Are you not going to say thank you? Who do you think you are?’ She then lunged towards him with a broken glass, causing a serious gash to his left eyelid which needed stitches and two smaller cuts to his face. The injuries were so close to his eye that Mr Lee feared he would lose it. Tiny shards of glass were later removed from his eye. Thomas, from Bournemouth, was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to Mr Lee, and £150 in costs. She had worked as a sales negotiator at an estate agents but was later fired from the position. The court heard Thomas had displayed ‘unacceptable behaviour’ three times since she was sentenced for the attack. Tom Evans, defending, said Thomas’s mother had suffered a stroke on one of the days when a breach occurred, and that she was afraid she might have cancer. He said: ‘She accepts her behaviour was unacceptable. As is clear from her letter, she says there was no excuse for her behaviour.’","Yasmin Thomas, 21, left victim Ronnie Lee with deep gash close to his eye .

"The desperate hunt for a two-year-old autistic boy who has now been missing for 24 hours was continuing today after police failed to find him overnight. Sam Trott, from Landsdale, in Perth, wandered out of the front door which had been left open by workmen and has not been seen since. His disappearance sparked a major land search and rescue operation in the suburb on Tuesday for the missing boy who has autism and was last seen in the vicinity of Walbrook Mews just after 10.30am. Police said that the search would continue overnight and made a plea for more help from the public to help find the boy. Scroll down for video . Two-and-a-half-year-old Sam wandered out of his family home on Tuesday morning .

Thirty seconds later it beeped again and as I turned back around ... he wasn’t there,' Mrs Trott told Perth Now. 'I immediately saw the front door open and I just ran; I ran out the front. In 30 seconds he was not there anymore. Police divers search Landsdale River near the Trotts' home . 'When I looked left and right, straight ahead and I couldn’t see him I ran straight back inside, I went through every room screaming his name. 'He doesn’t know how to open doors but the door was wide open.' Mr Trott pleaded for everyone living in the area to check their backyards, frontyards… everywhere. The search for Sam will continue overnight as the police ask the public to help in the search . Mr Trott pleaded for everyone living in the area to check their backyards and frontyards for Sam . ‘He can be quite sociable but by the same token he could run away.

"Parents have vented their fury after another winter wonderland festive fun fair has been cancelled just two days before it was due to open. Despite announcing the event more than a month ago, the Ruislip Winter Wonderland in north London, was cancelled yesterday with organisers citing a disagreement with landowners. Today the site earmarked for the funfair at India Gardens in Northolt appeared barren and undeveloped. Scroll down for video . The empty site at India Garden in Northolt, which was due to be the venue for the Ruislip Winter Wonderland. The event was cancelled yesterday, just two days before it was due to open . People driving up to the site  where Ruislip Winter Wonderland was due to be held, were greeted with closed gates today . The announcement has left hundreds of families and children disappointed, despite organisers saying on their Facebook page, which had more than 3,500 likes, that the event was still due to go ahead as late as yesterday morning. Former I’m a Celebrity star and singer David Van Day and wife Sue Moxley were earmarked for the 'star-studded' opening performance. Other celebrities set to have attended the opening included Dancing On Ice star Matt Lapinskas, ex-Coronation Street actor Adam Rickitt, boxer Joe Calzaghe, former Blue star Lee Ryan and Another Level singer Dane Bowers. The message from organisers on their Facebook page read: 'We are sorry to inform that the event has been cancelled. 'After a day of discusions between the event organisers and the land owners unfortunatlly the event has had to be cancelled. 'We are extreamly upset about this decision and did not take the decision light heartedly. 'We are terribly sorry to all the people who where helping us and who where having stalls/rides at the event and to all the famillies who where supporting us and going to be coming along we are extreamly sorry. The organisers posted this message on their Facebook page informing people that the event had been cancelled, which prompted an angry response from some parents . 'Thank you all for your support and we hope to be able to do a different event at sometime in the future. 'Thanks again for your support and once again we are truely sorry but it is out of our control.' (sic) But many parents have been left feeling the entire event was a ‘scam’ because of its late cancellation, and the failure to begin any construction on the north west London field. Claire Collier wrote: 'I think something dodgy has been going in here!' While mother Wendy Walsh added: 'It was blatantly fake. Why else would it be cancelled two days before? The festive funfair was due to have its opening in Wednesday but it was cancelled just two days before it was due to begin . Today, the site in Northolt remained barren and undeveloped despite it due to be featuring fairground rides, a stalls and a Santa's grotto . 'Luckily I didn’t tell my child about this.' And one poster, Cathy Barnes says she is now planning her own event to help disappointed locals. She said: 'Sorry but if their spelling is anything to go by no wonder it wasn’t taken seriously! 'Sad state of affairs to build up people’s hopes. Name and shame the land owners and event organisers! 'Ruislip Christmas Market sounds a better idea with old fairground rides. “If anyone wants help organising it let me know.' The attraction was supposed to run until December 27 at the a site on the Ruislip border with Northolt, and was to feature fairground rides, a Santa’s grotto and food stalls. The cancellation of the event comes after another winter wonderland created by TV interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen was forced to close after just one day due to complaints. The Magical Journey in Warwickshire created by Laurence Llewellyn Bowen closed after just one day following complaints by parents about long queues, rude staff and cheap toys at the attraction . The fair eventually re-opened three days later but parents were left equally unimpressed with the decorations on the site . Parents said the Magical Journey at the Belfry Golf Club in Wishaw, Warwickshire, has ruined the build up to Christmas for their children, as they attacked the 'tacky' attraction which costs up to £22.50 for a ticket. But many complained about rude staff, large queues for their children to visit Father Christmas and said cheap unwrapped presents, some squashed or broken, were being handed out to their children. Others bemoaned of a lack of festive decorations and Christmas music, despite paying more than £20 a ticket for their children. However, the attraction reopened to the public three days later after improvements including more fake snow. But parents were left equally unimpressed at the second grand opening due to over-loaded sockets being visible in the main entrance and a pile of tatty-looking presents being layed clumsily dumped in the corner of a marquee with a red Santa's outfit left on top.","Ruislip Winter Wonderland in Northolt, north London has been cancelled .

"Roxanne Beaven (pictured) was arrested after telling an off-duty policeman to 'f*** off' when he asked her to stop swearing at a primary school . A mother is outraged she has been arrested by an off-duty police officer who overheard her swearing in the school playground. Roxanne Beaven, 24, was chatting to other mothers when the police officer dropped off his own kids at Gray's Farm Primary Academy, Orpington, Kent. He heard her use a profanity and asked her to mind her language. A few minutes later, as he walked back through the playground, he threatened to arrest her if she swore again. She did. She told him to 'f*** off'. And then, she says, he then grabbed her arm and tried to wrestle her to the ground. The mother-of-three, who was with her two-year-old twin sons Archie and George Lugg, said she did not believe the man was a police officer at first. 'I admittedly told him to f*** off at first because I didn't know him from Adam. 'He has bruised my arm. It's disgusting what he has done to me. It's so sore, it really hurts. I ran into the school and burst out crying.' Ms Beaven, of Orpington, who has another son, five-year-old Tommy Duffell and lives with her partner Charlie Lugg, has made a formal complaint against the officer. She added: 'I know I shouldn't have been using that language outside the school but the way he reacted was out of order. 'The word was used in conversation. It was not directed at him. 'He was so aggressive. He was off-duty. To me, that is a parent attacking another parent.' Metropolitan Police officers were eventually called to the school at 9am and Ms Beaven was arrested for a public order offence. A 45-year-old woman who tried to pull the police officer away and knocked off his glasses was arrested for common assault. Both were taken to a south London police station and issued with a caution after admitting the offences. Dawn Cleary, of St Paul's Wood Hill, stood talking to Ms Beaven after dropping her own children off at the school. Ms Beaven, a mother-of-three, claims she was left with a bruise on her arm following the arrest . Ms Beaven (pictured) has now made a formal complaint against the officer . The 37-year-old said: 'Everyone swears. All he had to do was say: ""Tone your language down a little bit."" It just went from one extreme to another. 'It was really horrible to stand there and watch. He blew it completely out of proportion.' Mother-of-two Catherine Oates, of St Mary Cray, also saw the commotion. The 30-year-old said: 'He looked like he was trying to get her on the floor. Ms Beaven was dropping her children off at Gray's Farm Primary Academy (pictured), in Kent, when the incident occurred . 'Roxanne's twin boys started screaming their heads off. We had no way of knowing he was really a police officer. 'I was disgusted. To those little boys, it looked like he was attacking their mum.' An Essex Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we have received a complaint about an officer and as this matter is being investigated we cannot comment further at this stage.' Gray's Farm Primary Academy declined to comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Roxanne Beaven, 24, was arrested by an off-duty policeman for swearing .

"A teacher helped her son fraudulently claim £11,000 in benefits while he was travelling around Asia by sending him forms to complete so he could pretend he was looking for work. Tom Clancy even managed to marry a Thai bride while he was on his 18 month trip. His mother, Sibyl Lloyd, of Carmarthenshire, sent her 36-year-old son forms so he could sign them as he took in the sights in Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia. Sibyl Lloyd (left)  helped her son Tom Clancy (pictured right with his Lloyd) swindle £11,000 in benefits by sending him forms to complete and sign while he was on an 18 month trip through Asia, and then transferring the money to him while he was travelling . This meant he was able to claim £11,268 in housing benefit, council tax, disability allowance and income support while he away, pretending to authorities he was looking for work. A disciplinary hearing for Lloyd, a teacher, heard that she then transferred the money abroad to her son so he could use it on his travels. Clancy, of Loughor, Swansea, admitted failing to inform the authorities of a change in circumstance while he was out of the country.  He was given a community order after he returned to Britain. Lloyd, 56, admitted aiding and abetting his fraud. The mother-of-three also received an official reprimand from the General Teaching Council for Wales after admitting her convictions had an impact on her fitness to teach. She had been working at a school in Gorseinon at the time of the offences and had been teaching for 23 years. The General Teaching Council for Wales found that the fraud had affected Lloyd's fitness to teach . Presenting officer Huw Roberts said: 'Teachers are role models to pupils and the public needs to have confidence in the teaching profession.' The hearing in Caridff was told she re-paid 'every penny that was over claimed.' Sheila Drayton, chair of the panel, said: 'Teachers are expected to adhere to the law. 'Ms Lloyd did not adhere to lawful standards of behaviour and did not conduct herself in a manner so as to uphold public trust and confidence in the teaching profession. 'She has expressed genuine regret and remorse and repaid the money in full. 'The offences took place outside school and there is no evidence that her behaviour has adversely affected pupils.'","Sibyl Lloyd sent claim forms to son Tom Clancy while he travelled abroad .

"It was unusually calm in the city of Donetsk today, as government troops and separatists observed a  ‘Day of Silence’ after weeks of bitter fighting. But, amid the shaky ceasefire, there was a stark reminder that a truce in war-ravaged eastern Ukraine is still a long way off. As both sides prepared to hold a 24-hour ceasefire, intense shelling could be heard echoing around the Kuibishevskiy district of Donetsk, killing residents and shattering people's homes.

Despite the successful ceasefire, the scenes of chaos provide residents with a stark reminder that a truce in war-ravaged eastern Ukraine is still a long way off . The night-time shelling came just hours before a temporary truce between both sides, which has sparked hopes of further peace talks and eased tensions. Today, residents attempted to deal with the aftermath of the attack, scouring the debris and picking apart the rubble of what used to be their homes. Some residents lay dead amid the chaos. Fighting in the past few weeks has been intense around the international airport in the city of Donetsk, the main separatist stronghold. The rebels are trying to wrest the ruins of the airport from government control, in the latest stage of the war waged by pro-Moscow separatists in Ukraine's east. Kiev's military said troops had recorded six violations by the rebels during the ceasefire, while six Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the 24 hours before the truce came into force. Today, Russia also resumed shipments of natural gas to Ukraine, despite it being shut off for six months over a dispute over price.

"A rogue submarine was being hunted by NATO patrol planes after a periscope was spotted off the western coast of Scotland. At the height of the operation, five aircraft from four different nations were working with Royal Navy ships in the search for the mystery vessel. News of the operation, comes amid growing tensions between Western powers and Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis. Scroll down for video . A periscope was sighted in waters where British submarines would normally surface as they head into or out of the Royal Navy’s submarine base at Faslane in Scotland. The incident comes just weeks after Sweden mounted a search for a suspected Russian submarine thought to be in its territorial waters.

The periscope was sighted in waters where British submarines would normally surface as they head into or out of the Royal Navy’s submarine base at Faslane in Scotland - home of the UK’s ballistic missile submarines. Dr Lee Willett, Editor of IHS Jane’s Navy International, said: ‘What you have to remember about submarines is that they are a very useful way to project national power. By their very nature if you want them to be seen they can be, but if you don’t the ocean is a very big place and you have plausible deniability. ‘At this stage we do not know if the reported submarine was a Russian boat, but the Russians have used their submarines in the past to make the point that Russia is still here. ‘It is important to remember that when Putin came to power he made some very clear statements about the importance of the navy in restoring Russian power. ‘Such deployments should not be unexpected. If the deployment did take place, it seems very much like the Russians asserting their growing presence while also attempting to gather information on other nations. ‘Perhaps it is a case of Russia testing the UK’s response, looking to see how the UK responded and how quickly.' The incident comes after Sweden mounted a search for a suspected Russian submarine thought to be operating in its territorial waters in October. Sweden closed off waters and airspace off Stockholm and warned the public to stay away after the military made three sightings of the mystery vessel. It also said it had picked up three encrypted signals from a suspected submarine it believed to be Russian. One theory was that an experimental Russian mini-sub called the Triton NN had got into trouble on a spy mission in Swedish waters. Although the hunt was unsuccessful, defence officials said there was no doubt that their waters had been violated by a foreign power. The Swedish Defence Ministry published this picture in October which shows a partially submerged object in the water, as they confirmed they had made three sightings of foreign undersea activity in the past few days following reports that a Russian submarine had got into difficulties in their waters . Sweden closed off waters and airspace off Stockholm and warned the public to stay away after the military made three sightings of the mystery vessel in October . The Swedish hunt was unsuccessful, defence officials said there was no doubt that their waters had been violated by a foreign power . Russia denied that any of its forces were involved. There has also been a recent upsurge incidents of Russian long-range bombers approaching UK airspace. A total of 26 Russian were were intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours just days after the Sweden incident, including two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain. The British Typhoon pilots identified the Bear bombers visually and 'escorted' them around the edge of British airspace, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. Last month the Royal Navy tracked four Russian warships passing through the English Channel. On this occasion The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that the ships had been escorted out of UK waters by Royal Navy warship HMS Tyne. Maritime patrol aircraft (MPAs) from France, Canada and the US conducted patrols, in conjunction with British surface warships in the search, which began around November 26 and continued into the first week of December, operating out of RAF Lossiemouth. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed that it had received assistance from NATO allies but would not say whether they had been searching for a submarine. But a UK defence ministry spokesman told Aviation Week that Britain had ‘requested assistance from allied forces for basing of maritime patrol aircraft at RAF Lossiemouth for a limited period,’ adding: ‘The aircraft are conducting Maritime Patrol activity with the Royal Navy; we do not discuss the detail of maritime operations.’ Incursion: A Russian Tu-95 Bear 'H' photographed from a RAF Typhoon Quick Reaction Aircraft with 6 Squadron from RAF Leuchars in Scotland on April 23, 2014 . A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Air Force said: ‘Following a request for assistance from the United Kingdom, the Canadian Armed Forces deployed one CP-140 Aurora Aircraft to RAF Lossiemouth for a limited time.’ An RAF Sentinel radar-reconnaissance aircraft was one of the planes said to have taken part in the operation which appeared finally to have drawn to a close last week. A MoD spokeswoman said: ‘Nato partners have provided assistance for the operation of maritime patrol aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth for a limited period with the Royal Navy. We do not discuss the detail of maritime operations.’","Five aircraft from four different nations were working with Royal Navy .

"The headquarters of the Metropolitan Police has been sold for £370million to a multi-billion dollar alternative investment company based in Abu Dhabi. The proceeds of the sale - which secured £120m more than the guide price and three times what was originally paid for the site freehold in 2008 - will be invested in technology for police officers such as tablets, smartphones and body cameras. The New Scotland Yard site, situated next to St James's Park Tube station and famed for its revolving triangle sign which will be moved, along with the Metropolitan Police, to their new home on Victoria Embankment. Scroll down for video . The Metropolitan Police has sold its home since 1967, pictured, for £370 million to Abu Dhabi investors . However, the iconic revolving sign, pictured, which a tourist favourite, will move to the new building in 2016 . The Metropolitan Police will move into their new headquarters building, pictured, within the next two years . The operational HQ will be moved to the Curtis Green building, which is currently being refurbished at a cost of £58 million. It is estimated that the new headquarters should save the Met some £6 million in running costs. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the new Met HQ was a 'pretty nondescript building...a lovely building obviously'. He said that while New Scotland Yard would be redeveloped, the 'special triangle jobby' - the revolving sign outside - would be kept. The Metropolitan Police moved to its current location beside St James' Park station in 1967. After Robert Peel founded the Metropolitan Police in 1829, the new police force had its headquarters in Whitehall Place. The rear of this property faced a court yard which led onto Great Scotland Yard. The name Scotland Yard attached itself to the headquarters building. In 1890, the Met moved to the Norman Shaw building in 1890, which was named 'New Scotland Yard'. The Met retained the name 'New Scotland Yard' when it moved to its latest home in 1967. The first ever 'police procedural' television show Fabian of the Yard was broadcast by the BBC between 1954 and 1956. It was based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian. He added: 'The Met Police has a unique place in history and they need a home fit for the future, but police budgets are under real pressure. 'The sale of this under-used and outdated building means we can now not only protect that rich heritage, but also fund the new HQ and kit out bobbies with the latest mobile technology to secure the future of the force. 'This landmark deal allows us to preserve the past whilst giving today's Met a vital cash boost so our officers can go on keeping London safe.' Jassim Alseddiqi, chief executive of ADFG, said: 'Ten Broadway will be one of the most important redevelopment projects undertaken in Central London this decade, replacing a world famous headquarters with a world class development. 'With the bid process now complete, we look forward to creating an exceptional new landmark for London.' Once redeveloped and sold, the Victoria Street site is projected to yield up to £100 million in stamp duty receipts for the UK Exchequer. The sale is part of an ongoing overhaul of the Met estate which has so far raised £215 million through the sale of 52 under-used and outdated buildings. When completed in 2016, the restructure is predicted to save London's police force over £60 million in annual running costs - enough to fund 1,000 officers - and will leave behind a smaller, more modern estate which will include a new training facility in Hendon and a world-class forensics lab and control centre in Lambeth. The Met moved into the first 'New Scotland Yard', pictured, in 1890 after leaving their Whitehall home . At the time of its opening in 1967, New Scotland Yard, pictured,  was seen as a state-of-the art location . But over the past 40 years, the building has become a liability and was described as not fit for purpose . It will be moved to the Met's new HQ - the Curtis Green building on Victoria Embankment, which will continue to be known as Scotland Yard. As the home of the Met, Scotland Yard has moved several times before - from Whitehall Place to Great Scotland Yard in 1875, to the Norman Shaw building in 1890 and to the current building in 1967. This new move therefore marks a return to nearer its founding location. The current HQ is home to many unique artefacts and policing memorabilia dating back to the formation of the Metropolitan Police in 1829 - none of which are currently on public display. The additional proceeds from the sale means a small portion of money raised can be used to relocate this collection to a dedicated museum site, allowing visitors to see rare crime artefacts and heritage items that tell the history of Scotland Yard.","The Metropolitan Police has sold its headquarters for £370 million .

"David Cameron wants Turkey to join the European Union, despite his drive to reduce net migration to tens of thousands. The Prime Minister said yesterday that it remained a 'long-standing goal' for Britain that the nation of 75million people should join the EU, and that the issue was under active discussion. Speaking in the Turkish capital Ankara after talks with prime minister Ahmet Davotoglu, he said of Turkey's membership: 'I very much support that… we discussed that last night.' Scroll down for video . Remarks: Mr Cameron made the comments after a meeting with Turkish PM Ahmet Davotoglu (right) The comments are likely to provoke anger from Conservative backbenchers, who want curbs on the free movement of people within the 28-member bloc. Mr Cameron last visited Turkey four years ago, and said at the time that he was there to 'make the case for Turkey's EU membership' and was its 'strongest advocate'. However since then, he has committed to an in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU amid rising public concern about levels of immigration. His ministers have also been forced to admit the government will fail in its target to reduce net migration to 'tens of thousands'. The latest figures last month revealed it had risen to 260,000. But yesterday he said his position has not changed. Talks about Turkish accession have stalled in recent years with Germany deeply opposed to its membership. There are also fears millions of people could migrate to other European countries and that the Turkish government has been sliding back on human rights commitments. Meetings: Mr Cameron also met with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (right) Mr Cameron said: 'In terms of Turkish membership of the EU, I very much support that. That's a longstanding position of British foreign policy which I support. We discussed that again in our talks today'. It is understood any moves towards Turkish membership of the EU would take several years, and would almost certainly involve transitional controls on new migrants. But his words will provoke a reaction Ukip. Leader Nigel Farage said last year: 'The vast majority of people in northern Europe would not support enlargement to include a country like Turkey'. Mr Cameron's visit was to discuss the issue of British foreign fighters travelling to Syria and northern Iraq to join Islamic State. At least 500 UK jihadis are believed to have joined the Islamist fanatics, many of them travelling on commercial flights to Turkey and infiltrating its porous border with Syria. Mr Cameron said the two countries would share intelligence and work 'hand in glove' to 'stop this scourge of foreign fighters and defeat this ideology of violence'. In addition to passing counter-terror laws and drawing up plans to seize the passports of suspected jihadis, the Prime Minister said those who travel through Turkey and other routes 'threaten us back at home so we should do everything that we can and we've had very productive discussions'. But Mr Davotoglu seemed to deny jihadists travelling through Turkey were due to lax controls. He said in a press conference at his ministry: 'We have a very clear and obvious position. Foreign fighters are a threat to the countries that they are coming from or for the neighbouring countries. Turkey has never tolerated their transit through our territory or their existence in Syria. 'These fighters are creating a threat for us in Turkey, they are casting a shadow over the just cause of the Syrian people….No country can claim that it is under more of a threat than Turkey [from terrorism]. He even blamed 'propaganda in the foreign press' for claiming ISIL leaders had passed through Turkey. He said: 'Isis actually emerged in Iraq and when Iraq was under US control they developed with the support of the Syrian regime. In no way did any Isis leader pass through the Turkish border.'","David Cameron made remarks on visit to Turkish capital Ankara .

Police were called to the exclusive block of flats in Montagu Square in Marylebone at about 5.20pm yesterday, but were unable to save the man who was in his early fifties. Firefighters had to help police cut through the five foot high metal railings with an angle grinder, as part of attempts to free the man. Metropolitan Police said the man's death was not being treated as suspicious but confirmed enquiries were being carried out into the circumstances surrounding his death. The man, believed to be a banker, fell from the fourth floor window of the exclusive £3million flat (far right) in Montagu Square in Marylebone, central London. He died after becoming impaled on the railings below . Police and fire crews used an angle grinder to try and free the man from the metal railings (pictured) but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Witnesses described seeing his body on the railings for several hours . The £3million split-level flat is next door to a property which used to be owned by Beatles frontman John Lennon, where Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and Jimi Hendrix all stayed in the 1960s. A blue heritage plaque outside the property, which Lennon shared with Yoko Ono, confirms the musician lived there in 1968. It was first bought by Starr in 1965 and later rented out to McCartney and Hendrix before Lennon and Ono took it over as their first home together. A mother described today how her five-year-old son said 'mummy, there's a dead man' seconds after the man plummeted from the fourth floor window. The woman, who refused to give her name, said: 'I was walking down the street and was about five car lengths away when I heard a big bang, like a bottle hitting the floor and smashing. 'The next thing I saw was a man there on the railings.' The woman, in her thirties, added: 'Even my five-year-old son saw and said ""mummy, there's a dead man."" I think he's okay despite what he saw. 'I told him there wasn't and walked him up the street and out of sight before calling the police. 'The man was definitely impaled but I couldn't see much because it was so dark and I didn't want to look. 'It was horrible, I'm still in shock.' One neighbour described the scene (pictured) as 'horrible', while another said it was 'gruesome' The man fell on the railings (left) and witnesses said his body was dangling over this ledge outside the flats . Another witness described how she saw the body of the man, who was thought to be living with his American girlfriend at the time, hanging off railings. The south-east Asian woman, who lives on the square, said she saw the body despite police attempts to cover it up. The woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police had covered the body but I could see from behind that he was on the spike because I could see his feet dangling towards the basement floor. The railings outside the property in Montagu Square, where flats sell for millions, cordoned off . 'It was horrible, I had to divert my eyes.' Another neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, added: 'It is horrific and very sad. 'My cleaners were here and saw the man's body. They were traumatised. 'It was a very gruesome scene. The body was there for a while. 'Police covered it with a tent straight away when they arrived but quite a few people must have seen it. I could not look, I was horrified.' According to neighbours, the man is believed to have worked in the banking or financial services industry. London Fire Brigade confirmed two fire engines and a response unit attended the incident. A spokesman said: 'They had to cut through the railings. They are trained to deal with all different types of incidents.' A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Montagu Square, W1, at 17:18 hours on Monday to reports of a man having fallen from a fourth floor window. 'A man, believed aged in his early 50s, was pronounced dead at the scene. 'The death is not being treated as suspicious at this time.' London Ambulance Service also confirmed that a number of paramedics attended the incident but said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Flats in the square sell for more than £3million while rents for duplex apartments can reach up to £8,000 a month. An elderly lady who lives in the flat below the victim, who asked not be named, said: 'I had only seen the man once as he was coming down the stairs. 'He was a white man, probably in his 50s, but I really know nothing about him or what happened. 'I think he was British but he lived with an American woman who I'd say was a bit younger. Their flat was on the third and fourth floor. 'We don't know what happened, but have heard he fell from the top floor onto the railings below.' Police put a tent in place in the wake of the incident at 5.20pm yesterday and remained at the scene for hours . The incident occurred next door to a property which was formerly occupied by Beatles' John Lennon . A builder, who was working on a neighhbour's home at the time of the accident, said: 'His body was covered when I came outside and there were police everywhere. 'But you could work out what happened, he must have come out of the window and onto the railings. There was blood everywhere. 'I came outside to see what was happening because I heard all the sirens and when I came out I could see that the top floor window was open.'","Man, in his early fifties, impaled on railings after falling 60ft from window .

"A California man has been convicted of killing his wife after a court heard how he stabbed his wife to death with scissors as she held their baby son. A jury convicted 47-year-old Todd Winkler in October of first-degree murder in the death of 37-year-old Rachel Winkler, The Sacramento Bee reported. He was sentenced to 26 years behind bar. Speaking out: Don Hatfield is seen speaking in court while Todd Winkler, in orange, listens on Monday . Rachel Winkler's father Don Hatfield reportedly told the courtoom of his grandchildren 'Those beautiful children were orphaned in one cruel deed. How will I ever explain, or even comment, on the question: ""Why did Daddy kill Mommy?""' The Sacramento Bee reported that Todd Winkler claimed in his trial that Rachel Winkler's neck was stabbed with scissors in self-defense as the couple engaged in a verbal fight on February 27, 2012 about a divorce. Rachel Winkler's affair with a Cameron Airpark co-worker was also included in the trial, according to the newspaper. The couple's children - Eva, Ariel and Alex - are now being parented by Don Hatfield, The Sacramento Bee reported. The grandfather reportedly recounted Eva's and Alex's trauma in the wake of the slaying. According to The Sacramento Bee, Hatfield claimed Eva yells 'Mommy, don’t leave me! Mommy, don’t leave me! Mommy, don’t leave me!' after waking up in the evening. The newspaper also reported that Hatfield expressed anger over both his daughter's affair with 46-year-old James White and her husband's mental health issues being used by the defense. Convicted: Todd Winkler faces a sentence of 26 years behind bars. He is seen in court on Monday . 'I had to listen while Rachel was portrayed...as a sick, incompetent, wayward drunk who cared little for her children and was impossible to please,' Hatfield said, according to The Sacramento Bee. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. 'I fell into deep despair and depression, thinking only of the one juror who would believe this stuff. In the end, none of them did.' Later in court, Todd Winkler said 'I would just say, your honor, that I feel deep remorse for what’s happened, for Rachel’s family and for my family and, especially, for Rachel,' the newspaper reported. Rachel Winkler's longtime friend Shannon Thurman spoke Monday in court, according to The Sacramento Bee. Her brother David Hatfield's written statement was reportedly read to the court by her father.","A jury convicted 47-year-old Todd Winkler in October of first-degree murder in the death of 37-year-old Rachel Winkler .

"The man charged with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is working as a consultant on a Russian TV show about the death of the former KGB agent. Alexander Litvinenko died in London in 2006, aged 44, after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. Andrey Luguvoy, 50, was identified as one of the two Russian men who had met Litvinenko for tea, and was charged with his murder by the British CPS in 2007. Andrei Lugovoy, was charged with murder over the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006, but Russia refused to extradite him, and he has now helped a TV team on a show about the killing . However, Moscow refused to extradite Lugovoy to Britain, and the businessman and former KGB bodyguard was instead elected to the lower chamber of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, where he still sits. Now, eight years after Litvinenko's death, a Russian production company is making a TV series based on his murder, and Lugovoy has been hired as a consultant on the show. Lugovoy has been brought in to share his memories of the meeting with Litvinenko, where he was served the poisoned tea, the studio, Central Partnership, said in a statement. Lugovoy will be consulting the actors and the director of the miniseries, and has helped the screenwriter with the script, the production company said. Central Partnership quoted Lugovoy as saying he chose a Russian company after being approached by foreign studios he didn't trust. Murdered: Alexander Litvinenko, former Russian security agent, was poisoned using tea laced with radioactive polonium-210,  in London in November 2006, and died shortly afterwards, aged 44 . He sure looks the part... Lugovoy is seen with a body guard in 2007, shortly after British CPS sent Moscow an extradition request over the Litvinenko murder charge . Effects: Litvinenko before he was poisoned, left, and after, photographed in his hospital bed at University College Hospital in central London shortly before he died . 'I made a conscious decision to turn down all of them because I understood that none of them were able to tell this Russian story truthfully because of a different mentality,' Lugovoy said in the statement. An inquest into Litvinenko's death stalled over authorities' reluctance to disclose secret intelligence evidence. But in July Britain announced a public inquiry into the death. Lawyers for Litvinenko's family said he was working for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence agency, at the time of his death. The case soured British-Russian relations for years, leading both sides to expel diplomats. Those lingering political tensions worsened recently as Britain and other Western powers accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Ukraine and being complicit in the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet over eastern Ukraine. Britain, along with France and Germany, has been pushing for harsher sanctions on Russia.","Andrei Lugovoi was charged for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko .

"Dramatically cleared of killing his new wife on their honeymoon four years ago, Shrien Dewani will today fly home to Britain on a private aircraft chartered by his wealthy family. But the one thing he has craved all his life – respectability – will prove elusive now. For his secret gay double life, particularly his penchant for violent sex with rubber-clad male prostitutes, will now face renewed scrutiny as his dead bride’s family plot legal action over his sordid private life. Scroll down for video . Acquitted: Shrien Dewani (left) will now face renewed scrutiny as his dead bride’s family plot legal action over his sordid private life, including his sex with rubber-clad male prostitute Leopold Leisser (right) Vinod Hindocha, the father of Dewani’s murdered bride Anni, has retained a London legal firm to sue his son-in-law for keeping secret the fact that he was gay, saying it meant the couple’s wedding was ‘false’. ‘Which father in the world, including me, would allow their daughter to marry a person who sleeps with men?’ he said. ‘The whole wedding was a drama and was false. ‘I am going to sue him for that – not just for the money, but for the loss of my daughter.’ The family believe they have grounds for suing Dewani for leading Anni into marriage without revealing his sexuality, and for compensation for the money the Hindocha family spent on the three-day, £200,000 wedding. They are furious, as are prosecution lawyers, that the issue of Dewani’s sexuality was dismissed as irrelevant by the judge at the start of the trial on the grounds that this was not in dispute, leaving the prosecution without a motive to prove murder. Legal action: Vinod Hindocha, the father of Dewani’s murdered bride Anni, has retained a London legal firm to sue his son-in-law for keeping secret the fact that he was gay . Anger: Anni's family believe they have grounds for suing Dewani for leading Anni into marriage without revealing his sexuality. Pictured are her sister Ami, brother Anish and father Vinod . Yet, until the case began, Dewani had always vehemently denied rumours that he was a promiscuous homosexual, and had spared no expense to keep the truth out of the public domain. Having hired Max Clifford, the disgraced publicist, on a retainer of £30,000 a month within days of being named as a suspect for the murder in 2010, Dewani ordered Clifford to suppress details of his homosexual double life. After the Mail contacted Clifford over allegations that Dewani had hired rent boys, the publicist — now serving eight years in prison for sexual assaults — insisted there was ‘no truth at all’ in the claims. Clifford said: ‘Shrien Dewani has never had a sexual relationship with a man in his life – not ever.’ Clifford added that he had been ‘inundated’ with calls from young women saying they had slept with Dewani. He also threatened legal action against The Sun newspaper for printing claims of an affair by a gay prostitute called ‘the German Master’. It was only on the first day of the trial when, as a series of witnesses prepared to testify he was gay, that Dewani admitted he was ‘bisexual’ in a three-sentence statement read to the Western Cape High Court. Plans: Even as Dewani and Anni they planned their wedding in India, they argued over the colour of decorations, the theme for functions and the style of clothing . His sexuality had been a key aspect of the prosecution case. But judge Jeanette Traverso, ruled – bizarrely – that this evidence was irrelevant because of Dewani’s admission. Crucially, this meant prosecution lawyers could not allege Dewani had plotted to have his wife killed because he was secretly gay. Certainly, lurid tales of gay sex, bondage clubs and trysts in hotel rooms with rent boys were not something that the accused ever wanted to emerge. For appearance and status have always meant a lot to Shrien Dewani. He grew up in a strict, respectable home, the son of a magistrate who ran a nationwide network of care homes, and had a property empire worth millions in Bristol. Indeed, the family were considered so important in their home of Westbury-on-Trym that other worshippers would wait until they arrived before starting prayers at the Hindu temple where they were grandees. Hired: Dewani ordered disgraced publicist Max Clifford to suppress details of his homosexual double life . After going to Bristol Grammar School, where he worked hard and got good grades in his A-levels, he studied for a BSc at the Manchester University Institute of Science and Technology, where he became general secretary of the National Hindu Students’ Forum. After graduating, he trained as an accountant and worked for Deloitte before joining his brother in the family business as a financial director. Even then, all the time he was hiding a secret. For by his early 20s, he had joined a gay dating website called Gaydar, using the name ‘asiansubguy’ – a reference to the fact that he liked to be submissive during sex with men. He used the same username to take out a £50-a-year premium membership of another gay dating site, Recon, which describes itself as the ‘world’s largest hook-up site for men into fetish gear’. And he became a regular at the notorious Hoist nightclub in South London. Yet his strict family and religious background meant he kept the truth about his sexuality secret. There was also, increasingly, pressure on him from his parents to get married, particularly after Preyen, his elder brother, settled down. Shrien struggled in relationships with women. In 2008, he was introduced to a tycoon’s daughter called Rani Kansagra. They were engaged within three months, but split up soon afterwards. Three months after that relationship collapsed Dewani was introduced to Anni Hindocha, a Swedish engineering graduate, whose family had fled Uganda during Idi Amin’s bloody rule, and built up a business and a new life four hours from Stockholm. On a visit to see her cousin, Sneha, in Luton in 2009, she was introduced to Shrien by mutual friends. He invited her to see the Lion King at the Lyceum Theatre in London. The pair continued to see each other, spending alternate weekends in Bristol and Stockholm. Shrien proposed to Anni at the Paris Ritz with a £25,000 diamond ring after flying his girlfriend out from London by private jet in 2010. Behind the scenes, however, the relationship was in turmoil. Dewani and Anni rowed repeatedly and broke up several times during their 18-month courtship because of his ‘controlling’ behaviour and lack of sexual interest in her. Her cousin Sneha Mashru, who was close to Anni, said: ‘Anni felt embarrassed and hurt, and we both felt it was weird. Anni and I speculated that maybe he was a virgin or perhaps just being proper.’ Mrs Mashru added that Dewani was always ‘very critical’ of Anni’s appearance. Anni even broke off their engagement at one point. But Mr Hindocha says Dewani’s father phoned him and pleaded that Anni could ‘not do this’ as it would bring the Dewani family’s reputation ‘down to earth’ if he had a second failed engagement. So Mr Dewani instructed his eldest son Preyen to get Shrien to be more affectionate, and Anni finally agreed to marry him, despite significant ‘misgivings’. Throughout their relationship, he had begun secretly meeting Leopold Leisser, known as the ‘German Master’, paying £400 for the first of several sex sessions four months after he started going out with Anni. Family: The parents of Shrien Dewani, Prakash and Shila (centre) arrive at the Western Cape High Court . Anni and Dewani’s rows continued. Even as they planned the wedding in India, they argued over the colour of decorations, the theme for functions and the style of clothing. At one point, Anni texted her cousin: ‘Fighting a lot with Shrien. Wish I never got engaged. Everyone tells me how fortunate I am…absolutely sick.’ Yet when the £200,000 wedding finally did go ahead at the five-star Mumbai Marriott set on the banks of Lake Powai, there were few public signs of tensions as 300 guests watched Shrien and Anni dance to the hit Bollywood song Pehla Nasha – First Love. But after they went to the honeymoon suite, there was little romance. Shrien scolded Anni for not folding her clothes and spent the night on the sofa, their marriage un-consummated. ‘Crying has become my new hobby,’ Anni told a friend in one text. She also told friends she was already considering divorce before they left for their fateful honeymoon in South Africa. Anni’s father, Vinod, said when he last spoke to her by phone on the afternoon of November 13 she said she had a ‘lot to tell him’ and needed to speak to him when she returned the following Tuesday. They never spoke again. Later that night, Anni was shot dead after their car was hijacked in a township outside Cape Town, apparently on a sight-seeing tour because, according to Dewani, she wanted to see ‘the real Africa’. Hours after her body was found, police found Dewani had logged on to Gaydar, the gay dating site, from the luxury hotel where they had been staying in Cape Town. Ashok Hindocha, the uncle of Anni, told the Mail: ‘We couldn’t care less if someone is gay or not. ‘But Shrien was determined to marry a beautiful heterosexual girl because he is so vain that he had to have a trophy wife. Whatever else happened, by marrying her knowing that he was gay, he had already ruined her life. For that we can never forgive him.’","Bride's father retains legal firm to sue Dewani for concealing he was gay .

"A former gang member who has served 12 years of a life sentence in prison for shooting dead a teenager has been cleared of murder after an appeal. Dwaine Simeon George has always denied being involved in the killing of 18-year-old Daniel Dale in Miles Platting in east Manchester. Mr George, now 30, had his murder conviction quashed by judges at the Court of Appeal today after they ruled it was 'no longer safe.' Sir Brian Leveson, President of the Queen's Bench Division, quashed the conviction. Dwaine George, 30 (left) had his murder conviction quashed at the Court of Appeal after serving 12 years in prison for the killing of Daniel Dale, 18 (right). Mr George is pictured leaving London's appeal court today . He said 'new expert analysis of the evidence 'might reasonably have affected the decision of the trial jury.' Mr George was convicted in 2001 at Preston Crown Court and sentenced to life in prison in 2002, with a minimum term of 12 years. He was released on life licence last year. Mr Dale, who had never been in trouble with the police, was shot as he chatted to friends in the street in 2001 and was found collapsed in an alleyway. Darren Thomas was also wounded in the hand by shots fired from the same gun. Two days later the teenager had been due to give evidence at a trial of the killing of his friend Paul Ward, 16, who was stabbed to death in Cheetham Hill in January 2001. Mr George, formerly of New Moston, was a member of the Cheetham Hill gang and was found guilty of Mr Dale's murder and charges of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was convicted on the basis of gunshot residue which was found but has always maintained his innocence. In 2004 he submitted an appeal in 2004 which failed. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the murder conviction to the Court of Appeal for a second time earlier this year, based on new scientific evidence and an analysis of the case by students at Cardiff University. They were working on the Innocence Project, which aims to help people who they believe have been wrongly convicted. After his conviction was quashed Lynn Hayes, 51, insisted Mr George knew the identity of her son's killer and should name the culprit. She said: It has left me feeling sick. George has now claimed to be a reformed man. If that is true he should tell the police who did this. 'He has said that he is a mature adult. If that's true he should give the names of those responsible to the police. It's his so-called friends that should have saved him, not the appeal court. 'He should tell the police who pulled the trigger.' Judges at the Court of Appeal in London quashed Mr George's conviction for the murder back in 2001 . Ms Hayes said Mr George had previously said a group of his friends had been involved. She added: 'There is no appeal available for my son's life. No amount of time will ever fix the heartbreak that my family continue to suffer each and everyday.' Mrs Hayes said she didn't even know that the appeal court hearing was due to be heard today. She said Greater Manchester Police and the CPS didn't let her know and added: 'I heard about it from a friend who sent me a text after seeing it on the news. 'George said at the time that there was a code - that you didn't grass on your friends. But he has now said that he is a grown-up. Well if he is a grown-up he should tell what he knows. 'Daniel was an innocent 18-year-old boy that never had any dealings with gangsters, gangs, drugs or territory wars.' Sir Brian Leveson, sitting with Mr Justice Green and Mr Justice Goss, expressed the court's 'gratitude' to the CCRC for the part it had played in the appeal. He also paid tribute 'to the work of the Innocence Project and Pro Bono Unit at Cardiff Law School, which took up the appellant's case and pursued it so diligently'. The judge described how the CCRC obtained its own scientific evidence and referred George's case to the appeal court on the grounds that there was 'a real possibility' that the evidence of gunshot residue 'does not now attract the value attributed to it at trial, and therefore does not support the identification evidence'. The CCRC also questioned the admissibility of voice identification evidence. Sir Brian Leveson said Mr George's conviction  was no longer safe because of new scientific evidence . Mr George originally stood trial accused with three others - Ryan Brown, his brother Nathan Loftus, and Arron Cunningham. Before the trial, Cunningham pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition without a certificate, and assisting offenders. He went on to give evidence for the prosecution. Loftus changed his plea of not guilty to guilty of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to five years in a young offenders' institution. Brown, who relied on an alibi for his defence, was acquitted of murder and attempted murder but convicted of wounding with intent. That conviction was later quashed for being 'inconsistent' with the acquittals, but he was sentenced to eight years' detention - reduced to seven years on appeal - for possession of a firearm with intent. Sir Brian said the prosecution case was that George and Brown were responsible for the shooting, using a Walther PPK self-loading pistol which was recovered from Cunningham's house. The judge said the background to the shooting was witness evidence all leading to the inference that it was the outcome of gang rivalry. The evidence against George was that gunshot residue had been found on a black Henri Lloyd hooded jacket found under the stairs at his home. Subsequent analysis found that it bore four particles of gunshot residue, and the prosecution said this was evidence supporting the assertion that George was the gunman. The current appeal was primarily based on a scientific re-evaluation of the significance of gunshot residue generally. Mr George's defence argued that the particles could have come from sources other than the shooting. Years after his conviction, the Forensic Science Service (FSS) had issued new guidelines in July 2006 on 'the assessment, interpretation and reporting of firearms chemistry cases', said the judge. This document dealt with the prevalence of small numbers of particles of gunshot residue 'with the result, so it is argued, that the number and type of particles of residue found on the coat were so small so as to be at or near the level at which they could not be considered to have evidential value.' Sir Brian said that, had the present scientific concerns raised in the appeal court been available to the trial judge, his directions to the jury 'would have been couched in terms of much greater circumspection and caution'. He said: 'The particles of gunshot residue may well be consistent with the appellant's participation in the murder but, at the very least, the extent (if it got that far) to which they could provide positive corroboration would now have required much more detailed analysis of the science and the evidence.' He said the conviction was no longer safe because the new evidence might reasonably have affected the trial jury's decision.","Dwaine Simeon George was convicted in 2002 of Daniel Dale's murder .

"Days before they were due to fly home to the UK from the trip of a lifetime, two young volunteers were drowned after being swept out to sea in South Africa. Charity volunteers Alice Barnett, 19, and Summer Robertson, 21, were pulled to their deaths after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach on December 4, near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. The pair had gone for a celebratory swim with three-other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together at a stunning and remote camping resort. Friends Alice Barnett (left) and Summer Robinson (right) were drowned off the coast of South Africa after going on a swim to celebrate the end of a 10-week charity adventure. The pair had been teaching special needs children and helping to educate young people about drugs, alcohol and AIDS . Summer Robinson (left) and Alice Barnett (right) went swimming with three other friends, but while they were pulled to safety, volunteer lifeguards could not get to the pair in time . Alice Barnett was described as 'an angel' by her father Pete Gallagher on Twitter. Around a month before her trip she wrote that she could not wait to contribute in anyway she could . The three other people who went into the water with Alice Barnett (pictured) were treated for symptoms of near drowning after they were brought to shore . All five quickly got into trouble in the turbulent coastal waters where the south Atlantic Ocean meets the Indian Ocean, known for their strong tides and currents. After hearing their desperate cries, a frantic rescue operation was launched by volunteer lifeguards at a surfing tournament taking place at the resort. But although they were able to pull three of the girls to safety, Summer had passed away by the time they brought her to shore, while Alice's was washed up on the beach a day later. Family, friends, classmates were quick to pay tribute to the pair. In a moving tribute on Twitter, Alice's father Pete Gallagher said that there were 'no words to say how devastated we are to have lost our beloved angel Alice.' Around a month before she jetted out to South Africa his daughter, from Tring in Hertfordshire, had shared her excitement about the trip on a charity website. 'I have learned so much about global development and international issues and cannot wait to contribute in any way I can,' she wrote. Alice Barnett's headmaster said that many teachers would have picked her out as their favorite student . Friends of Summer, from Shrewsbury in Shropshire, also used social media to communicate their grief. One, Beth Hemmings wrote on Twitter: ''My heart goes out to Summer Robertson's family. Really hits home how valuable life is when something so tragic happens to someone you knew.' It is thought Summer was working for Jaguar Landrover at the time of her death after previously working as a sales assistant for retailer Dunelm. Family members are believed to have flown out to South Africa. Alice's former headmaster at the Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School in Aylesbury said his former pupil had been teaching special needs children and helping to educate young people about drugs, alcohol and AIDS. 'The whole school community has been hurting since we heard the devastating news,' he said. 'I often smile when I hear headteachers talking about students who had experienced major tragedies. The students are always described as wonderful, good natured and talented. I often wonder how true those statements are.In Alice's case I know that she really was a lovely person.' He added: 'Not only was she very gifted herself she was always generous and selfless in sharing her gifts. Many of our younger students have had the privilege of being helped by her at lunchtimes in the art room or the drama studio. 'Some teachers have said that if they were allowed to have a favourite student then their choice would have been Alice. Her family are in the thoughts and prayers of all of us.' Port Alfred police spokesman Lieutenant Luvuyo Mjekula said the three survivors were a 41-year-old man and male and female of 18-years-old. All of them showed signs of near drowning and were treated by the team's medics before being transported to nearby hospital for observation for secondary drowning, according to South Africa's National Sea Rescue Institute. They received counselling from the Port Elizabeth police psychological services, said Lieutenant Mjekula. 'The bodies will be repatriated as soon as the post mortem examinations are done,' he added. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the deaths of two British nationals in the eastern cape, South Africa, on December 4. We are providing consular assistance to the families at this difficult time.'","Strong tides dragged Alice Barnett and Summer Robertson to their deaths .

"More than 110,000 people are living with funeral debt in Britain - according to Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck . Families are burying dead relatives in their gardens because of the rising cost of funerals, a Labour MP has claimed. Emma Lewell-Buck said some people are being forced to sell possessions or take out pay-day loans to fund a proper send-off. Others are holding DIY funerals or choosing cut-price cremations with no formal service, she claimed. According to research, the average cost of a funeral has reached more than £3,500 – nearly twice the level a decade ago. In some areas, the figure can approach £7,000 because of a lack of burial space. The MP for South Shields said one fifth of the 500,000 families bereaved each year struggle to afford the cost of a funeral, with more than 100,000 in the country now owing funeral debts. She said the problem will get worse as the price of a service accelerates faster than inflation, with the average cost standing at £3,551. In some areas of the country the price may approach £7,000 due to issues over burial space availability, MPs heard. She told the Commons: ‘Everyone who loses someone close to them wants to give them a decent send-off, but sadly fewer and fewer people are now able to afford even a basic funeral. ‘As well as rising debts, we’re also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral. 'Some are holding do-it-yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden. ‘A number of companies are offering cut-price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service.’ The Labour MP pressed ministers to tackle ‘funeral poverty’ by holding a UK-wide review of funeral service costs and to reform a Government social fund designed to help low-income households. Funeral directors should also be required to let people know the price of a ‘simple service’ to make it easier for people to choose an affordable service, the South Shields MP said. Home burials are legal in Britain if the householder owns the freehold, but estate agents estimate having a body buried on a property can reduce its value by £50,000. Mrs Lewell-Buck, who is calling for a review of funeral poverty, said research by insurer Royal London estimates that 110,000 are living with funeral debt, with each person owing over £1,300 on average. The average cost for a cremation funeral is £3,163, including £654 for the cremation and £2,224 for the funeral director. A burial funeral costs on average £3,933, including £1,584 for the burial. Ms Lewell-Buck told the Commons: ‘One woman from my area approached the Citizens Advice Bureau with unmanageable debts. Funerals are rising in cost leaving many poor families unable to afford them. This has caused some people to bury their relatives in their back yard . ‘She had been unable to get the money together to pay for a headstone for her brother's grave. ‘She ended up applying for a payday loan and the cost of repaying this debt had quickly got out of control. Sadly her story is not an isolated one. ‘Royal London estimates that 110,000 people are living with funeral debt, with each person owing over £1,300 on average. ‘As well as rising debts, we're also seeing people turn to alternatives to the traditional funeral. ‘Some are holding do it yourself funerals and even having to bury their relatives in their back garden. ‘A number of companies are offering cut-price funerals including direct cremations that have no formal service attached to them. ‘Increasingly bereaved individuals who simply cannot afford a formal service are faced with having to opt for a public health funeral - or what used to be referred to as pauper's funerals.' Ms Lewell-Buck said a review of funeral poverty costs would need to consider the amount of burial space available, how deaths are registered, the impact of competition between private and local authority crematoria, and the support offered via the benefits system to people who cannot afford a service. Addressing state support from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for low-income households, the MP said the social fund is ‘well overdue for reform’. She said: ‘The system doesn't function well at the minute and even encourages some households into debt. ‘Applications are lengthy and confusing and especially for somebody who is just bereaved. They can also take around 17 days to have an outcome. ‘DWP also requires an invoice to claim, which means that people who want to arrange a funeral quickly have to agree their costs before they even know if they qualify for help or not. ‘This is worrying when we know 50% of claims are rejected - about 30,000 a year.’ Ms Lewell-Buck asked for the need for an invoice to be removed, saying that this would allow people to check their eligibility before committing to funeral costs. She also suggested the DWP streamlines the process to result in quicker decisions. Ms Lewell-Buck was given permission to bring in the Funeral Services Bill. She asked for it to be given a second reading on January 23. It is unlikely to become law in its current form without Government support or sufficient parliamentary time.","Rising costs are causing people to hold DIY funerals, Labour MP said .

"More than 150 cattle valued at about $350,000 have been reported missing in southeastern Idaho, and authorities suspect modern-day cattle rustling as beef prices have soared. The average retail value of all-fresh USDA  beef jumped to a record $5.28 per pound in February, compared to $4.91 in 2012. The same time a decade ago that grade of beef cost $3.60 and in 1970, the farthest back the USDA data goes, it was just 23 cents. 'Right now it's just insane what those things are worth - it scares me to death,' Idaho State Brand Inspector Larry Hayhurst said. 'Which means the incentive is there.' Three ranchers say roundup searches in recent weeks in the hills and gulches on the remote summer range where the cattle graze have come up empty in two counties. Theft: More than 150 cattle valued at about $350,000 have been reported missing in southeastern Idaho, and authorities suspect modern-day cattle rustling as beef prices have soared (stock picture) The losses include a herd of 50 Black Angus consisting of 25 cows and 25 calves valued at $150,000. Another herd of 41 cow-calf pairs, meaning 82 animals total, plus 10 cow-calf pairs, or 20 animals, from another rancher are also reported missing. Those missing cattle are valued at about $200,000. Authorities say other ranchers in the region have reported smaller losses, but note that typically one or two cow-calf pairs go missing almost every year. An entire herd disappearing is something else. 'At this point we don't have any suspects,' said Sgt. Jeff Edwards of the Bonneville County Sheriff's Office, which is investigating the missing Black Angus. He said an aircraft was used in that search, and so far no other rancher has reported accidently rounding up the cattle, which happens sometimes. The sheriff's office in nearby Bingham County, where the 102 cattle are missing, is also stumped. 'It is a very cold trail,' said Capt. Robert Sobieski. 'There's no way of knowing when they went missing. That's what makes it toughest.' But he also said that deputies aren't ready to confirm that the cattle have been stolen because they could have mingled with other herds in the area. But there have been no reports of that from other ranchers so far. Authorities said taking that many cattle would likely involve tractor-trailers, and at least several people on horseback or all-terrain vehicles to round them up. 'We've never seen cattle prices this high before in the history of the cattle market,' said Brad Higgins, a rancher in northern Idaho near Cottonwood and board member of the Idaho Cattle Association. 'I worry about (theft) a little bit out here.' U.S. cattle industry officials say beef prices are at record highs due to a combination of factors that include past droughts that caused cattle numbers to shrink and increased demand for beef on a global scale following the Great Recession. 'More people entering the middleclass want to eat up the food chain,' said Kevin Good, a senior market analyst for CattleFax, a group that tracks the industry. He said the size of the nation's cattle herd has shrunk in 15 of the last 17 years, while at the same time the human population has grown. Hikes: The average retail value of all-fresh USDA beef jumped to a record $5.28 per pound in February, compared to $4.91 in 2012 . Appetite: The U.S. reportedly had a cattle population of 88 million in 2014 with Americans making their way through about 54 pounds of beef per person . He also said some cattle producers are currently withholding cows and heifers from the market in an attempt to increase herd sizes, another factor leading to less beef on supermarket shelves. 'It's supply driven,' Good said. 'At some point we'll expand the herd.' Good said the U.S. had a cattle population of 88 million in 2014, and that Americans will eat about 54 pounds of beef per person this year. That compares to a cattle population of about 103 million in 1996, when American at about 67 pounds of beef per person per year. Higgins said ranchers are having to decide whether to cash in on high prices by selling more heifers that would normally be used to replenish or increase herd numbers. Retaining those cattle is essentially betting that prices will stay high. Higgins, 45, said he's sticking with his plan to hold onto about 15per cent of the heifers to maintain a herd of about 225, but could understand if others chose differently. 'It'd be a great time to cash in on the market if you're at an age where you're close to retiring,' he said. Hayhurst, the state brand inspector, said that earlier this fall his office caught a man trying to sell ten dairy cattle he'd stolen from a large dairy that didn't even realize they were gone. He said that if the eastern Idaho cattle were stolen it would be difficult to sell them in one of mostly western states that exchange information on brands. But he said someone with some planning could get past state ports of entry by using back roads and end up in a state without brand inspections. 'There are ways to get rid of them,' Hayhurst said. 'But it's hard with a branded animal to market them.' He also said the cattle could simply be used to start another herd, as likely the cows were pregnant.","More than 150 cattle have been reported missing in southeastern Idaho .

"Veteran journalist Derryn Hinch has attacked former TV host Yumi Stynes for her decision to take her six-months-old daughter Mercy to a red carpet in just her nappy. Hinch blasted on his blog, Human Headline, that the controversial move at the Paddington Bear premiere in Sydney was ‘unhygienic’. ‘No jumpsuit, no singlet, just a nappy. And a disposable one at that,’ Hinch wrote. Scroll down for video . Uninhibited: Yumi Stynes attended the Australia premiere of Paddington in Sydney on Sunday, and brought her six-month-old daughter Mercy - who she dressed in only a nappy . ‘My main objection here is hygiene. Maybe Yumi doesn’t mind if bubba poos on her cowboy boots, but other people might object to the side spray.’ Giving his opinion after Stynes hit back at critics for her decision not to make her daughter a fashion subject, Hinch said he was ‘sick of selfish, blinkered mothers, using public areas as toilet stops for kids’. He listed times that he has been shocked by some mothers’ behaviour in recent weeks. ‘I’ve seen a woman change her baby’s nappy across the aisle in Business Class on a plane and – at a ritzy restaurant in Melbourne’s Crown complex - a mother changed nappies at the table. Sure, she moved to an unoccupied table but some other unsuspecting diner would be using that seat soon. Derryn Hinch said he's fed up of 'selfish, blinkered mothers, using public areas as toilet stops for kids’ ‘I support the campaign for mothers to breast-feed in public. It is a disgrace when people urge them to retire to the toilets.’ He concluded: ‘I wouldn’t eat in a lavatory and don’t expect a baby to. I also wouldn’t use bum wipes in public or take kids to a red carpet event clad only in their underpants.’ The former host of The Circle spotted Hinch’s blog and responded on Twitter by calling it: ‘Very hurtful, very inaccurate but thanks for the free shame.’ Hinch told Daily Mail Australia that when he first saw the photos he thought 'she's silly' and that 'it's really wrong and inappropriate.' He felt compelled to write the blog post afer his recent experiences with mothers changing their babies in public . 'I think it's happening more and more, this mummy power in recent times, the thing I was very keen to differentiate is that I'm not getting involved in the breast feeding debate, I one thousand percent agree with it.' He said taking a baby to a premiere in just a nappy 'was very inappropriate' and possibly a publicity stunt. Asked whether he feels bad that Stynes found it hurtful, Hinch said: 'No not at all she's a big girl she's handed it out.' Stynes hit back after she heard Hinch had commented on her decision . She called his blog 'very hurtful' but brushed it off . On Monday Stynes’ husband savaged a newspaper columnist who claimed his wife had committed a 'fashion faux pas' by taking their baby to a high-profile event in a nappy. Her choice of attire for her youngest child was critiqued by David Campbell, writing for The Daily Telegraph as 'weird'. He also questioned whether a parent 'worth their salt' would be caught without a change of clothes. The radio personality said the criticism she received was completely unwarranted and the last thing she was trying to do by letting her youngest daughter Mercy dress appropriately for the warm weather was to draw attention to herself. The media personality also  attended the premiere with husband Martin Bendeler (left) and two older daughters Anouk, 12, and Dee Dee, 10 . 'I've been to a pile of premieres this year and am never the most interesting person there. Usually I show up because I'm interested in the film, maybe to write about it, not because I'm desperate to get in the social pages!' Ms Stynes told Daily Mail Australia. 'Yesterday I attended the premiere of Paddington with my husband and three daughters because the two older ones were excited to see the film and my husband loves London. 'The last thing we expected was to have s*** hung on us for what our 6-month-old was wearing! 'My littlest girl is a Sydney baby. She was born at the RPA and has spent the entire Spring and Summer getting around in a nappy,' Ms Stynes revealed. 'I don't believe in judging babies by their outfits. More attempts by men to control women, if you ask me!' She has hit back at critics calling the attacks sexist and upsetting for her family . Stynes with her husband Martin Bendeler, who said that being offended by a child in a nappy was 'weird' The mother of three added that it was not the criticism alone that upset her, but the sexist nature of the attack on an innocent baby. 'The thing that makes me sad is my husband was so proud to see his wife and baby daughter getting their photo snapped on the red carpet,' Ms Stynes said. 'He thought Mercy was so cute and calm in the face of all those flashing cameras. And then when we saw that article this morning it was so incredibly judgmental and hostile it actually made my hair stand up on end. '""Baby wears nappy"" is hardly news: it's a breathtakingly sexist attack - and if I am the person who attracts that sort of confected scandal, that's sad for me. But leave my baby daughter out of it,' the media personality said. Stynes tweeted to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.' Stynes with her eldest daughters Anouk, 12 (left), and Dee Dee, 10 (right) Mr Campbell's comments were also rebuffed by Mercy's father Martin Bendeler, earlier on Monday. Speaking to Mamamia, he said that there was nothing unusual about the little girl being in a nappy, especially on a hot day when temperatures reached 26C. 'If you’re offended by a six month-old’s nipples, you’re weird,' he said. Ms Stynes and Mr Bendeler married in 2012 and Mercy is their first child together. The former Channel V presenter also had two older daughters Anouk, 12, and Dee Dee, 10. She was one of a number of guests who took their children to the Paddington premiere and was worried that her baby would get too hot. Mr Bendeler said that his wife had a blanket with her in case Mercy got cold. However, Mr Campbell, who has two children, claimed that the child's attire looked 'plain weird'. 'There was only one fashion faux pas on the red carpet... it wasn’t a celebrity revealing a little too much. It was a baby wearing nothing but a nappy,' he wrote, saying the only excuse would be a 'poo explosion - a bowel movement that requires not only a nappy change but a full wardrobe change.' Mr  Campbell said that as a father of two children, and expecting another, he would have ensured that his kids would have worn at least a singlet and nappy cover. The Paddington premiere, though a red carpet event at Event Cinemas on George Street, was a casual affair, attended by celebrities and their children, as well as ordinary families. Most were dressed in summer attire, and Nicole Kidman, who stars in the film, was the only frocked-up celebrity on the carpet. Ms Stynes expressed outrage at the comments, tweeting to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.' 'It's important that men keep telling women how to dress and what to wear @DaveyCampbell85. Even 6-month-olds,' she commented.

"Depraved:Daniel Welsh dragged his victim off the street and threatened to shoot her before raping her. It has now emerged that he was being monitored by police at the time of the attack . A young woman was abducted and repeatedly raped by a high-risk serial sex offender who was being monitored by police. In a horrifying attack, Daniel Welsh dragged his victim off the street and threatened to shoot her. Welsh, who had a long history of sex offending, was subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order at the time, having been judged as at ‘very high risk of re-offending’. He told the 25-year-old woman: ‘Don’t do anything stupid because I am going to shoot you’ before subjecting her to a ‘prolonged, vile and depraved’ ordeal, lasting for 90 minutes. As Welsh was handed a life sentence yesterday, police chiefs defended their handling of the case after refusing to publish an internal report on the sex offender, claiming it was ‘in the public interest’ to keep it under wraps. Yesterday, Welsh was handed an Order for Lifelong Restriction (OLR) which means he will only be released from custody once the Parole Board is satisfied that he no longer poses a threat. Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lady Rae described Welsh’s latest attack as ‘prolonged, vile and depraved’ and branded him a ‘serious danger to the public’. She said: ‘One cannot even imagine the terror this young woman must have suffered. It is clear from the Victim Impact Statement that she has suffered greatly at your hands – the psychological impact on her is incalculable.’ Welsh, 22, pounced on his victim, as she walked to meet a friend in Aberdeen in February this year. The sex offender, a prisoner at HMP Grampian, pleaded guilty to abduction and rape charges at an earlier hearing and sentence had been deferred for reports. The court heard how he grabbed the woman then forced her to walk with him, saying he just wanted to talk. He took her to a cemetery and raped her. He then forced her to walk to a bird hide, where he raped the victim again. The court heard that Welsh was a convicted sex offender at the time of the attack and was being monitored by an offender management unit in Aberdeen. Crime scene: Forensics officers at a bird hide where the victim was raped . Welsh had twice breached a court order banning him from going near girls aged under 17. He had been cleared on a legal technicality after police were forced to break into his flat to rescue youngsters there. When the authorities have failed to prevent a convicted sex offender from striking again, an independent Significant Case Review (SCR) is often commissioned. However, in Welsh’s latest case, there was none. Instead, local police compiled an internal report– an Initial Case Review (ICR) – into its own handling of Welsh, which is now being kept secret. Scottish Tory chief whip John Lamont said: ‘The decision by Police Scotland not to reveal the findings of the ICR unhelpfully gives the impression of having something to hide.’ Campaigner Margaret-Ann Cummings, whose eight-year-old son Mark was killed by a sex offender in Glasgow in 2004, said: ‘If Daniel Welsh was deemed “very high risk”, it defies belief for the police to say this crime was impossible to predict.’ A Police Scotland spokesman said: ‘The management of sex offenders in the community is a particularly sensitive and complex area of work, and in this instance a review was immediately undertaken by the MAPPA [a set of procedures called Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements] partners in accordance with national guidance. ‘It was concluded that the actions of the authorities were appropriate and could not have predicted the behaviour of Daniel Welsh. ‘Keeping the public safe is always the main priority (but) a balance is required between public safety and the right of the individual. ‘All aspects of cases are carefully considered at every stage of the process, from psychological and risk assessments, to places of residence and potential security issues.’","Daniel Welsh dragged his victim off the street and threatened to shoot her .

"David Cameron today called on Turkey to do more to tackle jihadi fighters in Iraq and Syria – and help stop British fanatics joining them. The Prime Minister met the country’s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara amid growing concern over Turkey’s failure to take the fight to the Islamist fanatics across its border.

The PM’s visit to Turkey coincides with that of Federica Mogherini, the new EU foreign affairs commissioner, who wads due to visit a refugee camp on Turkey’s southern border and hold talks with its leaders. Turkey has already absorbed up to 1.8 million refugees and is braced for more if the conflict intensifies. Ms Mogherini, a former Italian foreign minister, took up the role at the beginning of November. A statement from the EU said: 'This joint visit, early in the mandate of the new European commission, demonstrates the importance of Turkey… as a candidate country negotiating accession to the European Union and as a key partner and neighbour considering its strategic location and dynamic economy. 'It is also a clear sign of our willingness and determination to step up engagement across the whole range of the EU-Turkey relationship to fully reflect the strategic importance of our relations.'

"Staff at a McDonald's brought a whole new meaning to Happy Meals when they aired hardcore pornography to late-night diners. The branch in a small Swiss town showed explicit scenes including several different kinds of sex acts on the in-store televisions. Presumably the sound was turned off, for a witness reported that the hard core broadcasts went on for some time before staff even noticed it was playing. That's not tartare sauce! A shocked youth looks up at television screens showing hardcore porn at a branch of McDonald's in a small Swiss town after workers tuned into a sports channel that switched to adult fare .

The skin flick had followed on after the end of the usual sports broadcasting that evening. 'We were only a group of men so it didn't bother us, although what would have happened if there was a family in the restaurant at that time I don't know,' said the diner, who sent these pictures into Swiss news site 20 Minuten.

"There's been speculation that there could soon be blood in the water within government ranks - and it appears at least one front-bencher believes that's already the case - claiming Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and influential Peta Credlin, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, are 'like two Siamese fighting fish stuck in the same tank'. The Australian on Wednesday reported that the working relationship between the pair is effectively over and that the only person capable of bringing the internal battle to an end, the Prime Minister, 'isn't going to get rid of Peta' according to the front-bencher. However, a spokesperson from Julie Bishop's office told Daily Mail Australia that the Foreign Minister stands by her claims that the pair have not had a cross word and she does not want anyone else's job. There's been speculation in recent days that Bishop is primed to take over as leader, if needed. 'I genuinely don’t know anything about those claims,' the spokesperson said. Scroll down for video . Julie Bishop has proved to be one of the government's shining lights in 2014 but her recent rifts with the Prime Minister and his Chief of Staff is causing concern within Cabinet ranks . 'They are like two Siamese fighting fish stuck in the same tank!' A Liberal front-bencher is claimed to have said about Peta Credlin's apparent frosty relationship with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . The Foreign Minister and Deputy Liberal Leader has reportedly refused to take any orders from Peta Credlin, who is the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff . 'There is nothing that I am aware of that could possibly be reported coming from the Foreign Minister or her office, both (Bishop and Credlin) have said that there was nothing to the claims and I think it’s fair to say we need to go on what both have said, exactly.' There are also claims that the Foreign Minister has made a decision not to take any more orders from Peta Credlin while other senior Cabinet members reportedly also believe the PM's senior adviser wields too much influence. The Australian quoted the front-bencher as saying 'Tony isn’t going to get rid of Peta and Julie isn’t going to stop' and goes on to quote another MP 'what is Julie supposed to do? Perform worse to make Tony look better by way of comparison?' But Ms Credlin told the newspaper that 'we continue to work in a close and collegial way, I admire Julie for her tenacity and skill as a minister'. Julie Bishop's office stands by her claim that she has not had any 'cross words' with Peta Credlin and they have no idea where the suggestions of a bust-up have originated . One front-bencher says Julie Bishop is unhappy at the level of control Peta Credlin as the PM's chief of staff. The Foreign Minister's office denies the claims . Recent polls under-score her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull . What has become apparent is that there are factions building within government ranks - those who back the strong-performing Foreign Minister and others, loyal to the PM, who believe she is being overly-promoted to his detriment. Recent polls underscore her increasing popularity, with Julie Bishop's approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past five months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull. The reports of this latest rift come after a week of high drama for the government front-bench, including a widely-reported argument between Julie Bishop and the PM himself after she read media reports that a male colleague would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, Peru. Two reported bust-ups in the past week with the PM's office. Julie Bishop took issue with Tony Abbott's decision to 'chaperone' her at the United Nations conference and now there are claims she is at odds with his chief of staff, Peta Credlin . The Foreign Minister was not consulted about the plan for Andrew Robb, who is ranked below Ms Bishop in the Cabinet, to shadow her and confronted Tony Abbott on the matter, reports said. It was further claimed that he was being sent to Peru with the Deputy Liberal Party Leader to ensure that Australia did not over-commit on its climate change policy promises. The bust-ups have overshadowed a significant announcement in Lima by Ms Bishop that Australia will contribute $200 million to a global fund to help poorer nations tackle climate change. Prime Minister Abbott said it was fair and reasonable for the government to pledge a contribution despite having ruled it out at the G20 summit in Brisbane. 'We've seen things develop over the last few months,' he told reporters in Melbourne. Australia's commitment would contribute to emission reduction projects in the region, Mr Abbott added. Health Minister Peter Dutton, was not buying into the drama around Julie Bishop and Peta Credlin, on Wednesday. 'I see two highly competent people who are very effective at their job and serving their nation well,' he said. Julie Bishop enjoys strong support from within Cabinet but there are some MPs who claim her increasing profile is undermining the Prime Minister . Causing further consternation were revelations that the PM initially had no plans to send any of his ministers to the global climate negotiations in Peru, where up to 200 other countries would be. Ms Bishop will talk international climate policy ahead of next year's 2015 Paris conference, which is being held to achieve a universal agreement on climate change, from all the nations of the world. Mr Abbott last week admitted the government had been performing in a 'ragged' way in recent days. The Foreign Minister has scored impressive wins at home and abroad in 2014 and has won support with her influence in the unanimous resolution of the UN Security Council to demand access to the crash site of MH17 .","The working relationship between the Foreign Minister and PM's Chief of Staff has reportedly broken down .

"The moment Moses parts the Red Sea is one the most famous Biblical miracles. But instead of relying on God to divide the water into two huge columns, as seen in the 1956 film, 'The Ten Commandments,’ Moses may have instead used his knowledge of tides to guide the Israelites to safety and escape the Pharaoh’s army. This is the claim made by Dr Bruce Parker, an author, visiting professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey, and former chief scientist of the of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA’s) National Ocean Service. Scroll down for video . Moses may have instead used his knowledge of tides to guide the Israelites to safety and escape the Pharaoh’s army, according to Dr Bruce Parker, former chief scientist of the (NOAA’s) National Ocean Service. A screenshot of the moment from Ridley Scott's new film, ‘Exodus: Gods and Kings,’ is pictured . In the Biblical story, Moses parts the sea, allowing the children of Israel to cross a dry seabed to the opposite shore, while the waters ‘close’ and drown the Pharaoh’s soldiers, who are in pursuit. The tale will feature in Ridley Scott’s ‘Exodus: Gods and Kings,’ who claims that his version will be more ‘realistic,’ with the parting explained by a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This is because, before a tsunami strikes, coastal waters often recede. However, Dr Parker writes in The Wall Street Journal that the explanation is flawed, because waters typically only drawback for up to 20 minutes, which could not have given the Israelites enough time to cross the dry seabed, thought to be at the Gulf of Suez, at the northern end of the Red Sea. Moses would not have been able to predict an earthquake and tsunami, unless he was tipped off by God, he added. Instead, the expert believes that Moses used his local knowledge of tides to ensure his people got safe passage. In the Gulf of Suez (stock image), the low tides mean that parts of the seabed can be dry for hours, before the waters make a sudden return. According to the Bible, the children of Israel were camped on the western shore of the Gulf when Pharoah’s troops were spotted in the distance . Accounts from the Bible suggest that God gave Moses the power to part the waters in the form of a miracle. It has been suggested that the water parted because of a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This is because, before a tsunami strikes, coastal waters often recede. Hollywood Director, Ridley Scott, chose this explanation to depict in his new film, 'Exodus: Gods and Kings'. Dr Bruce Parker believes that Moses used his knowledge of the tides to enable his people to cross shallow waters at low tide. His perfect timing meant that as the last of the Israelites crossed to safety, pursuing Egyptian soldiers were drowned as the waters suddenly returned. In the Gulf of Suez, the low tides mean that parts of the seabed can be dry for hours, before the waters make a sudden return. According to the Bible, the children of Israel were camped on the western shore of the Gulf when the Pharaoh's troops were spotted in the distance. Dust clouds raised by chariots and horses of the approaching army would have allowed Moses to calculate their time of arrival, Dr Parker said. Having lived in the wilderness, Moses would have known useful low tide Red Sea crossings  and by looking at the moon, he could have predicted when low tide would occur. This knowledge would not have been used by the soldiers who lived along the River Nile, which is connected to the Mediterranean Sea and does not have dramatic tides. Dr Parker writes: ‘Knowing when low tide would occur, how long the sea bottom would remain dry and when the waters would rush back in, Moses could plan the Israelites’ escape.’ The Biblical tale cites a full moon on the night of the dramatic escape, which would have meant that the low tide would be at its lowest, allowing the seabed to have stayed drier for longer, giving the people longer to cross. If this was the case, the high tide would also have been higher and more likely to drown an army, as described in the Biblical story. This is the parting of the Red Sea as depicted in the Hollywood blockbuster, 'The Ten Commandments'. Because water levels were higher in the Red Sea in Biblical times, the expert estimates that ‘walls’ of water may well have come crashing down on the Egyptian soldiers, but they wouldn't have parted in this way . In order for this to happen, Moses’ timing would have had to be perfect, so that the last of the Israelites crossed the dry sea just before the return of the high tide – enticing the Pharaoh's army to follow them and letting the powerful returning waters catch them unawares. Dr Parker says Moses may have managed this either by using some sort of delaying tactic, or by sending his most able-bodied people back to entice the soldiers to chase them across the seabed. The Biblical story also mentions a strong east wind that helped to ‘push back’ the waters. Dr Parker said that it is true that wind blowing across a shallow waterway pushes it back, so such a wind may have heightened the effect of low tide to reveal more dry seabed than normal. Of course, such a wind could be attributed to divine intervention, but Dr Parker believes that Moses’ timing ‘had to be based on a tide prediction’. Because water levels were higher in the Red Sea in Biblical times, the expert estimates that ‘walls’ of water may well have come crashing down on the Egyptian soldiers. Dr Parker is not the first scientist to suggest this theory to explain the Red Sea miracle. An account written by an ancient historian called Artapanus between 80 and 40 BC, says: ‘Moses, being acquainted with the country, waited for the ebb and took the people across the sea when dry.’","Dr Bruce Parker, former chief scientist of the NOAA’s National Ocean Service believes Moses understood the moon and tides .
Knowledge helped him predict when the Israelites could cross the Red Sea during low tide, when the sea bed was dry .

"Residents living close to Will Loasby, 30, endured months of torment while he threw loud parties fuelled by drugs . A 'neighbour from hell' has been barred from his own home after months of anti-social behaviour  culminated in a 10 hour rave at his home. Residents living close to Will Loasby, 30, in Downham Market, Norfolk, endured months of torment while he threw loud parties, a court heard. They said his music was played so loudly from his semi-detached home that the pictures on the wall of the house next door were shaking. The nightmare culminated in a 11-hour rave on November 28 when music started blaring from the house at 5.30pm and did not stop until 4am. Now, in one of the first cases of its kind, the local council has prosecuted Loasby under the new Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act which was passed earlier this year. Magistrates have granted a closure order on the property, which prevents occupiers and others from remaining there for a maximum of three months. It means that despite a last minute bid by Loasby, he has been banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks. The order does not terminate the tenancy but the court was told eviction proceedings are likely to be brought against Loasby. Emma Duncan, prosecuting, said furious neighbours in Downham Market, Norfolk called police after pictures hanging on their walls began to shake. When officers turned up to the house they found themselves outnumbered by revellers with around 30 people under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Loasby pleaded with magistrates to show leniency but at the hearing last Friday he was banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks. The prosecution - one of the first cases of its kind in the country - means he cannot got back to his home until January 15. Ian Cooke, presiding magistrate at King's Lynn, said there was 'no other way' to prevent disorder for neighbours. Ms Duncan had told the court how Loasby repeatedly refused to turn the music down when asked by neighbours and council officers. She said: 'The loudness and intensity of the bass beat was described as the loudest the noise nuisance officer had heard in eight years in the job. 'Around 30 people were under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and there was physical contact between rave goers and residents. 'The neighbours are at their wits' end and they deserve some relief from Mr Loasby's behaviour.' She also warned there was 'not enough' police manpower in the whole of Norfolk to stop the gatherings once they had begun. The bench was told that police would not be able to support council staff if they tried to seize sound equipment. Loasby denied use of or selling of drugs but admitted his party got 'out of hand' and said he made a 'massive mistake'. Representing himself, he said: 'My neighbour asked me to turn the music down in a very aggressive way which annoyed me and I slammed the door in her face. Residents in Downham Market said his music was played so loudly from his semi-detached home (pictured) that the pictures on the wall of the house next door were shaking . 'I was under the influence of alcohol and the decision I took was a massive mistake. 'You can do what you want. I'm not going to have another party because I don't want to lose my house.' He added that the house was one of the only remaining connections he had to his daughter who had been previously adopted. After the hearing, Loasby said he has since been left 'walking the streets'. He said: 'I am homeless. The only place the council has offered me to live is the biggest drug den in King's Lynn. 'Since I left court on Friday I have been walking the streets. I haven't really slept. I have just being going to warm places. 'I do not have friends and family to help me. I want to apologise to some of my neighbours.' Speaking about the new rule to evict tenants for up to three months, he said: 'I think it is a joke. 'Maybe for people who are repeat offenders but that was the first time the council had been to my house.' Unemployed Loasby said he has been unable to work since he  tripped and banged his head in 2011 and was left in a coma. The prosecution was brought by West Norfolk Council and deputy leader Brian Long said: 'A small minority of people can make life miserable for our law-abiding residents. 'In this instance the nature of the disorder and the potential for further disorder has triggered this decisive action. 'In cases such as this it is important that we act swiftly to protect residents in the vicinity of the property.' Loasby pleaded with magistrates to show leniency but at the hearing he was banned from the housing association-owned property for six weeks . Sue Stavers, managing director of Circle Housing Wherry, who own the property, said they 'fully supported' the council's action. She said: 'We work in close partnership and regularly exchange information with local authorities, the police and a range of other agencies to tackle anti-social behaviour. 'Where problems persist and alternative methods have been exhausted, we will go to every length necessary to ensure that those committing anti-social behaviour crimes are brought to justice.' Loasby's next door neighbour Greg Dzirnowski said he had to take this young family out in his car to escape the noise. Mr Dzirnowski, 34, said: 'We've lived in our house for five years and Will moved in two years ago. 'For the past two months it has been very bad but the past three weeks it has been terrible. 'There have been lots of parties but this time it was ridiculous. It was all night. 'Around 10 pictures on my wall fell down and some broke, they were family photos. The whole house was shaking. 'On the Friday evening a van arrived and 10 huge speakers were loaded out of it. There were no lyrics to the music it was just a heavy vibrating beat. 'It got so bad I took my family out in the car to escape it in the hope it would stop when we got back. 'I knocked on his door and asked him to keep the noise down but he was aggressive and said some very very bad words to me then slammed the door in my face. He knows what he's doing isn't alright but he just doesn't care. 'I called the police and they came and did nothing. They asked him to turn it down but when they went away he turned it back up again. 'Cabs were constantly arriving and eventually people went at around 7am.' Speaking about the recent eviction Mr Dzirnowski said: 'I'm glad they've served him the notice. I hope he doesn't come back. He's the neighbour from hell.' Deanie Brock, an unemployed 19 year-old who attended the party, said Loasby held the party after breaking up with his girlfriend. He said: ''It started with just two of my speakers and a couple of us and we started getting drunk. 'Then we said let's have a house party and got someone with a huge van of speakers to bring them in and we stacked them up. 'We have to move everything away from the walls it was so loud. The cupboard doors were opening and closing on their own. 'There were about 25 people there. There was weed and we had loads of alcohol. We heard there were 16 complaints in all. 'I think Will probably is the neighbour from hell. If I had kids I wouldn't want to live next door to him. But it was worth it. It was one of the best parties I've been to.' Chris McGrath, 20, has been a neighbour of Loasby's for six months since moving into his retired grandparents' home while working as a labourer. He claims his grandfather William McGrath, 65, and grandmother Wendy McGrath, 64, feel driven out of the home they have lived in for ten years because of Loasby. He said: 'They have been thinking about moving. They feel driven out of their home. 'They've rung the council twice a week every week for months and have had meetings with the council about him. 'We've had beer cans and other rubbish purposely thrown into our garden. I would call him a neighbour from hell. I'm glad the council has finally done something.'","Neighbours of Will Loasby, 30, in Downham Market, Norfolk, endured months of torment while he threw loud parties at his home .

"Despite ample warnings, more and more Australians are looking for love in the wrong places and falling victim to online romance scams. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says that total losses for dating and romance scams reached an eye-popping $23 million this year. In a bid to protect the public, the ACCC has sent almost 1500 letters to potential victims in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as part of its Scam Disruption Project. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has sent almost 1500 letters to potential scam victims in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory as part of the Scam Disruption Project . ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard told Daily Mail Australia that the initiative, which was launched in August, has been very effective so far. ‘In the past we have relied upon getting the message out through the media, but too many people were still falling for the scams,’ she said. ‘Since we began writing to suspected scam victims, we've seen a 60 per cent drop in the victims continuing to send money.’ ‘These are very ruinous plots. They destroy people emotionally and financially, so it’s very important we reduce the rates.’ One of the most shocking stories of online romance scams is that of Jette Jacobs, from Wagin, West Australia. The 67-year-old widow was found dead in suspicious circumstances after she travelled to Johannesburg to meet a Nigerian man she met online. Her body was found in a rented South African villa but her money, credit cards, jewellery, and other personal items were gone. Ms Jacobs, who had been advised against the trip by her family and friends, had already sent over $78,000 to her Nigerian lover, who called himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh. ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the project, which was launched in August, has been vastly effective . Jette Jacobs, (L) was found dead in suspicious circumstances after she travelled to Johannesburg to be with a Nigerian man she was involved in an online romance with, who called himself Jesse Orowo Omokoh (R) ‘The majority of people who fall victims to the scam are middle-aged, with an even split between the genders,’ Ms Rickard said. ‘There has been an increase in the sophistication of the scams, and we’re seeing now is an influx of scams being executed through online dating sites and social media.’ She said the use of social media allows scam artist to research their victims and assume mutual interests, gaining their trust more rapidly and effectively than they had previously been able to. ‘Typically, scammers will claim they are Australians living overseas. They will profess their love and try to move the communications off the site, so they can’t be held accountable.’ Scammers will sometimes spend years building trust before they ask for money. They often ask for money to visit the victim in Australia, but the plan to visit wall will fall through last minute. Though it is extremely rare for the victims to recover the money, one woman from Perth known as Jenny became one of the exceptions when, back in April she regained $100,000 or about 40 per cent of the money she transferred overseas, according to the ABC. ‘Jenny was one in a million. She was ferocious in pursuing the money and was fortunate in that the bank involved in the transfer was compliant. She is one in only two other victims I have  heard of being successful, said Ms Rickard. It is extremely rare for the victims to recover the money lost in these scams, however one woman from Perth known as Jenny (R), pictured here with Australian detective Dom Blackshaw, and Nigerian detective Paul Okoli, managed to uncover about 40 per cent of the funds she sent overseas. Ms Rickard says there are usually some warning signs of a scam. ‘If they do provide images, try look at some of the databases online, as there are favourite images used by scammers that can be easily identified.’ ‘They also use scripts of dialogue with multiple victims at once, so try googling what they say to see if you get any hits,’ she said. ‘Once they start asking for money, that's a tell-tale sign. ’ ‘If you do think you have been scammed, let Scamwatch know as soon as possible, as well as the any sites that were involved in the process.’ For more information check Scamwatch .","Scammers are using social media to research their victims and gain trust .

"President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has today fired his deputy after accusing her of 'plotting to kill him' following a three-month 'campaign' against her led by his wife. According to a statement released by the government, Mr Mugabe fired Joice Mujuru, 59, and eight other Cabinet ministers aligned with her, accusing them of corruption. Mrs Mujuru had been tipped as the person most likely to succeed Mr Mugabe until his second wife, Grace, launched a three-month campaign against her and accused her of being too 'dull' and 'corrupt' to lead the party. Scroll down for video . President Robert Mugabe (left) has fired his deputy Joice Mujuru (right) accusing her of 'plotting to kill him' Mr Mugabe, 90, has now accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting to assassinate him and branded her 'a witch'. Experts say the First Lady is now being groomed to succeed her husband, following her appointment as leader of the women's wing of Zanu-PF last week. Mrs Mujuru was tipped as the person likely to succeed Mr Mugabe until his second wife, Grace, (pictured) launched a campaign against her . Mrs Mugabe, 49, had repeatedly accused Mrs Mujuru of plotting against her husband. Once working as her husband's secretary, in the last few months she has risen to the position of senior party figure. Mrs Mujuru's sacking came following weeks of accusations that she had led a 'treacherous cabal' to try to unseat Mugabe, according toAl Jazeera. The sacked officials received their dismissal letters on Monday night the Reuters news agency has reported. Mrs Mujuru and her allies were also fired from their senior positions in the ruling party, Zanu-PF, at a meeting last weekend. A statement issued by the cabinet secretary on behalf of Mr Mugabe said: 'It had become evident that her conduct in the discharge of her duties had become inconsistent with the expected standard, exhibiting conflict between official responsibilities and private interests.' The president said he would, however, allow them to retain ordinary membership of the party. Mr Mugabe has also accused Mrs Mujuru of holding secret meetings at the U.S. Embassy in Harare. Mrs Mujuru has denied the claims, calling them 'ridiculous' in her first public statement, released a day before she was fired. 'I have become the fly in a web of lies whose final objective is the destruction of Zanu-PF,' Mrs Mujuru said in a statement on Tuesday. Mr Mugabe and Mrs Mujuru  attend a rally marking Mugabe's 88th birthday in February 2012 . 'A vociferous attempt has been made to portray me as ""a traitor"", ""murderer"" and ""sellout"", yet no iota of evidence has been produced to give credence to the allegations.' In her statement Mrs Mujuru said her loyalty to Mr Mugabe was ‘unquestionable’ and it was ‘repugnant’ to suggest she had plotted to kill him or wanted to remove Mr Mugabe from office. She said Zimbabwe's state media had ‘continued to publish malicious untruths’ about her. Mujuru has denied the claims, calling them 'ridiculous' in her first public statement . But correspondents say her career ran into trouble when Mr Mugabe's wife entered politics earlier this year. Mrs Mujuru, who has been a member of Mr Mugabe's cabinet since he became president in 1980, said no evidence has ever been brought against her. Mrs Mujuru is the first vice president to be fired since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. Her four predecessors all died in office. The ministers of energy, education, public service and social welfare, presidential affairs, communication and postal services are among the other members of Cabinet who were fired. There has not yet been any announcements relating to replacements. AFP news agency has reported Mrs Mujuru has blamed 'a well-orchestrated smear campaign and gross abuse of state apparatus' that led to the loss of her ruling party post. She said she was being victimised after exposing infiltrators conspiring to destroy the party, which has ruled the country since independence in 1980. Zanu-PF held an elective congress last week which endorsed Mugabe as president and his wife as head of the women's wing. Mrs Mujuru, once a freedom fighter in Mr Mugabe's guerrilla army known by the nom de guerre 'Spill Blood' in the local Shona language, is now considered a political pariah following the allegations.","Accused Joice Mujuru of plotting to kill him and branded her 'a witch'

"American citizens must pay their fair share of tax, the US ambassador to London warned today as Boris Johnson refuses to hand over more than £100,000. The American-born Mayor of London has said it is outrageous that the taxman in the US is chasing him for unpaid bill worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Matthew Barzun, the White House's man in London, today defended the rules, insisting people who enjoy the benefits of being a US citizen must 'pay your fair share in taxes'. But he also leapt to the defence of US firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon, insisting they were doing nothing wrong by avoiding pay tax in the UK but were just 'playing by the rules'. Scroll down for video . Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who spent today playing in Ealing, has branded US tax laws 'outrageous' Mr Johns was born in New York and has both and British and an American passport . Mr Johnson was born in New York and has an American passport as well as a British one. The law means that American citizens must pay income tax to US authorities if they earn more than £62,000. The can also be taxed on capital gains on selling a main house made anywhere in the world. Rejecting the demands, Mr Johnson said: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I?' But today Mr Barzun insisted that all Americans must pay their share, wherever they live. Speaking to a press gallery event in Parliament, he told journalists that he would not discuss Mr Johnson's tax affairs. He said: 'If you are an American citizen we have the Privacy Act where we as government officials don't talk about you or your tax or health or your other information without your express consent. 'I won't comment on a specific American citizen and their status because of that.' US ambassador to London Matthew Barzun said anyone who enjoys the benefits of being a US citizen must pay their fair share of tax . America wants Britain to stay in the European Union, Matthew Barzun said today. The US ambassador to London stressed the importance of the UK's membership of theEU days after David Cameron signalled he would be prepared to lead the country out of the 28-member bloc unless there are major reforms. Mr Barzun said Britain's membership of the EU was a 'really good thing' from an American point of view and US leaders 'really value a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU' because the nations see 'eye to eye' on a range of crucial international issues. The Prime Minister has vowed to renegotiate the UK's relationship with Europe ahead of an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 if he is returned to Downing Street after the general election. In a landmark speech less than a fortnight ago setting out plans to tighten welfare rules for EU migrants, Mr Cameron warned that he will 'rule nothing out' if other countries turn a deaf ear to British concerns. At a Westminster lunch, Mr Barzun was asked whether a British exit would reduce the importance of the UK's special relationship with the US. Mr Barzun said: 'If you ask us, we really value a strong United Kingdom in a strong EU because we see eye to eye ... on the important issues of the challenges we face - look at Isil, Ebola, climate change, Russian aggression - Europe and the UK are the first places we turn to deal with that. 'That's on the negative side. On the positive side, look at the transatlantic trade deal. 'We see eye to eye. So from a selfish point of view it's a really good thing. 'From a selfish point of you, it's a really good thing but it's entirely up to you folks to figure out your relationship with and within Europe.' But he made clear that any US citizen had to pay the tax that is due. He added: 'Look, I mean we have our rules and we expect people to play by them. 'And if you get the benefits of being an American citizen you pay your fair share in taxes.' However, he defended US companies who have been accused of using international law and cross-borders deals to avoid tax bills in Britain. Asked if US companies Amazon, Google and Facebook are 'international tax dodgers', Mr Barzun replied sharply: 'No.' He went on to insist that the tax rules are set by national governments which they then apply legally. 'I'm not the spokesman for any of those great American companies. 'These companies and other companies who do work are clever about using international, the rules that exist, as written by the way by all of us: that's US government British government, we make these rules and they are playing by them. 'And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.' Last month, on a visit to New York, Mr Johnson revealed that he was refusing to pay a tax bill on the sale of his house in London. In an NPR interview designed to promote his new book, he said he was subject to Uncle Sam's 'global taxation' policy. He claimed he was facing a bill on the profits made from selling his first home in London, which is exempt from tax in the UK, but would be taxed in the US. It is thought he made around £720,000 on the sale. The relevant tax for 2009 sales was 15 per cent, which would give him a total bill of almost £110,000. Mr Johnson said: 'The great United States of America does have some pretty tough rules, you know. 'You may not believe this but if you're an American citizen, America exercises this incredible doctrine of global taxation...' 'Even though tax rates in the UK are far higher and I'm Mayor of London - I pay all my tax in the UK and so I pay a much higher proportion of my income in tax than I would if I lived in America - the United States comes after me...' 'Would you believe it? For capital gains tax on the sale of your first residence, which is not taxable in Britain, but they're trying to hit me with some bill. Can you believe it?' Mr Johnson claims he is facing a bill on the profits made from selling his first home in London, which is exempt from tax in the UK, but would be taxed in the US . Today he took part in the netball match at Ealing, Hammersmith & West London College . Earlier he had a coffee with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for a walkabout with local officers in Ealing town centre . When asked whether he would pay up anyway, Johnson replied: 'I think it's outrageous! No is the answer. Why should I? 'I haven't lived in the United States for, you know, well, since I was five years old. I could [afford the bill] - but I pay the lion's share of my tax. I pay my taxes to the full in the United Kingdom where I live and work.' The IRS rules state: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad. 'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.' However, Mr Johnson has made his own demands for the US Embassy in London to pay the congestion charge. Latest figures suggest Mr Barzun's embassy owes more than £8million for driving officials and dignitaries around London. But Mr Barzun made clear he will continue to refuse to pay up, citing rules which allow embassies to avoid paying tax which would affect business operating in host countries.","Ambassador to London Matthew Barzun says US citizens must pay up .

"Australia has been slammed for its lack of action on climate change by a new report that ranks it the worst performer out of all the industrialised countries. The 2015 Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI), which rates countries based on their performance in five categories including climate change policy, ranked Australia as 60th – the second last place – just above Saudi Arabia. Guy Ragen from the Australian Conservation Foundation, who provided the report's authors with comment on Australia's climate policy, told Daily Mail Australia the results show that 'the world is going forward and we are going backward'. Australia was ranked 60th in the world, the second last place, by the 2015 Climate Change Performance index . 'Our low ranking is mix of a few things, firstly it's because our per-person emissions are very high compared to other countries,' Mr Ragen said. 'What also caused the drop is that in the last 12 months our government has repealed the carbon price which did actually work. It reduced around 17 million from our electricity sector. 'They've also moved to weaken the renewable energy target. At the moment the target is 41,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020 and they want to reduce it to 26,000, so essentially they want to cut it by 40 odd per cent. Despite making up 0.33 per cent of the population, Australia emits 1.14 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. The poor result has been attributed to the government's worsening climate policy, including a proposal to weaken the renewable energy target.

Canada . 5. Islamic Republic of Iran . This is a significant imbalance when compared to Denmark which was ranked first amongst the countries scrutinised by the report and was recorded as having 0.08 per cent of the world's population and emitting 0.11 per cent of the globe's CO2. Even the United States and China, which are the world's biggest producers of CO2 and produce 14.69 per cent and 23.43 of the world's emissions respectively, managed to score five ranks higher than Australia. Mr Ragen said that if Australia wanted to improve its ranking, it would need to implement a much higher emission reduction target. 'Ours is a five per cent reduction commitment by 2020. In the US they've announced a 28 per cent reduction by 2025. For us to match that we'd have to commit to 30 per cent,' he said. Australia's ranking has worsened over time: 'As Tony Abbot withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the Australian delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations, the policy grades where much worse than in previous years,'  Jan Burck, the report's author said . Australia's score card: Despite making up 0.33 per cent of the population, the report stated that Australia emits 1.14 per cent of the world's carbon emissions . The reports authors, Jan Burck from political and social analyst group Germanwatch, also pinned the worsening results on failed government policy. Guy Ragen from the Australian Conservation Foundation said the results show that 'the world is going forward and we are going backward' 'As Australia has (compared to the most other countries) a very high emissions level, a bad emissions trend, nearly no new renewables [sic] and also no good developments in the field of energy efficiency, Australia's better rating in the past came from the policy part,' Ms Burck told Daily Mail Australia. 'Your former government was relatively pro active regarding climate change policies like emission trading schemes or carbon taxes. 'As Tony Abbot withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the Australian delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations, the policy grades where much worse than in previous years.' The report, which was created by Germanwatch and Climate Action Network Europe and released in  Peru where the United Nations climate talks are taking place, was issued as news emerged that Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop was originally blocked from attending the talks by the Prime Ministers office. However Ms Bishop bypassed the decision through a Cabinet meeting and is now expected to arrive in Peru's capital on Tuesday to meet with almost 200 other leaders to discuss a global climate change agreement.","Australia was ranked 60th, the second last place, by the 2015 Climate Change Performance index .

"Aristocrat: James Lumley-Savile, 39, is accused of threatening his girlfriend with a pair of ten-inch kitchen knives  while high on MDMA . An Eton-educated aristocrat threatened his girlfriend with a pair of ten-inch kitchen knives in the street outside his £800,000 home while high on MDMA, a court heard today. James Lumley-Savile, 39, the great-great-grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough, is alleged to have flown into a drug fuelled rage at  Inda Pap that left witnesses fearing for her life. Jurors at Isleworth Crown Court heard that Lumley-Savile, who is heir to the title Baron Savile, waved the blades around above his head in front of his terrified girlfriend outside his Fulham home. A minicab driver Miss Pap called in a bid to escape told the court he thought the  businessman was 'going to kill her.' Lumley-Savile denies two charges of possessing a bladed article and one of affray all on May 19. Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said the Google employee and his girlfriend were at his home when the drama unfolded. 'By the early hours, some kind of dispute had begun between them,' Mr Nicholson told the court. 'The origins of the dispute, we do not need to go into at this stage and we are not going to call Inda Pap. 'What happened was, by 2.15am a mini cab driver by the name of Qamar Walayat was called to the scene by the Uber mobile phone app. 'Miss Pap had booked the mini cab driver and was to go to her home in Bethnal Green.' Mr Nicholson said Mr Walayat arrived at the house ten minutes later, and saw a man and a woman outside. He continued: 'Before the girl could speak, the defendant said: ""She doesn't want the cab anymore"". 'Mr Walayat enquired: ""Are you going to cancel the job then?"", and at that point, the girl looked over at the defendant, said she did not feel safe with him and that she wanted to go. 'As far as the minicab driver could see, she looked scared and nervous. At that point the defendant lifted both arms from where they had been down by his side to shoulder height. 'Mr Walayat could see one large kitchen knife in his right hand along with a knife sharpener, and one in his left hand. 'Both had blades of around 10 inches or so - they were proper large kitchen knives - and the defendant said in a threatening voice: ""Self defence"".' Mr Nicholson said Mr Walayat had been fearful for his own safety, and that of Miss Pap, and tried to reason with Lumley-Savile. 'Understandably, the mini cab driver felt scared and in particular for Miss Pap, who was still standing in close proximity to her boyfriend on the pavement,' he said. Witness: Qamar Walayat (left), a taxi driver Miss Pap called in a bid to escape told the court he thought Lumley-Savile was 'going to kill her' 'He told the defendant: ""Calm down, you can talk to her tomorrow, if you do something wrong you could go behind bars,"" but the defendant shook his head and said 'No'. 'It seems the woman was saying words to the effect of self-defence as well. 'It will be for you to determine what that meant and whether she meant self defence to the defendant. 'Mr Walayat reversed the car around three metres away, locked the door and called the police as covertly as he could, placing it on speaker phone. 'During the call the women walked to the cab, opened the doors and got in. 'We will hear some of what she said as well. The defendant did not try to stop her.' Miss Pap saw the driver on the phone to the police and called out 'James, James' to alert her boyfriend, causing the driver - who was 'fearing for his own safety' - to drive off. The 999 call was played to the jury of nine women and three men. Police spoke to Mr Walayat and Miss Pap, who were now around the corner from Lumley-Savile's home. The court was told they noted that the pupils of Miss Pap's eyes were 'very big' and she had foam around her mouth, so decided she was under the influence of drugs. Court: Jurors at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard that Lumley-Savile, who is heir to the title Baron Savile, waved the blades around above his head in front of his terrified girlfriend outside his Fulham home . Lumley-Savile, who was found nearby, was arrested and said: 'Will I get to tell my side of the story?'. Interviewed at Hammersmith Police Station that afternoon, he admitted having taken MDMA. A collection of five kitchen knives - including the two he was allegedly holding - were discovered behind his front gate, the court was told. Mr Nicholson added: 'This does not fit easily into the terms of domestic violence. 'But the prosecution say that by going outside with two knives, frightening the taxi driver and brandishing them as he did in the area, the defendant committed these offences.' Accused: Lumley-Savile denies two charges of possessing a bladed article and one of affray on May 19 . Giving evidence, Mr Walayat, who drives an E class Mercedes, told the court he thought Lumley-Savile was going to 'kill' Miss Pap during the violence. At the height of the drama, the rowing couple were just a foot away from his car, on the left hand passenger side. Mr Walayat said: 'The guy told me she doesn't want the cab anymore. The tone of his voice was terrible - it was a bit scary. 'I didn't see the knife at first because it was down by his side, but the girl said she was not safe here and was talking to him and saying: 'I need to go'. 'She was obviously scared. She knew she was not safe so I thought something was wrong, and she was really scared. 'Then the guy took the knife up - it was a long knife, a kitchen knife about 10 inches long, and he was holding something that looked like a sharpener too - and said ""self defence"". 'I replied ""Let her go"". 'The body language and his voice was proper scary because of the way he was looking at his girlfriend and I thought he was going to kill her straight away because of the way he was. 'I said: ""Look, let her go, you can talk to her tomorrow, if you do anything stupid you will get in trouble, let her go"". 'I wanted to make him scared but he didn't listen to me. 'I didn't feel safe and I thought I might end up in hospital here so I reversed my car and put my phone on speaker and called the police. 'I held it where he couldn't see it because I didn't want him to see me and do something.' The court heard that Miss Pap then came over to the car, and when she was '80 per cent' inside spotted what the driver was doing and shouted out to the defendant. The driver added: 'I just put my foot down because I was not taking any risks', while Miss Pap shut the door. In the 999 call she is heard protesting that the pair 'don't need' the police. Road: When Mr Walayat arrived in the Fulham street where Lumley-Savile lives he found him and Miss Pap outside. The court heard he later realised Lumley-Savile was carrying two knives . Miss Pap is heard saying: 'He's got knives in his hands, but I know he was like, trying to self defend himself and there wasn't anything like you know, we made it OK by me going home safe in a cab and you locked the door. 'It was a really really scary situation but I am safe now'. The call operator, however, insists: 'There's no chance of that. We've got a male threatening you with knives, we're still going to be coming to that whether you like it or not.' The jury were shown photographs of Lumley-Savile's home, close to the River Thames, and Mr Nicholson pointed out the footpath outside and space where the defendant parks his car. Lumley-Savile is descended from the Earls of Halifax and Scarborough and part of one of the oldest landowning families in Yorkshire. His father, Eton-educated businessman and war hero Hon Henry Leoline Thornhill Lumley-Savile, was injured during the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944 while a lieutenant with the Grenadier Guards. He is set to inherit estates in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Recently Lumley-Savile sought planning permission to convert their hunting retreat, Walshaw Lodge in Hebden Bridge into a five-star twenty-bedroom hotel. Although the family's ancestral seat in the town was sold in 2009 to pay inheritance tax, they still own almost 6,000 acres of land in the county. The trial continues.

"Washington’s ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun, said Google, Facebook and Amazon are playing by the rules on tax and shouldn't be demonised in Britain . Google, Facebook and Amazon are playing by the rules on tax, are great American companies and should not be demonised in Britain, Washington’s ambassador to the UK said yesterday. Matthew Barzun leapt to the defence of the giant corporations which have come under fire for their tax policies, saying they were simply following international tax rules laid down by governments. David Cameron warned in October that multinationals which exploit loopholes to avoid paying UK taxes would be made to ‘damn well pay’. Today the Treasury will publish details of a new ‘Google tax’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the UK pay at least some tax here. But Mr Barzun told journalists in Westminster it was wrong to describe the firms as ‘international tax dodgers’ despite the fact they pay little, if any, corporation tax in this country. ‘I’m not the spokesman for any of those great American companies,’ he said. ‘These companies and other companies… are clever about using international rules that exist, as written, by the way, by all of us – that’s US government, British government – we make these rules and they are playing by them. ‘And I hope that if and when rules change they will play by those new rules as well.’ Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee which has exposed the extraordinary methods used by some corporations to avoid tax, condemned Mr Barzun’s intervention as ‘a joke’. She said: ‘They are not playing by the rules as any normal person would understand it – they are playing around with the rules in a way that is totally unethical. ‘Playing by the rules means paying a fair amount of tax in the jurisdictions where you generate your revenues. These companies are not doing that, and to suggest they are somehow playing by the rules is a joke.’ Today the Treasury will publish details of a new ‘Google tax’ designed to ensure that multinationals operating in the UK pay at least some tax here: Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax . Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years . Facebook is reported to have paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last two years. Google, which generated more than £3.5billion from the UK last year, paid just over £20million in corporation tax. And Amazon, which sold goods worth £4.3billion in the UK last year, paid just £4.2million. The firms all insist that they are operating within the international tax rules. But their behaviour has sparked mounting anger in the UK. Chancellor George Osborne announced last week that the UK will impose a new ‘diverted profits tax’ on corporations that seek to artificially shift their profits to low tax regimes abroad. He said it would raise £1billion over five years. But experts warn that the so-called ‘Google tax’, whose details will be unveiled today, could prove fiendishly difficult to enforce.","Treasury to announce a new 'Google tax' to force companies to pay tax .

"'Obamacare architect' Jonathan Gruber formally apologized to Congress and the American people on Tuesday for his 'glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting comments' about the fashion in which health care reform was passed in Congress and the intelligence of the American people. 'In some cases I made uniformed and glib comments about the political process behind healthcare reform. I'm not an expert on politics, and my tone implied I was, which is wrong,' Gruber told a House committee. 'In other cases I simply made mean and insulting comments which are uncalled for in any context. I sincerely apologize for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion,' the economist testified. Gruber denied that he did anything more than provide economic advice to Congress and the Obama administration during the creation of the health care law and pleaded with lawmakers, who used the hearing to rub his comments in his face, not to allow his hubris to sully their view of the health care law. Scroll down for video . 'Obamacare architect' Jonathan Gruber formally apologized to Congress and the American people on Tuesday for his 'glib, thoughtless, and sometimes downright insulting comments' about the fashion in which health care reform was passed in Congress and the intelligence of the American people . 'I did not draft [Massachusetts] Governor Romney's health plan, and I was not the architect of president Obama's health care plan,' he told them. 'It is never appropriate to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others. I knew better, I know better, I'm embarrassed, and I'm sorry.' Gruber, an economist and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, came into the national spotlight this fall after videos surfaced of him asserting that Democrats intentionally deceived the American people during the health care reform debate. Two critical videos of Gruber riffing on Obamacare at an academic conference have rankled Republicans, who have long claimed that the Affordable Care Act should be gutted and replaced with 'commonsense' legislation. In one he said the law was purposefully written in a 'very tortured way' so it wouldn't be counted as a tax. In another he claimed 'lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.' 'And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to get the thing to pass,' he added. At a House Oversight hearing that was to be the swan song for the committee's fiery chair, Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, the California congressman called the statements 'troubling' and said they were 'not only an insult to the American people but revealed a pattern of intentional misleading the public about the true impact and nature of Obamacare.' He later asked the economics professor point blank: 'Are you stupid? Does MIT employee stupid people?' When Gruber answered in the negative, Issa said, 'OK, so you're a smart man, who said some really stupid things.' The Republican congressman, stepping down as head of the powerful committee at the end of the current legislative session, set to end this week, shoved Gruber's comments back in his face during Tuesday's hearing and played the damning clip on the 'stupidity' of Americans for the committee. Confronted with his own contentious words, Gruber smiled and laughed awkwardly as all eyes turned to him. But when it came time for him to testify, Gruber apologized profusely. Accompanying Gruber at today's hearing was Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner. Tavenner's agency, located within the Health and Human Services Department, is responsible for the implementation of the health care bill. At the last minute Democrats asked that a witness, a DC resident named Ari Goldmann, who was scheduled to be on a secondary panel  be seated at the table with the key witnesses. After first denying the minority party's request, Issa relented and asked the government witnesses if they minded having Goldmann at the table. 'I understand he is a waiter at a local restaurant that thoroughly loves Obamacare,' Issa snarked before stating that Goldmann is 'actually an independent consultant.' 'They gave him a new title,' he snidely said. in making his opening remarks Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings lamented that throughout the last Congress Republicans held 29 hearings on Obamacare and 'not one' was about how to implement the law. Just think 'what we could have accomplished had we devoted that same amount of time and resources to more constructive efforts,' he told his colleagues. 'So I mourn what could have been.' Cumming said that today's hearing appeared to be no different. 'As far as I can tell we are here to beat up on Jonathan Gruber for stupid, I mean absolutely stupid, comments he made over the past few years, and then grill, and grill, Administrator Tavenner,' he said. 'This may be good political theater, but it will not help a single American get health insurance.It will not help a single person get well, it will not help a single person get the care that they need.' The Maryland Congressman took advantage of the opportunity, however, to state for the record that he was 'extremely frustrated' with Gruber's statements. 'They were irresponsible, incredibly disrespectful and did not reflect reality, and they were indeed insulting,' the Maryland congressman said. Growing angry, Cummings said that Gruber does not speak for him or other committee chairs who directly worked on the health care law. 'Worst of all Dr. Gruber's statements gave Republicans a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down ACA and eliminate health care for millions of Americans,' he said, noting that 'many Republicans now allege some kind of Democratic conspiracy.' Cummings said such an assessment is 'completely wrong,' he said, as is the idea that Gruber lied to aid Democrats. The Democratic congressman pointed out that former Republican presidential nominee and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney had also praised Gruber's work in the past.","'I'm not an expert on politics, and my tone implied I was, which is wrong,' he told a House committee .

"It is a chance to own a piece of British motoring history - an incredibly rare pre-production Range Rover, which was developed in secret under the code name Velar. Land Rover, in an effort to disguise the new Range Rover brand, designed the brand new luxury 4x4, and issued it with a name Velar, which in Italian, means covered. In an effort to further disguise the heritage of the car, the first 30 development models were issued with number plates from Croydon - instead of Solihull, to further confuse any potential industrial spies. One of the prototype Range Rovers developed by Land Rover in the late 1960s is going under the hammer early next year in Dorset . The Range Rover Velar, is still on its original number plates which add to the important historical value of the incredibly rare vehicle . The vehicle's chassis plate shows the important number which proves the car to be one of the first pre-production development vehicles . Early next year, the incredibly rare prototype Range Rover is expected to sell for more than £30,000 at auction. Land Rover wanted to develop a luxury off-roader that was capable of coping with the demands of the countryside while providing the level of comfort normally associated with a high-end saloon. Designers worked on the project in secret under the name Velar, from the Italian 'velare', meaning 'veiled' or 'covered'. Before the introduction of the Range Rover, off-road vehicles were seen as very agricultural and used by farmers or people in remote locations. Land Rover developed just 30 of these prototype vehicles and according to the car's chassis number, it is the 38th vehicle to have been completed. The development models were registered in 1969 on a H registration plate - more than a year before the car's official launch in September 1970. Despite its size, the Range Rover was faster than most production saloons in 1970 with its 3.5 litre V8 petrol engine. It had a 0-60 time of around 15 seconds while its top speed approached 100 miles per hour. The original car was sold at launch for £1,990. In addition, the car had a four-speed manual gear box with a low and high ratio - doubling the number of available gears and giving it unrivaled off-road performance while allowing it to cruise along the new motorways at high speed. Land Rover developed the Range Rover in secret to provide a luxury off-road vehicle that can cope with the motorway and countryside . Range Rover claimed its new car 'provides excellent and comfortable transport to and from the office and because of its good lock and light steering and all-round visibility and roomy luggage space, it is an ideal vehicle, particularly for women drivers, for taking the children to school' The Range Rover has had its original petrol V8 engine removed and replaced by a more economical diesel version, pictured . According to Land Rover's official press release from 1970, the new car 'provides excellent and comfortable transport to and from the office and because of its good lock, light steering, and all-round visibliity and roomy luggage space, it is an ideal vehicle, particularly for women drivers, for shopping and taking the children to school, as well as being perfectly suited to take the family and caravan and boat comfortably off the beaten track and away from the crowds.' The car is being sold by Charterhouse Auctions in Sherborne Dorset early next year. It is being sold by a private owner from Bristol, and over the years has had its original V8 engine replaced with a Land Rover 300TDi engine and some body panels changed. Richard Bromell, from the auction house, said: 'This is one of the earliest Range Rovers ever made. 'It’s the eighth vehicle made by Velar, a company set up Land Rover to develop the Range Rover, and is one of just 40 of the Velar Range Rovers made. 'The Range Rover was launched in 1970 and was a success form the start. Now in its fourth generation, early Range Rovers have a large and loyal following. 'Despite being such an important early vehicle, this Velar Range Rover has been well used over the past 44 years and has had the original V8 petrol engine replaced with a more economical, the interior changed and some of the body panels replaced. 'This is such an early and important Range Rover that we estimate it could fetch £30,000 for its Bristol owner.'","The Range Rover Velar is a special pre-production development model built before the official launch in 1970 .

Although the state-run Korean Central News Agency did not date the photograph, in is believed to have been taken in recent days. Other photographs of the official visit show Kim posing with young children who are dressed in full military uniform, and giving a speech in an auditorium packed to the rafters with huge crowds of women who applaud him wildly. Throughout the visit, Kim was flanked by members of the North Korean military wearing Khaki uniform and their distinctive oversized peaked caps. However before and after his speech in the huge meeting hall, Kim was seated on an elevated top table alongside his wife, whose official title is Comrade Ri Sol-ju. Very little information about Ri Sol-ju has appeared in official North Korean sources, but she is known to have attended a number of public functions alongside the 31-year-old North Korean dictator, and is often spotted wearing black trouser suits made by the fashion house Chanel. She is believed to be aged between 25 and 29 and her professor father and gynecological nurse mother are considered members of the country's political elite. Ri Sol-ju, which may well be a pseudonym, is understood to have married Kim in 2009 and the couple have at least one child together.

The latest cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services. Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group. North Korean officials denied being the hacks, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to them and an official statement branding the privacy invasions a 'righteous deed.

Smiles all round: Kim is flanked by  members of the North Korean military who wear Khaki uniforms and elaborate headwear . Images of Kim's state visit come after North Korean officials denied accusations they are behind the recent hacking raids on Sony Pictures . A theory has been put forward suggesting North Korean hackers targeted Sony Pictures out of anger at the release of a film called The Interview. The movie stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHubGist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!' Investigators have traced the hacking attacks  back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel - a five-star resort in Thailand's capital. Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel.","Kim Jong-un photographed alongside dozens of wives of North Korean servicemen who are seen weeping with joy .

"2014 has a been a year filled with shocking breaking news events which  set Facebook users' timeline's alight. From the death of international celebrities to the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, Australians were quick to take to the social media site to share their thoughts. Tragedy and politics dominated Australians' online conversations, with Robin Williams, Tony Abbott and Malaysia Airlines taking out the top three spots in Facebook's most talked about topics of the year. Scroll down for video . The death of Robin Williams was the number one topic of conversation on Facebook in 2014 . The talented 63-year-old'd death hit the Australian online community hard . Williams, who took his own life in August, led the list followed by Mr Abbott, who had a busy year with the G20 meeting in Brisbane and the federal budget, while the dual tragedies of MH17 and MH370 took out third place. The topics are culled from conversations and posts from the more than 12 million Australians who used Facebook between the start of January and start of December 2014. 1. Robin Williams . 2. Tony Abbott . 3. Malaysia Airlines . 4. Ice Bucket Challenge . 5. Game of Thrones . 6. Ebola virus outbreak . 7. Conflict in Gaza . 8. South Sydney Rabbitohs . 9. World Cup . 10. Melbourne Cup . 'We look at it in an anonymous, aggregate way,' said Facebook's head of policy in Australia, Mia Garlick. Tony Abbott had a busy year and took out the number two spot on the list, after his momentous G20 meeting in Brisbane and the federal budget . Malaysia Airlines was the talk of Facebook this year for all the wrong reasons, with the tragic loss of flight MH370 and the downing of MH17. It came in third place in the most talked about topics in Australia for 2014 . The Ice Bucket Challenge, which was created to raise awareness of the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis took the world by storm. Celebrities including David Koch( pictured) and even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg got involved in the viral campaign. 'Increasingly people are talking about current events, current affairs and news stories from around the world. You can see the Israel/Gaza Conflict is featured in here, the Ebola crisis, the World Cup.' Sport continues to be a favourite topic in Australia with the South Sydney Rabbitohs making the list following its NRL premiership win this year as well as the Melbourne Cup. Schapelle Corby just missed the list, coming in at No.11, after she became the talk of the country following her release from Bali in February. Popular show Game of Thrones made it in to the list at number five. The medieval fantasy series had Facebook users talking throughout 2014 with more statuses expected in 2015 with the return of Game of Thrones in April . The South Sydney Rabbitohs’ ground-breaking win against the Canterbury Bulldogs in the NRL grand final made it onto the list as the number eight most talked about talked of 2014 . Sporting events proved to be popular topics of conversation among Australian Facebook users in 2014, with the World Cup in Brazil making an appearance on the list . 1. Darling Harbour, Sydney . 2. Sydney Opera House . 3. Melbourne Cricket Ground . 4. Sydney Harbour . 5. Taronga Zoo . 6. Warner Bros. Movie World - Gold Coast, Australia . 7. Sea World - Gold Coast, Australia . 8. South Bank, Brisbane . 9. Dreamworld Australia . 10. Surfers Paradise . Another omission was cricketer Phillip Hughes, who died at the end of November. The place with the most check-ins was Darling Harbour in Sydney, followed by the Opera House. The previous year's most checked-in venue, the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was knocked down to third place, followed by Sydney Harbour. Queensland theme parks also appear as a favourite place to check-in this year, with Warner Bros, Sea World, Southbank, Dreamworld and Surfers Paradise also making the top 10 list. Another sporting event, the Melbourne Cup, got the Australian public talking on Facebook in 2014 . Sydney's popular tourist destination, Darling Harbour, was the number one most checked-in place in Australia for 2014 . 1. World Cup . 2. Ebola virus outbreak . 3. Elections in Brazil . 4.

"An experimental technique used to boost brain performance with electrical pulses can actually cause people to perform less well in some tasks, scientists have found. The technology, known as transcranial direct current stimulation, is already being marketed in commercial products as a way of helping computer game players and athletes improve their focus. However, new research from the University of Oxford suggests that the benefits of this technique, which stimulates activity in the brain with an electrical current, may be limited by personality as it appears to only be helpful to people who are stressed about performing a task. Brain stimulation devices have been used by researchers to study a range of brain functions but they do not believe the technology is understood well enough to be available for use by the general public . They found that while electrical stimulation helped those who lacked confidence or were anxious about performing a series of sums, it caused those who did not fear mathematics to decline. A follow up study that examined how volunteers fared at spotting which way an arrow was pointing on a screen when confronted with distracting information showed that all those who received stimulation performed more poorly. Early experimental studies using transcranial direct current stimulation have suggested that the simple devices can boost memory and cognitive performance. This has led to some DIY enthusiasts who have attempted to build their own equipment at home. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation uses gentle pulses of electricity to increase the activity of neurons in the brain. The pulses boosts the natural tiny electrical current that transmit signals within neurons. Electrodes are attached to different parts of head depending on the area of the brain to be stimulated and the desired effect. A low intensity current passes between the two electrodes, with the area of the brain close to the cathode being inhibited and the area close to the anode being excited. However, Dr Roi Cohen Kadosh, a lecturer in experimental psychology at Oxford University who led the latest study, urged people not to attempt using the technology at home. He said: 'The central finding is that stimulation may be beneficial to some populations but detrimental to others, rather than merely less effective, depending on the trait. 'Such research is essential given the increasing academic and public enthusiasm over transcranial direct current stimulation, including do-it-yourself stimulation. 'These tendencies may overlook the importance of identifying traits and situations that respond to stimulation as costs with no demonstrable gains, as with our low mathematics anxiety participants.' He added: We stimulated the regions that are not working efficiently in those with high maths anxiety, it helped to improve their functioning. 'However, in those with low maths anxiety those brain regions are presumably working at an optimal level. If we further change their excitation and inhibition it leads to a non-optimal change. 'We assume that the brain has a limited capacity. Changing the excitation and inhibition might impact other cognitive skills.' Previous research has shown that transcranial direct current stimulation can improve mathematical ability when applied to part of the prefrontal cortex. Safe? Some transcranial direct current stimulation devices are already being sold commercially to the public . This area is known to play a role in regulating emotion, so Dr Cohen Kadosh and his colleagues tested the technique on 25 students who found mental arthimetic stressful and 20 who had no problem with sums. According to their findings, which are published in the Journal of Neuroscience, participants who were anxious about performing maths gave correct answers faster after receiving brain stimulation. Experimental results showing transcranial direct current stimulation can boost brain activity has led some to attempt to build their own devices at home, but new research suggests this harms cognitive performance . These participants also had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva. The findings suggest that the brain stimulation may have helped the students control their anxiety. Another study by Dr Cohen Kadosh, published in Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience earlier this year, also showed that people's response to electrical stimulation varied by age, gender, hormone levels and the pre-existing activity of their brain. Dr Cohen Kadosh is now pushing for new regulations to control the sale and use of these brain stimulation devices. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: 'It's not something people should be doing at home at this stage. 'I do not recommend people buy this equipment. At the moment it's not thereapy, it's an experimental tool.' A transcranial device that uses a smartphone is already been developed by a US company called Thync as a way of altering a users mood. Other commercial companies have been marketing similar devices to help computer gamers react faster. In a recent article for the Journal of Law and Biosciences, Dr Cohen Kadosh's colleague Dr Hannah Maslen argued: 'Recently, it has become very easy for individuals to purchase devices which directly modulate brain function. 'For example, transcranial direct current stimulators are increasingly being produced and marketed online as devices for cognitive enhancement. 'Despite posing risks in a similar way to medical devices, devices that do not make any therapeutic claims do not have to meet anything more than basic product safety standards. 'We present the case for extending existing medical device legislation to cover CEDs.' Dr Nick Davis, an expert in brain stimulation at Swansea University added that the science underpinning the affects of such techniques were still too poorly understood to be available to the public.","Tests at University of Oxford show brain stimulation helps reduce anxiety in people who find a task stressful but can make others perform worse .
Participants who had no fear of maths performed worse after treatment .
Researchers say brain boosting devices must be regulated to avoid harm ."
"While she's won rave reviews for her performance in Cake, seeing Jennifer Aniston in the same nominations race as Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon is an unexpected turn of events. The two ladies are both nominated in the leading actress category at the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards, with Witherspoon earning a nod for her performance in Wild. They join Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), previous SAG winner Julianne Moore (Still Alice), and Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) in the stacked category. SCROLL DOWN TO SEE FULL LIST... Honoured: Jennifer Aniston was nominated in the leading actress category for the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards, which were announced on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles . Competition: Reese Witherspoon was also nominated in the leading actress category for her role in Cake . Aniston is a veteran of the rom-com genre and a fan favourite. Her dramatic turn in Cake is quite a departure for the actress and has been stirring up awards buzz in the past few months. Witherspoon, however, is a force to be reckoned with after earning in 2006 the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and the Critics Choice Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in Walk The Line. And Aniston could not contain her surprise when responding to her nomination, tweeting: 'This is the best 6:00 a.m. wake-up call ever. Words can't describe how blessed I feel to be recognized like this by my peers for this film. What an enormous feeling of joy and gratitude.' In the ensemble cast category, nominations were awarded to Birdman, Boyhood, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game and The Theory of Everything.

There were also nods for Benedict Cumberbatch, (The Imitation Game), Michael Keaton (Birdman) and Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) in the leading actor category. They were joined by Steve Carell (Foxcatcher) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler). The supporting actress category was led by Patricia Arquette (Boyhood), Keira Knightley (The Imitation Game), Emma Stone (Birdman), awards season favourite Meryl Streep (Into the Woods), and Naomi Watts (St. Vincent). While in the male category for supporting actor the list was topped by veteran Robert Duvall (The Judge), Ethan Hawke (Boyhood), Oscar winner Edward Norton (Birdman), Mark Ruffalo (Foxcatcher), and J.K. Simmons (Whiplash) And the nominees are: The SAG Awards were announced by Eva Longoria and Ansel Elgort in LA on Wednesday . Early birds: The duo announced the nominations in the wee hours of Wednesday morning . Handsome presenters: Ansel and Eva posed for a photo after their announcements . And the nominees, as to be expected, were thrilled by the honour, with Keira Knightley tweeting: 'Thank you so much to the Screen Actors Guild. It's such an honor to be nominated by your peers and in the company of this group of talented women. I'm thrilled to celebrate this morning with Benedict [Cumberbatch] and the cast.' And Michael Keaton was keen on thanking his director upon hearing the news: 'As an actor being nominated by actors for playing an actor, I am truly, truly grateful for this honor. An ensemble like this hardly ever comes around, and all of us made this very unique film work - lead by our maestro, director Alejandro Inarritu.' While Jake Gyllenhaal gave a shout out to his big sister: 'I am even more happy for my sister who I think is extraordinary in the honorable woman and it would seem that SAG thinks so too. My sister's a bada**.' Double threat: Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are both nominated in the leading and supporting categories, respectively, for Birdman . First timer: Eddie Redmayne is up for leading actor for The Theory of Everything . But for Ethan Hawke it had even greater significance: 'I've been acting for 30 years now. So the SAG nomination is genuinely meaningful to me. Particularly this year, with the loss of Phil and Robin, our acting community is more important to me than ever.' The awards were announced on Wednesday by Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria and Ansel Elgort of The Fault In Our Stars. The Screen Actors Guild Awards will air next year on January 25, with the Oscars airing nearly a month later on February 22. Veteran: Ethan Hawke is nominated for best supporting actor for his work in Boyhood . Many of last year's SAG winners went on to claim Oscar gold, including Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club), Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine), Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years A Slave), and Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club). Nearly every major acting nod handed out at the SAG awards was a precursor for the Academy Awards in 2014 - making it one of the best predictors for how this year's race will go. The only category that did not match up was SAG's ensemble award which has no equivalent in the Oscars. SAG nominees are voted in by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites. Creepy turn earns him some accolades: Jake Gyllenhaal is nominated in the leading actor category for Nightcrawler . Back in the game: Patricia Arquette is up for supporting actress for her role in Boyhood . The voters are split in half, with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film. Following the polling process the full body of both SAG and AFTRA (Hollywood's acting unions) then decides upon the winners in each category. Among the big awards ceremonies, SAG is the first to announce their nominees, resulting in some major films not being included. Last year The Wolf Of Wall Street failed to send in their screeners on time for the selection process thereby excluding it from the awards ceremony. Stellar: Benedict Cumberbatch is another actor in the leading category for The Imitation Game . The year before Django Unchained ran into a similar problem and this year it is Selma (a civil rights drama starring Oprah Winfrey, Martin Sheen, and Tim Roth). Much like all of the major awards shows the categories honour actors for leading roles, supporting roles and ensembles (differing from the Oscars, which only celebrates solo performances). However, SAG is strictly a ceremony celebrating actors and actresses and does not recognize producers or directors. A dramatic turn: Steve Carell is nominated in the leading actor category for Foxcatcher . Seasoned: Robert Duvall, a previous winner of a SAG award, is up for best supporting actor for The Judge .","Benedict Cumberbatch, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michael Keaton up for Best Actor in film role .

"Top Gear, In the Night Garden and Doctor Who could all feature in a new £2billion theme park alongside characters from Star Trek and Mission: Impossible. The BBC has signed a deal to allow some of its programmes to feature in the new multi-billion pound resort in Kent. Plans are still being drafted for how the theme park will work, but BBC shows and characters could feature in specific lands, games and rides at the London Paramount Entertainment Resort. BBC shows such as Doctor Who could feature alongside the Daleks at a new £2bn theme park being built in north Kent after the broadcaster signed a deal with developers for its rights to be used around the park . London Resort Company Holdings (LRCH) - which is creating the £2billion park - has already signed a contract with Paramount Pictures, the oldest major Hollywood studio in existence, which could see elements from films including Mission: Impossible and The Godfather feature throughout the resort. Organisers said the deal with the BBC and Paramount will mean they can combine 'Hollywood glamour with British culture.' It will mean Captain Kirk, captain of the USS Starship Enterprise in Star Trek, could be seen at the park in rides themed around the science fiction classic. The latest deal with the BBC may mean that some of the corporation's biggest characters, such as Doctor Who and the Daleks may also feature. A brochure for the proposed theme park includes pictures of what it may look like which show some elements of Paramount classics - including a 'Mission Impossible control centre' and Star Trek emblems alongside a ride. The resort on the Swanscombe Peninsula in north Kent is scheduled to open in Easter 2020. Stephen Davies, director of live events at BBC Worldwide said: 'We're always looking for opportunities to extend fans' enjoyment of their favourite shows and the idea behind this resort is a really exciting way of celebrating the very special place the BBC has in British culture.' Doctor Who (left) could meet characters from Mission: Impossible and other Paramount films at the theme park . Daleks from Doctor Who (left) and the Star Trek Voyager (right) could feature at the new theme park in Kent . BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the broadcaster, has signed a deal with LRCH which will allow the company to use the rights for its programmes. In return profits from using these rights will be paid to BBC Worldwide and invested back into the broadcaster. It will work in a similar way to the CBeebies land at Alton Towers, which has an agreement with the BBC to use the intellectual rights of the property. David Testa, director of LRCH, said: 'The BBC has played an instrumental role in shaping the British entertainment industry for nearly a century, creating some of the most iconic and cherished characters on TV and radio. The resort which will feature a theme park, water park, cinema and large theatre is expected to open in 2020 . Plans for the resort appear to show a Star Trek themed land, with the emblem visible on one of the rides . Paramount had already designed a deal with developers and hints of its productions have been seen in the plans, with a Mission: Impossible training centre detailed in sketches and Star Trek emblems on rides . 'It seems only right therefore that it's programmes will be present at the new London Paramount Entertainment Resort, which will combine the glamour of Hollywood with the best of British culture.' Both the BBC and LRCH would not be drawn on which specific films or shows would feature, or if they would appear in lands or as specific rides. The theme park will also include a water park and 2,000 seat theatre alongside themed games and rides throughout. It hopes to attract 15 million visitors a year. The BBC has signed a development agreement with LRCH but said there were no firm plans in place as to which programmes would be featured and whether they would appear in lands or rides. Developers plan to build a huge £2billion Hollywood-inspired resort in Kent. Paramount Pictures had already given permission for its name to be used for the proposed development on the Swanscombe Peninsula. Developers hope the project – which would be built on the site of a former cement works near Dartford - will open in 2020. It would be located near Ebbsfleet International station, which is on the Eurostar route between London and Paris. The 872-acre site - nearly twice the size of the Olympic Park in Stratford - will feature Europe’s largest indoor water park, rollercoasters, cinemas, theatres, hotels and live music venues. The site's developer, London Resort Company Holdings, estimates that the project would create up to 27,000 jobs in the area. Announcing the plans in 2012, project leader Tony Sefton said: ‘Our vision is to create a world class entertainment destination, the first of its kind in the UK.' Paramount Pictures films include the Madagascar franchise (pictured). A similar entertainment resort is due to open Spain in 2012, which will feature a Titanic Experience and rides based on Mission Impossible, Star Trek and War of the Worlds. The latest agreement with the BBC means programmes such as Dr Who and Top Gear could feature in lands, rides and games across the new park.","New £2bn theme park featuring rides and a water park planned for Kent .

"Chloe King told an inquest her baby girl was mauled to death by a dog after she put her to bed, believing the dog was secured. Miss King, pictured leaving King George's Hall in Blackburn had fallen asleep . An 11-month-old baby was mauled to death by a nine stone dog while her mother slept downstairs, unaware that the animal had escaped from a room where it had been blocked in. Chloe King, 21, found Ava-Jayne Corless lying on a bed, with her body floppy and blood on her. Miss King had put her daughter to sleep in a bedroom of Lee Wright's house in Blackburn - her then boyfriend -  in Lancashire and had gone downstairs and fallen asleep on the sofa with him. She said when she fell asleep the dog had been secure in the kitchen. But it had got free and gone upstairs and attacked Ava. The child died of 'unsurvivable'  multiple injuries inflicted by the alleged pitbull terrier-type dog, which is a banned breed of the animal. At an inquest into her daughter's death Miss King told how she discovered her daughter's lifeless body when she woke up and went upstairs on February 10. She said: 'I walked into the bedroom. The landing light was on but the bedroom light was not. I remember seeing there was a dark stain about halfway down the bed. I noticed the dog was in the bedroom and I thought, what is it doing there. 'Ava was halfway down the bed. My initial thought was that I needed to pick her up. I knelt on the bed and picked her up. She still had a blanket on her. Ava was really floppy. 'I had only just woken up. At that point I had not realised blood was on her. I thought she was in a deep sleep. 'I laid Ava on the bed, kneeling over her, cuddling her, Ava made a grunting noise. I was giving her kisses, talking to her ... Lee was screaming ""is she all right?"" I got my phone and said I need an ambulance now. 'I turned the light on, I saw Ava pale, her lips were really white. I thought she was asleep for a split second. I then noticed drops of blood on the floor. 'I ran out in the hallway. I thought I was going to pass out. I felt sick and I collapsed on the floor. I thought I (had) woke up in a nightmare and it could not be happening.' Miss King said she believed the dog, called Snoop had been blocked in by a speaker and a golf bag stand in the kitchen when she put her daughter to bed that evening. In a statement read out to the court she said: 'I gave her [Ava] a kiss and told her that I loved her like I always did at night. 'I told her she was my dream girl and gave her another cuddle. I left the room about 8.45pm and went downstairs. We put a film on and I fell asleep. When I had fallen asleep the dog was in the kitchen.' Ava Jayne-Corless was mauled to death by the dog, Snoop, at the home of her mother's then boyfriend . The couple woke up at about 11pm and went upstairs where Miss King was initially baffled by the appearance of the dog in the bedroom. She said: 'I thought maybe the dog had been chewing a toy on the bed. 'I laid her (Ava) on the bed and started cuddling her. I was holding her close and she was making a grunting noise. 'I was giving her kisses and said ""you need to wake up now, come on.""' Only when she turned the light on did Miss King realise how badly injured her daughter was. She rang paramedics who tried to revive the child before they took her to the ambulance and to hospital. She died shortly afterwards at 11.53pm. Lee Wright, of Blackburn, owned the dog that mauled baby Ava-Jayne Corless to death . Miss King also rang her mother, Claire, and screamed down the phone: 'Ava's dead. The dog got her at Lee's.' Miss King, a student, was not allowed to go to hospital with her daughter at the time. 'I said I just wanted to die,' she told the inquest at King George's Hall in Blackburn. 'Why could not I have died? Why did the dog not attack me? I said I did not want to live either if Ava did not make it.' The inquest heard that the dog was usually kept away from Ava, but that night she had a 'nasty cough' and the bedroom door had been left open so Miss King could hear her if she woke up. In the statement she added: 'Ava had only been in contact with Snoop once or twice before. 'He was always in a separate room and never upstairs when Ava was there. 'I was always quite wary in case he stepped on her.' In tribute to her daughter, Miss King told the inquest: 'I'm devastated about what's happened. My baby has lost her life. 'It will stay with me for the rest of my life and I would have done anything to trade places with her. I don't understand why the dog attacked that night. 'She will always be my beautiful daughter and I shall treasure the memories.' After her daughter was taken to hospital Miss King was arrested on suspicion of child neglect and was taken to a police station in Blackburn where she was later informed her daughter had died that night. Both Miss King and Mr Wright were then held on suspicion of manslaughter before they were released on bail and told in April that no charges would be brought against them. Dr Philip Lumb, a forensic pathologist, said Ava died from the multiple injuries she suffered. This included a large wound on her neck with bruises and grazes covering her head, neck, chest and arms. The child also had a severely damaged rib cage and punctured lung. Miss King had been seeing Mr Wright for three to four months but they had only been together officially for ten days when the incident happened. Miss King said the dog was normally kept away from her baby girl and she believed it was secured in a room . They had met in September 2013 when Mr Wright was out walking his dog, known by neighbours as Killer. She said the dog had never bitten anyone before and she had never heard him bark, but instead he had normally greeted her by 'slathering kisses.' Miss King said her former boyfriend had described the dog as an American Bulldog and told her he had spent £4,000 prior to the attack fixing his broken leg. The nine stone animal had injured himself while fighting with Mr Wright’s other dog, a Japanese Akita called Wolfgang some months before. The court heard that Snoop had also killed a neighbour’s cat in March 2013. Mr Wright was said to be 'always paranoid' burglars were going to break into his house but denied to police that he owned the dog for protection. Miss King, pictured with Ava-Jayne, said she did not realise what had happened when she discovered her daughter upstairs in the room and realised her body was floppy and there was blood on her and the floor . Giving evidence, retired police officer Peter Talak, who now specialises in prohibited dog breeds, examined the dog the day after the incident and concluded that it did have 'substantial characteristics of a pitbull terrier type.' Police believe the dog is a pitbull terrier, which is on a list of dogs banned in the UK along with a Japanese Tosa and Figa Braziliero. However Mr Wright denies this and said the dog is an American bulldog. He has been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and his trial was postponed until the New Year because experts have been unable to identify the dog's breed. The inquest continues.

"Volunteers in the Operation Santa Program and the Alaska National Guard brought Christmas to the remote Inupiat Eskimo community of Shishmaref, on Alaska's western coast. But instead of a sled pulled by flying reindeer, Mr and Mrs Claus touched down on the snow-covered surface aboard a U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules jet. Children received toys, coats, school supplies and the rare treats of apples and oranges along with ice cream during the Saturday visit. Scroll down for video . Touch down: Santa and Mrs Claus get off a military transport plane in Shishmaref, Alaska . ''Cause everybody loves ice cream,' said Cheyenne Nayokpuk, a 17-year-old senior, when asked why anyone living 25 miles south of the Arctic Circle would want the cold treat. It's the 58th year for the program to bring a little holiday cheer to remote Alaska villages, where poverty is widespread. 'For some of these kids, if it weren't for the toys we're delivering, they might not get a toy or anything at Christmas,' said Maj. George Baker, divisional commander for the Salvation Army in Alaska. 'In many respects, some of these village areas are almost like Third World villages, and a lot people don't understand that,' he said. Aerial view: This photo taken December 6 shows a propeller from the cockpit of a C130 military transport plane flying over the Alaska Range . Remote: Here the community of Shishmaref, Alaska, can be seen . Greetings: Once they had touched down, Mr and Mrs Claus took gifts to around 300 children . Smile! This child is unsure of what to make of Santa as he sits on his lap . Your turn: Besides Shishmaref, the other village that received a visit this year was Newtok . 'You think we're living in the United States, but for a lot of these folks, this makes Christmas for them. Were it not for (Operation) Santa, they might not have anything.' Besides Shishmaref, the other village that received a visit this year was Newtok. Both are among Alaska's most eroded villages; both have plans to relocate, with Newtok further along in the process. The National Guard provided a C-130 transport plane to take the volunteers, including a Salvation Army band, and gifts to Shishmaref, located about 600 miles northwest of Anchorage or about 100 miles east from Russia, across the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea. 'There is a lot of need in Shishmaref,' said school Principal Ralph Watkins. 'Having access to just some of your basic things is an event.' He said it takes effort to get to Shishmaref. For anyone wanting to get there from the Lower 48, it would require first a flight to Anchorage, followed by another airplane ride to Nome, followed by a small-plane ride to Shishmaref. It's a big deal for someone to come in and bring gifts, he said. 'It's all the kids have been talking about for the last week,' he said. Cause for celebration: Children and adults line up for a visit with Santa and Mrs Claus in Shishmaref . Spreading the Christmas cheer: Volunteers prepared tables of donated books for children . Excitement: Some community members drove their snowmobiles to the airstrip to greet the arriving airplane and wave to Santa and Mrs. Claus as they got off. Express delivery: Christmas toys and other supplies get loaded from a C130 military transport plane onto sleds being pulled by snowmobiles . Tradition: The Alaska National Guard provided transport for the good Samaritan program Operation Santa, which took gifts and schools supplies to about 300 children in the Inupiat Eskimo community . Some community members drove their snowmobiles to the airstrip to greet the arriving airplane and wave to Santa and Mrs. Claus as they got off. The honored couple got a ride in a four-door pickup to the school for the big event, while other volunteers jumped in sleds and were pulled to town by snowmobiles. Before Santa and Mrs. Claus made their appearance, the children of Shishmaref welcomed the visitors with Alaska Native dances. Then Santa and Mrs. Claus came through a gym door to a standing ovation from those in the packed gym, including the estimated 300 children who would receive gifts. Santa then met with every child - some more willing than others - before the children went down a line to receive a gift, backpack, a book and then ice cream. Nellie Okpowruk, 18, was among the students standing in a long line to see Santa and Mrs. Claus. As for her gift, she had something specific on her wish list. 'I want a trip, a round-trip ticket to Oregon to see my cousin and her daughter,' she said with a giggle.","Volunteers brought Christmas to the remote Inupiat Eskimo community of Shishmaref, on Alaska's western coast .

"Warning: Prince Charles, pictured today, has warned that the world may be returning to 'the dark ages of public executions' because of groups like Islamic State . The Prince of Wales said today he is worried the world may be returning to 'the dark ages of public executions' and urged people not to share gruesome films made by extremist groups like Islamic State. Prince Charles also said that society has a 'duty of care' towards the families of those who are being executed on camera by terrorist groups in the Middle East in a speech to Iraqi Christians. Islamic State has beheaded 27 people on film this year, including three Americans, two Britons and 22 Syrians, and the royal called their killers blasphemers. Prince Charles spoke about the gruesome films  at a Catholic church service in Acton, west London as he also spoke about the persecution of Christians worldwide. He said: 'It seems to me that all faiths to some extent shine a light on the divine image in every human life. 'If that is so then surely to destroy another human being is to desecrate the image of the divine and to do so in the name of faith is nothing less than a blasphemy. 'We hear much at present about the duty of care,' he said. 'Then, ladies and gentlemen, I am bound to ask whether there is not a duty of care towards the victims of violence and their families who, like you, are daily distraught by the graphic transmission of violent images of their loved ones.' The church service at at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Acton was for Chaldean Christians, a denomination of the Catholic Church that includes many Iraqis and Syrians. There are approximately 4,000 Iraqi Chaldean Christians in the UK, and numbers have grown since the conflict with Iran in the 1980s. More recently Christians in Iraq have come under attack from Isis militants who are trying to create a pure Islamic state in the country, and many have been attacked and forced to leave their homes. Charles met Chaldean Catholics whose families are suffering because of persecution in Iraq. Welcome: Schoolchildren wave images of the heraldic cypher of Britain's Prince Charles, as he bends down to talk to some of them outside a Catholic church today . Greeting: The royal was met by Archbishop Habib of Basra, Iraq during a visit to Iraqi Christians in London . Maijida Nissan, 64, has a brother and sister who still live in Iraq. She has lived in the UK for 29 years and has worked as a nanny. Mrs Nissan thanked the prince for his work to draw attention to the plight of persecuted Christians, to which he responded with: 'It's the least I can do.' She also said she was praying, and he replied: 'We all do.' Afterwards she said: 'I am very happy that he came here, and thanks to God that he came here. God brings him here.' Mrs Nissan's brother's house in Baghdad has been bombed twice, and he now lives with his family in a church in Erbil. She said that his daughter, Meena, 11, had asked her to speak to the royal family to tell them about her family's plight. Another churchgoer, Dr Samad Toma, 37, a clinical scientist, has a sister who was forced to leave her home city of Mosul with her four children when Isis captured the city in June this year. He said: 'There was 20 hours of no connection with them. It was really frightening, but they managed to go to the Kurdish area. 'You lose all your history, you lose your childhood memories, you lose everything. Your connections, even your friends. I have some friends who have been killed just because they refuse to obey Isis rule. You lose your roots. 'I wish one day I might go there, show my children where their father has been raised, where their mother has been raised. Where we used to go to school and where we used to have fun, but everything has now changed. 'Whenever I tell my daughters about Iraq, all they can see is killing. I think they would refuse to go there now, because they would be frightened.' Generous: The heir to throne was also presented with gifts by Archbishop Habib . In his speech to the congregation Charles said he felt strongly about the plight of persecuted Christians. 'I have been deeply distressed by the horrific scenes of violence and persecution coming out of your beloved Iraq. 'I know that many of those who have been killed or forced to flee are members of your own families. 'The pain and grief must be quite unimaginable as you see them persecuted because of their faith.' He finished his speech by saying: 'You can have no idea how much I feel for those who as I speak are suffering for their faith in such terrible circumstances.' The prince also met Neville Kyrke-Smith, national director of Aid To The Church In Need, who support persecuted Christians worldwide, telling him: 'You're doing a fantastic job.' Last month Charles released a video message to introduce the charity's report about religious freedom, and in September he made a donation through the charity to support Iraqi Christians. Archbishop of Basra Habib Jajou had come from Iraq to meet the prince. He said: 'We have to express our thanksgiving to him for the solidarity he has shown for our situation.'","Prince Charles  urged people not to share gruesome Islamic State videos .

"Staff and pupils at a private school are in mourning after two schoolgirls died after their car was involved in a crash with a bus. Anna Haefeli, 18, and 17-year-old Anastasia Besedovskaya were killed when the Peugeot 206 they were in was involved in a collision with the vehicle in Tickencote, Rutland. The pair attended the nearby independent Oakham School, where annual fees are £30,000. It is thought they were international boarders at the school, which dates back to 1584 and counts England one-day cricket captain Stuart Broad among its ex-pupils. Several school events were cancelled as a mark of respect, and flags were flown at half-mast. Loss: School pupils Anastasia Besedovskaya (left), 17, and 18-year-old Anna Haefeli (right), who died on Friday when their car was involved in an accident with a bus in Tickencote, Rutland . An investigation is now underway into the cause of the crash, which took place on a country lane at around 1.25pm on Friday. Heartbroken friends of Anna and Anastasia, who were the only occupants of the car and were pronounced dead at the scene, paid tribute to them online. Pip Lashbrook posted a collage of photos of herself and Anna on Instagram. She wrote: 'Anna, you are truly one of the funniest, kindest, loving and craziest people I have met. 'I have the best memories with you and I will never ever forget them. 'I will always love you with all my heart and I will never ever forgot you. Thank you for just being you babe. Love you loads my angel. The pair attended the nearby independent Oakham School, where annual fees are £30,000. It is thought they were international boarders at the school, which dates back to 1584 . The car was travelling along Empingham Lane towards Empingham and the bus was travelling in the opposite direction towards Tickencote when the collision occurred . 'Yesterday we lost two fantastic girls far to early and they will both be missed massively. 'RIP Anna and Anastasia. God has gained two beautiful angels.' Another Instagram user, Alina Kicheava, posted a picture of the two girls, with the message: 'Dear Anna and Anastasia, Oakham will never be the same without you two. I don't know how to describe my feeling. 'I will always remember you two as the happiest and nicest girls in this school which could have made others smile at any time.' And Hattie Merriman posted on the photo-sharing site: 'My beautifuls. You will be missed eternally. 'You were both the sweetest most caring people.' A spokesman for Oakham School said it was an 'incredibly sad time', adding: 'Understandably, the school community is extremely upset by the tragic loss of two such wonderful young adults.' The driver of the bus and eight passengers suffered superficial injuries in the incident. Detective Constable Pete Davies, of the East Midlands Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'The car was travelling along Empingham Lane towards Empingham and the bus was travelling in the opposite direction towards Tickencote when the collision occurred. 'We would like to speak to anyone who may have witnessed the collision or saw either vehicle beforehand to contact us.' The road was closed for several hours while the emergency services dealt with the aftermath of the crash.","Anna Haefeli, 18, and 17-year-old Anastasia Besedovskaya died in crash .

"The future of 25 Australian babies born to  parents who are asylum seekers is uncertain after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison retrospectively changed the legal status of some children born in detention. Born in Australia from the 19 July 2013, the infants - who range from the age of one to just a few months old - are currently in detention centres in the country, where their families anxiously await their fate. Legislation passed by the government in parliament on Tuesday morning means the babies are now defined as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals (UMAs) because their asylum seeker parents arrived in Australia by boat. The babies' lawyer Katie Robertson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Falling pregnant was the catalyst for many of these women to come to Australia... it was the final straw, they didn't want to impose what they'd suffered on their child.' Scroll down for video . The future of 25 babies born in Australia to asylum seeker mothers is uncertain after a change in legislation . Lawyer Katie Robertson, who is representing the families on behalf of Maurice Blackburn’s social justice department, had been fighting for the right to apply for visas for the babies . The mothers of the babies, all classed to have high-risk pregnancies, gave birth in Australian immigration detention - watched over by security guards - because the medical conditions on the tiny Pacific Island of Nauru where they were originally being held were so poor. Ms Robertson, who is representing the families on behalf of Maurice Blackburn’s social justice department, had been fighting for the right to apply for visas for the babies. However, a change to the Bill announced by Mr Morrison on Tuesday means the babies now have little chance of being allowed to stay in the country in which they were born. Ms Robertson said: 'These babies are born to the most vulnerable parents. 'The babies have never had a free day in their life... It’s so arbitrary and cruel'. Speaking to New Matilda Ms Robertson also said: 'Clearly Morrison and his department agreed we had a good argument because they've now amended the law.’ Eight of the 25 babies are born to parents from Myanmar. Because of their Rohingya heritage the government does not recognise them as citizens. They could be sent to Nauru detention centre in a matter of days due to Immigration Minister Scott Morrison's retrospective change . One of the babies fighting to stay in Australia is a one-year-old Rohingya baby called Ferouz, who was born in Brisbane. He is now being sent to live on Nauru until his future is decided. Ferouz was born prematurely in Australia after his mother was classed as a high-risk pregnancy. Ms Robertson said the families are ‘beside themselves with anxiety’. The legislation means put forward by Scott Morrison (pictured) the babies are now defined as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals (UMAs) 'One woman grew up in an refugee camp in Africa from the age of three. She came to Australia when she was pregnant and spent time in Nauru,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'She says she is tough but she does not want her child to go there as it is no place for children. 'If you can put yourself in their situation these families have fled persecution. They have been returned to Australia because they are the most vulnerable cases.' The changes came as part of a deal Mr Morrison made. He argued that if the government would pass the Bill he would allow 108 children currently being held on Christmas Island with their parents to be granted Temporary Protection Visas rather than be deported to Nauru. Ms Robertson has a clear message for Mr Morrison, calling him out on the promise he broke when he vowed to allow children of asylum seekers to live in the community. 'We are calling on him to be true to his word. He made a clear promise that children in detention would be released into the community,' she said. 'We are not saying they should be able to stay, we are saying they should go through the same application process. If they are not found to be refugees, fair enough.’ Maurice Blackburn Senior Associate Murray Watt said: ‘Minister Morrison claims that his bill will release children from detention, when in fact it will do just the opposite. ‘While some children may be released and may become eligible to apply for Temporary Protection Visas, the bill also condemns 25 Australian-born babies to removal to Nauru. ‘Buried in the bill are amendments that retrospectively deem these babies to have come from Nauru, when they were born here and have never left Australia.’ The infants are now being classed as Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals despite being born in Australia. This is the ID card of one of the babies . They could be sent to Nauru detention centre as early as Wednesday . Mr Blackburn added: ‘We are urgently calling on Scott Morrison to amend his bill and let these babies stay in Australia – they were born in Australia and have spent their entire lives here, yet because their mothers spent time previously on Nauru they will now be taken away. ‘That is grossly unfair, and it is not the Australian way. 'We also appeal to Senator Ricky Muir, who holds the deciding vote, to stand up for these Aussie kids and amend this bill. ‘Senator Muir has kids of his own, and I can’t imagine he would want to see other kids born in our country locked up indefinitely on Nauru.’ Ms Robertson argues the children have never left Australia and should at least have the right to apply to stay . In response to the 25 babies' imminent deportation, Christian Leaders around Australia held nationwide prayer sit-ins in seven MP's offices in six cities: Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide. More than 50 church-goers were spread protested in Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's Perth office as well as Mr Morrison's office on Wednesday. On Friday, Guardian Australia published photos from inside the family and single adult women camp - Regional Processing Centre 3 (RPC3) – were the women would have lived. Christian action group Love Makes A Way organised a sit-in at Scott Morrison's office . Church-goers also visited Julie Bishop's office in Perth . The distressing images showed young children playing in dirt, covering from the sun under cardboard boxes, and clothes hanging on fences. There have long been concerns over the way asylum seekers are treated at Nauru and in October the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) visited RPC3 and expressed concerns that facilities there were in violation of international human rights laws . In November 2013, a UNHCR report ruled the education room at the centre was ‘too hot for the children to remain in it for any length of time’ and highlighted ‘deteriorating mental health’ of children held there. Members of the media are currently denied access to the detention centre on Nauru where there are already 106 asylum seeker children detained. The UNHCR recommended the government should ‘cease to transfer children and their families to Nauru under current conditions’. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Immigration Minister Scott Morrison for comment. Many reports have slammed the conditions of the facilities saying they are no place for children or families .","The 25 babies were born in Australia from 19 July 2013 .

"As the wedding vows say, they agree to build a life together ‘for richer, for poorer’. But just how rich or poor seems to be a secret among couples – with women the worse offenders for keeping their partners in the dark. A report reveals that one in ten people fail to tell their loved ones about all of their savings, while 63 per cent of couples’ savings are kept in separate bank accounts. Stash: One in ten people hide money from their partners - and women are the worst culprits, a survey found . The average hidden stash is around £1,300 – an increase of 9 per cent since last year – meaning that Britons are furtively hoarding some £3billion all together. And, according to the research by Lloyds Bank, one in eight women admitted concealing money from their partner, compared with one in ten men. The typical female had a stash of £1,400, while men’s hidden savings were around £1,100. Men were also more likely to exaggerate their savings than women, with 5 per cent telling partners they had more put away than they did. The research also found that among those who shared a joint savings accounts, one in ten said their other half would not have to ask before dipping in – but the limit to take without permission was £286. Philip Robinson from Lloyds Bank said: ‘The number of couples keeping savings secret is on the rise with the UK’s hidden savings pot growing to just over £3billion. ‘However it is worth considering pooling funds between partners as combined savings could provide greater returns on interest.’ The survey of 2,000 adults also found a marked contrast in how different generations approached their banking. Younger couples were more likely to have independent accounts, with 82 per cent of under-25s saving separately – up from 80 per cent in 2013. This compares to just half of couples who are over 55. The Lloyds spokesman said they did not know why more people were keeping their savings separate – or even secret – as the economy started to improve. However Anna Bowes, from the Savings Champion website, said many couples save independently to ensure they are both entitled to an ISA account – in which they can each put £15,000 a year. A separate report yesterday found savings among the over-55s had risen by £10,000 in the last three years. The research by Aviva insurance also found that average mortgage debt among older people has fallen to £59,000, compared with £64,000 in 2011.","Hoarders revealed in a study of 2,000 adults' habits by Lloyds Bank .

"A 'highly decorated' soldier used compensation he received from the army to set up an illegal payday loans business and threatened junior comrades with punishment duty if they failed to pay him back, a court has heard. Afghanistan veteran Lance Corporal Charles Trouliotis is accused of handing out £31,000 worth of loans to more than 30 subordinate soldiers in the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, charging them 40 per cent interest. The 25-year-old is said to have bankrolled his money-lending business after receiving a cash settlement from the army compensation fund due to an injury sustained playing football. Lance Corporal Charlie Trouliotis, left, pictured leaving Woolwich Crown Court yesterday. He is accused of running an illegal payday loans business while serving in the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment. Corporal David Crouch (right) is accused of helping him run the business. He has admitted lending money to fellow soldiers and family members but insists he did not charge interest and only made a profit because people paid him gifts as a thank you. Trouliotis is on trial at Woolwich Crown Court alongside his best friend in the regiment Corporal David Couch, 28, of The Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, south east London, who is accused of helping him run the enterprise. Stuart Jessop, prosecuting, told the court that father-of-one Trouliotis charged interest rates of up to 40 per cent on loans to his fellow soldiers. Mr Jessop said that he used his senior rank to bully and threaten his subordinates to pay back 'exorbitant' amounts of interest. He explained: 'There’s no doubt that you were a first class soldier and a brave soldier. You were highly decorated. 'But you were running an illegal money lending business for profit. 'You used the fact that you were respected and well liked to help you with this money lending business.' One private gave evidence to say that an initial loan of £400 spiralled into a £1,800 debt and he was threatened with punishment duty if he failed to pay. Mr Jessop added: 'He was struggling to pay you back because you were charging exorbitant interest. 'You would say ""where’s my f***ing money you will go on standby if you don’t pay this money.”' The two men are said to have operated an unlicensed credit business at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich (pictured) Standby is an army punishment where superiors order someone to do unwanted jobs. But Trouliotis insisted he was just helping out his colleagues. He said: 'They are my friends. That’s what you do for friends. You help them out.' Trouliotis also told the court how he gave money to around 30 people in his regiment, mostly lower-ranking soldiers, but some were full corporals senior to him. He added: 'Over half of those I lent money to offered more money back. 'If they were happy to pay a little extra I would say thank you very much.' But Mr Jessop said that texts from Trouliotis to his debtors showed there was an 'awful lot of palaver and aggravation' chasing them for money. Trouliotis is also accused of profiting off money lent to his family, including a cousin called Little Roy. A text message, from Trouliotis to his wife, said: 'If Little Roy doesn’t pay me by Friday I’m going to his house this weekend and I’m going to smash him in.' But the soldier, of Victoria, London, told the court: 'I would never hurt anyone. It’s not in my nature.' Trouliotis also told the court he would lend Couch money because the superior non-commissioned officer would often be skint because he was addicted to gambling. But the prosecution said that Couch also delivered loans on behalf of Trouliotis and texts between them showed they were working together to get repayments. After a private who allegedly owed money to Trouliotis complained to a senior officer, Trouliotis texted Couch: 'If he grasses again, me and you could be goners.' The court was also told that Trouliotis had nine bank accounts which he regularly moved money between and he also transferred more than £3,400 to his co-defendant Couch. Barrister Mr Jessop asked: 'Does it reflect the fact you were operating together and were lending?' The two men, who both deny running an unlicensed credit firm and money laundering are currently on trial at Woolwich Crown Court, pictured . Trouliotis denied the accusation, but admitted having nine different bank accounts which he regularly shuffled funds between. He claimed one was an old account, but the other eight were due to a hard-pushing bank sales manager. The former soldier said: 'When I was in the bank, the advisor doing his job tried to sell the other accounts to me. And I thought 'why not?'"" One was a shared account with a friend. Trouliotis added: 'We had a dream of buying a house together but we worked out we couldn't really afford it. It was a silly drunken conversation. Texts were also read to the jury sent from Trouliotis' phone to the co-accused Couch. It read: ""You realise the palaver you have caused us with your shit money lending skills.' But when asked if he sent the text, he said: 'I never sent the message.' Mr Jessop questioned Trouliotis about his finances, because in the 18 months he is accused of running the lending business, he was paid £30,000 in wages, yet spent more than £46,000 in direct debits and standing orders - and withdrew more than £14,000 in cash. Trouliotis said: 'I had an £18,000 compensation claim and worked for my uncle as well. 'I was getting married and if I was to buy something, the wedding dress for example, I would be reimbursed.' Trouliotis, who is no longer a soldier, was arrested in an early morning raid at his home in May. Both men, who appeared before the judge in navy and yellow regimental ties, deny two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one count of money laundering between January 2012 and May 2013. They also deny one count of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property, and a money laundering offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The trial continues.

"Drivers are being ripped off by a postcode pumps lottery with 10p gaps between nearby garages, motoring groups have said - even as the Prime Minister warned retailers to pass on tumbling oil costs. David Cameron's remarks came after experts predicted the price of crude oil would continue to fall, having already dropped 40 per cent over the past six months. Today average petrol prices dropped to 119.4p a litre, falling below 120p for the first time in four years. But as these photographs show, it depends where motorists choose to shop. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Petrol prices hit 120p a litre today - but as these photos show, it still depends where you shop. Esso in Gravesend, Kent, charged 114.9p (left) while Shell at London's M1 services charged 127.9p . Eye-watering: The Chelsea Cloisters service station in Sloane Avenue, one of London's most expensive streets, was charging 179p a litre for unleaded today. In the past experts have blamed the road's high rents . A Shell garage at the M1 motorway services in Edgware, north London, was charging 127.9p a litre for unleaded today - while just seven miles away in Finchley, a BP garage was charging 119.9p. Just outside the capital in Gravesend, Kent, an Esso garage was charging 114.9p a litre for unleaded - almost matching the 114.7p-a-litre nationwide cap set by Asda today. LONDON . Asda (various locations): 114.7p . BP (Finchley Road, north London): 119.9p . Shell (Gateway Services, M1): 127.9p . Chelsea Cloisters (Sloane Avenue): 179p . BIRMINGHAM . Asda (various locations): 114.7p . Texaco (Watery Lane, city centre): 119p . Esso (Frankley Services, M5): 129.9p . MANCHESTER . Asda (various locations): 114.7p . BP (Stockport Road, Cheadle): 119.9p . Texaco (Manchester Airport): 121.9p . CARDIFF . Asda (various locations): 114.7p . M&S Johnson (Dinas Powys): 124.9p . Shell (Cardiff Gate services, M4): 124.9p . BRISTOL . Asda (various locations): 114.7p . Esso (Hartcliffe Way, Bedminster): 120.9p . Shell (Gordano services, M5): 127.9p . Asda has been leading the way with cuts – copied by its rivals – and the AA said motorists were paying more in districts without a branch of the supermarket chain. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘It is a postcode lottery rip-off of winners and losers. ‘London and Aylesbury have some maverick independents and non-supermarkets who are undercutting even Asda which is usually the price-cut leader. ‘Asda then lowers prices nationally and the other supermarkets follow to match them in towns where there is an Asda. But where there isn’t an Asda, price falls take longer to arrive.’ Despite the competition, it seemed some in London have been largely untouched by falling prices. At the Chelsea Cloisters petrol station in Sloane Avenue, Chelsea - one of London's most expensive streets - unleaded fuel cost an eye-watering 179p a litre today, a representative told MailOnline. The petrol station appears to be an exceptional case. It has made headlines for its huge prices in the past and experts have blamed the enormous rent its owner has to pay. A staff member confirmed the cost to MailOnline twice - then said any concerns should be raised with the manager. But the pattern of varying prices was repeated across Britain. MailOnline looked at five cities today and easily found petrol prices varying by between 7p and 15p a litre. Among the more expensive were motorway service stations. In Bristol, a Shell garage off the M5 just outside the city was charging 127.9p a litre - 13.2p more than the Asda petrol stations within the city. In Birmingham, the Esso garage at Frankley Services on the M5 charged 15.2p more than Asda supermarkets inside the city. A Shell spokesman said it did not operate the garage pictured so had no control over the price, adding: 'Prices at motorway sites are influenced by a number of factors, including rents typically being higher than at other forecourts, and increased maintenance costs due to increased traffic volumes, especially HGVs.' Independent firms also lose out, however. Independent garage M&S Johnson, near Cardiff, was charging 10.2p more today than an Asda superstore less than three miles away. According to price comparison site petrolprices.com, whose figures were compiled yesterday, there was a variation of 34.2p a litre in Leeds, 25p in Greater London, 14.2p in Manchester and 9.2p in Edinburgh - though the most overpriced garages were not revealed. Price: Petrol costs 120p a litre on average across the UK, matched by this garage in Finchley, north London . Competition in Essex was particularly fierce, and the motorists using an Esso station in Ongar were paying only 112.9p a litre for unleaded. The RAC predicts prices will drop by at least 8p a litre for unleaded and by 6p a litre for diesel over the next fortnight. It found a number of 16p-a-litre differences between garages in the same area. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘The price we pay at the pump is more likely to be affected by local retail dynamics than it is by distribution costs which are something of a red herring. 'Price tends to be driven by the presence of supermarkets keen to compete on price or an independent forecourt retailer determined to offer the cheapest fuel. ‘If a town doesn’t have either of these, it can lead to motorists paying several pence a litre more than a neighbouring town just a few miles away.’ Supermarket chains have been criticised by the main petrol firms in the past for selling fuel as a 'loss leader' due to relentless competition. But despite the commercial tension there was variation too today among the big-name supermarkets, which have pushed down prices the hardest in a bid to retain trade. Asda clinched most of the cheapest prices, setting a cap of 114.7p a litre for unleaded across the country today - while most supermarket chains varied from branch to branch. The average price at Morrisons was more than 2p higher than Asda at 116.9p a litre, though it is due to drop another 1p tomorrow morning. Falling prices: Petrol prices have hit a four-year low, but the prices of crude oil have fallen much faster . At the 800 of 1,000 Shell-branded sites which Shell operates, the average unleaded price was 119.0p. Other retailers, including Tesco and Esso, refused to tell MailOnline average pump prices for commercial reasons. However, Tesco cut prices at all 500 of its filling stations by 1p a litre today. David Cameron this morning warned forecourts that he was keeping 'a close and watchful eye' to see if they will pass on falling oil prices to motorists. 'We need to be clear to the industry that we’re keeping a close eye on this issue in terms of forecourt pricing,' his spokesman said. 'The Government is going to keep a close and watchful eye on that sector.' It came after Kevin Daly, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, described the recent slump in oil prices as a ‘significant stimulus’ to the economy which would benefit families around the country. Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Daly predicted the price of unleaded petrol could fall another 15p to between £1.05 and £1.10 a litre. Unleaded petrol prices fell to an average of 122.9p a litre last month and have dropped closer to 120p a litre since then, according to the AA. With wages stagnant, Mr Daly told the Treasury Committee that ‘the men and women of Britain will really notice things such as the sharp decline in oil prices.’ The value of Brent crude has tumbled 40pc since the June high of $115 a barrel as production in the US has surged while demand from faltering economies in the eurozone and China has fallen. Oil prices have dropped to a five year low of just under $66 a barrel this week and rose to $66.4 yesterday. Yet retailers - who have been criticised for not passing on enough of the savings to motorists - insist they are not to blame for persistently high prices. David Cameron warned petrol companies he would 'keep an eye' on them . A spokesman for BP told MailOnline: 'Prices aren't related to the crude oil price - they're much more related to the cost of petrol and diesel which are sold as commodities in their own right. 'So there are all sorts of factors including exchange rates, and then of course you've got duty and VAT on top of everything. We aim to be as competitive as possible.' RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams, however, maintained retailers should use the drop in costs to give the 'Christmas present motorists have been waiting for' at the pumps. 'The wholesale prices of both petrol and diesel have reduced dramatically in recent weeks, so much so that there is room for petrol prices to come down by over 8p a litre and diesel by over 6p a litre in the next fortnight,' he said. 'We are hopeful motorists will see average petrol prices under 112p a litre, something they will not have seen since February 2010. If this happens the cheapest retailers will no doubt be selling petrol for well under 110p a litre, perhaps even lower.' Prime Minister David Cameron, chancellor George Osborne and the Bank of England governor Mark Carney have all warned of the threat posed to the UK recovery by problems in the global economy. But Mr Daly said he was ‘relatively optimistic’, adding: . ‘My own view is that people respond more to pounds and pence in their pockets rather than politicians warning about dangers lurking abroad.’ Figures released yesterday showed the UK economy is still growing at a steady pace, despite a surprise decline in manufacturing. Latest forecasts from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggest the economy grew 0.7pc in the three months to November, unchanged from GDP of 0.7 per cent in the three months to October. But manufacturing contracted 0.7 per cent between September and October.","Garages across the country still show huge variations in petrol prices .

"For nearly half a century, it has been the nerve-centre of some of the country’s most high profile police investigations – including the IRA’s mainland bombing campaign in the 1970s, the disappearance of Lord Lucan and the July 2005 terror attacks. With its famous revolving sign outside, New Scotland Yard has also become one of London’s most iconic buildings, a popular destination on the tourist trail and served as a backdrop to thousands of TV crime reports. But not for much longer, after it was announced today today that the office block has been sold to an investment company in Abu Dhabi for £370million as part of a radical cost-cutting plan which will see the new HQ located in a much smaller building a few miles away. The current HQ – known to many in the police simply as ‘The Yard’ - has been home to the Met since 1967 and today it is surrounded by concrete barriers to protect it from terrorist attack. But as these pictures from 47 years ago show, things were very different when the building was opened. An officer holding a metal food tray lines up for his lunch at New Scotland Yard's self service canteen in 1967 . Pictured is the dining area of the canteen, where police officers and other staff members can be seen drinking tea and coffee . The selective vertical document conveyor (left) carried files between floors, while right, dozens of people work the phone lines in New Scotland Yard's information room . Officers work in New Scotland Yard's state-of-the-art automatic teleprinter exchange room in 1967. At the time, teleprinters were used to send typed communications . There were no need for bomb-proof barricades outside to protect police from enemy attack, no need for armed officers to patrol the perimeter of the building, let alone the deployment of dozens of CCTV cameras. Members of the public could simply walk into New Scotland Yard off the street, with no need to go through airport style security to reach the reception area. In the Z-Cars, Dixon of Dock Green era, things were radically different inside, too. With their starched blue shirts and short back and sides haircuts, the officers of 1967 seem a world away from the image of the modern day copper. It was a time when Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs was on the run from Wandsworth Prison; the Kray twins were running amok in the East End; and the Met was still mourning the murder of three officers gunned down by career criminal Harry Roberts in Shepherd's Bush the previous year. Seatbelts had just been introduced to cars; in July, the police breathalyser arrived. In September, a 'new style' uniform was unveiled for female officers. Staff pictured as they painstakingly file hard-copy criminal records during the arduous move to their new headquarters in 1967 . Pictured is the briefing room - a university-style lecture hall where officers would detail their tactical plans prior to raids . As they stored paper files, examined a giant map of London in the map room, and answered calls via a rudimentary switchboard, surely none of these officers could ever have imagined how 47 years later, officers would be bogged down by multi-million pound computer databases and call centres, target-obsessed politicians and politically correct diversity units. Indeed the first police computer had been installed only four years earlier: its purpose was to manage the payroll and statistics, rather than track criminals. The Met plans to move its head office to a smaller former police station which has been empty for the last three years. The Curtis Green site on Victoria Embankment along the River Thames will become the force's head office in 2016 and will be known simply as Scotland Yard. The relocation is designed to help the force save six million pounds a year in running costs and avoid the £50million expense needed to refurbish the current head office, it said. Left, a staff member is briefed by a superior while working in the telecommunications room. Right, two officers are pictured filing criminal records . A group of men move a filing cabinet full of criminal records into the new building during the force's move  in 1967 . Curtis Green will have desk space for 1,000 officers, less than half the number in the current building, using mobile technology to enable officers to work more flexibly. The revolving triangle will be moved to the new site. Originally bought from Land Securities in 2008 for £123million, the current New Scotland Yard building was marketed as ‘Ten Broadway’ and had a guide price of £250million - well above initial estimates of £150million, thanks to soaring London property prices. The HQ of the Met has moved before – from Whitehall Place to Great Scotland Yard in 1875, to the Norman Shaw building in 1890 and to the current building in 1967. This future move therefore marks a return to nearer its founding location, the force says. London Mayor Boris Johnson said the Met needs a home fit for the future, but police budgets are under real pressure. This section of the telecommunications department handled the switchboards for staff phone lines . A woman places identifying marks on a huge wall size map of London, in a section of New Scotland Yard known as the map room .

The Metropolitan Police has sold its home since 1967, pictured left, for £370 million to Abu Dhabi investors. The iconic revolving sign, right, which has now become a tourist attraction, will move to the new building in 2016 . He said today: ‘The sale of this under-used and outdated building means we can now not only protect that rich heritage, but also fund the new HQ and kit out bobbies with the latest mobile technology to secure the future of the force. ‘This landmark deal allows us to preserve the past whilst giving today's Met a vital cash boost so our officers can go on keeping London safe.’ But it is not only traditionalists who are mourning the imminent closure of News Scotland Yard. Pub landlords in the vicinity of the current HQ – where pubs popular with thirsty officers include The Old Star, the Feathers and the Buckingham Arms - are expecting a significant drop in takings when the Met moves home.","Photos from Met Police move in 1967 provide fascinating insight how force operated prior to the digital revolution .

"The Israeli military committed war crimes during the final days of its war against Gaza this summer, according to Amnesty International. The destruction of four multi-storey buildings during the last four days of the 50-day conflict was carried out 'deliberately and with no justification', officials said. The human rights organisation said the bombings amounted to 'a collective punishment against the people of Gaza' designed to destroy livelihoods, rather than take out military targets. Scroll down for video . Amnesty has said the Israeli military committed war crimes during the last four days of its war against Hamas this summer when it destroyed four multi-storey buildings including the Italian Complex in Gaza City (above) Israeli warplanes also dropped large bombs on the 12-storey Zafer 4 Tower (above), said the Amnesty report . Amnesty is now calling for a team to be allowed into the country to investigate the alleged crimes, and says the perpetrators should be brought before a court. More than 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed in the war between Israel and Hamas-led militants, which ended on August 26. Another 11,000 were injured. On the Israeli side 73 people were killed, 67 of them soldiers. One of the buildings destroyed was the Municipal Commercial Centre in Rafah, which contained a shopping mall, a medical clinic and offices. All told, the businesses inside provided livelihoods for hundreds of Palestinian people. Residents were warned an attack was about to take place by telephone calls and 'knock on the roof' missiles - a small bomb dropped on the top of a building in advance of a larger warhead. However, the report said people were not given enough time to clear important belongings out. When the attack came, the blast was large enough to destroy the entire building along with neighbouring homes, injuring dozens of people. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther, said Israel had a responsibility to chose a method of attack that would minimise civilian casualties. He added: 'The Israeli army have previously conducted air strikes on specific apartments in high-rise buildings without their complete destruction.' Israeli authorities tried to justify the attack by saying that one building housed a command centre of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, and that another had 'facilities linked to Palestinian militants'. Israeli warplanes also dropped large bombs on the 12-storey Zafer 4 Tower, the 16-storey Italian Complex and the 13-storey al-Basha Tower in Gaza City. The Israeli military committed war crimes during the last four days of its war against Hamas this summer when it destroyed four multi-storey buildings using large bombs, according to Amnesty (file image) The blasts at the high-rises were so large they damaged surrounding buildings and injured dozens. Amnesty said Israel has weapons that allow it to target specific parts of a building, but did not use them . Amnesty said that it asked Israel to list the justifications for carrying out each separate attack, but that officials failed to provide an adequate response. According to the BBC, the Israeli embassy in London accused the report of ignoring Hamas' use of the buildings for military purposes, and made unfounded allegations. Diplomats said Amnesty should be investigating Palestinian rockets launched at their civilians. Jerusalem has refused to cooperate with a United Nations inquiry into possible war crimes during the conflict, accusing it of bias. The Israeli army has launched a series of criminal investigations into incidents in the war, including the shelling of a UN school that medics said killed at least 15 people and the bombing of a beach where four children died. Critics, however, have said that the investigations by Israel will not be independent.","Airstrikes on four large buildings constitutes war crimes, say Amnesty .

"This is the eerie photo a 25-year-old British tourist posted days before he slipped from the 90-metre cliff pictured below him. Gareth Jones, a well-known BASE jumper, fell to his death after climbing over a fence at North Head on Sydney's northern beaches at about 6.45am on Sunday morning. On his Instagram page just two days before his death, Mr Jones posted a photo of his feet dangling from the same cliff at North Head with the caption: 'Another day another happy place'. Scroll down for video . This is the eerie photo  British tourist Gareth Jones, 25, posted days before he slipped from the 90-metre cliff (pictured) at North Head on Sydney's northern beaches . Gareth Jones, a well-known BASE jumper, fell to his death after climbing over a fence at North Head on Sydney's northern beaches at about 6.45am on Sunday . Police investigating his death don't believe he was thrill-seeking at the time. Instead, he and friends had walked to the edge of the cliff to watch the sunrise. Mr Jones is believed to have slipped before plummeting to his death. Only a few months before his tragic death, the extreme sportsman - whose Facebook displays footage from a variety of his international jumps - leapt from the top of the Menara Tower in Kuala Lumpar. 'Survived KL with an amazing crew of people! What an epic adventure that was,' Mr Jones had written of the event. Other photos show the adventure-thirsty tourist jumping into canyons in Australia in the months leading up to his death. Tributes have poured in for Mr Jones since his death and a number of his friends have taken to social media to pay their respects to a 'beautiful soul' and 'proper mate', many writing: 'fly free'. The 25-year-old's Facebook page displays footage from dozens of BASE jumps that Mr Jones had completed all over the world . The most recent photographs show him jumping from canyons in Australia and from the Menara Tower in Kuala Lumpar . A number of Mr Jones's friends have taken to social media to pay respect to a 'beautiful soul' and 'proper mate', many writing: 'fly free' None of the messages were as poignant as the tribute posted by Echo Giesel Widmer, who described the 25-year-old as 'wild child' who 'wanted to be free'. 'He was loud the day I met him, and he was loud the last day I hugged him and squeezed him before saying goodbye. He was never boring, he always challenged the norm. He made every moment more fun, and exciting. He pulled everyone out of their comfort zones and just let go,' Ms Widmer wrote. 'Ironically he told me and some others a week ago that when he died, he'd be p***** if his friends had a funeral and cried for him. He said he wanted to have a Viking Funeral and he wanted his friends to send him out to sea on a burning ship while celebrating and partying in the moonlight. Gareth wasn't afraid of what the future may bring, he just wanted to live.' None of the messages were as poignant as this tribute posted by Echo Giesel Widmer, who described the 25-year-old as 'wild child' who 'wanted to be free' Four 'distressed' witnesses, believed to be Mr Jones' friends, are being interviewed by investigators . Four witnesses, believed to be Mr Jones' friends, are being interviewed by investigators. The friends were sitting on the cliff edge when tragedy struck, Inspector Nigel Taylor told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'When they returned to the lookout, the young fella has gone to have a closer look and fallen over the edge,' Inspector Taylor said. Two of Mr Jones' friends are believed to have used ropes and ladders to climb down the cliff to reach him but found their friend unresponsive, according to Nine News. 25-year-old Gareth Jones climbed a fence at North Head near Manly at approximately 6.45am on Sunday morning, and walked to the edge of the cliff before slipping . Police retrieved Mr Jones' body from the cliff base at 11.30am. 'It looks like a tragic accident and we feel for all of the people that were there and obviously our thoughts will be with his family when we inform them,' Inspector Belinda Caddy told Nine News. The clifftops at North Head are well known for the panoramic view they show of Sydney Harbour and skyline, and are a popular tourist destination on the northern beaches. Police are warning visitors to lookouts and coastal areas to stay behind fences and out of restricted areas or risk serious injury or death. Police have issued a serious warning to people who visit such lookouts and coastal areas .","Gareth Jones fell to his death from a cliff at Sydney's northern beaches .

"With album titles like Reign In Blood, Hell Awaits and World Painted Blood, you wouldn't expect the thrash metal Slayer to have a softer side. But when Kerry King, 50, the guitarist of the platinum-selling group, along with members of the band's entourage, were offered an abandoned and freezing kitten on the streets of Indianapolis by a homeless man, they took the suffering animal in and nursed it back to health. Slayer’s publicist Heidi Robinson-Fitzgerald told Nuvo.net: 'Kerry [King] and some of the crew went to dinner at Kerry's favourite steak house in Indy, St. Elmo's Steak House. Scroll down for video . This kitten called Gypsy was rescued from the streets of Indianapolis by the entourage of thrash metal band Slayer, including guitarist Kerry King. The cat has now been re-housed and is thriving . 'Afterwards, the assistant tour manager, Jess [Cortese] saw a homeless man on the street who offered up this little kitten for a dollar. 'The kitten apparently was freezing so Jess took it, slept with her in her bunk on the bus and went to the venue with her today, hanging out. 'One of the runners knew someone who wanted a kitten, so the little guy now has a new home where he or she currently is.' A day later the Old National Centre, the venue where the band performed alongside Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus, posted a photo on Facebook of the rescued kitten confirming it had been rehoused. Metal pioneer: Kerry King of Slayer performing on the Main Stage  at the Reading Festival in 2006 . In the comments, the cat’s new owner shared a picture of her new pet, writing: 'Here she is! I named her Gypsy! I gave her a bath last night then she slept for 5 hours on the heating pad. 'She's at the vet this morning being treated for fleas and worms. Thank you SLAYER for your act of kindness and thank you.' Slayer was formed in Huntington Park, California, and hit the music scene with the influential 1986 release Reign in Blood. Between 1991 and 2004, the band sold more than 3.5 million albums in the U.S. They have attracted controversy for their graphic lyrics and album covers featuring anti-religious and violent imagery.","Kerry King and his entourage were offered the animal by a homeless man .

"West Midlands Police out on patrol today after a threat to kidnap and murder an officer sparked a major security alert . A man has been arrested by counter-terror police over an alleged plot to kidnap and murder an officer from Britain's second-largest force. The 31-year-old was detained earlier today in connection with the anonymous threat made to West Midlands Police. He is currently being held in the police cells awaiting questioning by senior detectives. Officers had been told not to travel to work in their uniform after the force received the tip-off. West Midlands Police called officers and staff in to special briefings overnight and security measures stepped up after they received the tip-off. Bosses issued them with advice on travelling to and from work in partial uniform as well as being extra vigilant on patrol. A police spokesman said tonight: 'A-31-year old man from the West Midlands has this afternoon been arrested in connection with the investigation into threats made to West Midlands Police officers and staff yesterday. 'The man was arrested at a property in the West Midlands by officers from the Counter Terrorism Unit, who are leading the investigation.' The spokesman refused to reveal what the man had been arrested on suspicion of. The investigation, being lead by West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, was described as 'fast-moving and dynamic.' Police would not confirm the specific details, but did not deny reports that there had been a threat to kidnap and kill a police officer. A spokesman said: 'We are still accessing the information and cannot go into specifics.' In October the threat level to police officers across Britain was raised to substantial, while the national security level remains at severe meaning a terrorist attack is highly likely. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said there is nothing at this stage to suggest an increased risk to members of the public. 'West Midlands Police treat all information relating to matters of security extremely seriously, he said. 'In this particular case we have received information relating to the safety of West Midlands Police officers and police staff. A spokesman for the force described it as 'business as usual,' but confirmed security measures had been stepped up . 'There is nothing at this time to suggest there is an increased risk to members of the public. The threat posed by fanatics has seen the terror level rise  to 'severe' in the UK - the second highest state. The level, which means an attack is highly likely, is set by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre and the Security Service (MI5). Both the police and the British Army have raised the threat against their personnel from 'substantial' to 'severe.' The decision came as a result of increased 'terrorist chatter' about attacks similar to that on Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was killed last year by two fanatics as he walked near his Woolwich barracks. Drummer Rigby was not wearing his uniform when he was attacked, but a Help for Heroes hooded jumper. Police chiefs have reportedly warned officers to keep a low profile outside of work, issuing advice on what to wear when travelling to work and urging them to keep social media clean of all personal information. Military personnel have also been warned not to wear their uniform off barracks or tell strangers that they serve with the British Armed forces. 'We have taken the opportunity to remind all employees of the need to be vigilant. Our priority remains serving our communities and protecting them from harm. Officers remain on patrol and our staff continue to respond to calls for service as usual.' The force refused to reveal how they received the information about the threat yesterday/ on Monday. They said that officers continued to patrol the streets and described it as 'business as usual.' Steve White, Police Federation of England and Wales (PFEW) chairman, said officers faced a daily threat and it was only right that counter terror measures were regularly reviewed. 'The nature of policing is that day-in, day-out, officers face life-threatening risks,' said Mr White. 'When I started my career in policing 26 years ago, the risk was the Provisional IRA and while the new threat is not the same thing it is still about a dynamic risk assessment process. 'We need to be regularly assessing what we do and the changing issues officers have to face on a day-to-day basis. 'In recent months the national threat level has remained severe and the threat to police officers substantial. This has not changed. 'It is important that forces deal with these issues quickly and effectively, increasing awareness for officers so that when they are dealing with a job they are thinking about it more closely, and considering whether it feels right. 'At the moment we have 16,000 fewer officers but the safety of their troops on the frontline needs to remain a priority. 'PFEW urges police officers and staff to follow existing policies and good practice to counter terrorism and ensure their own safety. 'It has always been good practice, regardless of threat level, to avoid wearing uniform and take sensible precautions when travelling to and from work.' Former West Midlands Police officer Ray Egan, 75, who served on the force from 1967 to 1993, said: 'I heard a few weeks back that officers had been warned not to travel in partial uniform which was ridiculous as we used to do it all the time. 'It's a sign of the times at the minute. We never had anything like this in our day - I can't believe we have come to this. 'Its really worrying that our front line officers might not be safe. Its frightening when you think what they did to that solider. It's terrifying really.' Reports of the threat comes after five men were charged in October with plotting to kill police officers or soldiers on the streets of London. Members of the gang allegedly swore allegiance to extremist group Islamic State and scouted out Shepherd's Bush police station and White City Territorial Army Barracks on a 'hostile reconnaissance' mission on Google Street View. They allegedly kept Instagram images of two Scotland Yard police officers and two Metropolitan Police community support officers, as well as a trove of jihadist material including videos of beheadings. Former Scotland Yard detective Peter Blecksley said:'I am sure West Midlands Police will be very keen to speak to [the tipster]. 'They will want to really nail down the details of this allegation. I am sure they would love to know the identification of those involved, who they are where they may be from. 'West Midlands Police is one of the largest around, so they will have all the resources available to a large metropolitan style force to tackle this. 'There won't be an officer alone on the streets today, they will operate in pairs and they will want to reassure the people on the street as well as their own officers that they are safe.' Liberal democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley John Hemming said it was 'sad' people wanted to 'undo the good work of the police.' 'It is important that every body work with the authorities to ensure that people who wish to cause such harm in their wisdom are prevented from doing so. 'I have found West Midlands Police work well with all people in the community and it is sad that any one would wish to cause divisions and undermine all the effort they have put in.' There has also been an outpouring of support on social media for West Midlands Police. Stella Coppard tweeted: 'Stay safe and your dedication to protecting everyone is selfless and beyond heroic. You deserve the very best and the public know.' West Midlands Police has a dedicated Counter Terrorism Unit, based in Birmingham. It is one of five regional units based across the country that form the counter terrorism policing network. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said further guidance has not been given to Met officers following the incident. 'I believe it to be an anonymous call that's been made,' he said. 'One of my colleagues has talked to the Chief Constable of West Midlands this morning to find out exactly what the state of that threat is. 'And once we've assessed it, we'll decide whether or not to give any further advice.' The Commissioner added that the force tries not to 'overreact' in situations like this. Meanwhile, London Mayor Boris Johnson said it is not thought there is any particular threat to police officers in the capital. West Midlands Police force reportedly called officers back to base after receiving a threat of a plot to kidnap and kill a policeman .","West Midlands Police have implemented additional security measures .

"Nearly 50,000 furious gamers have signed a petition for Target to withdraw the Holy Bible from stores in response to the removal of Grand Theft Auto. It comes after Target decided to scrap sales of the popular game after an online petition slammed it for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women'. But when one gamer took to Twitter and tweeted: 'Withdraw The Holy Bible - over 40,000 signed!', Target responded: 'We don't actually sell the bible at Target, that's some pretty impressive numbers though!' Scroll down for video . One gamer took to Twitter to demand the retail chain to pull the Bible off their shelves but Target doesn't stock the Holy Bible in the first place . Furious gamers are demanding that if Target and Kmart are going to pull the R-rated game from their shelves then they should do the same to the Holy Bible. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it. But gamers have argued that the Bible's content is much, much worse. Gamers have now started their own petition on Change.org website – the world's largest petition platform – claiming that the Bible has more misogyny and gratuitous violence than GTA, and there were far more reasons for it not to be sold. The petition page headline reads: ‘Withdraw The Holy Bible – this sickening book encourages readers to commit sexual violence and kill women.’ An online petition slammed R-rated video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA5) for encouraging players to 'commit sexual violence and kill women' So far the petition has 22,359 supporters, and in the petition the Bible is described as a book that 'encourages readers to murder women for entertainment.' 'The incentive is to commit sexual violence against women, then abuse or kill them to proceed or get 'god' points – and now Target are stocking it and promoting it for your Xmas stocking,' reads the petition. 'This is The Holy Bible. This book means that after various sex acts, readers are given options to kill women by stoning her unconscious, Setting them on fire, cutting off their hands, and killing their children! 'This misogynistic book literally makes a game of bashing, killing and horrific violence against women.' 26-year-old gamer Kiley McDonald diputes claims the game incites violence towards women . However the former sex workers petition made it clear why they were against GTA being sold. 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell the game. 'We've been speaking to many customers over recent days about the game, and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content,' he said in a statement on Wednesday. 'We've also had customer feedback in support of us selling the game, and we respect their perspective on the issue. Kiley is an avid fan of the game and even has her own GTA character called 'SHADOWKiiLLA' 'However, we feel the decision to stop selling GTA5 is in line with the majority view of our customers.' Manager of Facebook site Grand Theft Auto Tips & Tricks Kiley McDonald says the move is 'ridiculous' and disputes claims that the game incites violence towards women. 'I remember playing it as a 10-year-old, my parents got it for me,' She told Daily Mail Australia. 'It never offended me, it doesn't offend me now and I grew up alight. 'I don't go out and mow down people or pull a gun out and spray them or anything, so I just think it's a little bit over the top.' McDonald claims that there is a significant amount of violence towards men throughout the game and believes women  are in short supply. She said she was 'speechless' as to why GTA had been specifically targeted and believes that parents who won't let their kids play the game, would probably be happy to give them permission to sit through an episode of Game of Thrones, or read a chapter from 50 Shades of Grey. 'If I don't like someone's clothing, I'm not going to ask the store to ban a certain type of shorts,' she said. 'If I don't like it, I don't look at it,because I've got better things to do.' McDonald believes the campaigners against the game are 'misinformed' and 'threw a tantrum' when they didn't get what they wanted. 'I'm all for feminists and women's rights but this is going a bit too far.' she said. 26-year-old McDonald believes big retailers such as Kmart and Target should not have to suffer financially due to this unjust petition. 'I don't know why gamers should be punished for something that's not our fault, or the retailers fault because they've gone through all the standards and checked the game,' she said. The petition, authored by former sex workers, has so far attracted almost 40,000 signatures. It says the 'sickening game' encourages players to kill prostitutes and calls on Target to stop selling it . McDonald said she understand the anger from former sex workers who launched the online petition, but believes GTA gamers do not play out these acts in the real world. 'It's up to the gamer to choose,' she said. 'I've played the story from start to finish, I'm 26-years-old, I'm a female and I was not once offended, I was not once appalled by the content,' she said. 'There are prostitutes in the game, there is a strip club in the game but very few of them that you see.' Reports that the game depicts women as bimbos and prey for men has angered McDonald. 'Most of them are actually dressed quite normally.' she said. 'Games like this are grooming yet another generation of boys to tolerate violence against women,' the petition said . 'These people actually look like they're going to work, they've got the content that perfect that some people are in uniform or they're in work clothes or summer gear.' McDonald said little children are the worst offenders in online forums. 'They're the ones that taunt you on the microphone, saying 'I'm going to f**k you mum' and 'F you this', and 'F that', it's insane and they shouldn't be playing it' she said. 'Most people have grown up playing video games like that and we're fine,' 'We don't go shooting up people and punching cops' McDonald said there are other children's games available that are much more dangerous. 'There's also another game which a lot of children play called World of Warcraft and  a lot of sexual predators are on that game.' she said. General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V . The young gamer worries that this ban will effect future sales of Grand Theft Auto as there will be a monopoly on who will be able to sell the game. Ultimately, she said it's really going to effect gamers who are keen on playing the game. 'My worry is that it's  going to be banned so it's going to be a problem for future games,' she said. Mr Cooper said Target would continue to sell other R-rated DVDs and games. 'While these products often contain imagery that some customers find offensive, in the vast majority of cases, we believe they are appropriate products for us to sell to adult customers,' he said. 'However, in the case of GTA5, we have listened to the strong feedback from customers that this is not a product they want us to sell.' GTA5 is an award-winning game which set a sales record for entertainment products, passing the $1 billion sales mark after three days.","Gamers argue the Bible contains more gratuitous violence that the game .

"The living nightmare a family from Victoria has been through for the past two years looks to be finally over after the suspected remains of murder victim Patricia Ann Gay were found. Her remains were discovered near a creek bed on a Victorian farm just 3km from her home, The Herald Sun reported. Ms Gay’s daughter Brooke James tearfully told how the ordeal had torn their family apart. 'It’s a nightmare to wake up every morning and wonder what’s happened to her, where is she,' Ms James told The Herald Sun. Patricia Ann Gay (left) with her daughter Brooke James. Patricia disappeared over two years ago . 'It’s horrible to see her face every time you close your eyes, trying to go to sleep. 'You wonder what’s happened and did she suffer. What was running through her head when it was happening.' Not knowing what happened to their 'funny, caring and beautiful natured' mother was devastating for Ms James – Ms Gay disappeared from the area on March 2012. Although this brought her family some closure and they were now able to lay their mother to rest, still not knowing what happened to her was difficult for them to comprehend. It has been a living nightmare for the family of Patricia (left) since her disappearance . 'It’s still on your mind 24/7. What happened? Why did it happen? Who done it?' she said. Despite extensive searches of the area when the mother-of-five disappeared two years ago no trace was found of her. It was only after skeletal remains that were believed to be Ms Gay’s had been found by a farmer recently as he cleared land on his property on the outskirts of Malmsbury that the family's nightmare looked to be over. Patricia's suspected remains were discovered near a creek bed on a Victorian farm just 3km from her home . Once the bones were identified as human, and most likely belonging to  her, Ms Gay's family were notified. The property owner found the bones when he was recently clearing his land. They were scattered over a 20sqm area in shrubbery adjacent to the creek. Police do not believe her body was recently dumped in the area. Ms Gay was wearing pyjamas when she was last seen by her daughter at about 10.30pm on Sunday March 11, 2012, at her Malmsbury property. She was reported missing the next morning. Patrica (left) had a close-knit family. Police have no suspects or a motive so far . Homicide squad detective Senior Sergeant Shane O’Connell said the evidence suggests foul play took place and he ruled out suicide or the fact Ms Gay, who was ill and required medication, may have wandered off from her Malmsbury home and fallen in the creek. 'There were a number of things in the initial stages that didn’t ring true (that led us to believe her disappearance was suspicious),' he told The Herald Sun. 'I can’t go into detail about that because it is an ongoing investigation and our concerns have very much heightened since the location of these remains. Patricia (left) was last seen by her daughter at about 10.30pm on Sunday March 11, 2012, at her Malmsbury property . 'But given the area we are searching is not in close proximity to (her) house and the terrain between the two is quite rough, and her ill health, suggests the likelihood of her getting to this location on her own is highly unlikely.' Further forensic testing will be conducted on the remains to make a formal identification and to try to determine the cause of death. So far police have no suspects or a motive.","The suspected remains of Patricia Ann Gay were found in a creek bed just 3km from her home .

"Whales may be known for having large appetites, but one humpback nearly bit off more than it could chew off the coast of California after almost swallowing a pelican. The bizarre scene was captured by photographer Kate Cummings in Monterey Bay as she watched a gathering of birds, sea lions and whales feasting on a school of anchovies. While the pelican appeared to be doomed after becoming trapped in the whale's mouth, the creature opened its jaws again just before diving, allowing the bird to flap its way to freedom. Scroll down for video . One humpback whale almost bit off more than it could chew while hunting for anchovies in California after accidentally snaring a pelican between its huge jaws . Photographer Kate Cummings captured the bizarre scene in Monterey Bay. Luckily for the pelican the whale opened its jaws just before diving, allowing the bird to flap to freedom . Anchovies, like sardine or herring, swim in huge schools which move as one body, and are covered in silvery scales to help confuse predators as they dart about to avoid being eaten. When attacked from all sides by predatory fish or sea lions, the instinct to stick together becomes a weakness, trapping the fish in so-called 'bait balls' which are also targeted by birds as they rise towards the surface. Whales make their hunt easier by waiting for these densely-packed balls to form, before rising up from underneath to swallow them whole with one huge gulp. However, as so many other animals crowd around trying to get a piece of the action, it is not uncommon for them to also become fish food. Ms Cummings, who took the pictures for Blue Ocean Whale Watch, said: 'This particular pelican's timing was a bit off and didn't lift off fast enough before the humpback whales emerged. Ms Cummings said that whales have a large pink organ on the top of their mouths, which can be mistake for a tongue, which is used to sense how much food has gone into their mouths - and probably alerted the whale to the fact that the bird was stuck . Whales often wait for schools of anchovies to be herded into 'bait balls' by other predators before striking from below, swallowing the densley-packed fish in one go. Because these balls attract many other animals, it is not uncommon for them to be caught in the beast's jaws . 'The humpback didn't close its mouth all the way. It's very likely the whale felt the pelican in its mouth and didn't want to crush it. 'We watched as the whale opened its mouth wide before submerging again and the pelican hopped across the water with no visible damage. She added: 'Humpback whales have a special organ on the roof of their mouth - a long, pink strip that's often confused for the whale's tongue. 'It's very sensitive and is likely used to get a feel for how much food the whale is taking in with one mouthful, though they could also use it to detect something inside their mouth that didn't belong there - like a pelican.'","Humpback whale was hunting for anchovies in California when it accidentally caught a pelican in its huge jaws .

"Ball's in his court: Boris Johnson at a college in West London yesterday . Boris Johnson should settle a six-figure tax bill in the US, the American ambassador indicated yesterday. The London Mayor, who was born in New York and has dual citizenship, revealed last month that he is being pursued by the US tax authorities over profits made on the sale of a home in London. American citizens are required to pay taxes on income over a certain level, even if the money is already taxed abroad. Mr Johnson described the demand as ‘incredible’, and suggested he would not pay. But US Ambassador Matthew Barzun indicated that Mr Johnson should settle up. Speaking to journalists in Westminster, he refused to be drawn on the details of the London Mayor’s case. But he said: ‘We have our rules and we expect people to play by them. 'If you get the benefits of being an American citizen you pay your fair share in taxes.’ The disputed tax bill is believed to relate to the sale of Mr Johnson’s first home in London. He is reported to have bought the property in Islington, north London, for £470,000 in 1999. It was sold a decade later for £1.2million. In the UK, capital gains tax is not payable on an individual’s main home. But under US rules Mr Johnson could face a bill of more than £100,000. He could also be liable for tax on his income, which is well above the £62,000 US citizens are allowed to earn abroad before paying taxes at home. US ambassador to London Matthew Barzun said anyone who enjoys the benefits of being a US citizen must pay their fair share of tax . His salary as Mayor is £144,000 and he is paid £250,000 for a newspaper column. The US embassy is also involved in a long-running row with the capital’s authorities over more than £8million in congestion charge fees run up by diplomats, which it refuses to pay. In July last year, ahead of Mr Barzun’s arrival, Mr Johnson praised his diplomatic abilities, then added: ‘I do hope he’ll put those skills to good use in finding the more than £6million owed by US diplomats to Londoners in unpaid C-charge fines.’ And ahead of a state dinner in honour of Barack Obama in London in May 2011, he said: ‘Maybe when President Obama’s hors d’oeuvre plate is whisked away he will find a bill for £5.5m.’","US citizens must pay tax on certain income, even if already taxed abroad .

"A wealthy British expat turned into a ‘sex-crazed monster’ after luring women to his upmarket apartment on the French Riviera, a court heard today. Robert Dolby, a 74-year-old described by one of his victims as a ‘lonely pensioner’, appeared at Alpes-Maritime Assizes, in Nice, accused of murder, attempted murder and rape. If convicted he faces life in prison. Wealthy British expat Robert Dolby, 74, described by one of his victims as a ‘lonely pensioner’, appeared at the Alpes-Maritime Assizes court, in Nice (pictured) accused of murder, attempted murder and rape . He is said to have killed a woman he invited to dinner in 2010, and then is said to have sexually assaulted and then tried to strangle another victim in 2012. The crimes are said to have taken place in Dolby’s flat in Beausoleil, the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco, and at another apartment nearby. On February 25 2012, a 29-year-old Frenchwoman identified only as Cindy was found nude in the Beausoleil apartment block, with her nose broken, and covered in blood and bruises. ‘Dolby tried to kill me,’ Cindy told investigators, confirming she had met her alleged attacker in the bar of a Monte Carlo hotel. ‘When he complained about being lonely, I felt sorry for him,’ Cindy told the court, saying he had originally been ‘like a father figure to me.’ She said the ‘reassuring, protective, thoughtful’ Dolby originally became a friend, and she soon accepted his offer to move into the flat he had shared with his wife up until her death in 2009. But, after she moved in as a ‘lodger’, Cindy said Dolby turned into a very different character with a ‘weird grin and the voice of a monster’. She said that within a few days of her becoming a lodger, Dolby entered her bedroom naked and ‘raped me and tried to strangle me’. ‘I fought with all my might,’ said Cindy. ‘He beat me all over. He tried to break my neck. Without the help of a neighbour, I would be dead.’ The crimes are said to have taken place in  Beausoleil (pictured) the Riviera resort town just outside Monaco . The British neighbour, who has not been named, confirmed the account, saying he had ‘heard a primal scream, like an animal being killed.’ The neighbour said Dolby was a ‘strange man’ who liked to boast about his numerous conquests, especially after his wife died from cancer. Dolby, who denies all the charges, admitted that he often met Russian women in bars, but his sexual relations were consensual. When police began to investigate Cindy’s complaint, they uncovered evidence linking Dolby with another crime in in 2010. It was in that year that a 60-year-old woman identified only as Annie-Claude died in his former home in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, also on the Riviera. Annie-Claude’s death was initially blamed on a cardiac arrest after a night of heavy drinking, with her body found half-naked on Dolby’s couch. But when her body was exhumed for further investigation, toxicology tests found traces of Zolpidem – a powerful sleeping pill often prescribed to people suffering from insomnia. Irene, another witness in the case, today described how spending an evening with Dolby was ‘the worst life of my life’. The young Russian woman said ‘Robert’s voice changed, his faced took on a horrible expression. He threw me on the carpet, and gave me a brutal head butt. I sensed he was going to kill me.’ Irene said Dolby was ‘obsessed by sex’, and often used to spend the whole day in bed. Judge Michele Lis-Schaal today outlined how Dolby had a long list of previous convictions for crimes committed in the UK. In 1991, he was found guilty for sexually assaulting a work colleague and sentenced to four years in prison. He also has more than a dozen previous convictions, mostly for theft and burglary. The case, which is expected to conclude at the end of the week, continues.

"A magnificent great white shark leaps from the water to take a chunk out of what it believes to be a seal. These amazing full breaches were conceived using a plastic seal decoy, dragged behind a tourist diving boat, as a way of enticing the hungry predator. Shot by filmmaker Mark van Coller in False Bay, Cape Town, the footage demonstrates the frightening power and agility of the iconic shark. The close-up footage demonstrates the frightening power and agility of the iconic man-eater as it swoops on what it thinks is dinner . The great white shark twists and turns in mid-air as it toys with its prey in False Bay, Cape Town, South Africa . But achieving such incredible shots is only possible if the conditions are right. He said: 'We filmed just before and just after sunrise, as this is the most active time for the sharks to hunt. 'During this time the seals and our seal decoy form a good silhouette for the sharks to target, but the water is still very dark, making it very difficult for the seals to spot the predators. The bait is dragged behind a tourist diving boat, as a way of enticing the hungry predator into action . The stunning video was shot by filmmaker Mark van Coller who had to be on his toes to capture the action, which can be over in an instant . 'This gives the sharks a big advantage during these hours. 'On a good morning you can get anywhere from one to six breaches on the decoy - this is obviously dependent on many factors such as sea conditions, weather and seal activity in the water.' The South African added that one lapse in concentration can result in a missed opportunity - such is the speed of the great white. 'It all happens in seconds. There have been occasions when the boat has pulled the decoy for close to an hour with no breaches. 'But you dare not take your eye off your viewfinder and the decoy because that is always when it happens. You turn around to say something to someone and smash, you missed it. 'It is much too quick to be able to pick up the camera and record. By that time it is all over.'","Remarkable video was shot by filmmaker Mark van Coller in False Bay in Cape Town, South Africa .

"Police divers have searched two woodland ponds in the hunt for missing Catherine Nee (pictured) Police divers are today searching two woodland ponds in a hunt for a woman who went missing 12 years ago. Officers investigating the disappearance of Catherine Nee turned their attention to the deep ponds at Burghfield, Berkshire after receiving a tip-off. Ms Nee was 32 years old when she was last seen by her family, from whom she was estranged, in 2002 and it was initially thought that she had simply moved away to another area. However police launched a missing persons investigation a decade later and a 48-year-old man from the Thames Valley area was arrested on suspicion of her murder last February. He was later released without charge. The grandmother-of-six, who would now be aged 44 years, was originally from Reading, Berkshire, but was living in the Ilfracombe area of Devon at the time of her disappearance. Detective Inspector Kevin Mahon, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Catherine became estranged from her family 14 years ago and in that time they have made attempts to try to find her but to no avail. 'They have constantly wondered what happened to her. They turned to Thames Valley Police for assistance in 2012 to try to trace her and our investigation has led us to this point. 'The Thames Valley Police specialist search and rescue team is conducting a search of two ponds in the Burghfield woods on the basis of this information. 'We do not know what we may find, but the hope is that we will discover items relating to Catherine's disappearance.

"Northern California residents were bracing for a powerful storm expected to be the biggest in five years as a torrent of atmospheric moisture originating near Hawaii barreled toward the West Coast Wednesday. The National Weather Service issued a high wind and flash flood warning for areas in and around the San Francisco Bay and north up the western Washington coast. The storm was expected to pelt the region through Thursday. It could overwhelm waterways and roadway drainage systems, possibly leading to flash flooding. This storm is 'expected to be one of the strongest storms in terms of wind and rain intensity' since storms in October 2009 and January 2008, respectively, said the National Weather Service in Monterey. 'Pineapple express': An atmospheric river of moisture was expected on Wednesday to bring a massive storm capable of dumping the most rain seen since 2005 on some areas of Northern California . Lashing: The storm was expected to start lashing western Washington on down to the San Francisco Bay on Wednesday . Good and bad: Flash flood warnings were issued by the state of California, but heavy snowfall was expected to benefit the state as forecasters said it would fall in areas hit hard by three years of drought . Heavy rainfall is expected, especially in the North Bay. According to Accuweather.com, Sacramento could see as much as six inches of rainfall in just a couple of days--the most in that period of time since 2005. Overall, the heaviest rainfall totals are expected from western Washington to Northern California, with numerous 3- to 5-inch rainfall totals expected. Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, issued a warning that the storm will present a risk of flash flooding and debris slides. 'This year was also a significant fire season for Northern and Southern California and burned areas are especially at risk for debris slides. Even regions that don't experience regular seasonal flooding could see flash flooding during this intense storm system, which could be the largest to date of this year's rainy season,' he said in a statement. High winds from 20 to 40 mph are expected, with gusts of 40 to 60 mph. Authorities are warning motorists to avoid driving through standing water; stay clear of outside roadway lanes, especially at night; keep headlights on at all times; and drive slowly to prevent hydroplaning. People should also have emergency contacts available and a stock a small emergency kit that can sustain each person for three days. Some projections said rainfall in Sacramento could reach levels not seen since a 2005 storm . The so-called 'Pineapple Epxress' is an atmospheric river of moisture that often brings major weather events to North America's Pacific Coast. The system is named for its origins in Hawaii, around where it gets its massive moisture content. Via NOAA.gov: . Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics. While ARs come in many shapes and sizes, those that contain the largest amounts of water vapor, the strongest winds, and stall over watersheds vulnerable to flooding, can create extreme rainfall and floods. These events can disrupt travel, induce mud slides, and cause catastrophic damage to life and property. However, not all ARs cause damage – most are weak, and simply provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to water supply. An average of between 30 to 50 percent of the total precipitation for the year on the West Coast comes from ARs. The biggest events among them can transport in the form of water vapor between 7.5 and 15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi. How a typical Pineapple Express 'atmospheric river' event works . Farther north, a series of strong weather fronts with high winds and heavy rains could lead to flooding and landslides this week in western Washington state. The National Weather Service expects as much as 14 inches of rain between Monday and Thursday in the Olympic Mountains west of Seattle. And it expects as much as 13 inches of rain in the North Cascades east of the city. Saturated soils will bring the risk of mudslides, while winds could topple trees. Last week, a different Pacific system brought three days of rain to Southern California. There was some flooding and evacuations near hillsides stripped bare by wildfires, but the Los Angeles area avoided major damage despite some huge rainfall totals. An exceptional 14.5 inches fell between Tuesday and Thursday at Yucaipa Ridge in the San Bernardino Mountains, the National Weather Service said. Most other parts of the state received 2 to 4 inches of rain. The storm dropped snow in mountains key to the state's water supply and made signature waterfalls flow at Yosemite National Park, including the 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls that had slowed to a trickle in mid-July. Meanwhile, Southern California was hit by a different storm system just a week before. That system hung around for days and caused mudslides in areas of  Ventura County where wildfires had stripped vegetations .

Fashionable face: Made In Chelsea starlet Rosie Fortescue has been unveiled as the face of Pretaportobello.com's new initiative, MarketSpace - an e-tailer that allows up-and-coming independent designers to trade directly with customers - and she says she is a huge supporter of fledgling designers . Speaking about her involvement, the 24-year-old, who recently unveiled her own fashion range, told MailOnline: 'Supporting up and coming designers is super-important to me and I actually get contacted by a lot of new designers via my blog. 'I feature them as often I can as I think it's important to show them support. 'There's an amazing array of young design talent on board, helping to give them a platform to get into the mainstream market.' Rosie recently curated and modelled her debut clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique - and every piece stayed true to the tailored and chic style she's made her own. Sharing her go-to style formula, she said: 'It's all about finding clothes that fit my body. It's incredibly important to wear items that compliment your figure. 'I do often stick to the same style when shopping which leaves me with a wardrobe full of muted colours and leather trousers so I do try and think outside the box and be creative.' Perfect fit: Rosie said it's essential to find clothes that fit your body. 'It's incredibly important to wear items that compliment your figure,' she advises . Star style: Rosie is a huge fan of tailored pieces and recently chanelled her style expertise into her own range for Lipstick Boutique . The reality TV star cites her statement Christmas party outfit as a tuxedo suit with a camisole top, sexy heels, statement necklace and clutch bag. 'It's a go-to outfit for me as I am not the biggest fan of dresses,' she said. 'Don't get me wrong, when I find a dress I adore I really do enjoy wearing it.' Despite unveiling her debut range earlier this year, Rosie says her fashion coup is yet to come. 'My favourite fashion moment is yet to come I think. I do always enjoy dressing in brands for London Fashion Week and attending all the shows. 'It's a way for me to really play around with style and dress to my exact mood and feelings,' she said. Big things on the cards? Despite unveiling her debut range earlier this year, Rosie says her fashion coup is yet to come . Citing her icons as Olivia Palermo and Abbey Clancy, Rosie reveals that her best friend and fellow fashion designer Millie Mackintosh had a glance through her look book before it launched and the pair exchanged notes. 'We have been wearing each others ranges,' she added. Rosie is one of the original Made In Chelsea cast members and as well as seeing her star rise, she says her style has changed, too. 'I have learnt a lot about my body and what suits my shape. For example, I am pale so I would never wear neon.' She's extremely grateful to the E4 show for providing her with so many opportunities, explaining: 'It's full of drama and fun and we had an amazing time in New York. I am so proud and pleased that it's all going so well.'

"Next time you want to remember a piece of information, save it as a file on your phone or computer. The act of digitally storing files containing useful or important data boosts memory and the brain's ability to remember future events, according to researchers. This is because the brain knows the original information is safely stored, which ultimately frees up cognitive resources that can focus on learning and remembering new facts and figures. When files are digitally saved, the brain knows the information is stored safely and can be accessed when needed. This frees up cognitive resources that can be used to remember new facts and figures, according to researchers from the University of California . Lead author, assistant professor Benjamin Storm of the University of California, said: ‘Our findings show that people are significantly better at learning and remembering new information when they save previous information. ‘The idea is pretty simple: Saving acts as a form of offloading. ‘By ensuring that certain information will be digitally accessible, we can re-allocate cognitive resources. Researchers from Harvard University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Columbia University  recently found that many people now use the internet in place of a memory. They claimed that when someone wants to know something they now use the internet as an ‘external memory’ just as computers use an external hard drive. The study continued that we are now so reliant on smartphones and laptops, we go into ‘withdrawal when we can’t find out something immediately’. Elsewhere, experts from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand warned that the obsession with recording and sharing every moment could be having an adverse effect on our memories. One psychologist claimed people are becoming increasingly unable to live in the moment. They say the phenomenon is 'kind of a loss'. ‘We tend to think of forgetting as happening when memory fails, but research suggests that forgetting plays an essential role in supporting the adaptive functioning of memory and cognition.’ The researchers set out to challenge previous studies that indicated saving information on a digital device, such as a computer or camera, hinders later memory for it. In the first study, 20 students used computers to open and study pairs of PDF files - File A and File B. Both files contained a list of 10 nouns. The students had 20 seconds to study File A before closing the file, with half being told to save it. They then studied File B for 20 seconds and were immediately tested on how many nouns they could remember, before being tested on their memory for File A. The students remembered more words from File B when they had saved File A than when they had simply closed it, according to the report published in Psychological Science. A second study with a separate group of 48 undergraduates saw the same results. The second study revealed that the saving-related memory effects depended on how reliable the students thought the saving process was. When the students were told that the saved version of File A might not stick, they showed no saving-related memory benefits. If they thought saving was unreliable, students’ memory for File B was the same regardless of whether they saved File A. Students used computers to study pairs of PDF files. The students had 20 seconds to study File A before closing it, with half being told to save it. They then studied File B, and were tested on the details on both. Students remembered more from File B when they had saved File A than when they simply closed it . Professor Storm said: ‘As technology develops, computers and smart phones are making it easier and easier to save information, which seems to have important consequences for the ways in which our memory functions. ‘By treating computers and other digital devices as extensions of memory, people may be protecting themselves from the costs of forgetting while taking advantage of the benefits.’ The researchers believe that the memory benefits of saving previous information may even have broad implications for how we think more generally. ‘Coming up with a new idea or solving a problem often requires that we think outside the box, so to speak, and forgetting previous information allows us to do that,' continued Professor Storm. ‘By helping us to reduce the accessibility of old information, saving may facilitate our ability to think of new ideas and solve difficult problems.’","When files are saved, the brain knows the original data is stored safely .

"Bethany Cammack took home the crown of Miss Teen Galaxy England in March this year . A beauty queen who suffered years of torment for being too good looking has had the last laugh by taking home a national title. Bethany Cammack, 18, saw her first victory at the young age of 14 when she won her first prize at a local competition. But rather than receiving congratulations from her peers Bethany, from St Helens, Merseyside was subjected to vicious name-calling and trolling on social media sites from other jealous pupils. The college student became so down-trodden by the constant abuse that she came close to giving up on competing completely. Bethany says that the bullying started early and as she was met with more success the abuse only worsened. She explains: 'I was only 14-years-old when I did my first event and I won. But when I started doing more and more modelling and events the bullying got worse. 'It started off with sly name calling in school but over time it turned much worse - things were being posted about me on social media.' Bethany says her bullies tried to justify their behaviour by claiming that she thought herself superior to everyone. 'People would say that I thought I was better than them just because I was competing as a beauty queen. 'Even people that were my best friends would call me names and things like that. The bigger the event I did, the worse the bullying got. 'I was called a sl** a b**** and all sorts of other things - it was the most upsetting things you could imagine.' Bethany says that the torment became endless with her abusers able to attack her both at home and in school. 'There's nothing worse than seeing people saying such horrible things about you online and then giving you abuse the next day in school - it was horrific. 'I considered giving it up because it was leaving me in tears - people who I thought were my friends turned their backs on me all because I was doing something I loved. 'But I did more and more events and started growing in confidence - I realised that I shouldn't let bullies have their own way. Scroll down for video . 'It started spurring me on to do better and I know that I'm better off than they are now - I'm so glad I stuck with it.' The determined student this year was able to overcome her demons and hit-back at her bullies after she was crowned Miss Teen Galaxy England in March. Bethany had almost given up on her pageanting dream after she faced years of torment for being too good looking . Bethany, who studies hair and media make-up at St Helens college, was first scouted while shopping in London and romped to victory in her maiden event, Miss Teen Queen 2010. She started commercial modelling a year later and has travelled to the US to do a range of photo-shoots on several occasions. Although Bethany had enjoyed much success up to this point her win at Miss Teen Galaxy England meant the most to the 18-year-old as it not only helped her get over years of torment but also saw the launch of international opportunities. The win earned her a place at the Miss Teen Galaxy International event in Orlando in the summer where she competed over four days for the prestigious title. She missed out on the top-spot but said she has been offered the chance to return to the US for more modelling shoots in the future. Bethany says that she would face her bullies in school and then come home only for the abuse to continue online via social networking sites . Bethany's dreams came true when she took home first prize at The Miss Teen Galaxy England awards (pictured) earning her a place in The Miss Teen Galaxy International event in Orlando in the summer . Bethany says that although she didn't win the crown she really enjoyed competing and gained a lot of experience. 'The standard was incredibly high over there and unfortunately I didn't win but it was a phenomenal experience. 'We did photo shoots and all sorts of things - I've even been offered to go back and do some more modelling which is something I'm seriously considering. 'I'm in my final year at college and I'm still deciding whether or not to go to university so we'll see what happens.' Bethany, who is now an ambassador for charity Bullies Out, is determined to share her experiences with other victims of online bullying. Although Bethany did not take home the crown at the Orlando awards, she says she was thrilled to have taken part . Bethany is now an ambassador for charity, Bullies Out, is determined to share her experiences with other victims of online bullying . 'It's great to be able to have all of these things on my CV after everything that happened - all I want to do now is help other people. 'As an ambassador for the Bullies Out charity, I travel to schools in St Helens and give talks to people about bullying. 'It's great to share my experiences and hopefully help others who are suffering the same thing.' Bethany hopes that her story can prove that it is possible to do what you love no matter what others think. 'I want to show people that you don't have to put up with bullies - you should always stick to your guns and do what you want to do. 'It's very hard at times but you'll always have the last laugh.'","Bethany Cammack received years of torment both in school and online .

And just days after Professor Hawking warned that 'artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,' a team of British researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules. Robots that can think and act without human intervention are fast moving from fiction to reality. There are fears that intelligent robots (illustrated) could one day overthrow humans, so a team of British researchers are embarking on a collaborative project to ensure that the autonomous robots we build in the future will make decisions that are ethical and can follow rules . The nuclear, aerospace, manufacturing and agricultural industries are starting to develop autonomous systems that can carry out tasks that are either too difficult or too dangerous for humans, while driverless cars are already with us. Researchers at the Universities of Sheffield, Liverpool and the West of England, Bristol have set up a new project to address concerns around these new technologies, with the aim of  ensuring robots meet industrial standards and are developed responsibly. The £1.4 million project will run until 2018. Professor Michael Fisher, principal investigator at Liverpool, said the project will ‘develop formal verification techniques for tackling questions of safety, ethics, legality and reliability across a range of autonomous systems.’ Stephen Hawking has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind. 'Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history,' he said writing in the Independent. 'Unfortunately, it might also be the last' Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The . search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with . Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help . computers think like humans. One . of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for . this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, . I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind’s Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. The news may be a relief to scientists such as Professor Hawking, who last week warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' Last month, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to ‘summoning the demon’. Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our ‘biggest existential threat’. He said: ‘I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. ‘I’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish. Last month, Elon Musk (pictured), the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of ‘something seriously dangerous happening’ as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years . ‘With artificial intelligence we’re summoning the demon. You know those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.’ In August, he warned that AI could to do more harm than nuclear weapons. The three ‘laws of robotics’ were devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov in a short story he wrote in 1942, called ‘Runaround’. They state: . As part of the new research project, the University of Liverpool will focus on the development of ‘verification tools’ that will provide mathematical proof about the decisions the intelligent systems will make, allowing experts to check up on future machines’ actions. Researchers at Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL), a collaboration between UWE and the University of Bristol, will work on developing and demonstrating ‘ethical’ robots. Professor Alan Winfield, of the BRL, explained: ‘If robots are to be trusted, especially when interacting with humans, they will need to be more than just safe. ‘We’ve already shown that a simple laboratory robot can be minimally ethical, in a way that is surprisingly close to Asimov’s famous laws of robotics. ‘We now need to prove that such a robot will always act ethically, while also understanding how useful ethical robots would be in the real world.’ The three ‘laws’ were devised by sci-fi author Isaac Asimov in a short story he wrote in 1942, called ‘Runaround’. They state that a robot may not injure a human, or allow us to come to harm, must obey orders given by humans – unless breaking the first law – and must protect its own existence where possible. Professor Sandor Veres of Sheffield Robotics added: ‘Our project will demonstrate the abilities of robotic systems to take decisions based on ethics, law and safety grounds and provide further guidance to legislators and robot developers.’","Researchers at the Universities of Sheffield, Liverpool and the West of England, Bristol will address concerns around artificially intelligent robots .
