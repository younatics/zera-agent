Iceland was not to blame for its bank crisis and did no wrong when refusing to repay billions of pounds of UK savers' money, a European court said today. Governments in Britain and the Netherlands were forced to repay £3.18 billion to members of the public who lost their deposits when Icesave, an online subsidiary of Iceland's Landsbanki, collapsed in the 2008 crisis. The Luxembourg-based European Free Trade Association Court ruled that deposit-guarantee laws did not cover ‘a systemic bank failure of the magnitude experienced’ in the tiny North Atlantic nation. Icesave: The collapsed savings arm of Landsbanki attracted swathes of UK savers after it offered top rates . Iceland, which has a population of just 320,000, went from economic wunderkind to financial basket case almost overnight when the credit crunch took hold. Some 340,000 savers lost deposits when Icesave collapsed, 200,000 of which were British. An estimated £3.18 billion was repaid by the UK and Dutch governments, and both have been trying to get their money back ever since. Icelandic voters have twice rejected deals brokered by their government to reimburse the two countries, partly because of anti-terrorism legislation used by the British government. Iceland's foreign ministry said it was ‘a considerable satisfaction that Iceland’s defense has won the day’ in court. Borrowed cash: Billions of UK depositors' money was lost when Icelandic bank Landsbanki (pictured) collapsed in 2008, and the UK government have been trying to retain the money paid out ever since . ‘Icesave is now no longer a stumbling block to Iceland economic recovery,’ it said in a statement. The country says it is nevertheless repaying Britain and the Netherlands from money it is raising by selling off the remaining assets of Landsbanki. Icesave at the time of collapse said that 95 per cent of its customers had deposits of less than £50,000, meaning they would be covered in full by the combined Icelandic and UK deposit protection schemes. Officials in the capital Reykjavik said that Iceland has paid IKr 585bn (£2.8bn) of the IKr 1,166bn (£5.7bn) claims from Icesave – this, it says, is the equivalent to more than 90 per cent of the minimum deposit guarantee the two governments were obliged to pay. It added: ‘It is expected that the Icesave claims will be paid out in full by the actual debtor, the estate of the failed Landsbanki.’ The court case was brought by the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, which makes sure that non EU members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway comply with European Union regulations.","Iceland not to blame for 2008 collapse of its banks, court rules .

Shops in Saudi Arabia have been ordered to put up walls to separate their male and female employees in accordance with the country’s strict vice laws. The barriers need to be at least 5ft 3in high and will keep staff from seeing and communicating with workers of the opposite sex. This follows Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam which prohibits men and women who are not immediate relatives from socialising. Segregation: Shops in this mall in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia will have to erect barriers to separate their male and female employees as religious law prevents mingling of men and women who are not blood relatives . The news comes only days after the religious police, known as the Mutawa, said there would be no punishment for men who frequent shopping malls and public spaces in their underwear. The new and controversial trend among young men is to go out in public wearing only undershirts and trousers, normally worn underneath the traditional robes. Despite complaints about the new trend, Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice spokesman Najm Al Dhufairi dismissed rumours of a ban of the practice, leaving it up to shopping centre security whether they deem it inappropriate. Equality has been a slow process in . Saudi Arabia, where women are still not allowed to drive a car, must use . separate entrances at banks and offices, and follow strict dress codes. They . also need permission from a male relative or their husband to work, . travel, study or marry and a woman's testimony counts for less than that of a man . in a court of law. Restriction: Male attendants in a shop selling abayas, the female black robe, are only allowed minimum contact with a female customer even when she is chaperoned by a male relative or her husband . Controlled: The life of a Saudi woman is regulated by the country's sharia law and she may not travel, study or marry without a male relative's permission and must always follow the strict dress code seen in this picture . A small step forward was announced by King Abdullah last year as he opened up the government advisory council to both sexes. Earlier this month women were appointed women to 20 per cent of the 150-member Shura Council as King Abdullah reconstituted the council for a new four-year term. Although the women can attend the assembly, they will be separated from their male colleagues by a screen and will join the debate via an internal communication system. To comply with the kingdom's Wahhabi sharia law, the Shura Council building must now be altered to include a separate entrance for women.","Shops have been ordered to erect dividers to keep men and women apart .

There are not many brave enough to get on the back of a 2,000lbs bucking bull - and definitely not many 5ft5in girls - but there is at least one, and she is doing pretty well for herself. Maggie Parker is the world's only female bull rider to compete professionally in the men's category and although she is only 20 years old, she is considered a veteran, having competed in nearly 200 rodeos. Despite her slender frame, Maggie, from Michigan, USA, regularly takes on bulls that weigh in excess of 2,000lbs - over 15 times her own size. Scroll down for video . Pro buckaroo: Maggie Parker's unusual choice of career has seen her become the world's only female pro bullrider to compete against men . Maggie, who . weighs 130lbs, became professional last June after tackling a . bucking bull for the full eight seconds needed to qualify as a pro. The fact that professional bull riding is considered one of the world's most dangerous sports has not deterred Maggie from putting 100 per cent into her hobby. She said: ‘Bull riding is one of the most dangerous sports because you're up against an animal and you don't know what he is going to do or what he's thinking. ‘You will get bulls that are meaner than others but you really have to respect them. You can't ride against them, you have to ride with them.’ Maggie's path to the bull ring began . four years ago in her hometown of Shastsburg, Michigan, when a family friend who used to ride bulls took her to a rodeo and she was hooked. Ready to do: Maggie prepares her ropes by adding rosin, making it sticky enough to get a better grip for holding on while being bucked by the bull before heading for the chute in Santa Maria, California . Hold on tight: Maggie needs to stay on the bull for eight seconds in order to score in a rodeo . Bull-ied: Although Maggie is barely 5ft 5in, she regularly takes on bulls that weigh over 2,000 lbs . Going, going, gone: Maggie has her rope in a rights grip and tries to hold her balance aboard the animal as the bull runs and bucks . Aged 17 she left home to live in the . southern states, working on ranches in Oklahoma and Texas to fund her . bull riding training, and recently moved to Santa Maria, California, to be trained by top mentor Gary Leffew. Maggie says her parents are supportive of her unusual career path - despite the obvious dangers. But desite winning plaudits as a female in a predominantly male sport, Maggie says she still faces difficulties in being accepted - especially when she gets bucked off a bull. Rough ride: The 20-year-old left her family behind in Michigan and moved to California in order to become a better bullrider . Rough ride: In order for Maggie to qualify to be a professional bullrider she needs to stay on the bull for more than eight seconds . She . said: ‘They [men] say, ""This is why girls shouldn't ride bulls and . girls aren't made for this."" But it all depends on the person. ‘You're . either a good bull rider or you're not. It takes a long time to gain . people's respect and get treated the same as the men. ‘Sometimes . it's been harder for me because when you're learning how to ride a bull . you're going to get bucked off - and you're going to get hurt. It's . just not going to look very pretty while you're riding.’ She now wears a full face mask and helmet to protect her, but revealed she has suffered being stood on by the bulls and endured knocks to the head. Devotion: Maggie shows off her own tribute to her chosen sport - a back-tattoo of herself on a bucking bull . Maggie, who says she is just as . comfortable in a summer dress as she is in her Stetsons, said: ‘If I . didn't wear my helmet I'd probably be a vegetable by now because I've . been hit in the head.’ To keep on top of her sport, Maggie does ranch work, conducts regular . workouts at the gym and practices techniques on a stationary barrel. Speaking . of his protege, Maggie's trainer Gary Leffew, who has coached 12 world . champions, said: ‘She wasn't very good when she came to me but she had . grit. ‘That's what I admire about her. She ain't got no quit in her - she's determined and she works long and hard on it.’","Maggie Parker is the world's only female bullrider to compete against men .

A gang of thieves stole nearly six miles of copper cables causing more than £700,000 worth of damage, a court heard today. Christopher Cruz, 33, and his crew ripped the wiring from train tracks and telephone lines during a four-month crime spree across London, Hertfordshire, Essex, Leicestershire and Buckinghamshire in 2011. Five members of the gang, consisting of six men from in Basildon, Essex, were today sentenced to 12 years in jail. The gang carried out their night-time raids between May 1 . and August 30, 2011, stealing six miles of cable,  weighing 31,654 lbs, from Network Rail alone. They used a van to rip underground . cable out through manholes as well as . cutting down live overhead cables near to railway lines across south England. Attacking cables armed with circular . saws, hacksaws and nail removers, the crew would wear high-visibility . jackets in order to pose as workmen, even . placing a yellow flashing light on top of their van. They also cut off thousands of British Telecom . landlines by chopping away hundreds of metres of cable at a time, . Blackfriars Crown Court heard. ‘The consequences go beyond simple theft, and pose a significant detrimental effect on the operation of the national railway network,’ said prosecutor Richard Beynon. ‘The delays and disruption divert . human resources from work elsewhere to carry out repairs, and financial . cost for replacing the cables is significant. ‘Also, . stealing the copper earthing cable from the stanchion supporting a high . currency system can mean the stanchion itself could become live, with . obvious huge dangers to those nearby.’ Mr Beynon said up to 1,000 BT . customers were affected in one hit, leading not only to inconvenience . but potentially putting people who live in remote areas in danger as it . rendered them unable to contact emergency services. Jailed: Kris Kreuder, 36, left and Bill Lee, 50, were given jail terms of 16 months and two years respectively . Sentenced: Lookout Shaun Nembhard, 44, left, will serve 27 months, whilst career criminal Simon Scott, 45, picked out as a main player in the thefts, was handed his 47th conviction and jailed for three and a half years . Uncovered: Lengths of stolen cable, found in shipping container in August when members of the gang were arrested . One incident saw some 2,700ft of copper cable stolen from BT, affecting 400 customers. Describing an attack on the rail line . through Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, on May 25, 2011, Mr Benyon added: . ‘Network Rail received reports of a fault and small line-side fires. About 1,000 metres of cable had been stolen.’ Network Rail estimated cost to repair the cables themselves: £294,770 . Network Rail further repair costs: £256,000 . Total value of thefts to Network Rail: £550,750 . BT value thefts: £162,593.30 . Scrap value of the stolen copper: £57,000 . Total value of the conspiracy: £713,343.38 . The gang were stopped after repeatedly . targeting train lines in Bishop’s Stortford, Sawbridgeworth, and . Spellbrook, in Hertfordshire and Boreham and Billericay, in Essex. They also took trips further afield, staying together in a Travel Lodge in Leicestershire to carry out midnight raids. The gang would often cut up the cable on site and sold most of the copper to a scrap metal dealer in Barking, Essex. Passing sentence this afternoon, Judge . John Hillen called the thieving crew a co-operative, saying he did not . see any of the men as a leader. Judge Hillen said: ‘This was one of . the largest series of railway thefts ever undertaken to investigate by . the British Transport Police.’ He . said the gang were made up of ‘hitherto petty thieves’ but because of . the disruption caused, he must pass immediate prison sentences as a . deterrent to others. Game plan: The gang would dig up the cables and cut them up at the scene before taking it to a scrap dealer . Destruction: A Colchester rail line with cable missing after a visit by the gang . Under cover: The gang would dress up in high visibility jackets and put a yellow light on top of their rented Ford Transit van to pass off as genuine railway workers . Mr Cruz, who has 14 previous convictions was picked out as a leading participant and jailed for three years and nine months. Simon Scott, 45, another main player and the most prolific criminal of the group with 46 convictions for 108 offences, was jailed for three and a half years. Bill Lee, 50, is already serving a four and a half year prison sentence for crimes dating back to 2002, but was only imprisoned upon his arrest in 2011 after nine years on the run. He was jailed for two years today, to run consecutively to his current sentence. Kris Kreuder, 36, a recovering heroin addict who worked as a ceiling construction worker with Cruz, was jailed for 16 months. Shaun Nembhard, 44, the gang’s lookout, was sentenced to serve two years and three months behind bars. The sentencing hearing for John Michael Newton, 36, will be heard on March 22.","Thieves stole cables from Network Rail and BT during summer 2011 .

Not struck off: Lorraine Bloice referred to her students as 'beasts' A teacher who called her pupils 'beasts' and referred to a child with special needs as 'a f****** little s***' will still be able to work as a teacher, an education panel has ruled. Lorraine Bloice, 32, was found guilty of inappropriate behaviour when teaching at a special needs school in Aberdeen, but will still be allowed to teach. Ms Bloice was heard saying 'don't wake the beast' when a child fell asleep in class and when asked if pupils had finished their morning snacks she said: 'Yes - let the beasts free'. The teacher and musician also referred to another pupil as 'a f****** little s***' when talking to a volunteer. A fitness-to-teach panel found some of the charges proven against Ms Bloice but ruled that she should not be barred from teaching. The General Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland heard how the incidents came as Ms Bloice taught at a special school in Aberdeen. She told the hearing in Edinburgh that she used the word ‘beast’ after a reference to a pupil as ‘sleeping beauty’ from Beauty and the Beast. She said that was because of the child's pattern of challenging behaviour before lunchtime and her habit of falling asleep after lunch. She claimed that was a long-standing joke among members of the classroom team. Ms Bloice was also heard to call a pupil 'a boot’ during the same period in September 2011. Ms Bloice admitted she told a school volunteer about a pupil and said ‘I'd really like to write in his book that he has been a f****** little s*** today but I can't’. On another occasion Ms Bloice was . found to have ‘forcibly’ taken a pupil outside who struggled to keep up . with her - although the panel agreed that no suffering was caused. The . panel agreed that Ms Bloice ‘failed to maintain appropriate boundaries, . avoid improper contact. with pupils and respect her unique position of . trust as a teacher.’ Inappropriate: Ms Bloice had told a school volunteer that she wanted to write that a pupil at the special needs school was a 'f****** little s***' in his book (file photo) They also said her behaviour ‘had the potential to damage the confidence which the public have in her as a teacher as well as teaching as a profession’ and her banter was ‘inappropriate’ and ‘unprofessional’. But instead of removing her from the teaching register she will instead be forced to comply with strict conditions at her current school. A Conditional Registration Order and Reprimand will last for two years.","Lorraine Bloice referred to her students at special needs school as 'beasts'

A probe has been launched by budget Dutch airline Transavia into what happened on the  Boeing 737 flight to Crete. Although in the incident happened in September, it was only made public yesterday by the Dutch safety board (OVV) in a report published on its website. The body called it a 'serious' incident. Investigation:A probe has been launched by budget Dutch airline Transavia into what happened on the Boeing 737 flight to Crete (file photo) 'After two and a half hours in the air the captain of the Dutch-registered plane left the cockpit to go to the toilet,' the OVV said. 'A little later he wanted to return to the cockpit. When he used the intercom to call the first officer to open the door he got no reaction. 'When he managed to get into the cockpit, he found the first officer asleep.' In September pilots' groups raised concerns that new flying hours imposed by the EU could lead to precisely this problem. Under the new rules, pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake - including 11 hours flying, plus stand-by time and travel to the airport. MPs had warned in their original report that 22 hours of wakefulness was ‘an extraordinary figure’ - particularly for night flying - that raised levels of fatigue equivalent to being ‘drunk.’ Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was accused of ‘rolling over to Brussels’ after his department approved the rules despite the concerns raised in a report by the respected Commons’ Transport Select committee. UK pilots can currently go up to 18 hours without sleep - but more than four out of ten pilots already report nodding off in-flight - of whom a third awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep. The new rules are expected to be adopted into EU law after mid-2013 and fully implemented by the end of 2015.","Investigation has been launched by a low-cost Dutch airline Transavia .

'Just lost it': Former RAF sergeant Frederick Gilliard, 76, killed his wife with a garden gnome . An elderly ex-RAF sergeant who beat his wife to death with a garden gnome before stabbing her ten times was today jailed for four years. Frederick Gilliard, 76, said he 'just lost it' after a row with his wife Josephine, 74, to whom he had been married for 54 years. Mr Gillard, who called police to the couple's Blackpool home, told officers 'this is going to kill my kids, I loved that woman,' Preston Crown Court heard. The couple were described as a 'decent, hardworking couple' who raised four children and had three grandchildren. Members of his family wept in the public gallery as he was jailed. Mr Gilliard had also served in the RAF for 27 years including seeing active service during the conflict in Aden, and had previously suffered from depression. It was during a 'depressive episode' on February 5th last year, that Mr Gillard used a garden ornament shaped like an Easter Island statue, and an eight inch carving knife, to kill his wife, the court heard. Mrs Gilliard, 74, who was attacked in their bedroom, suffered ‘catastrophic’ head injuries and ten stab wounds of ‘considerable force’ to her neck, chest and stomach. He then dialled 999 telling the operator ‘I just lost it’ summoning police to the family home in Blackpool, Lancashire where his wife lay dead. When officers arrived he said: ‘I can’t believe it. This is going to kill my kids. We have been married 54 years. I loved that woman.’ Weapon: Mr Gillard used a garden gnome shaped like one of the famous Easter Island statues to kill his wife . Gilliard was originally charged with murder but at an earlier hearing pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility due to his depression. Passing sentence Judge Anthony Russell QC, Recorder of Preston, told the defendant: ‘This is a terrible tragedy which has affected all of your family and you, and must have inflicted considerable emotional damage which can never be repaired.’ Frail Gilliard, who walks with a stoop and wears glasses and hearing aids in both ears, could not hear proceedings and looked over to his family in the public gallery who held up four fingers to indicate the sentence.","Frederick Gillard, 76, used a garden gnome to kill his wife Josephine, 74 .

New direction: Casey Anthony has become so experienced with the legal system since her daughter disappeared that she may be considering a job as a paralegal . Casey Anthony could become a paralegal after gaining legal experience while being tried for her two-year-old daughter's murder, her attorney said today. The 26-year-old expected to make millions off book deals, movies and TV shows after she was acquitted in 2011 of murder in the death of her daughter Caylee. But those big-money contracts for her story never materialized and now she faces three lawsuits and owes nearly $800,000, mostly stemming from the criminal case against her. She has been out of work for four years and when asked what she may be interested in doing, her attorney Charles Greene said she might want to be a paralegal . 'I truly believe that she has a lot of skills,' Mr Greene told ABCNews.com. 'She's better than many paralegals I know. She could be a paralegal or something like that right away. Mr Greene said Anthony 'believes strongly in our justice system' and constitutional rights. 'I think she may be the type that ends up trying to work within our system to make our system better rather than being a person who's trying to break it down,' he said. Anthony filed for bankruptcy in . federal court in Tampa, Florida, on Friday, claiming she is unemployed . and has had no recent income . Anthony was acquitted of killing her daughter in July 2011 after a sensational trial that divided America. Caylee Marie Anthony, 2, went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later . Aftermath: The 26-year-old expected to make millions off book deals, movies and TV shows after she was acquitted in 2011 of murder in the death of her daughter Caylee . A jury believed Anthony’s version of events that Caylee had accidentally drowned and she had panicked and buried the girl by her father George. A search and rescue organisation today vowed to claw back $100,000 from Casey Anthony for the time they wasted searching for her missing daughter. Texas based Equusearch are named as one of the creditors America's 'most hated' mom owes in her recent bankruptcy filing. Investigation: Caylee Marie Anthony, 2, daughter of Casey Anthony, went missing in June 2008 and was found in woods near her grandparents house six months later . They are listed among more than 70 organisations and individuals who are owed money by Anthony who has debts of close to $1m. Casey Anthony filed for bankruptcy in Florida on Friday, claiming about $1,100 in assets and $792,000 in liabilities. Court records show that Anthony, who was acquitted of killing her . 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2011, sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy . protection in federal court in Tampa. Her listed debts include $500,000 for attorney fees and costs for her . criminal defense lawyer during the trial, Jose Baez; $145,660 for the . Orange County Sheriff's office for a judgment covering investigative . fees and costs related to the case; $68,540 for the Internal Revenue . Service for taxes, interest and penalties; and $61,505 for the Florida . Department of Law Enforcement for court costs. The filling also states that she is a defendant in several civil suits, . including one brought by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez for defamation in . Orange County Circuit Court. Acquitted: Casey Anthony leaves with her attorney from the Booking and Release Center at the Orange County Jail after she was acquitted of murdering her daughter Caylee Anthony in July 2011 . Fernandez-Gonzalez claims her reputation was damaged by Anthony telling . detectives that a baby sitter by the same name kidnapped Caylee. The . detectives were investigating the 2008 disappearance of the girl, who . later was found dead. Anthony's attorney said details offered by Anthony . did not match Fernandez-Gonzalez and clearly showed Anthony wasn't . talking about her. An attorney for Anthony, David Schrader, did not immediately respond to messages from the Associated Press. Anthony lists about 80 creditors in the 60-page court filing. The claims . largely cover fees for legal, medical, psychiatric and forensics . consulting or services. But one claim covers a debt for scuba diving . services. According to the courts, the aim of seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy . protection is to be discharged of most existing debts - essentially to . obtain a fresh financial start. A trustee may have the right to take . possession of and sell non-exempt property and use the sale proceeds to . pay creditors, but Anthony lists little in the way of assets. A debtor . may still be held responsible for some obligations, such as taxes and . student loans. The filing came on the same day that a Florida appellate court set aside . two of the four convictions she faced for lying to detectives during . the investigation into her missing daughter. Though Anthony was acquitted of killing Caylee, jurors convicted her of . four counts of lying to detectives, and her attorneys appealed those . convictions. Anthony was sentenced to time served for the misdemeanors. She was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for . an unrelated case. For her protection, her whereabouts have been kept . secret since she was released from state supervision last year. She was offered $1m for the first interview after her acquittal but public revulsion towards her meant no network TV station would agree to air the chat. NBC were threatened with an advertisers boycott after it was reported they were in negotiations to sign a deal with her. The bankruptcy filing happened on the same day an appellate court in Florida threw out two of her four convictions. Court records show that the bankruptcy petition was filed in the middle district of Florida. It means Anthony must be residing in Florida and covers towns such as Fort Myers, Tampa and Jacksonville.","Acquitted of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee in 2011 .

The Queiq River rises in Turkey and travels through government-held districts of Aleppo before it reaches Bustan al-Qasr. 'They were killed only because they are Muslims,' said a bearded man in another video said to have been filmed in central Bustan al-Qasr after the bodies were removed from the river. A pickup truck with a pile of corpses was parked behind him. Grim task: Residents attempt to identify bodies found along a river at a school used as a field hospital in Aleppo's Bustan al-Qasr . It is not clear who carried out the killings - human rights groups have accused both government forces and the rebels of carrying out summary executions. Government forces and rebels in Syria have both been accused by human rights groups of carrying out summary executions in the 22-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives. Rebels pushed into Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, over the summer, but are stuck in a stalemate with government forces.

Storm: Syrian rebels stormed a government intelligence complex in the oil-rich east of the country on today, freeing at least 11 people held in a prison at the facility, activists said . The city is divided roughly in half between the two sides. The revolt started as a peaceful protest movement against more than four decades of rule by President Bashar al-Assad and his family, but turned into an armed rebellion after a government crackdown. More than 700,000 people have fled, the United Nations says.

Revolt: A military tank that caught on fire in front of the government intelligence complex in Deir el-Zour, Syria . After five days of heavy clashes around the intelligence compound in the city of Deir el-Zour, rebels finally overran the complex early Tuesday following intense fighting overnight, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Opposition figures were reportedly being held at the jail on the complex's grounds, but it was not immediately clear whether those freed Tuesday are fighters or activists. Government forces responded to the rebel advance by unleashing a series of airstrikes on the compound, trying to push the opposition fighters from the facility. Assistance: Medics wheel an injured Syrian on a stretcher into a hospital in the Turkish-Syrian border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province . The aid group Doctors Without Borders said last month that government forces are shelling and bombing Deir el-Zour almost daily. It said tens of thousands of Syrians, many of them wounded, remain trapped in the city. Also Tuesday, regime warplanes also carried several airstrikes on rebel positions in restive towns and villages around Damascus, including eastern Ghouta and Yalda, and hit other suburbs with artillery, the Observatory said. The group relies on the reports from activists on the ground. After capturing several major army bases and government outposts, the rebels control large swathes of land in northeastern Syria. Assad's troops, however, continue to hold a tight grip on the capital after nearly two years of conflict. The areas on the capital's doorstep have been rebel strongholds since early on in the revolt. In recent months, the rebels have used them as a base from which they have been trying to push into central Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.","The bodies were found in the Syrian city of Aleppo earlier today .

Glenn Estrada was chasing  Lamont Pride after he allegedly murdered policeman Peter Figoski during a botched robbery in December 2011. But today in court Estrada spoke of the moment he returned to find Figoski unresponsive and on a stretcher.

He was the only one who backed us up with a . revolver,' Gandini said. He explained this was clear to him because some of the older cops, like . Figsoki, still carried revolvers instead of the newer standard-issue . Glock semiautomatics. Gandini explained he ran to his patrol car to find something to cover Figoski’s face, but couldn’t find anything suitable. The father-of-four was pronounced dead . several hours later at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The 47-year-old could have retired two years before with a full pension. Family man: Police officer .

In court prosecutors played surveillance videos that showed Estrada chasing Pride for four blocks . Figoski . and Estrada were part of a back-up team of officers who responded to a report of a break-in at the basement apartment in the East New York section of Brooklyn, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. The building owner, who lives on the first and second floors, called 911 at about 2:15am. The first officers walked toward the back of basement to help three men they thought were robbery victims, reported Huffington Post. Held without bail: The five men who were indicted on Friday.

Until now, scientists have thought that our own Earth is the only planet that can support life. But now scientists at Ohio State University who have been studying our 'solar twins' - stars that have solar systems with planets - say they could be even MORE habitable than Earth. Our solar system: other stars could be like our sun and have planets that could support life . Geologists and astronomers at Ohio State University have teamed up to search for alien life in a new way. They looked for the radioactive elements of thorium and uranium. More of those elements make the inside of the planet warmer. That in turn drives the plate tectonics, or how the separate parts of the earth's crust move. Earthquakes are the result of the different plates of the earth's crust moving and grinding against each other. Plate tectonics helps maintain water on the surface of the Earth, so the existence of plate tectonics is sometimes taken as an indicator of a planet’s hospitality to life. Our Sun is a star - our closest star. Earth is about 150million kilometres from the Sun. Of the eight solar twins the Ohio State University researchers have studied so far, seven appear to contain much more thorium than our sun — which suggests that any planets orbiting those stars probably contain more thorium, too. That means that the interior of those planets are probably warmer than ours. Our own Earth inhabits the 'Goldilocks zone' - a region of space where the planet is just the right distance from its home star. In this habitable zone, the planet is neither too hot nor too cold: it is just right. Our Sun is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth. Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium. The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago. Life is only possible in a small zone around the Sun - the 'habitable zone' or the 'Goldilocks zone'. The Ohio State researchers believe that if the planets around the solar twins are warmer than they thought, then we could increase the size of those stars' Goldilocks zones - and make more planets in those distant solar systems more friendly to life. 'If it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought, then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star, and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life,' said Cayman Unterborn, who presented the results at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco this week.","Presence of radioactive elements means other planets could support life .

A man who stabbed his married lover 20 times in a frenzied attack was jailed for life for her murder today. Sultan Khan, 51, was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years behind bars for killing mother-of-three Shobhna Jethwa in a row over compensation money from an accident he had on a building site. Her body was discovered slumped on . the sofa of the family home in Butely Road, Luton by her 12-year-old son . and 16-year-old daughter when they came home from school on September 9 . 2011. The children tried to revive her, but she had been murdered some . time earlier. Mrs Jethwa, 44, was cheating on her . husband Rajesh with Khan who she called 'The Old Man', and a younger . lover, restaurant worker Ashiq Hussain, who she called: 'The Short Man'. Sultan Khan, who is now . wheelchair-bound, of Durbar Road, Luton, pleaded not guilty to murder, . but was convicted last week by a jury of three women and 8 men at St . Albans Crown Court. Judge Andrew Bright QC had adjourned sentence for a report on Khan's physical condition. Khan had been involved in an accident and suffered a major pelvic fracture when he was hit by a lorry on a building site at Bicester in Oxfordshire in May 2011. At the time of the killing he was walking either with the aid of crutches or a Zimmer frame. Jailing him today the judge said: 'Shobhna Jethwa gave you practical and financial support after the accident. She helped you find accommodation and prepare you meals. 'The relationship turned sour because you were due a large some of money in compensation for the accident. 'Shobhna Jethwa wanted a share of the money. You told her you wanted to go back to your wife in India and support your daughter in London.' Defence barrister John Burton QC said Khan had a wife and three children. He had come to the UK in 2004 to 2005 from India to work and had only seen his wife once since then. His elder daughter had come to the UK herself to train as a nurse. He said Khan had not gone to the house to kill his lover but to take her a top up for her mobile phone. The murder weapon was a knife taken from her kitchen drawer. 'Something happened in the house. There was a lack of pre-meditation,' he said. At the time of the killing detectives investigating the case were surprised when the 12-year-old son told them he knew where his mother's boyfriends lived and took them to their addresses in Dunstable Road and Leagrave Road in Luton. A key-ring recovered from the dead woman's handbag had the words: 'I love you S K' inscribed on it. The keys were to Sultan Khan's home. Khan was captured on CCTV walking with crutches and catching a bus at 9.55am that day from near Beech Hill Post Office. At 10.13am he got off, a short distance from Shobhna Jethwa's home. Shobhna Jethwa was killed by Sultan Khan in September 2011 . A neighbour cleaning the blinds in his bathroom saw Khan use his crutches to open the gate to the back garden of the Jethwa's home that lunchtime. He was next seen boarding a bus just before 2pm. Then at 4.42pm he was seen having changed his identity by switching from Western clothing to an Asian garment. He had discarded the crutches and was walking with a Zimmer frame. In the days before the killing prosecutor Sam Mainds said there lengthy phone calls, up to two hours long, from Mrs Jethwa to Sultan Khan. He said: 'She and Mr Khan had an intense relationship for two years. She was a woman who did not leave him alone. He sneaked down to her home when her husband was away. She fed him and they had sex together. 'She looked after him after his accident and cooked for him at his home. At the time she was putting pressure on him. There were 3 calls from her to him on 6 September for over an hour. 'The son heard rows between her and the defendant in which she demanded half of his accident money because she had helped him,' said the prosecutor. Khan had bought the top up for her mobile phone on his way to the house, indicating that he had not gone there to kill her, but it is thought a row broke out while she was ironing. At the time of the killing the younger boyfriend Ashiq Hussain, who she had been seeing for 3 and a half years, was at his Mosque in Luton. The father of three, whose wife is in Pakistan, told the jury: 'We were best friends and I miss her.' Her husband was working as a train manager on a Virgin train between Manchester and London. He told the jury: 'Since she met this fellow life has changed. It was a happy marriage for the first 25 years.' Khan did not give evidence. When questioned by police, Mr Khan said: 'I don't know what happened. I didn't do it.' Jailing him Judge Bright said: 'You had no intention of giving her a share of the compensation money. You decided to be rid of her. You left her body knowing her three children would find her.' After sentencing, the judge commended officers from the Beds and Herts Major Crime Unit who had investigated the case.","Sultan Khan, 51, was having an affair with Shobhna Jethwa for two years .

But when 58-year-old Jane Thomas was doing the washing up she noticed colourful patterns in the bubbles and decided to turn it into art. Mrs Thomas, from Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, has been a keen photographer for many years but never realised she could find the perfect picture as part of her daily routine. Jane Thomas noticed colourful patterns in soapy dishwater as she did the washing up . The images were created using a macro lens, a remote control shutter and an angle poise lamp instead of flash . Such a chore: Jane Thomas noticed the beautiful patterns in the soapy water when she was doing the dishes . Mrs Thomas said: 'I leaned in very closely and saw that . there were tiny patterns swirling about so rushed off to find my camera . and try some experiments. 'I'm a very keen photographer always looking for unusual subjects. There are none more so than the strange and fantastic patterns in soap - the flat film in a child's 'bubble wand' before it is blown into bubbles. Just a few millimetres at a time are photographed by Jane Thomas in order to create the stunning images . Blu tack, children's bubble mixture, a bubble wand and an angle poise lamp were used to set up each photograph . True colours: Different soaps create different effects depending on their thickness . 'The liquid swirls around and colourful shapes can be seen and will amaze you if you look very closely. 'I like to photograph them with my Nikon D600 camera and Nikkor 105mm macro lens. I don't use flash, just a small office angle-poise lamp, and I use a remote control shutter release cable in my left hand while I focus with the right. 'Technically speaking, the patterns arise naturally from the interference of reflected light rays from the front and rear surface of a thin film of soapy water in the tiny frame or 'bubble wand'. Forever blowing bubbles: The effects occur naturally from the interference of reflected light from the film of soapy water . Soaps of varying levels of thickness were used by Jane Thomas to create different effects . Former teacher Jane Thomas says she is a keen photographer and she looks for 'unusual' subjects . 'The inner circle which I use for most of these photos measures approx 18mm. Most of the shots are of very tiny areas - just a few millimetres - within that ring. 'It's almost impossible to photograph the whole area because only small parts are in focus at any one time.

A renowned Russian ballerina with the illustrious Bolshoi Ballet has decided to leave the theatre and live in Canada after receiving  threats. The abrupt announcement by leading soloist Svetlana Lunkina comes only weeks after sulphuric acid was thrown in the face of the theatre's artistic director, Sergei Filin. The historic theatre, first opened in . 1776, is known for its bitter, ego-driven disputes, with some describing . the situation as 'gangsterism'. Scroll down for video . Departed: Svetlana Lunkina is leaving the Bolshoi Ballet after receiving threats . It is considered an . enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals and . foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers and . directors during its more than 200-year history. Past incidents include dead cats have been thrown on stag and broken glass inserted into ballet pumps by jealous rivals, reported The Times. The threats against Lunkina, 33, seem not to be linked to those against Filin. Svetlana Lunkina as Aspcia, the Pharaoh's Daughter and Ruslan Skvortsov as Lord Wilson / Taor (L) perform in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of 'The Pharaoh's Daughter' at the Royal Opera House.  and she dances in the dress rehearsal of ""Swan Lake"" at the Royal Opera House in London. According to daily Russian newspaper Izvestia, they are linked to a film her husband, producer Vladislav Moskalev, had been working on. It was due to feature the great Russian imperial ballerina . Matilda Kshesinskaya, but Moskalyev was dropped from the . project after he fell out with his business partner, who is now suing . him for $3.7 million (£2.3 million.) 'I think we need to react to these threats.' Lunkina told the newspaper . Izvestia on Tuesday. Concerning: The threats are linked to a film her husband, producer Vladislav Moskalev, had been working on until he got into a dispute with his business partner . Reopen: The Bolshoi, which has ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its colonnaded landmark building near the Kremlin . 'These people have no right to interfere in our . private lives or my professional work.' Lunkina, who has a seven-year-old son, has been living in Canada for the last six months and will shortly begin dance classes at a dance studio in Kleinburg, the Toronto Star reports. Her prolonged disappearance from the Bolshoi stage had already puzzled fans who initially suspected she had suffered an injury before rumours spread that she was no longer in Russia, reported AFP. The ballerina had been due to appear later this year in . Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring but has been given leave of absence by . the Bolshoi.. Gangsterism: Sergei Filin, 42, artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, was the victim of an acid attack. He was interviewed from the Moscow hospital where he is being treated, left, after the incident . Meanwhile Filin remains in hospital . since the attack outside his apartment and he may soon be transferred . from Moscow to Aachen, Germany for more treatment . His right eye is seriously damaged but doctors are hopeful his left one can be saved. The dancer is thought to have suffered weeks of personal harassment ahead of the incident. The man seen as Filin's main rival Nikolai Tsiskaridze, was one of the first people to be interviewed after the attack. Treatment: The artistic director of the Bolshoi ballet Sergei Filin was interviewed at the hospital in Moscow where he is being treated . Prestigious career: Sergei Filin in 2011 with the then president Dmitry Medvedev and his wife Svetlana attending a gala opening of the Bolshoi in Moscow . The Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow. As a symbol of Russian culture for more than 200 years, it is a big draw for both locals and foreign tourists, and has seen power struggles among both dancers and directors throughout its history. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of those conflicts, whether driven by egos or artistic convictions, have been played out in public. After the tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before Filin's appointment. In 2003 Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, dismissed ballerina Anastasia Volochkova after reportedly saying she was too heavy for male dancers to lift, and in 2011 a senior ballet manager resigned after a scandal over sexually explicit photographs. Filin, a Moscow native, joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic director in March 2011. Tsiskaridze, a traditionalist, was . one of several whom Iksanov passed over in favour of Filin for the post . of artistic director in March 2011. He has been very vocal in the past about criticising the theatre, although he has expressed his outrage at the attack on Filin. General director of the Bolshoi Theatre says Tsiskaridze 'is like an abscess.' 'All . his worldwide speaking bad about his own home which made him a star, . and he is doing it and he never stops and he will not be stopped,' he . told The Daily Telegraph. 'Without . any punishment or any reaction, he is free to do what he wants – it . brings an unhealthy atmosphere inside the company. I am not ashamed to . say it openly, because evil has now appeared here.' In an interview immediately after the attack Filin said the attacker wore a hood and either a mask or a scarf, so only his eyes were visible. 'I got scared and I thought he was going to shoot me,' Filin, his face covered with white bandages, told REN TV. 'I turned around to run, but he raced ahead of me.' Filin, a Moscow native, joined the . Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in . March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow . theatre. There was 'fierce rivalry' for the Bolshoi position at the time, according to RIA Novosti. Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry. Filin had already reported having his car tyres slashed and his emails hacked, as well as receiving repeated nuisance calls from someone who stayed silent when he answered. 'He said, `I have a feeling that I am on the front lines,'' Iksanov quoted Filin as telling him Thursday before the attack. The Bolshoi's spokeswoman Katerina . Novikova confirmed to Izvestia that Lunkina had requested leave for the . season and that the company had approved it.","Sergei Filin, 42, was attacked outside his apartment earlier this month .

Mourners paid tribute to a popular 20-year-old man, who loved wearing his onesie, by donning the all-in-one jumpsuit at his memorial service. Jamie Lawrence, who had been preparing for an . interview to rejoin the army after being discharged two years ago on . medical grounds, died suddenly at his home almost a fortnight ago. At his funeral on Thursday, more than . 500 people gathered at a packed York church wearing their own versions . of the jumpsuit as a tribute to Jamie - who loved his onesie so much he . even wore it to eat his Christmas dinner. On Saturday, MailOnline reported how Kelly and Stuart Scott were the first couple in Britain to get married wearing babygrow-style suits. Jamie Lawrence loved wearing his onesie and had hopes to rejoin the army this later this year . Family and friends of Jamie Lawrence spent more than £450 on onesies to be worn at his funeral . Jamie’s mother, Lin Lawrence, 53, said: 'He loved his onesie and he never had it off since trying one on a year ago. 'I . think he just found them so comfortable and so he wore his to the pub, . when he went shopping and even to a party on New Year’s Eve,' she said. 'There . were almost 550 people who attended the service on Thursday and nearly . all of them wore onesies in his honour. He would have been really . touched.' Jamie’s sister, Emma Smith, 24, who . works as an accounts manager at a bank after spending four years in the . army, ordered £450 worth of onesies for people to wear at Jamie’s . funeral. 'I couldn’t believe how up for it everyone was. It’s such a lovely tribute to pay to Jamie and it really meant a lot to the family. They all sold out straight away,' she said. 'The fact there were so many people at the funeral, with scores having to stand throughout, helped make the day easier for us. 'We always knew Jamie was so popular but we didn’t realise just how much.' His mother, Lin, a support worker, said: 'Jamie was a typical young lad. He loved being with his mates and he was football mad. Jamie Lawrence's friend Martin Stone, his mother Linda Lawrence, his sister Emma Smith, his girlfriend Laura Hare and friend Brad Rowle all donned onesies as a tribute . 'He was outgoing and was the life and soul of a party. He was well-mannered and just a lovely person. 'For us this was reflected in terms of how many people came to pay their respects. 'For the wake, the pub had to put up a marquee to fit everyone in and even that wasn’t big enough.' Jamie, who was due to start a new job as a landscape gardener just a week after he died, had an interview on February 14 to rejoin the army after he was discharged on medical grounds two years ago. After recovering from Raynaud’s Disease, a common condition which affected the blood supply to his fingers and toes, Jamie hoped to pursue his career in the army. He had spent over two years in the army before he was discharged after following in his father’s footsteps. Jamie’s father Joe, 52, who spent 22 years in the army before retiring as a prison officer, said: 'He loved being in the army. He was very social and made friends easily and for him, he just loved being with the lads.' Jamie, who was a lifelong supporter of Manchester United, played football for his local pub, the Half Moon, where the wake was held. More than 500 mourners wore romper suits to the funeral of Jamie Lawrence, who loved to wear a onesie . 'He always played in his number seven shirt and a lot of people had it printed on their onesies at the funeral,' his father said. 'The manager of the team has said he’s retiring the shirt as a tribute to Jamie and will hang it on the wall of the pub. 'I’d like to say a huge thank you to everyone who came. This tragic event has been made easier by their support.' One of his onesies was worn at his funeral by his girlfriend Laura Hare, who had been in a relationship with Jamie for seven years. Laura, 20, who is studying at university, said: 'Jamie was always so happy and so I think this is a very fitting tribute to him. 'We spent so much time together and often he’d be in his onesie so it’s a great way to remember him.' Jamie’s death was not suspicious and an inquest has opened and adjourned. Emma told the congregation at St Wilfrid’s Garrison Church: 'He was found by mum and dad in his bedroom. We will never know what happened that night, but Jamie never meant this. He wouldn’t have done this to us. 'He wasn’t depressed. He had a beautiful girlfriend that adored him. I am proud to have been his big sister.' Jamie was laid to rest wearing his blue onesie, along with the ashes of his beloved dog, Taz, his football boots, photographs and letters from friends. Emma is going to take part in the Great North Run as a tribute to Jamie. She has already raised £1,100 from money donated at his funeral, which she is donating to Help For Heroes.

The Federal Reserve has admitted it was hacked by Anonymous as the group 'takes revenge' for suicide of Reddit founder Aaron Swartz. The admission, which raises questions about cyber security at the Fed, follows a claim that hackers linked to the activist group Anonymous had struck the Fed on Sunday, accessing personal information of more than 4,000 U.S. bank executives, which it published on the Web. Swartz, 26, killed himself on January 11, just a month before he was set to go on trial in Boston for thirteen felony charges. Admission: The Federal Reserve has admitted it was hacked by Anonymous as the group 'takes revenge' for suicide of Reddit founder Aaron Swartz . Family and friends of Swartz, who helped create Reddit and RSS, say he killed himself after he was hounded by federal prosecutors. Officials say he helped post millions of court documents for free online and that he illegally downloaded millions of academic articles from an online clearinghouse. Today a Fed spokeswoman said 'The Federal Reserve system is aware that information was obtained by exploiting a temporary vulnerability in a website vendor product.' 'Exposure was fixed shortly after discovery and is no longer an issue. This incident did not affect critical operations of the Federal Reserve system,' the spokeswoman said, adding that all individuals effected by the breach had been contacted. Last meal: Aaron Swartz and girlfriend Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman shared a dinner of his favourite foods on the night before he hanged himself . Technology news site ZDNet separately reported that Anonymous appeared to have published information allegedly containing the login information, credentials, internet protocol addresses and contact information of more than 4,000 U.S. bankers on Sunday night. The claim was made via Twitter over an account registered to OpLastResort, which is linked to Anonymous, a loosely organized group of hacker activists who have claimed responsibility for scores of attacks on government and corporate sites over the past several years. OpLastResort is a campaign that some hackers linked to Anonymous have started to protest government prosecution of computer prodigy Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide on Jan. 11. The Fed declined to identify which website had been hacked. But information that it provided to bankers indicated that the site, which was not public, was a contact database for banks to use during a natural disaster. Hacked: This screenshot shows the hijacking of the sentencing commission website by Anonymous. The group claim they have already infiltrated several other government sites . A copy of the message sent by the Fed to members of its Emergency Communication System (ECS), which was obtained by Reuters, warned that mailing address, business phone, mobile phone, business email, and fax numbers had been published. 'Some registrants also included optional information consisting of home phone and personal email. Despite claims to the contrary, passwords were not compromised,' the Fed said. The central bank separately confirmed the authenticity of the message to ECS members. The website's purpose is to allow bank executives to update the Fed if their operations have been flooded or otherwise damaged in a storm or other disaster. That helps the Fed to assess the overall impact of the event on the banking system. Last month the hacker-activist group hijacked the website of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to avenge the death. On film: Aaron Swartz was caught soon afterwards this video taken at MIT was recorded on January 6 2011 with a laptop and a hard drive that contained secured and lucrative academic journals that had been hacked . The website of the commission, an independent agency of the judicial branch, was taken over early on a Saturday morning. Hackers replaced the homescreen with a message warning that when Swartz killed himself  'a line was crossed.' At his memorial last month, held at New York's Cooper Union, his girlfriend Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman . Stinebrickner-Kauffman's eulogy did not shy away from criticizing the role the government played in Swartz's suicide.

They have encouraged me to fight on, to fight the charges and regain my reputation and good name and whatever I have represented to this country down the years. ‘I would like to thank everybody who has supported me for their good will which has sustained me through this absolutely horrific ordeal.’ The former It’s A Knockout presenter said he was nursing a heart complaint brought on by the stress of the ordeal.

A historic tall ship, one of only 60 of its kind ever built, has sailed on to the market with a price tag of £2million. The Kathleen and May liner, which is considered a national treasure by the Government, has been berthed on Hartley Quay in Liverpool since 2010. More than 60 dedicated sea-lovers volunteer to keep her afloat but it could now leave Britain after more than a century in our waters. Beauty: One of Britain's most historic sailing ships is for sale but it will cost the buyer £2million . Dedicated: Crew members (L-R): Peter Kingham and Dave Rothwell prepare the tall ship Kathleen and May for the new sailing season in Liverpool's historic harbour . Living history: The last triple masted Topsail Schooner, the Kathleen and May, on a voyage in summer 2006 off Clovelly in North Devon . Her owner, Stephen Clarke OBE, has been taken ill and is now making plans for her future, and needs to sell the vintage voyager. At the request of the Arts Council, auctioneers Bonhams of London has valued the ship is £2million. After being built in 1900, the Kathleen and May joined the National Historic Ships Register along with a core collection of fifty ships. The 113-year-old vessel was built at Connahís . Quay in Deeside, Scotland, and has already attracted interest from the Far East . with an offer of £2.3million. Classed as a National Treasure by the Secretary of State for Culture, the ship is used by the Liverpool Maritime Museum education department in its work with local children. The Duke of Edinburgh has been associated with the ship since 1972, and at his request she attended the Queen's Jubilee Celebrations on the Thames. Since the patriotic celebrations last year, she has attended the Brest Maritime Festival and so completed a sailing season of more than 2,000 miles. Labour of love: Cindy Grace cleans to original bell of Kathleen and May tall ship which is officially a national treasure according to the Government . Hard work: Crew member Peter Kingham attaches the name tag of the tall ship to its bow . Historic: The 113-year-old tall ship Kathleen and May, built at Connahís Quay in Deeside, has already attracted interest from the Far East with an offer of £2.3m . So far an offer has been received from a foreign buyer, however the sale must be subject to scrutiny by the Arts Council, who have to issue an Export Licence before it can proceed. Because the Kathleen and May is on the Historic Ships Register, this has been refused temporarily. It will be granted in coming months if funding cannot be raised to keep her in the UK. The deadline for expression of interest in achieving that is February 19. Any sums of money raised towards the £2million asking price will be gap funded by the Arts Council. Because of the way this is calculated, raising considerably less than half this sum would ensure her future as a Liverpool attraction or elsewhere. If such interest is forthcoming, a business plan will be produced for the ship’s future management and it will probably stay where it is or go to another UK port.","Kathleen and May liner could leave Liverpool for Asia unless cash is found .

Tragic: Kendrick Johnson's body was found on Friday morning in Lowndes High School's old gym in the rolled-up mat . A south Georgia high school student has died after he apparently climbed atop an upright roll of wrestling mats, fell into a center opening and became trapped inside, authorities said. Lowndes High School student Kendrick Johnson, 17, became lodged inside the roll of mats, upside down, Lowndes County sheriff's officials said on Monday. His body was found Friday morning in the high school's old gym after his family reported him missing Thursday night. No foul play is suspected, authorities said. An autopsy and an investigation by sheriff's officials and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation found no signs of a struggle, Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine told The Valdosta Times. It is possible Johnson may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat, Prine said. A shoe was found at the scene, but it is not known whether it belonged to Kendrick. 'At some point, Kendrick Johnson either reached into the center of one of the rolled mats or fell into the center opening of the mat and became lodged,' sheriff's officials said in a statement. 'We feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole,' the sheriff told the Times, adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat 'but him and the good Lord.' The student was upside down in the mat, with blood rushing to his head and upper extremities, causing him to pass out, the sheriff said. Keeping a human body upside down for an extended period of time can be deadly, causing hemorrhaging, stroke and heart failure. Although investigators do not believe foul play was involved, the sheriff said he and his investigators will continue interviewing students and friends who have additional information.

A high-flying City analyst broke a bouncer's nose when he was booted out of a five-star hotel after a row over his bar bill, a court heard today. David Reynolds, 30, allegedly drunkenly threw a punch at Araz Draey when he was thrown out of the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, central London, after hurling a torrent of abuse at bar staff when his credit card was declined. He accused a waitress at the plush £570-a-night hotel of being rude and became abusive himself when Mr Draey stepped in to defuse the row, Westminster Magistrates Court was told. 'Mr Reynolds was drunk and abusive towards staff, prompting security to be called', Izolda Gribbin, prosecuting, said. 'He was taken to the pavement outside the hotel, when the victim at the time had his hand behind his back and was talking to Mr Reynolds. For no apparent reason, Mr Reynolds punched the complainant on the nose. He was subsequently restrained prior to police being called.' Mr Draey was left bloodied and bruised following the incident on December 18 last year and is said to have suffered a broken nose.

Reynolds is also contesting the fact that Mr Draey's nose was broken in the incident. 'Initially it appeared the injury sustained was a cut to the nose and bleeding, but the complainant now says there was actually a fracture to the nose', Ms Gribbin said.

But despite the panoramic views offered by scaling Europe's highest building, it is poor value for money in comparison to other skyscrapers across the world. A 'height to price' ratio, balancing adult admission price against the height of the buildings, reveals why some visitors to the tower of steel and glass have felt aggrieved at the weighty admission costs. Poor value: The Shard, Europe's highest building, is the worst value for money for those looking to experience views from some of the world's most well-known skyscrapers. The graph measured the cost of admittance on the door for one adult against the height of the buildings . Pricey: Adults visiting the Shard, which opened to the public earlier this month, can expect to fork out £29.95 ($47) on the door . Having opened to the general public earlier this month, adults visiting the £500m building can expect to fork out £29.95 ($47) on the door. A family of four will be charged more than £87 for the 30-second elevator trip to the building's 68th floor viewing platform. But standing at only 800ft (244m), the Shard's viewing platform compares poorly against other global skyscrapers offering the chance to gaze at stunning vistas. The best value can be found at Taiwan's Taipei 101 building, with a viewing platform at 1285ft (392m), costing an adult only £9.70 ($15.25).

Toronto's CN Tower boasts an observation deck at 1,122ft (342 metres) costing £20.45 ($32). Despite criticisms of the Shard's entrance fees, and indeed its design, its views across London - said to stretch 40 miles with good visibility - have been described as the most sought-after views in the UK. The building has 72 occupiable floors, but with further floors narrowing to a point, and it stands as high as an . 87-storey building, scraping the sky at an impressive 1,016ft.

Building; and it is dwarfed by the 2,717ft Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the . world’s tallest building. The skyscraper is part of a 2m sq ft development in Southwark called London Bridge Quarter. The Shard and its sister development The Place are linked with London . Bridge Station through a new central plaza, public realm, bus station . and train station concourse.

Flight attendants at South Korean airline Asiana Airlines are rebelling against strict dress codes and are urging bosses to allow them to wear trousers instead of the skirts currently required . Their plight has attracted the attention of South Korea’s human rights commission, which has recommended trousers be allowed. The commission's ruling is non-binding but represents a small victory for the 3,400 female flight attendants at Asiana. Asiana air hostesses want to wear trousers when working, something they are currently prohibited from doing . Since last year, they have been asking the company to relax appearance requirements that range from how many hairpins they can wear to the length of their earrings. The National Human Rights Commission of Korea said Asiana Airlines required a uniform appearance through very specific rules on hairstyle and makeup, indicating that the company assumed women's role to be that of a service provider. Asiana said that its skirt-only policy was meant to emphasise the company's brand of 'high-class Korean beauty'. It said aesthetic elements such as the appearance of female flight attendants are part of its service for passengers and an essential tool for staying competitive. Still, the company said it will review trouser options in future uniform redesigns. It did not say when the next one is scheduled. Equality: Their male counterparts wear trousers, and the hostesses' union wants women to be able to do the same . Asiana is the only South Korean airline with a no-trouser rule for its female flight attendants. Even though the company did not openly ban specific hairstyles, all but four of its female flight attendants wore their hair in a tight bun because of pressure from senior crew and a group evaluation system that examines appearance, said Kweon Soo-joung, head of Asiana's labour union. Kweon said Asiana's meticulous rules for female cabin crew reached 10 pages, including a ban on wearing glasses, having to cover up facial blemishes, and requirements for the length of earrings and the amount of eye liner. The airline says it will review its policy the next time it changes its uniforms . About 200 male flight attendants had to conform to a two-page guide and were allowed to wear glasses, she said. Asiana said it eased appearance rules for its female employees as of January, including allowing glasses. 'I hope the decision would help change similar discriminatory rules that govern how women in service industries, such as hotels, dress and do their hair and makeup,' Kweon said.","Asiana has ten pages worth of strict dress rules  for female attendants .

Bilal Khazir was killed instantly when the high-performance car crashed into him as he crossed a main road in Bradford on his scooter, throwing the schoolboy more than 50 metres along the road. Uninsured driver Zain Khan, 21, was travelling at more than twice the 40mph speed limit in his 'very powerful' car, Bradford Crown Court heard. Khan sped away from the scene in his badly-damaged vehicle, leaving police in his wake as he reached speeds of up to 106mph.

No parent, brother or sister should feel the needless pain and suffering we have endured. 'For the rest of our lives we will . have family occasions, gatherings and celebrations ruined because Bilal . is missing and there is an empty chair. 'It is a day-to-day struggle and these . people need to realise how their actions have left this family . completely devastated and shattered.' Tribute: Bilal Khizar's family described the schoolboy as 'one in a million' in a statement . The court heard how Bilal, of Bradford, had been visiting school friends shortly before his death. Police on patrol nearby noticed Khan overtaking at excessive speed and stopped him, but he pulled away 'as fast as his vehicle was able to do so'. Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said: 'Khan appears to have been intent on, and focused solely upon, getting away from the police.' Bilal, who was pushing a scooter, was crossing Rooley Lane at a pedestrian crossing when Khan approached at 84mph - more than twice the 40mph limit. CCTV screened in court showed the moment Khan, from Halifax, hit him, catapulting him 54 metres down the road. 'He collided with Bilal, who was projected into the air, smashing the nearside of the car’s windscreen and tearing backwards the front nearside wing of the car, and then forward along the road surface,' Mr Sharp added. 'He suffered massive head injuries and it may be of some comfort to his family that he died instantly.' Mr Sharp said Bilal was crossing on a red man signal but added 'If Khan had been driving at or near the speed limit he would have had ample time to see Bilal crossing.' After the incident, Khan 'calmly' called 999 and reported his car stolen in what Judge Durham Hall called a 'crafted, convincing' act. In interviews with police, Khan and Hughes admitted the lie, but said he could not avoid hitting Bilal as he 'ran out.' He later pleaded guilty to death by dangerous driving and intending to pervert the course of justice. Hughes, who was today bailed and her sentence adjourned for assessments, also admitted the latter charge. Runaway: After the incident, Khan sped off, reaching speeds of 106mph as he evaded police, and dumped the car five miles from the scene . The court heard that Khan was uninsured at the time of the crash after mistakenly believing his father’s company policy covered him. Simon Csoka QC, defending Khan, said he was genuinely remorseful and still experiences flashbacks. 'The defendant cannot begin to explain why he behaved in the way that he did. He cannot escape the invasive thoughts about what happened,' he said. Khan bowed his head as Judge Durham Hall said his case was among the most serious of its kind. 'You have pleaded guilty to a serious and very grave offence; looked at together, extremely shocking and serious offences,' the judge said. 'The young man suffered catastrophic injuries and died instantly. You raced off knowing you had inevitably caused the most serious damage to another human being. 'Nothing I can do will bring back Bilal and no punishment I can impose as a judge, I recognise, can even satisfy the outrage and anger and I rather suspect the deep grief and wounds of the victim’s family.'","Bilal Khazir killed instantly when hit by Zain Khan's high-performance vehicle .

A council in London is spending thousands of pounds housing homeless families in three and four star hotels because it has nowhere else to put them, it has been reported. Westminster City Council is spending up to £12,000 a month for a family to be housed in a hotel. According to the BBC London investigation, many of the families have been made homeless because their housing benefits were capped last year. Accommodation: Westminster City Council has been spending thousands to put homeless families, including the Osmans (pictured), in hotels . Expense: The family of ten have been put up in a hotel since November, when they were no longer able to afford the rent on their four-bedroom house . The council has said it is using hotels because there is nowhere else for the homeless families to go and it was trying to re-house the families. Many of the cases were believed to have been staying in hotels for months, despite laws saying people should only be in bed and breakfast accommodation for no more than six weeks. The report suggested the government had informed the council they were breaking the law. The BBC report shows the Osmans, a family of ten who had been put up in the Jury's Inn hotel, in Chelsea, since November, after they became homeless when they could no longer afford the rent on their four-bedroom house because of the benefit caps. It said the family's housing benefit had been £700 a week, but it was now costing nearly the same amount every night for them to stay in the hotel. Labour MP Karen Buck said it was a scandalous waste of money. She said: 'These families have been losing their homes because of the cuts in housing benefit, Westminster Council cheerleading for those cuts, and now we find they are pouring money into hotels to have to house those families who have lost their homes.' Conservative councillor Jonathan Glaz said: 'The scale of the problem I think is somewhat unprecedented in so much as we have large numbers of people presenting as homeless and we don't have immediately opportunity to put them into self-contained accommodation or into social homes immediately.' A Westminster Council spokesman was unavailable for comment this evening.

Isabel Oakeshott of The Sunday Times said Pryce was devastated by the collapse of the marriage . Vicky Pryce was described yesterday as a ‘broken woman’ after her marriage to Chris Huhne broke down following his affair with Carina Trimingham. Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott, who conspired with Pryce to bring down Huhne over the speeding points, told the court that the economist was ‘constantly on the verge of tears’. She said: ‘It was the extraordinary contrast between this tough and successful professional woman wearing a suit and high heels, beautifully presented, but that seemed to be armour for her. She was very emotional in fact. ‘Her marriage had collapsed in the most traumatic and horrible of circumstances. She was clearly absolutely devastated.’ Pryce confessed her role in taking her husband’s speeding tickets to the journalist who she saw as her ‘soulmate’. She said she ‘rather liked’ Miss Oakeshott because she was also juggling a personal and professional life. But their relationship ended when Pryce ignored Miss Oakeshott’s plea for help with a follow-up as the controversy raged around them. Miss Oakeshott earlier told the court that Pryce would often send emails in the early hours, adding: ‘This was a broken woman.’ Pryce told Miss Oakeshott she was hopeful of getting a place on the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, and even suggested she had been approached by the Lib Dems as a potential candidate for the House of Lords. The pair met in a queue at the 2010 Lib Dem conference in Liverpool after being introduced by Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a distant cousin of the journalist. Speaking of this first meeting, Pryce said: ‘I have to say I had rather liked her when I met her. ‘She seemed to be a sort of soulmate, managing children, work, and I trusted her because she was related to someone who was a very, very good friend of mine’ Over the following months they struck up an apparently close relationship, meeting for lunch and exchanging dozens of emails. It was during one lunch at a restaurant called Christopher’s, in  Covent Garden, that Pryce revealed the crime she committed for her husband. Giving evidence yesterday, Miss Oakeshott said she did not even understand the ‘concept’ of swapping points at first. Isabel Oakeshott of the Sunday Times also gave evidence in court . Describing the ‘quite brief’ conversation, she said: ‘I remember she leaned forward to me and said something like, “I took his points”. ‘I didn’t know what she was talking about. She has a slight foreign accent. I didn’t hear quite what she said and wasn’t sure what she was referring to.’ Pryce at court yesterday. She described the first time Pryce told her she had taken her husband's points . She added: ‘That was clearly interesting and a very serious allegation against a very senior Government minister.’ It emerged in court yesterday that it was Pryce’s idea to record telephone conversations with Huhne in an attempt to catch him implicating himself. The attempt was unsuccessful but the pair continued to work together over the first story, claiming ‘someone close to’ Huhne took his points for him. In the course of the emails, Pryce told Miss Oakeshott she wanted to ‘nail’ her ex-husband for leaving her. In court yesterday, she said: ‘I am not very proud of those emails, I was definitely in a bit of a state of shock. 'I thought I had found a soulmate with whom I was discussing personal issues I would not have used anywhere else.’ She said she thought Miss Oakeshott ‘exaggerated’ when she said the claims would probably end his career. She said: ‘I personally never thought he would resign over something like that. He is very strong-minded and very little really affects him if he is determined to survive it.’ In an email to Pryce in early 2011, Miss Oakeshott suggests she could be in line for a peerage. She wrote: ‘It seems like you have a really good chance of joining the MPC... perhaps the House of Lords. It’s not worth jeopardising that if it can be avoided.'

French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler has been accused of abandoning her socialist principles to embrace a new life of luxury with the wealthy elite. A critical analysis in a magazine points to her appearance at couture fashion shows while millions of workers face job losses and pay cuts. The article, in the weekly title VSD, described the 47-year-old left-wing journalist’s appearance with France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, as a ‘PR disaster’ and an example of her ‘indifference’ to the plight of struggling families. It suggests she is following the footsteps of former queen Marie Antoinette, who was pilloried for her frivolous lifestyle and beheaded during the French Revolution in 1793. 'PR disaster:  A magazine has accused French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler (left) of abandoning her socialist principles after she appeared with France's richest man Bernard Arnault (right) ‘Mixing with the elite has always had the power to anaesthetise the conscience and Valerie Trierweiler clearly hasn’t been able to hold out against this for long,’ it said. Ms Trierweiler met President Francois Hollande, 57, at a political rally 15 years ago and they have been a couple for five years. She has sparked frequent controversy for her highly public attacks on Mr Hollande’s previous girlfriend and former presidential candidate Segolene Royal, with whom he has four children. The weekly magazine VSD went on to say: 'While thousands of French are fighting to avoid redundancy, she attended the fashion shows. Companion: Ms Trierweiler, pictured here with President Francois Hollande, who she met at a political rally 15 years ago. They have been a couple for five years . 'This woman who professed to be ""socialist to her soul"" seems to prefer supporting the one industry that has no need of her help - the luxury fashion world. 'It sends out a very mixed message to the millions of voters who elected her partner to office hoping for a change in morals and mentality. 'Instead of choosing to support welders or other workers, she has chosen to offer her presence to Yves Saint Laurent and the entire luxury industry.'","French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler appeared with France's richest man .

A popular doctor is battling for his life after becoming engulfed in flames when a petrol can exploded as he lit a bonfire in his garden. Dr Darryl Peel, 51, suffered horrific burns and is in an induced coma after the freak accident at his home in Huntingfield, near Halesworth, Suffolk, on Wednesday. The father-of-three managed to stagger back indoors and drench himself in cold water before a friend dialled 999. His distraught wife Susie Peel, 47, said last night it was 'touch and go' whether her husband would survive. Dr Peel, who works as a GP at Framlingham Medical Practice, is set to undergo six hours of emergency surgery before being put in an induced coma for at least six weeks to help him recover. He was flown to a specialist . burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, by East Anglian . Air Ambulance helicopter after the dramatic incident. Mrs Peel said the well-known GP had decided to have a bonfire at home. But after Dr Peel had primed it she thinks a random spark hit a nearby petrol can which then exploded. Mrs Peel said: 'He is to have six hours of surgery and is in an induced coma for six weeks to help him recover. 'Obviously we are hoping he will be able to recover and return to his patients.' Dr Peel worked at Cutlers Hill Surgery, Halesworth, for 10 years until 2003, when the family emigrated to Australia.

Children took pictures and laughed while a young mother was tossed on to a pyre of tyres and burned alive, after being accused of killing a neighbour's six-year-old son with sorcery. Kepari Leniata, 20, 'confessed' after she was dragged from her hut, stripped naked and tortured with white-hot iron rods. She was then dragged to a local rubbish dump, doused in petrol and, with hands and feet bound, thrown on a fire of burning tyres. As the mother-of-two screamed in agony, more petrol-soaked tyres were thrown on top of her. She was torched by villagers who claimed she killed a six-year-old boy through sorcery, with police outnumbered by onlookers and unable to intervene . The horrendous scene took place in in the village of . Paiala, in the highlands of Papua New Guinea where many believe that witchcraft exists and sorcery is used to kill enemies. The head bishop of a Lutheran Church located in the district today condemned the killing. ‘Sorcery . and sorcery-related killings are growing and the government needs to . come up with a law to stop such practice,’ David Piso told The National . newspaper. ‘Many innocent and helpless people . have been killed and tortured after being accused of witchcraft, but . taking a life is against the teachings of the Bible and the laws of the . country,’ he said. The tragedy unfolded after Miss Leniata's . young neighbour fell sick on Tuesday morning. He complained of pains in . the stomach and chest and was taken to Mt Hagen hospital where he died a . few hours later. Still alive: Sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote villages in Papua New Guinea's highlands . The boy who died had been complaining of pains in the stomach and chest and had been taken to Mt Hagen hospital . Relatives of the boy were suspicious . that witchcraft was involved in the death and learned that two women had . gone into hiding in the jungle. After they were tracked down, the pair admitted they practised sorcery but had nothing to do with the boy's death. Miss Leniata, they said, was the person responsible. The boy's family went to her hut at 7am on Wednesday, stripped her and dragged her away to torture and death. Pictures of the horrific scene were soon circulating online. The . Post Courier newspaper said the torture and brutal murder of a mother of . two ‘provided a photo opportunity for many of the onlookers, including . school children, who crowded around and took photos of the woman being . consumed alive by the fire.’ Police who rushed to the area were . turned back by the angry crowd, but were able to drive away with one of . the other women while the second has fled. Part of the culture: Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea, which brought in a Sorcery Act to protect against attacks on those accused of practising black magic (file picture) Breaking the law: The criminalisation of sorcery has seen several cases of violent vigilante action against 'witches' and 'sorcerers' in highland villages . Sorcery and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. Papua New Guinean police have launched a murder . investigation and are reportedly preparing charges against those . responsible. A firetruck which had been called to the scene was chased away by the crowd. Authorities and international diplomats have spoken out against the torching of the young mother, leaves behind two children, the youngest an eight-month-old girl. The country's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has sworn to bring the killers to justice, as he addressed the matter in a statement today. ‘No one commits such a despicable act in the society that all of us, including Kepari, belong to,' he said. ‘Barbaric killings connected with alleged sorcery. Violence against women because of this belief that sorcery kills. These are becoming all too common in certain parts of the country. 'It is reprehensible that women, the old and the weak in our society should be targeted for alleged sorcery or wrongs that they actually have nothing to do with.’ The U.S. embassy on the Papua New Guinea issued a statement condemning the ""’brutal murder’ calling it evidence of ‘pervasive gender-based violence’. ’We add our voice to those of Papua New Guinean religious and civil society leaders who have spoken out against the brutality inflicted upon Ms Leniata,’ the embassy said. ‘There is no possible justification for this sort of violence. We hope that appropriate resources are devoted to identifying, prosecuting, and punishing those responsible for Ms Leniata's murder.’","Police turned back by lynch mob in highlands of Papua New Guinea .

Having employees on maternity leave generally affects small businesses far more than large organisations employing tens of thousands of people. Pregnant workers are entitled to 52 weeks of Statutory Maternity Leave, no matter how long they have been with an employer, how many hours they work or how much they are paid. Employers are unable to change the employee’s contract terms and conditions without agreement during maternity leave - if they do, they are in breach of contract. If they take on a temporary worker to fill a gap, the new employee is entitled to full employment rights after 12 weeks' work, according to EU rules. Any mother who decides they no longer want to return to their full contractual hours can tell their employer up to eight weeks before they return to work and the employer must endeavour to accommodate any request for part-time flexible working.

How do you dress appropriately to battle the UK's freezing conditions en route and air-conditioning on board but also handle the heat when you step off the plane at your final destination? Now, for the first time, the ultimate travel outfit has been created which allows women to combat this tricky fashion dilemma. Ultimate travel outfit: TravelSupermarket have unveiled this outfit which allows women to unzip bits of a warm hooded jacket and transform it into a strapless dress or mini-skirt . The Winter Sun Travel Outfit allows women to unzip parts of a warm hooded jacket and remove them, transforming the cosy garment into a strapless dress or mini-skirt ready for arrival in sunnier climes. The quirky new outfit is the ideal item of clothing for holidaymakers and is even equipped with a inflatable pillow for sleeping on the plane. By zipping various elements on or off, it can be worn as a winter outfit or one of two summer styles. The changeable options for the item include the jacket with a hood and mittens, a strapless dress and a mini-skirt. Snuggle up: Perfect for long haul flights to sunnier climes, the outfit even comes with a pillow . Unzip: By zipping various elements on or off, it can be worn as a winter outfit or one of two summer styles - a strapless dress with handy bag, or a reversible orange or black mini skirt with jersey bolero . Meanwhile, wearers can fashion the jacket sleeves into a useful shoulder bag if they opt for the above-the-knee dress design. Holiday comparison site TravelSupermarket made the outfit after a study found 57 per cent of holidaymakers have stepped off a plane in unsuitable clothing. What's more, one in four travellers say changes in climate when they are travelling is a hassle. A third of respondents said they normally wear layers and strip off when they get to their destination. But, the all-purpose outfit removes the trouble of having to switch clothes in the plane toilet, as 10 per cent of us have resorted to in the past.

The Winter Sun Travel Outfit has been made with comfort in mind and is designed to accommodate long flights. And as two thirds of us consider comfort to be the most important element when travelling, it includes an inflatable pillow attached to the collar. Comfort: Over three quarters of mothers say it is imperative their children are comfortable when travelling . TravelSupermarket have accommodated for children too having created a similar design to be used by youngsters. The child's green, all-in-one outfit has easy access allowing for smooth nappy changes and a GPS tracker for parents to ensure their little ones are safe. Over three quarters (76 per cent) of mothers say it is imperative their children are comfortable when travelling. Both the outfits, the adult and the child version, are made from materials that are both heat retentive and breathable. Bob Atkinson, a spokesman for TravelSupermarket, said: 'For holidaymakers, deciding what to wear when travelling is a constant dilemma. 'Dressing appropriately for the UK weather as well as for the climate at the destination can prove a struggle. 'For mums it proves even more problematic because they also need to plan and for their children. 'We've created a comfortable, stylish outfit to make travelling easier so holidaymakers don't have to worry about what to travel in.

The 24-year-old singer, who recently admitted she was back together with the R&B star, followed him into the Los Angeles courthouse for his latest hearing stemming from his 2009 assault of her. According to sources on TMZ, Rihanna 'blew Chris a kiss and said some supportive words to him before he entered the courtroom.' Scroll down for video . Heading to court: Rihanna accompanied Chris Brown to court with his mother Joyce Hawkins as he prepared for another probation hearing . Brown was in court to hear allegations from the Los Angeles prosecutors office that he may have lied about completing his community service. TMZ reports the judge ordered Brown to meet with his probation officer in Los Angeles within 48 hours to discuss the allegations. The judge scheduled another hearing on April 5 due to needing 'more time' to review the evidence presented by Los Angeles prosecutors. He also needs to speak to the probation officers. Rihanna, 24 and Brown, 23, then left the courtroom 'arm in arm' with Brown looking 'dejected,' added TMZ. Shows of support: Chris Brown was accompanied by his mother Joyce Hawkins and Rihanna . Earlier, the couple had left Brown's home together with the star carrying his suit under his arm. Rihanna wore sunglasses and kept her head . down with her long hair partially covering her face. The . couple were also accompanied by Brown's mother Joyce Hawkins amid . allegations that Brown  'lied about completing community service hours,' which formed part of his probation deal. Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos and the Richmond Virginia Police Department have vociferously denied the allegations. Mr Geragos gave a news conference . after the hearing on Wednesday where he said: 'I have never had a client . who has been tortured like Chris Brown has.' He added that Rihanna had been in court to 'support' Brown and was unimpressed with the allegations. '[She's] completely supportive,' he said. 'She thinks it's utterly ridiculous to him.' Expressing his fury at the District Attorney's Office, Mr Geragos said: 'The D.A. is paralysed with the thought . his probation will be terminated.  If that happens they won't be able to . jock him around like they've been jocking him around.' Sombre: Chris Brown appeared in court in Los Angeles on Wednesday with his lawyer Mark Geragos . More time: Brown will have to return to court on April 5 for another hearing . Brown was in court following allegations by L.A. prosecutors on Tuesday that there is no credible evidence he . completed his community service sentence for beating Rihanna, and citing . several other incidents that they say point to anger management issues with the singer. The Los . Angeles County district attorney's office filed a motion which focuses on issues with . Brown's community labour in Virginia, citing numerous discrepancies and . claiming the R&B singer was essentially  unsupervised. Brown . is reported by E! News to have slammed the allegations on his Instagram . account, writing: 'I can handle the hate but enough is enough yo! 'Im a . human being and I honestly think I deserve respect i'm sick of being . accused…I'm just tired of this sh**. 'A day in my shoes is a day in hell,' he added. Meanwhile, a source told Radar that an attorney for the Richmond Police Department has sent a letter to Los Angeles prosecutors stating they are 'completely in the wrong when it comes . to their claims about Chris’s community service.' Ready for court: Chris Brown left his Los Angeles home with Rihanna on Wednesday morning with the singer carrying his suit . Grim: Chris looked in serious mood as he left his home amid allegations he may not have completed his community service hours as claimed . Mr Geragos is also said to be filing a . motion to Tuesday's motion insisting 'there is solid evidence that . Chris didn't lie and that he fully complied with his probation and . community service obligations. TMZ reports Geragos' filing also includes 'invoices and checks indicating Chris paid $31,534.70 to the Richmond PD for providing security during his labor details'. The District Attorney claims Chris did not pay such a sum. An insider meanwhile told Radar: 'Richmond P.D. is extremely upset about the allegations and believe that . prosecutors are just ignoring the facts. Separately, several . firefighters have voluntarily contacted Geragos and said they witnessed . Chris performing his community service hours. Coming: Chris Brown was spotted returning home after his court appearance in a dressed down mode . And going: While Rihanna was spotted leaving the singer's home in jogging bottoms and a sports jersey . Quick exit: The singer was in no mood to run behind schedule as she quickly headed to her waiting transport . 'Chris is ready to face the . judge today and truthfully answer any questions about the charges. He . has nothing to hide.' On Tuesday, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed: 'Chris Brown failed to provide ""credible or verifiable . evidence""' that he completed his court ordered community labour. Mr Geragos labelled the filing 'frivolous and defamatory', and added he planned on seeking sanctions against prosecutors. Showing her support: Brown's probation stems from his 2009 assault of Rihanna who has since forgiven him . Defiant: Brown is reported to have used his private Instagram account to deny the allegations about his probation . 'The motion filed by the DA's office is . shameful and a disgrace,' Mr Geragos said. 'In essence, it calls everyone a . liar in the Richmond Police Department and the Virginia Probation . Department.' He claimed prosecutors ignored interviews 'where . sworn peace officers stated unequivocally that Mr Brown was supervised . and did all of the community service.' He added: 'I plan on asking for . sanctions from the DA's office for filing in frivolous, scurrilous and . frankly defamatory motion.' A spokeswoman for the district . attorney's office declined to comment on Mr Geragos's statement. Out together: Chris Brown and Rihanna were pictured leaving a recording studio together in the early hours of Wednesday morning . Driving home: Brown drove Rihanna back to his home . Low key: The couple looked casual as they drove away together, with Rihanna sporting a baseball cap and Brown wearing a trilby . The prosecution's motion also notes several incidents in which Brown lost his temper, including throwing a chair through a window after a . Good Morning America interview in which he was asked about his assault . of Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards. The . report cites Brown's recent fight with R&B singer Frank Ocean, . including Ocean's allegation that Brown 'threatened to shoot him in the . brawl over a parking space,' according to a police report of the . incident. Ocean suffered cuts on his right index finger and minor cuts to his left temple. Police officials say they . are unlikely to seek charges against Brown for fight with Ocean, after . Ocean posted online that he does not intend to seek criminal or civil . penalties. Judge Patricia Schnegg ordered Brown . to . perform 180 days of community service after he accepted a plea deal of . community labour, five years' formal probation and domestic violence . counselling back in 2009. Serving the community: Brown pictured back in 2009 doing community service near the Richmond Police Mounted Patrol stables in Virginia . As they were: Brown pictured with Rihanna back in 2008 prior to the assault in February the following year . The new prosecutor's motion asks the judge to order the singer to repeat his entire 180-day service . sentence in Los Angeles. Brown had been given permission to perform . clean up and manual labour duties in his home state of Virginia. But LA prosecution . investigators claim they found no evidence he completed his work as ordered. Richmond Virginia police chief Bryan Norwood was tasked with supervising Brown and submitted paperwork last year indicating the singer had completed his sentence. However, prosecutors allege there are . numerous shortcomings and possible misstatements in those records, . which show the singer performing double shifts in the city and at a day . care centre where his mother once worked. 'This . inquiry provided no credible, competent or verifiable evidence that . defendant Brown performed his community labour as presented to this . court,' Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray writes in the filings. She alleges that the records submitted by Norwood are 'at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting.' Richmond . police spokesman Gene Lepley declined to discuss the allegations, . saying: 'We believe it would be inappropriate to comment on a matter . that's before the court.' According to the motion, officials . with Virginia's probation office told investigators that Brown's . arrangement to be supervised by Norwood was 'extremely unusual' and had . not been approved by the agency. No one from Virginia's probation . department oversaw Brown's hours, the filing states. The . motion notes that the only records the department has to indicate Brown . was supervised were officers' overtime sheets. But five of 21 days that . officers logged overtime for Brown were spent providing security for . the singer's concerts. Around one-third of Brown's community hours were logged at a daycare centre where the singer spent time as a child and where his mother once served as director, it has been reported. The prosecution motion says a . detective checked on Brown on only nine occasions when he was working . there. Each time, the singer was found at the centre, accompanied by his . mother and a bodyguard but no law enforcement personnel. Chris Brown left his home with a tub of  Bronner Brothers Super Gro Hair Aid on Wednesday, prompting speculation that the 23-year-old R&B star is worried about hair loss. The product is is rich in various proteins, sulphur, and sage, contains vitamins, mineral and coconut oils, and promises to 'relieve itchy scalps, splitting ends, and promote healthy hair with an abundance of rich minerals and nutrients.' It is not clear whether the hair loss product is for Brown himself, or why he needed it as he headed to his probation hearing at a Los Angeles court. The star usually wears his hair in a short, cropped style, but is often seen sporting a baseball hat or trilby.",Lawyer said Rihanna was there to 'support' Brown and thinks probation allegations are 'ridiculous'

A devoted wife died of cancer after washing her husband and son's work overalls everyday for 20 years. Grandmother Valerie Ward, 78, breathed in asbestos fibres as she shook out her painter husband Eric and son Adrian's work clothes, with the couple both contracting cancer. While Eric survived Valerie died just ten weeks after being diagnosed with mesothelioma on her lungs, an inquest heard. Valerie Ward, 78 is pictured here with her husband of 58 years Eric. The couple are said to have done 'everything' together . A verdict of death by industrial disease was recorded confirming that she died from . mesothelioma as the result of washing the overalls when her husband and son . returned from Aberthaw Power Station near Cardiff. Her daughter Avril Ward, 49, said: 'Mum died probably 10 years before she should have. 'My dad worked at the power station for 20 odd years and was a fitter's mate before he became a painter there. 'Mum always washed his overalls after work. She wasn't aware of the dangers of the dust and fibres on them. 'He lost a lot of colleagues and friends to mesothelioma. Not a lot was known about it then and very little protection was offered at that time.' Husband Eric, now 85, is being treated for asbestos plaques in his lungs but has been left devastated mourning his wife. Avril said: 'Mum and dad were sweethearts and had a fantastic life together. 'They did everything together and when dad retired they travelled the world and had 58 wonderful years together. 'It was just 10 weeks from when mum was diagnosed to when she died. It was very quick.' Husband Eric (left) is  devastated following the untimely death of his wife of 58 years (right) Eric with daughter Avril who said that her mother wanted to have any compensation donated to the hospice she lived in . Her family won a compensation payment of £8,775 which was donated to a hospice run by the Marie Curie Cancer Care charity. Valerie, of Barry, South Wales, died in the Holm Towers hospice run by the charity. Her daughter said: 'Mum went to Holm Towers and we were very grateful she was able to go to the hospice as she had multiple cancers. 'We want people to be made aware of asbestos as it doesn't come out until later in life long after you've been exposed to it. 'It's a shock to lose a parent and as quickly as we did. 'Whatever we were going to get was always going to go to Holm Towers. It's nice to be able to give something back they were amazing.' A spokesman for solicitors Lyons Davidson, who worked with the family, said Britain has the highest incidences of mesothelioma in the world. She said: 'Twice as many people in this country die from mesothelioma as die in road accidents.'","Valerie Ward, 78, died from mesothelioma after ingesting asbestos fibres .

Boeing has asked for permission to start test flights of its 787 Dreamliner as the investigation into the battery fires which have grounded the flagship aircraft continues. The company is awaiting the green light from the U.S Federal Aviation Administration to resume flights with test planes so that investigators can study the lithium-ion packs in the air. A decision has not yet been made but analysts expect Boeing to be given the go-ahead. Positive step: Boeing has asked for permission to carry out fresh test flights with the 787 Dreamliner jet . The move comes despite shocking images which were released yesterday of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in Japan. Pictures released by the Japanese Transportation Safety Board showed the blackened lithium device with frayed and broken earth wire. Investigators are trying to establish the cause of an in-flight fire which forced an All Nippon Airways flight to make an emergency landing in Japan last month. All 50 Boeing 787s belonging to eight airlines in seven different countries remain grounded while investigations continue. CAT scans of the overheated . lithium ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a . week earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency . landing in Boston. The . latest probe is said to have found evidence of short-circuiting and . 'thermal runaway' - a chemical reaction which causes overheating. The . All Nippon Airways flight made an emergency landing in western Japan . after a cockpit message warned of battery problems and a burning smell . was detected in the cockpit and cabin. Charred to a crisp: The burnt out remains of the lithium battery from a Boeing 787 which investigators are examining in Japan . Grounded: The fire on board an All Nippon Airways flight forced the plane to make an emergency landing last month . Damage: A ground wire which was attached to the burnt battery is showed charred, frayed and broken . An . investigator in Japan at the time said the burned insides of the . plane's lithium ion battery showed the battery received voltage in . excess of its design limits. But on Monday Boeing filed a request with the FAA to resume test flights to establish whether conditions in-flight are linked to the battery problems. The company performed thousands of hours of tests on the six-jet development fleet before the plane’s 2011 commercial debut. But a week ago, Elon Musk, the . founder of Tesla Motors said the batteries used by Boeing in its . Dreamliner aircraft are 'inherently unsafe' - after it emerged that an . airline replaced the batteries ten times before all 787s were grounded. All . Nippon Airways said it had to replace the batteries on its 787 . aircraft ten times because they failed to charge properly or showed . other problems. Flagship: The Boeing Dreamliner has been hailed as the next step forward in aviation history - but has been beset by problems from the start . And Japan Airlines also said it had replaced batteries on the 787 'on a few occasions'. Lithium . ion batteries are more susceptible to catching fire when they overheat . and are more likely to short-circuit than other types of batteries. Boeing . built in safeguards to gain safety certification for use of the . relatively light and powerful batteries to power various electrical . systems on the 787, the world's first airliner made mostly from . lightweight composite materials. The string of disasters could . potentially cost Boeing billions although shares rose 0.9 percent to $75.89 at the close in New York yesterday. The . Dreamliner has been seen as key a part in Boeing's plans to take on European giants .

A Russian cult leader has been jailed for 11 years for raping and sexually assaulting his followers. Konstantin Rudnev, 45, forced his disciples to take part in orgies, occultism, and drug-trafficking, a court in Novosibirsk, Siberia heard. Former Red Army conscript Rudnev, a self-proclaimed alien god from the star Sirius, demanded blind submission from his followers mainly aged between 14 and 30. Cult leader: Konstantin Rudnev has been jailed for 11 years after Russian authorities spent over a decade trying to bring him to justice . ‘Rudnev's cult members often lost their money and property and abandoned their relatives and friends, and many of them were reported missing,’ reported the Siberian Times. ‘After joining up, females were forced to take part in ‘ritual rapes’ and orgies with Rudnov and other cult leaders, the court was told.’ One mother told how her son took up yoga classes with the sect - called Ashram Shambala - when he was 15, and three years later vanished after joining his 30,000 followers. More than a dozen followers gave evidence against Rudnev and shocking videos were also found showing how some Ashram Shambala followers were subjected to violence and sexual abuse. Predator: Rudnev's cult Ashram Shambala had over 30,000 followers devoted to his teachings which saw them cut all ties with their families and take part in drugs trafficking and sex orgies . Media reports suggest some victims were under age. His sect was set up before the collapse of the USSR but earlier attempts to convict him over a 12 year period had failed because his ‘victims’ refused to testify against him in court, said prosecutors who had sought a 15 year sentence. Rudnev claims to his followers that he was sent to Earth to enlighten mankind, drawing up his own bizarre teachings called ‘The Way of a Fool’ which mocked traditional views of family life, study and work. He was also convicted of creating a religious organisation infringing on people's personalities and rights. The sect was lucrative and he became a multi-millionaire, preying on the vulnerable in a country undergoing massive transformations after the collapse of Soviet rule. Guilty: Female members of Rudnev's cult were forced to take part in 'ritual rapes' some of which were reported to have been underage at the time . He ran yoga seminars to lure young people who then disowned their families and gave their life savings and property to his Ashram Shambala sect. According to him, his eccentric ’teachings’ took elements from the Bible, the Koran, Karmasutra, shamanism, paganism and tantric sex. Prosecutors alleged his methods were sinister and involved the brainwashing of vulnerable people. When he was arrested some 15 people - including a 14 year girl from Belarus - were on police search lists after being reported missing by relatives. Rudnev's lawyer Alexander Nizhinsky said: ‘We think the verdict announced today was not very objective.’ In 2004, a psychological commission found him criminally insane and he was placed in a mental hospital, but later escaped.","Russian Konstantin Rudnev's cult Ashram Shambala had 30,000 followers .

The wife of a Cabinet minister risked a security alert after accidentally posting her husband’s mobile phone number online. Journalist Sarah Vine released the number of Education Secretary Michael Gove to her 5,000 followers. Despite the bungle, aides say the senior Conservative will not be changing his number which he has had for years. IT lessons: Education Secretary Michael Gove has his private mobile phone number posted on Twitter by his journalist wife Sarah Vine . The couple have been married since 2001 and have a son and a daughter. She has often risked causing her husband embarrassment, using her newspaper column to reveal toe-curling secrets about their relationship. She has claimed Mr Gove is ‘the worst driver in England, possibly the Western world’, accused him of being a ‘lunatic’ who scrapes the sauce off lasagne and revealed he ‘loves nothing more than a pair of dead man's trousers’ by shopping in charity shops. In a late-night blunder on Twitter, Ms Vine thought she was sending a private message to another journalist. But instead she posted his mobile number on the public website for anyone to see. Sarah Vine is a prolific user of Twitter, but blundered after posting a the phone number on her timeline instead of sending a direct message to journalist . The message was intended for online magazine editor Milo Yiannopoulos who replied: ‘Might want to delete that tweet.’ The message was removed, but not before being seen by many users. On tweeter, @thedharmblues, wrote: ‘Sarah Vine is married to Michael Gove, right? Has she just accidentally tweeted his mobile number?’ A source close to Mr Gove said the offending tweet was only visible for a few minutes. The . source told The Sun: ‘It was meant to a direct message. Michael has had . the same number for years, so he's not going to change it.’ It . is not the first time the couple have had phone trouble. In September . they accidentally took each other's iPhone to work after one of their . children swapped the covers. Ms Vine, pictured with David Cameron's wife Samantha, has previously used her newspaper column to make embarrassing revelations about her Cabinet minister husband . Mis-firing private messages on Twitter have caught out other politicians in the past. Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne was left red-faced after apparently trying to tell a journalist he could not be linked to a story. 'From someone else fine but I do not want my fingerprints on the story', the then-Energy Secretary wrote in October 2011, before admitting he had made a 'fairly marginal' error. Mr Gove's boss David Cameron famously warned of the perils of Twitter, when he blurted out on Absolute Radio that 'too many tweets might make a t***'. However the PM has since gone back on his own advice and joined the microblogging website, quickly building more than 200,000 followers.","Education Secretary Michael refuses to change number despite being seen online by thousands .

Tycoon: Michelle Mone has wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share . She left him amid furious claims he had an affair with one of their lingerie designers. Now underwear tycoon Michelle Mone – creator of the Ultimo push up bra – has wrested control of her business empire from the hands of her former husband Michael after agreeing to buy his share for an estimated £24million. The pair, who divorced last month, said they had finally put an end to a year-long legal wrangle today with an ‘amicable agreement’. Mrs Mone, 41, confirmed her former husband left the company they founded together in a statement, saying: ‘I’m delighted after a tough year this has all come to an end. ‘Michael has left Ultimo today. My focus is my children & growing Ultimo to the next level.’ According to public accounts, Mr Mone, 45, owned just under 48 per cent of the £50million company’s shares – one more than his wife – meaning she may have had to pay him almost £24million to gain control of the business. Mrs Mone called an end to their 20-year marriage in December 2011. Months later, she claimed he cheated on her with an Ultimo designer, saying: ‘You have to trust your team but there was a lot of deceit and lies – it changed the whole company.’ The businesswoman reportedly hired a private investigator to photograph her husband with the woman, later identified as Samantha Bunn, 31. She later sacked the pretty brunette, who received a £10,000 pay off last year after threatening to launch a case for unfair dismissal. Mr Mone denied cheating, saying: ‘Prior to our split, there was no relationship. If anyone is saying that is the reason for the split, that is untrue.’ The pair founded their lingerie firm, called MJM International, from a spare bedroom in 1996 and launched the first Ultimo bra in 1999. Modelled by stars including Penny Lancaster and Rachel Hunter – as well as Mrs Mone herself – its cleavage enhancing qualities proved a huge hit with millions of women. Deal: The pair, pictured here in Edinburgh, divorced last month and today said they had come to an 'amicable agreement' over the business . Model: Mrs Mone claimed her former husband was furious when she lost six stone and started modelling her own range . Its popularity was boosted in 2000 when Julia Roberts wore one of the bras for her role in Erin Brockovich. Mrs Mone embraced the limelight as the company’s public face, and boosted her profile with TV appearances on Masterchef and The Apprentice. In 2010, she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business. Divorced: Mrs Mone called an end to their 20-year marriage in December 2011, later claiming he cheated on her with an Ultimo designer . Meanwhile, Mr Mone, an accountant, preferred to stay in the background, managing the company’s finances and production line. She later claimed he was furious when she lost six stone and started modelling her own range, saying: ‘He was appalled I’d posed in my underwear. He didn’t speak to me for days.’ The pair, who have three children together, have now put their luxury home in Thorntonhall, Lanarkshire, up for sale. In a joint statement today, they said: ‘We are both saddened that our marriage has broken down, however we are pleased to confirm that we have reached an amicable agreement on all matters. ‘We wish each other all the best as we embark upon the next chapter of our lives and, as parents, are committed to continuing to work together in the best interests of our children. ‘This has been a difficult time for all involved and we would ask the media to please respect our privacy.’ Mrs Mone’s spokesman did not reply to a request for comment yesterday. Mrs Mone posted a picture of her lawyer on Twitter, saying: ‘Ha my lawyer is exhausted. I can’t thank you enough Tony Caplan x’ She added: ‘Ha he’s also very expensive, but he’s worth it. I can’t tell you how happy I am for my family & team at Ultimo.’ Recognition: Mrs Mone, who boosted her profile with TV appearances on Masterchef and The Apprentice, was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business in 2010 .","Ultimo creator pays ex-husband estimated £24million for share of business .

Correspondence: Ghandi sent the three-page typewritten letter to the British rulers in 1943 . A key letter written by Gandhi which has been described as 'the most significant' in Indian history is expected to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer. The three-page typewritten correspondence was sent to the British rulers by the father of the Indian nation while he was under house arrest in 1943. Written from the Aga Khan Palace in Pune, Gandhi made a reasoned plea for his and his followers' release from captivity. In it he describes his detention as 'a waste of public funds' while millions of Indians starved to death. He added selflessly: 'I should be quite content to pass my days in any prison.' Experts have described it as 'an incredibly important document in world history' because it also signifies his final emergence as the one man who could achieve the long awaited independence for India. Richard Westwood-Brookes, the Historical Documents Expert at Mullock's Auctioneers who are handling the sale, said: 'Letters of Gandhi are highly sought after around the world but this is without question one of the most significant letters. 'The letters that have appeared in recent years were saying things like 'thank you for my birthday present'. 'But this one is highly significant because for a start it's written from prison. 'It's written in 1943 and it signifies the moment he was taking on the whole leadership of non-violent moment. Auction: An historic letter written by Gandhi described as the most significant in Indian history is set to sell for £15,000 when it goes under the hammer next week . 'Gandhi is revered because he achieved independence for India without bloodshed but at this time the freedom movement were beginning to split up. 'He knew that there were two clear cut factions in the Congress - the first believed in non-violence, as was Gandhi's philosophy, while the second believed in armed struggle. 'This second group had already gone underground, splitting into two splinter groups. 'This letter, couched in coded diplomatic terms signifies Gandhi's desire to achieve a diplomatic strategical struggle for independence, and eventual successful establishment of the State of India. Important: Experts have described it as 'an incredibly important document in world history' because it also signifies his final emergence as the one man who could achieve the long awaited independence for India . 'If he had not managed to achieve it, goodness knows what catastrophe would have befallen Indian.' In the letter, which is addressed directly to the Additional Secretary of the Government of India in New Delhi, Gandhi brands his arrest a waste of energy and money and urges the authorities to lock him up in an ordinary jail. He writes: 'It is unthinkable that when India's millions are suffering from preventable starvation and thousands are dying of it, thousands of men and women should be kept in detention on mere suspicion when their energy and the expense incurred in keeping them under duress could at this critical time, be usefully employed in relieving distress... Distressed: In the letter he describes his detention as 'a waste of public funds' while millions of Indians starved to death . 'The huge place in which I am being detained with a large guard around me, I hold to be a waste of public funds. I should be quite content to pass my days in any prison.' Key sale: Richard Westwood Brooks, Historical Documents Expert at Mullock's Auctioneers, with the letter . But crucially the letter also refers to the resolution of the All India Congress held on August 8, 1942 where Gandhi had himself given a strong call of 'do or die' for Indian independence. In the letter, he adds: 'As the Government are aware I offered to meet the member of the Working Committee in order to discuss the situation and to know their mind. But my offer was rejected. 'I had thought and still think that my talk with them might have some value from the Government stand-point. 'Hence I repeat my offer. But it may have not such value so long as the Government doubt my bona fides. 'As a Satyagrahi however, in spite of the handicap, I must reiterate what I hold to be good and of immediate importance in terms of war effort. 'But if my offer has no chance of being accepted so long as I retain my present views, and if the Government think that it is only my evil influence that corrupts people, I submit that the members of the Working Committee and other detenus should be discharged.' Mr Westwood-Brookes added: 'This is an incredibly important document in world history. 'The huge place where he was being detained at this time is now a national shrine in India because of this association with Gandhi. 'But typically, we didn't listen to him or release him because of the letter. The only reason we release him was because his wife Kasturba died as did his right-hand man Mahadev Desai. 'And then Gandhi developed a very bad bout of malaria. 'The only reason we let him out in 1944 was because the British authorities did not want him to die in captivity and thus become a martyr to the cause of Indian independence.' The letter, which came from a member of Gandhi's freedom fighters in India, is going under the hammer at Mullock's Auctioneers' specialist sale of historical documents at Ludlow Racecourse, Shrops., next Thursday (14/2). It has an estimate of between £10,000 and £15,000 and the sale also features a large quantity of important Indian documents and artefacts, including manuscripts, letters, photographs and original art.","Three-page typewritten correspondence was written in 1943 .

Boeing were left to carry out their own safety checks on the lithium batteries that have grounded all their Dreamliner jets as there were no federal guidelines in existence at the time, it has emerged. When the disaster-stricken airliner was in development, Boeing was granted what the Federal Aviation Authority called 'special conditions,' for its planned use of the new lithium technology. By the time official guidelines for the batteries were created in 2008, the Dreamliner had already been approved so it did not have to meet them. Tailbacks: Dreamliners are seen parked nose-to-tail near the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington. The manufacturer has admitted delivery of the jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns . An investigation into last month's . battery fire in a Japan Airlines 787 'Dreamliner' while it was parked in . Boston, shows it began with multiple short-circuits in one of the . battery's eight cells. The results so far contradict some of . the assumptions that were made about the battery's safety at the time . the system won government approval, said the board's chairwoman, Deborah . Hersman. The NTSB investigation shows the fire started with multiple short-circuits in one of the battery's eight cells, she said. That created an uncontrolled chemical . reaction known as 'thermal runaway,' which is characterized by . progressively hotter temperatures. That spread the short-circuiting to the rest of the cells and caused the fire, she said. The findings are at odds with what . Boeing told the FAA when that agency was working to certify the . company's newest and most technologically advanced plane for flight, . Hersman said. Boeing said its testing showed that . even when trying to induce short-circuiting, the condition and any fire . were contained within a single cell, preventing thermal runaway and fire . from spreading, she told reporters at a news conference. Boeing's testing also showed the batteries were likely to cause smoke in only 1 in 10 million flight hours, she said. Link: Investigators found similar damage to the lithium ion battery to that suffered by a battery on another Dreamliner which was also forced to make an emergency landing in Boston last month . Charred: A CAT scan of the damaged battery shows that six of the battery's eight cells were all but destroyed . But the Boston fire was followed nine . days later by a smoking battery in an All Nippon Airways plane that made . an emergency landing in Japan. The 787 fleet has recorded less than . 100,000 flight hours, Hersman noted. The plane that caught fire in Boston . was delivered to Japan Airlines less than three weeks before the fire . and had recorded only 169 flight hours over 22 flights. 'There have now been two battery events resulting in smoke less than two weeks apart on two different aircraft,' Hersman said. 'This investigation has demonstrated . that a short circuit in a single cell can propagate to adjacent cells . and result in smoke and fire. The assumptions used to certify the . battery must be reconsidered.' Battery experts said Boeing could try . to build more safeguards into the battery by using a greater number of . smaller cells and putting more insulation between them. Or, they said, the aircraft maker . could switch to a different type of lithium ion battery already approved . for aviation. Some business jets use lithium ion batteries as their . main batteries. Switching to another type of battery, . such as lead-acid or nickel-cadmium battery, is another possibility, but . that would involve changing the charging system as well, they said. Deliveries of Boeing's Dreamliner . passenger jets will be delayed due to ongoing safety concerns, the . troubled manufacturer has admitted. Boeing . currently has orders for around 800 787s, however all 50 of the . problematic planes already supplied to airlines remain grounded until a . serious battery issue is fixed. Battery . malfunctions led to a fire on board a parked Japan Airlines (JAL) 787 . in Boston and an in-flight problem on another plane in Japan which was . forced to make an emergency landing. Airbus is considering dropping Lithium-Ion batteries and switching back to traditional units on its new A350 aircraft as safety investigators probe battery incidents on Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, several people familiar with the matter said. The move comes amid a wider rethink in the aerospace industry on whether the powerful but delicate backup energy systems are technically 'mature', they said. An Airbus spokesman said the company would study and evaluate the outcome of the ongoing U.S. battery investigation. 'Let's not get ahead of ourselves', he said. Airbus said last week it had a plan B and time to respond to any rule changes.France's Saft, which makes both the new and old generation of batteries for Airbus, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One operator, Norwegian Air Shuttle, . which is due to launch a long-haul service, said it now plans to lease . other aircraft to replace the 787s they have on order. Boeing had warned the Norwegian Air . that deliveries were uncertain because of the investigation by the US . National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). The carrier said in a statement this . morning: 'The extent of a possible delay and whether such delay will . affect later deliveries is presently not known. 'Norwegian is taking precautionary steps by planning for substitute aircraft capacity.' Earlier today the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration cleared Boeing Co . to restart test flights of its grounded 787 Dreamliner in order to get . more data on potentially faulty batteries. The groundings have cost airlines tens of millions of dollars, and there appears to be no end in sight. Norwegian Air Shuttle, which is aiming . to take on established airlines in the overseas sector,  was due to . take delivery of eight Dreamliners in April. The firm had already sold a number of discounted tickets for its first overseas flights. They added: 'In the event that the 787 . is not operational in time for Norwegian's services to New York and . Bangkok replacement long-haul aircraft will be leased to ensure flights . are operated as scheduled.'On Thursday a one-off flight was approved to move a 787 from Texas to Washington state, where Boeing is based for examination. The introduction of the Dreamliner has been fraught with difficulties from the start. The first three 787s were found to be . overweight. There were also problems sourcing certain parts and in the . development of the on board software. Test flights were delayed by a machinists strike and Rolls Royce was said to have struggled to supply the engines on time. Positive step: Boeing has been given permission to carry out fresh test flights with the 787 Dreamliner jet . In June 2010 Boeing stunned the . aviation industry by postponing the first flight indefinitely after . engineers discovered  structural flaws. Then in November that year a test . flight had to make an emergency landing in Laredo, Texas, after crew . notice smoke in the cabin. Earlier this week images of the charred remains of the battery which spontaneously combusted in Japan were released. Pictures released by the Japanese . Transportation Safety Board showed the blackened lithium device with . frayed and broken earth wire. Investigators are trying to establish . the cause of an in-flight fire which forced an All Nippon Airways flight . to make an emergency landing in Japan last month. CAT scans of the overheated lithium . ion battery revealed similar damage to an incident just over a week . earlier on January 7 which saw another Dreamliner make an emergency . landing in Boston. The latest probe is said to have found . evidence of short-circuiting and 'thermal runaway' - a chemical . reaction which causes overheating. Pilots . and safety advocates argued that it is too risky to fly with the . batteries on board at all if the plane's battery system makes it too . unsafe to fly. The . Dreamliner is the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium-ion . batteries. They charge faster and can be better moulded to space-saving . shapes compared with other aeroplane batteries. Mike . Sinnett, chief engineer on the 787, said last month that the plane's . batteries have operated through a combined 1.3 million hours and never . had an internal fault. He said they were built with multiple protections to ensure that failures 'don't put the airplane at risk'.","Boeing admits deliveries of new Dreamliner jets will be delayed .

Death: The body of violin teacher Frances Andrade, 48, who was sexually abused by the leading youth choir director and his wife, was found at her home less than a week after she gave evidence against them . A violinist killed herself after being branded a liar and a fantasist by a female barrister defending the man who sexually abused her. Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose half-way through the trial of choirmaster Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, both 68. Jurors, who were not told of the tragedy, convicted the pair of six counts of indecent assault yesterday. Mrs Andrade had been a reluctant witness and her family said she had been ‘kept in the dark’ about how tough the trial would be. During a heated cross-examination, the mother of four angrily denied claims from defence lawyers she had invented the abuse by her ex-teacher. Following one emotional exchange, Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘This feels like rape all over again.’ A week later she was found dead at her home. Following yesterday’s guilty verdicts, her family said they were convinced her court ordeal led to her death. Her son Olly, 21, who sat through her harrowing evidence, said: ‘Being repeatedly called a liar and a fantasist about a horrific part of her life in front of a court challenged her personal integrity and was more than even she could bear.’ Mrs Andrade’s husband Levine, 57, also testified at the trial and said she had been completely distraught at the idea of the past being ‘churned up’ and had been upset for weeks after being interviewed by police. Mrs Andrade told Manchester Crown Court Mr Brewer groomed her for sex from the age of 14 and started to molest her in his office, practice rooms and his camper van. The rape and indecent assault allegations dated back to the late 1970s and early 80s. She said she felt pressurised to testify against Brewer after her close friend Jenevora Williams reported the abuse to police without her permission. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Michael Brewer, 68, left, and his . ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, right, have been found guilty of sexually . assaulting a former student of his 30 years ago.  Frances Andrade killed herself during the trial . The jury heard that the police investigation was sparked by National Youth Choir teacher Jenavora . At the subsequent trial, Mr Brewer was forced to admit he had stripped and fondled another pupil – a 17-year-old head girl – in his office at Chetham’s School of Music in the mid-1990s. And he confirmed his departure from the school – officially on health grounds – had been a ‘cover-up’ that let him continue working with children. He co-founded the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain and was a highly respected figure in the world of music, with an OBE and appearances on the BBC’s Last Choir Standing. Brave: Mrs Andrade faced her abusers in the court by choice in a 'cathartic' experience, the judge in the case said . The tragic outcome of the trial raises new questions over how Britain’s legal system handles women who claim they have been raped. In her closing speech, defence QC Kate Blackwell – who describes herself as a single mother of four – told the jury her questions hadn’t been ‘designed to insult or demean Frances Andrade but to simply get to the bottom of the issues’. Judge Martin Rudland described her conduct as exemplary and said her questions had been ‘perfectly proper and completely professional’. After the case, Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said: ‘There is sometimes a very difficult balance to strike between protecting vulnerable witnesses and properly testing evidence so that juries are able to make informed decisions.’ But Yvonne Traynor, of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre, which had supported Mrs Andrade, said: ‘It is important that the judicial system looks at the emotional impact on a witness during the cross examination and that judges assiduously monitor the defence’s boundaries ensuring that the trial is a fair process and is not reduced to an attack on the witness.’ Mr Brewer, of Selly Oak, Birmingham, was found guilty of five counts of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15. Mrs Brewer, of Rossendale, Lancashire, was convicted of indecently assaulting her when she visited the then family home in Manchester aged 18. Mr Brewer was cleared of raping her at his home when she was 18 and Mrs Brewer was cleared of aiding and abetting rape. He was also cleared of indecently assaulting the victim as a child in his home. The pair were remanded in custody and ordered to sign the sex offenders register. They will be sentenced at a later date. Mr Brewer is accused of a string of assaults against a girl in the late 1970s and early 1980s while she was at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester, pictured . Claire Moreland, the head of Chetham’s, said the evidence of Brewer’s ‘appalling acts’ had ‘shocked us to the core’. The Crown Prosecution Service said Mrs Andrade was assisted by a witness care officer throughout.The judge told the jury in closed court about her tragic death after they had reached their verdicts. She taught the violin at a £25,000-a-year girls school in Surrey. Her husband is a leading viola player who performed on the Diana memorial recording of Candle in the Wind.

Tragic: Frances Andrade was said to have taken personal issue with questions asked by Kate Blackwell QC (pictured) representing Brewer. The judge indicated Miss Blackwell acted professionally, and right, Head of Chetham Music School Claire Moreland gives a statement after the trial . Convicted: Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were found guilty of indecently assaulting the victim but cleared of her rape . Frances Andrade was a hugely gifted violinist as a child whose talent shone through when she successfully auditioned to get into Chetham’s School of Music. She joined as a boarder shortly after the death of her adopted father, a vicar. Born in Hull in February 1964, she and her adoptive parents moved to Cheltenham when she was young. She doted on her father but life 'was hell' with her mother, she told the trial. Mrs Andrade, then known as Frances Shorney, told the court she had been raped by a family member from the age of eight although she did not confide in anyone at Chetham’s. Case: The jury at Manchester Crown Court was not told of the victim's death until after they reached their verdicts . As she became increasingly disruptive in class and was referred to see a hospital psychiatrist, it was decided she should live with the Brewers and their four daughters for a short spell. Several other boarders who were struggling with life away from home had already stayed with the family at their then home in Chorlton, Manchester. Mrs Andrade told the court she felt 'very loved' by the Brewers as she said 'it was the family I always wanted'. They all went on holiday together and attended music festivals. However, she claimed that Brewer was sexually abusing her at the time, both at school and in his house. 'A small price to pay' for the affection she received is how she saw it at the time, she said. Mrs Andrade said her past caught up with her at the Royal Academy and she 'went downhill'. She said she still managed to excel musically but in hindsight she thought she 'obviously had a breakdown'. It led to her giving up the violin professionally for 17 years from the age of 23, when she sold her instrument. 'There was a downward spiral that is continuing right now,' she told the jury. Following the verdicts, Mrs Andrade’s 21-year-old Cambridge undergraduate son Olly expressed the family’s sadness and anger at what happened. In a statement, he said: . ‘All who met her quickly realised what an amazing person Fran was. She was kind, loving and always full of life. ‘Extremely talented, she quickly ascended through the music world, winning numerous awards for her violin playing, which has been described as “the most passionate violin playing I have heard” and “perfect in sound and expression”. ‘Throughout her life she had many tragic events fall upon her and coped with most with a strength few people could manage. She was extremely resilient. ‘However, like all people she was not impervious, being repeatedly called a liar and a fantasist about a horrific part of her life in front of a court challenged her personal integrity and was more than even she could bear. Sticking to her morals she knew she must do what was right, to tell the facts as they were and leave it to the law to decide, even as she was only just beginning to see that Mr Brewer’s actions were indeed abuse. ‘One of her hopes was that the bravery she exhibited, and the other stories she knew would come out during the trial, would mean that other students who had also suffered abuse at Chetham’s would be able to receive justice. ‘Having been heavily advised by the police not to receive any form of therapy until the end of the case (a process of almost two years) she was forced to cope on her own with only the support of her family and very close friends. ‘This meant that even after several attempts at her own life she did not get the help she needed. ‘The state of mental healthcare in this country needs reform.’ VIDEO: Police statement after Brewer and ex-wife found guilty of sexual assault .","Michael Brewer, 68, guilty of sexually .

Back again: Diallo Allen, 18, was initially allowed to walk free by Judge Lesley Newton, who said she believed there was 'another side' to him . A 'middle-class’ mugger raided a house only three days after he was spared jail by a judge who took pity on him because his family had fallen on hard times. Diallo Allen, 18, was allowed to walk free despite mugging three teenagers after Judge Lesley Newton heard he turned to crime after his affluent parents were forced to move to a council estate. Judge Newton said she believed there was ‘another side’ to the violent mugger and gave him a suspended sentence. But three days later Allen smashed his way into a home while the owners were on holiday. He was caught after traces of his blood were found on a door and window frames. Local councillor Norman Lewis condemned the judge’s decision to spare Allen jail, saying that he should have been made to take responsibility for his criminal actions. ‘People’s homes are their own Shangri-Las and it’s unacceptable to come home to find that somebody has been through their property,’ he said. ‘The judge needs to reflect on her decision to suspend the sentence.’ On January 23, Allen was given the suspended sentence for stealing an iPhone, a BlackBerry and a bag worth £800 from three teenagers in Chorlton, Greater Manchester. Manchester Crown Court was told how he had fallen into bad company after his ‘high-achieving’ family moved a mile-and-a-half from a ‘middle-class’ area to the Nell Lane council estate, in Chorlton. Allen’s mother, Deanne Blake, had worked for Manchester council for 18 years as a social worker before launching her own private consultancy. His father Garfield Allen, who is separated from Miss Blake, was made redundant from his job as a theatre director due to funding cuts in the arts. From the old: Allen used to live with his parents on the upmarket Stratton Road in Chorlton, Greater Manchester, which has an average price of £210,000, before the recession forced them out . To the new: Financial difficulties meant Allen's family had to move 1.5 miles away to Ploughbank Drive on the Nell Lane estate, which has an average house price of £100,000 . Before the change in their fortunes . Allen had enjoyed an ‘affluent, middle-class lifestyle’ living on a road . where the average house price is around £200,000. But in 2010, he was forced to move to the Nell Lane estate, where the average house costs around £100,000. 'What a joke!' Manchester United goalkeeper Sam Johnstone's response to initial sentence .

Sorrow: Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy offers the city's condolences to the Pendelton family, Nathaniel Jr., Nathaniel Sr., and Cleopatra during a news conference seeking help from the public . Pendleton's death brought renewed attention to Chicago's homicide rate and the debate over gun violence in America. Chicago endured its most deadly . January in a decade this year, with Hadiya's death bringing the total killings . in the city since the start of the year to 42. Pendleton was huddled under a canopy in a South Side park to escape the rain before she . was shot in the back. A . witness said around 10 students in the park scattered when a man opened . fire. Hadiya and another teen collapsed a block away in front of one of . the upscale homes lining . Oakenwalk Avenue. 'It's very painful to see your big sister get slaughtered,' 10-year-old Nathaniel Pendleton Jr. told the Chicago Tribune about Hadiya's death, as tributes flooded in for the popular star student. 'I'm not worried about where she is . going, but I miss her,' her father, Nate Sr. added. 'A whole . section of my heart is gone. Get the guns out of the hands of people that don't need to have them.' Police said gang members were at the park where Hadiya was killed but she was not a gang member.

The other student who was shot, 17-year-old Lawrence Sellers, was hit in the leg and he is recovering. The tragedy camedays after Obama, . whose Chicago home is only a mile from the murder scene, announced plans . to ban assault weapons as part of a drastic overhaul of gun laws. As more details of Hadiya's death emerged, former Arizona Democrat Gabrielle Giffords, who survived being shot at point-blank range in 2011, spoke determinedly  at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on how to curb gun violence. The shooting occurred just a few blocks from the teenagers' school, . King College Prep, and a mile from the president's lavish Chicago home on Greenwood Avenue. 'The school is good but the neighborhood . is not,' student Anta Nije told Fox. 'When we step outside the school, . anything can happen to us.' In fact, relatives said Hadiya's mother was intending to move away to ensure her daughter's safety and a good education. 'Believe . it or not, her mom was just looking to move to Naperville,' Hadiya's . cousin, Shatira Wilks, said.

Hadiya's death brings Chicago homicides this month to 42 - making it the most deadly January in Chicago in 10 years. The last time there were as many murders was in January 2002, when there were 45. It also comes after there were more than 500 killings in the city in 2012. This weekend, a Chicago mother lost her fourth child to gun crime. Shirley Chambers had previously lost two sons and a daughter in shootings stretching back 18 years, but on Saturday her only surviving child, Ronnie Chambers, was shot in the head while sitting in a parked car in the west side of the city. While there are strict gun laws in the state and city, police are finding more weapons on the streets of Chicago than much larger cities. They seized 7,400 guns in crimes or unpermitted uses in Chicago last year, compared with 3,285 in New York City, the New York Times reported. Authorities have confiscated 574 guns since the start of the year - 124 of them last week alone. Hadiya, a sophomore at King's, had attended the inauguration and performed at inaugural events with the school band and the Majorettes dance team, the Tribune reported. Friends added that she was a volleyball player for the school and well-liked - and even had plans to go on a French-exchange program. 'She was working on some sort of exchange program, where she was going to go to school in Paris,' her godfather said. 'She was a great student.' Hadiya had aspirations to become a pharmacist or a journalist and had interest in attending Northwestern University, relatives told the Tribune. 'There were a lot of good opportunities that were coming her way. She was just taking them all,' Lakeisha Stewart, 37, Hadiya's godmother said. 'She was the kid who you had to say, 'Slow down, you can’t do everything"". 'I've known this little girl her . entire life. I can't think of a moment that this child did anything . wrong. She always strived to do the right thing.' Her cousin added: 'She's a huge reader, loves stories and . novels and was naturally smart, always on the honor roll. She was caught up in the violence of the city.' Fellow student Janai Bates, 17, said she didn't know of anyone who had any problems with either of the victims. Scene: She was at this South Side park with friends when a man ran towards them and opened fire . Location: The shooting took place just a mile from the Chicago home of President Obama . 'Lawrence and Hadiya aren’t the type of people to get in a conflict with . anybody,' she said. 'Everybody loved them, they joked with everybody, . they give out that warmth.' Students wore red to school in remembrance and were pictured taking part in a prayer circle. Police confirmed Hadiya had no arrest history and 'by all indications the female victim was an unintended target'. But their statement added: 'Preliminary information indicates that most of the members of the group were gang members.' Loss: Hadiya, pictured, died an hour later, while the other teenage victim remains in hospital . Popular: Friends said that the talented student was well-liked at school and 'gave out warmth' Roxane Hubbard, who has lived in the neighborhood for 19 years, told DNAinfo she has never heard of a shooting on her block. 'President Obama's house is like three blocks from here, so this is not typical,' she said. Students . in the marching band from the school went to Washington, D.C., to take . part in the Presidential Inauguration Heritage Music Festival. When asked about Hadiya's death, . presidential spokexman Jay Carney called it a 'terrible tragedy' for . someone to be killed when they had 'so much of their life ahead of . them'. Remembrance: Fellow students wore red and formed a prayer circle for Hadiya on Wednesday . 'The president and first lady's thoughts and prayers are with the family of Hadiya Pendleton,' he said. 'All of our thoughts and prayers are with her family.' Curbing gun violence across the city has been a major priority for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff. He became emotional when he paid tribute to the murdered teenager. 'She is what is best in our city,' he . said. 'A child going to school, who takes a final exam, who had just . been to the inaugural.'You look at her, you look at how she talked about . her future. She took her final exams. She had dreams.

Grief: A photograph on Twitter shows photos, notes and toys placed by the teenager's locker . He added: 'If anybody has any information, you are not a snitch. You’re a citizen.' The city's police superintendent . Garry McCarthy also spoke out about violence in the city after returning from a meeting with the . president in Washington. He said he discussed the .

'There seems to be a consensus now . among law enforcement, and as this consensus among Americans that the . reason ability of the gun laws has to be examined,' McCarthy said.

Loss: Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz, 26, who faced 35 years in prison over wire fraud charges at MIT, took his own life at his Brooklyn home on January 11 . Internet activist Aaron Swartz's . father told his son's suburban Chicago funeral that the Reddit . co-founder was ‘killed by the government.’ The 26-year-old was found dead of an . apparent suicide in his New York apartment Friday. His funeral was . Tuesday morning at the Central Avenue Synagogue in his home town of Highland Park, Illinois. Swartz was facing a potentially . lengthy prison sentence after being indicted in Boston in 2011 for . allegedly gaining access to academic articles from a computer archive at . the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The charges carried a . maximum penalty of decades in prison. Echoing the sentiments of the . family's previous statements about the tragedy, Robert Swartz said during the service that . his son was ‘hounded’ by the government. Spokeswoman Christina DiIorio-Sterling in Boston says U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz has no comment about Robert Swartz's remarks. Swartz was charged last September with  wire fraud, computer fraud and . unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer after he allegedly tried . to steal millions of scholarly papers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2011. It . is thought that the stress and strain of the looming federal trial . contributed to the depression which is being blamed for Swartz taking . his own life on January 11 at his Brooklyn, New York apartment. Swartz's lawyer had originally approached federal prosecutors in fall 2012 about a deal and was turned down. Then just two . days before he committed suicide, another plea deal was turned down by federal prosecutors. Elliot Peters, Swartz's lawyer, spoke to the Massachusetts attorney's office on January 9 to see if a plea bargain could be reached that would reduce prison time and $1million fines that the 26-year-old was facing. Aaron Swartz's casket is wheeled to a hearse outside a synagogue in Highland Park, Illinois, at his funeral on Tuesday . However Peters told the WSJ that Assistant . U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann was adamant that Swartz must . plead guilty to every count and jail time would be required. Swartz's distraught family has blamed MIT and federal prosecutors for his . death. In an earlier statement, Swartz's loved ones . had claimed the Boston attorney's office had pursed an 'exceptionally harsh array of . charges' for a supposed crime that had no victims, and MIT refused to . stand up for Swartz or it's own 'cherished principles'. 'Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy,' his family and the 26-year-old's partner Taren Stinebricker-Kaufmann, wrote. 'It is the product of a criminal . justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s office . and at MIT contributed to his death.' In a Boston court on Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Heymann and colleague Carmen Ortiz filed to dismiss the charges against Swartz. The case was dismissed because of Swartz's . death, such filings are routine when a defendant dies before trial. Tragic end: Aaron Swartz, a programmer and Internet activist who co-founded a company that would eventually grow into Reddit, committed suicide Friday in New York City . Remorse: MIT president L Rafael Reif said he was pained to think that the school had any role in Swartz's tragic death . Defiance: Anonymous publicizes the move by hundreds of academics to post their copyright-protected articles online for free following the suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz . Massachusetts Institute of . Technology's president spoke on Monday of his sadness over Swartz's suicide and . said there would be 'thorough analysis' into the school's role in the . federal case against the 26-year-old computer programmer. MIT president L. Rafael Reif said: 'I want to . express very clearly that I and all of us at MIT are extremely saddened . by the death of this promising young man, who touched the lives of so . many. 'It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy.' The . statement came as hundreds of academics posted links to . copyright-protected journals online in tribute to internet activist . Swartz. The movement . appears to have started on Swartz's own site Reddit and was echoed by . Anonymous on Twitter, who wrote: 'Please share: Academics posting their . papers online in tribute to Aaron Swartz using hashtag #pdftribute . #ICYMI.' Even officials at JSTOR -  an archive of academic journals to which universities, including MIT, pay large amounts of money for access - slammed the harsh tactics of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston. Swartz's family described him as 'extraordinary and irreplaceable.' They said his 'insatiable curiosity, . creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for . selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable' made the world and their lives far brighter.' Aaron Swartz was found hanging from his belt near his bedroom window, sources in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York said. The death was pronounced as a suicide by the city's medical examiner . Intimidated: The family of Aaron Swartz, left, and his partner Taren Stinebricker-Kaufmann, right, blame MIT and federal prosecutors for his death . Our beloved brother, son, friend, and partner Aaron Swartz hanged himself on Friday in his Brooklyn apartment. We are in shock, and have not yet come to terms with his passing. Aaron's insatiable curiosity, creativity, and brilliance; his reflexive empathy and capacity for selfless, boundless love; his refusal to accept injustice as inevitable - these gifts made the world, and our lives, far brighter. We're grateful for our time with him, to those who loved him and stood with him, and to all of those who continue his work for a better world. Aaron's commitment to social justice was profound, and defined his life. He was instrumental to the defeat of an Internet censorship bill; he fought for a more democratic, open, and accountable political system; and he helped to create, build, and preserve a dizzying range of scholarly projects that extended the scope and accessibility of human knowledge. He used his prodigious skills as a programmer and technologist not to enrich himself but to make the Internet and the world a fairer, better place. His deeply humane writing touched minds and hearts across generations and continents. He earned the friendship of thousands and the respect and support of millions more. Aaron's death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death. The US Attorney's office pursued an exceptionally harsh array of charges, carrying potentially over 30 years in prison, to punish an alleged crime that had no victims. Meanwhile, unlike JSTOR, MIT refused to stand up for Aaron and its own community's most cherished principles. Today, we grieve for the extraordinary and irreplaceable man that we have lost.

From linen and sheepskin to thick rubber sheaths that stank of sulphur, condoms haven't always been the most comfortable form of contraception. One of the world's oldest forms of birth control, condoms weren't widely used - much less, accepted - until the 1940s, when the demand for fighting fit syphilis-free soldiers changed the face of contraception forever. In fact, so popular are they today, there's even a Condom Awareness Week and to celebrate, prophylactic makers Trojan have released a documentary that charts their often fascinating history. Scroll down for video . Uncomfortable: This preserved sheepskin condom dates from the Tudor period . Ancient: Linen condoms such as this one (left) were found in early Egyptian tombs. Prettier, if no more comfortable, were the ribbon embellished condoms produced in the 18th century (right) Beginning with the earliest condoms in Ancient Egypt, the seven minute film looks at how birth control evolved from an upper class luxury into an everyday essential. 'The history of condoms is very . complicated,' explains Debra Lynn-Herbenick, Research Scientist and Associate Director at The Kinsey Institute. 'There are so many issues that have helped shape the way we . feel about this one particular object. 'Some of the earliest examples of condom . use occurred in Ancient Egypt, where people used linen sheaths to cover . their penis and protect themselves from all kinds of STDs as well as to . prevent pregnancy.' Condoms next appeared in the 17th century, when a syphilis outbreak made them an essential tool for seeing off sexually transmitted diseases, although the prophylactics in use then weren't exactly the sort of thing you would want to use today. 'There's documentation at least as early . as the 17th century about the widespread use of animal skins,' says James Edmonson, Chief curator at the Dittrick Medical History Center. Protection: During the Second World War, soldiers were encouraged to use the prophylactics, although troops fighting in the Great War weren't so lucky: they had to use the ineffective Dough-Boy Prophylactic kit (right) Sexual revolution: In the 1960s and 70s, condoms became more popular - and were more widely available - than ever before . 'Today, we use . the same animal skins to make sausage casings!' Uncomfortable though the animal skin condoms were, they were hugely popular among the middle and upper classes, but remained out of reach for the rest. 'It might have cost a working person a week's wage to buy a quality condom at the time,' adds Edmonson. 'The big innovation came in 1839 when Charles Goodyear found he could vulcanise or heat treat rubber.' Cheaper the new rubber condoms might have been but comfortable they were not, as Lynn-Herbenick points out. 'Condoms in the 1850s were as thick as bicycle tyres and they smelled of sulphur,' she explains. 'They weren't exactly inviting! HIV: The AIDS epidemic of the 80's made condom use more important than ever . Nevertheless, condoms grew in popularity and by the 1850s, they could be purchased by mail order and sent to your home. But the backlash was about to begin, particularly in the United States, where the 1873 Comstock laws effectively outlawed contraception. The new rules prevented advertising or sending condoms by post, while 30 different states outlawed the manufacturing and sale of condoms altogether. As a result disease increased. 'Condoms were effectively forced underground and you couldn't get them in the way you could before,' says Lynn-Herbenick. 'After Comstock, when you couldn't use condoms, the rate of STDs skyrocketed.' It wasn't until the outbreak of World War One that condoms staged a comeback - mainly in response to the high rate of venereal disease that incapacitated as much as 15 per cent of Allied forces at any one time. But the majority of condoms were still expensive and uncomfortable, and it was another two years before modern latex condoms were invented - too late for soldiers serving on the Western Front. The new material did, however, make a difference to troops fighting in the Second World War, when, for the first time, condoms were widely distributed by military authorities. 'By World War Two, condoms were really the main way of preventing venereal disease,' says Lynn-Herbenick. 'It made no sense to leave soldiers vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis and gonorrhea.' Widespread wartime use of condoms finally gained them acceptance among wider society, and by the mid 1950s, it is estimated that 60 per cent of British couples were using them regularly. But it was the sexual revolution of the 1960s that would finally cement their place in Western culture. 'The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s meant that a lot of people were having sex with people they didn't necessarily know very well,' explains Lynn-Herbenick. 'It changed the need for sexual protection and meant that the condom took centre stage in [Western] culture - particularly for younger people.' Safe sex: HIV/AIDS remain a huge problem, and in Africa especially, using condoms really does save lives . Spoilt for choice: Modern consumers no longer have to endure uncomfortable sheepskin and can buy condoms in a huge variety of shapes and sizes . Condoms became more important than ever when, in the 1980s, the HIV/AIDS epidemic arrived. 'In the early 80s, we found out we had a new public heath problem - HIV/AIDS,' says Lynn Barclay, President and CEO of the American Social Health Association. 'Condoms became the difference between life and death. The public health response to HIV and AIDS has meant that condoms are more widely available than ever before.' Rapid innovation changed the face of condom use in the 1990s and made them more comfortable and easy to use. Although the latex prophylactics have to compete with a wide variety of birth control methods today, they remain among the most popular and are still the only fail safe way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. 'Condoms were once a one size fits all kind of object but now they come in various shapes, sizes and colours,' says Lynn-Herbenick. 'When someone goes to the condom aisle of the drug store, they're faced with a number of choices that lets them tweak sex in any way they want to tweak it.' 15,000 BC: The oldest known depiction of a condom is in a painting on the walls of the Grotte des Combarrelles, a cave in France. The paintings are believed to be between 10 and 15,000 years old. 150 AD: Condoms appear in the legend of Minos, written down by Antoninus Liberalis in 150 AD. According to historians, this suggests that condom use was widespread during antiquity. 1494: An outbreak of syphilis decimates the population of Europe, before spreading to Asia where the disease devastated the Chinese people in 1505. Outbreaks such as this were in part due to the rise of modern religions such as Christianity and Islam, which forbade the use of birth control. 1564: Italian doctor Gabriele Falloppio publishes De Morbo Gallico (The French Disease), which was the first medical treatise to suggest the use of condoms as a means of tackling syphilis. 1666: The English Birth Rate Commission ascribes falling birth rates to the use of 'condons' - the first recorded use of the word. 1640: Condoms made from animal intestines have been discovered, which date from the English Civil War. The prophylactics, discovered in a toilet, were believed to have been used by the troops of King Charles I - mainly on each other. 1708: By the 18th century, condom use had become widespread, although they weren't to everyone's taste. John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, unsuccessfully tried to have them banned in 1708, while in 1717, Daniel Turner, an English doctor, published a text condemning condom use. 1840: Although uncomfortably thick, condoms had become affordable for all and were widely promoted to the working classes - all thanks to the discovery of rubber. 1870: The first major condom manufacturer, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston, opens its doors in London. 1912: German entrepreneur, Julius Fromm, invents a new and speedy way of making condoms called 'cement dipping', which involved adding petrol to rubber to make it liquid before dripping it over a glass mould. Fromm was also the first to make branded condoms. 1914: The German military becomes the first to promote condom use among troops. By the time World War One broke out in 1914, all countries, except the UK and the USA, handed out condoms to their soldiers. As a result, by the end of the war, the US army had been forced to deal with nearly 400,000 cases of STDs. 1920: Latex was invented, revolutionising the condom in the process. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, which was sold under the Trojan brand. 1932: The London Rubber Company became the first European company to make latex condoms, which they sold under the trade name, Durex. 1941: Germany outlaws civilian use of condoms and directs the country's entire supply to the military. All combatant nations in World War Two provided their soldiers with vast quantities of prophylactics. 1955: Post war, condom use became widespread, with 60 per cent of married British couples and 42 per cent of American pairings regularly using them. 1967: France repeals its birth control laws, followed by Italy in 1971. The last country to get rid of anti-condom laws was the Republic of Ireland, which did so in 1993. 1981: The AIDS epidemic begins, leading to widespread public health campaigns in Western countries between 1985 and 1987. As a result, condom use skyrockets, particularly in Switzerland, where condom use shot up by 80 per cent. 1994: Condom sales begin to decline slightly as the fear of AIDS diminishes in the West. Nevertheless, globally condom use continues to grow, with experts predicting that 18.6 billion will be used every year by 2015.","Condom makers Trojan have made a documentary charting the history of the condom .

Probe: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for a police investigation into the Stafford Hospital Scandal . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for a police investigation over the Stafford Hospital scandal which led to the deaths of up to 1,200 people. An inquiry into the trust this week reported a ‘disaster’ in the care of vulnerable and elderly patients at the hospital and said it revealed failings at every level of the NHS. Mr Hunt said it was wrong that nobody had been ‘brought to book’ at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust in the wake of the report. ‘I think it’s absolutely outrageous that potentially more than a thousand people lost their lives because of poor care and not a single person has been brought to book,’ he said. ‘This was a public inquiry that was designed to help us understand why the system didn’t pick up what went wrong but I think it is absolutely disgraceful with all those things happening, whether it is doctors, nurses or managers, nobody has been held to account.’ Asked whether the information should be passed to the police, he added: ‘Well that evidence is in the public domain. And you know, it’s there for the police - and it’s there for the professional bodies, the GMC (General Medical Council) and the NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) to look at and they should do that.’ Mr Hunt said that it was not for him to judge which individuals should be prosecuted. ‘As a politician, I am not in a . position to say this nurse is guilty, this nurse is not, and all these . things have to be decided at arm’s length following due process,’ he . told the Daily Telegraph. ‘This is about people’s careers and livelihood and there has to be fairness of course.’ Scandal: An inquiry found up to 1,200 patients died on casualty wards at Stafford between 2005 and 2009 due to an obsession with targets . Robert Francis QC, who led the . inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said there were . failings at every level of the NHS and that the culture among . healthcare staff must change. He said: ‘What we need to avoid is yet another wholesale reorganisation of abolishing organisations and creating new ones. Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at Stafford Hospital . ‘This is about how people behave when . they go to work and their ability to raise concerns and be honest about . what’s going on in their hospitals.’ The . change would only happen when NHS managers, clinicians and staff . started to address the failings ‘rather than waiting to be told what to . do from Whitehall, or by the top of the NHS,’ he added. Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, has resisted calls to step down over the scandal at Stafford Hospital. Heather . Wood, who headed an earlier investigation into the hospital in 2009, . said: ‘If this were a private sector organisation that had failed to . such an extent, we would be calling for the boss to take responsibility. ‘There is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture.’ Patients’ campaigner Julie Bailey, whose elderly mother Bella died at Stafford . hospital, called for individuals in the NHS to be held accountable for . the failings in care. She said: ‘This is an opportunity to put down the gauntlet and say enough is enough. ‘From today you will be held accountable for your actions - it’s no good saying in the future you will be held accountable. ‘We want accountability for the hundreds of deaths and the suffering our loved ones had to put up with.’ NHS . medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has launched a review into . five other trusts where there were 3,000 more deaths than expected . between 2010 and 2012. Patients’ campaigner Julie Bailey, (left)  whose . elderly mother Bella (right) died at Stafford hospital, called for individuals . in the NHS to be held accountable for the failings in care . A whistleblower at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital today urged others in similar situations to act as she did. Helene Donnelly, a former casualty nurse at the hospital, said healthcare workers who saw poor care had a duty to speak out. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether she would have blown the whistle if she . had known that nobody would be disciplined over what happened, she said: . 'Just because you think nothing's going to happen doesn't mean you . don't try, and that would be my message to other nurses out there right . now, who may be in a very similar situation, that if they're witnessing . poor standards of care, they have a duty to speak out.' She said the report by Robert Francis QC into the Mid Staffordshire NHS . Foundation Trust had highlighted that there may be a legal obligation to . report wrongdoing. 'But I think it goes much further. The Francis report can only go so . far, it's up now to the individuals and organisations to take that . forward to implement change.' Ms Donnelly said that people should be held accountable for their actions. 'I think individuals have to be accountable for their own behaviour, and . from a nursing point of view, you have a duty of care for your . patients, and if you are not delivering that, and particularly if you . are doing harm, you need to be made accountable.' Asked if there had been a culture of neglect at the hospital, she said: 'There was, and there was a culture of bullying as well, both towards . staff and patients.' She said there were 'immense' pressures on the nurses. 'We were hugely understaffed, and had very poor equipment, inadequate . equipment, and that obviously led to the nurses being under immense . pressure, and there was pressure to always meet the four hour accident . and emergency ward target. That had a knock on effect to patient care.'","Mr Hunt said it was wrong that nobody had been 'brought to book'

Lord McAlpine has accused Sally Bercow, the wife of the Commons Speaker, of adopting a 'cavalier' attitude after writing an allegedly libellous tweet linking him to false claims of child sex abuse. The peer is suing Mrs Bercow for damages of up to £50,000 after she tweeted: 'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*', after a botched Newsnight investigation claimed an anonymous Conservative figure had sexually abused boys at a Welsh care home. Legal papers obtained by The Sunday Times also say Mrs Bercow sought to 'trivialise' the matter and 'added insult to injury' in later tweets. Row: Lord McAlpine's legal team say Sally Bercow was 'cavalier' with her tweets and also suggest they may have been politically motivated . Papers lodged at the High Court reveal . that Bercow, 43, did not even watch Newsnight before posting the tweet and did not remove it for a month. McAlpine also suggests that her comments had a political motive. The BBC has already paid McAlpine £185,000 in damages and McAlpine's lawyers are now seeking redress from Twitter users who identified him as the man in the erroneous Newsnight programme. Outspoken Mrs Bercow has always denied her tweet was libellous, saying it was merely 'foolish'. She has instructed City lawyers Carter-Ruck to represent her. A spokesman for the firm said at the time: ‘Lord McAlpine has issued and served proceedings for libel against Sally Bercow and we are representing her. He put in a claim of £50,000.’ Numerous Twitter users erroneously linked Lord McAlpine to the Newsnight broadcast. For the most part, an apology ended was sufficient to end the matter . Swiftly deleting abusive tweets may save offenders from being brought before court, the country’s leading prosecutor said today. Keir . Starmer, director of public prosecutions, said it was 'relevant' for . police to consider whether an offending tweet had been quickly deleted. Speaking to Sky’s Dermot Murnaghan, he said he was holding a three-month consultation about the plan. Libellous tweets, or messages which broke court orders or were threatening, would still face prosecution regardless, he added. Mr . Starmer said: 'There’s a lot of stuff out there that is highly . offensive that is put out on a spontaneous basis that is quite often . taken down pretty quickly and the view is that those sort of remarks . don’t necessarily need to be prosecuted.' Most of the people who tweeted about his involvement have offered the 70-year-old Tory an apology, ending the matter. However, he launched legal proceedings after he failed to reach an out-of-court settlement with Mrs Bercow. The libel battle is expected to go to trial at the High Court in the next few months. McAlpine's lawyers refer to Bercow's 'high public and media profile', adding: 'The defendant is also politically well connected. 'She has been a prominent campaigner for the Labour party and is the wife of the Speaker.' After the furore surrounding the original tweet, Mrs Bercow posted on Twitter: 'Am TOTAL, irresponsible eejit for mentioning fact that he was trending on my timeline. So sorry.' She later posted: 'I guess I'd better get some legal advice then. Still maintain was not a libellous tweet — just foolish.' She deactivated her Twitter account in November but then reactivated it nine days later, but still did not delete the original tweet until mid-December. Neither party was available for comment tonight. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","He is suing her for up to £50,000 of damages following her online comments .

Court: Man City young player Courtney Meppen-Walter arrives at Magistrates Court in Manchester to admit charges of reckless and dangerous driving which caused the deaths of Kulwant and Ravel Kaur Singh . A Manchester City footballer is facing up to five years in jail today for killing a brother and sister in a road crash while driving his Mercedes at almost 60mph in a 30mph zone. Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, was arrested last September after his silver Elegance CDI car was travelling nearly twice the speed limit when it ploughed into a red Nissan Micra pulling out of a side street. The impact in Cheetham Hill, Manchester claimed the lives of Kulwant Singh, 32, who was driving the Micra and 37-year old sister Ravel Kaur who was a front seat passenger. Mrs Kaur's two sons Amjid and Parveen, who are 16 and 17-years-old, were sat in the back and were left fighting for life with serious injuries and had to be cut free from the mangled wreckage. They have since made a good recovery. Police initially investigated whether Meppen-Walter from Blackley, Manchester was racing a friend in a VW Golf as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras. But they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge. It emerged the double tragedy occurred just five months after Meppen-Walker was caught speeding at 54mph in another 30mph zone in Bury. Today the £1,000-a-week defender who has been at City since 2003 and has represented England at under-17 level pleaded guilty to two offences of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving. He asked to be dealt with at Manchester magistrates court where jail terms cannot exceed six months - but the bench instead sent to him to be dealt with by a judge at crown court as they ruled the offence was too serious and bordered on dangerous driving. Meppen Walker was given an interim driving ban pending sentencing next month. The tragedy occurred at about 10.15pm on Saturday September 1 last year on Bury New Road at its junction with Sherborne Street. At the time Mr Singh's was driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three. Tragic: Scene of the crash on Bury New Road, Manchester in where Ravel Kaur and her brother Kulwant Singh died . Meppen Walker looked stony faced as defence lawyer Mr Gwyn Lewis said: 'He is a very young man. He has been able to enter and plead on the very first occasion and accepts that he is responsible for this incident. Decorated: The talented footballer has represented England and has a burgeoning career at Premier League champions Manchester City . 'His lack of driving experience contributed to a likelihood of a collision. He was driving in a straight line on the main road and he car had emerged unexpectedly. The right of way belonged with the driver on the main road but the issue arises out of the speed he was travelling at.' Adjourning the case chairman of the bench Peter O'Keefe said: 'We believe it is not suitable for magistrates for sentence. We feel it was not far short of dangerous driving in addition the aggravating factors are too young people were seriously injured.' Meppen Walker was granted unconditional bail until sentencing at Manchester Crown Court on February 28. A 19-year-old man who was driving the grey VW Golf at the time of the collision will face no further action. At the time of the crash Balinder Singh, 19, a relative of Mr Singh and Mrs Kaur spoke of the two victims having 'joy on their faces' shortly before the tragedy. He said: 'We get together every Saturday at the temple but this week there was a special ceremony because it was the first day of our Holy Book. 'It's always a happy service and it's a big day in the religious calendar. They had joy on their faces. Kulwant said he would take his sister and her children first because she lives nearby and then come back for his wife and kids. 'Kulwant's wife has been left with a one-year-old son and a three-year-old girl. He was a loving father - he would help anyone. Ravel's husband passed away a long time ago so the children have lost their father and their mother now.'","Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, smashed into a car pulling out of a side road .

The head of the Bolshoi Theatre and its leading dancer have blamed each other for creating the poisonous atmosphere that led to last month's acid attack on the ballet's artistic director. General director Anatoly Iksanov and Nikolai Tsiskaridze, the principal dancer, traded accusations of intrigue and skulduggery yesterday as the investigation into the  January 17 attack on Sergei Filin, the company's artistic director continued. Asked who he thought was behind the . assault, Mr Iksanov told a Russian magazine: 'I have only one feeling: . that everything which happened is a logical result of the mayhem that . was created by Nikolai Maksimovich Tsiskaridze. War of words: Anatoly Iksanov (left), the general director of Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre, and ballet star Nikolai Tsiskaridze (right) attending an awarding ceremony in the Kremlin in Moscow . 'The dumping of mud on the theatre . and its staff, the constant intrigues and [his] confidence in his own . impunity is the background which made this tragedy possible.' Mr Tsiskaridze, 39, and the management . of the theatre have had a long-standing, and often public, dispute over . artistic differences and the recent reconstruction of the 188-year-old . main building, which the dancer claimed left it 'looking like a Turkish . hotel'. Mr Tsiskaridze, a traditionalist, was . one of several whom Mr Iksanov passed over in favour of Mr Filin for the post . of artistic director in March 2011. Mr Filin has undergone several . operations on his eyes and face since an assailant flung a jar of acid . into his eyes near his Moscow home last month. Doctors hope to save his . vision. Mr Iksanov claimed Mr Tsiskaridze had . 'crazy ambitions' and 'no one in the theatre' doubted that his alleged . posturing contributed to the atmosphere in which Mr Filin, 42, was . attacked. Nikolai Tsiskaridze is one of the figures at the centre of bitter infighting at the ballet company . Principal Bolshoi Dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze was questioned as a witness in the assault on the theatre's ballet director Sergei Filin . 'I'm not accusing him of this particular crime; I'm accusing Nikolai of increasing the tension in the theatre,' he said. The principal dancer responded in a . separate interview in the same magazine. 'Mr Iksanov has no evidence or . right to assert my involvement in this dirty business. 'Why was there any . need to utter my name in connection with this terrible crime? There has . not been such a shameful scandal on an international scale at the . Bolshoi for some time.'

'I was told to go to out to the press and say . that I couldn't lift her,' he said. 'But for one thing, I could lift . her.' Mr Iksanov said that Mr Tsiskaridze . had lobbied to become the ballet's artistic director or to take his own . job as general director. Previously he has described the dancer as 'like an abscess'. He also claimed that the dancer was . behind the online distribution of private erotic photographs of Gennady . Yanin, the head of the company, in 2011, which forced the latter's . resignation. Mr Tsiskaridze dismissed suggestions he was linked to the . leak. Backstabbing: The Bolshoi Theatre, an enduring symbol of Russian culture, is notorious for power struggles and backstabbing among dancers and directors . The general director also denied Mr . Tsiskaridze's claims that the six-year reconstruction of the theatre, . which ended in 2011, left it with cramped facilities and poor acoustics. The Bolshoi Theatre in the heart of Moscow is . an enduring symbol of Russian culture and a big draw for both locals . and foreign tourists, but has seen power struggles among both dancers . and directors during its tumultuous history dating back more than 200 . years. Mr Filin, a . former leading dancer at the Bolshoi who has been in the high-pressure . job at the heart of Russian culture for nearly two years, was attacked . outside his Moscow apartment building as he returned from the theatre. A . Moscow native, he joined the Bolshoi's ballet troupe in 1988 and was . named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar . position at another Moscow theatre.","Row breaks out between Anatoly Iksanov and dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze .

Tough approach: A total of 35 addresses were raided across England and Scotland today . A total of 26 people were arrested following the raids, which took place in a number of towns and cities throughout the UK. The stowaways pay from £2,000 to £6,000 per person to be smuggled into Britain. Raids were carried out in London, Hampshire, Peterborough, Birmingham, Coventry, Smethwick, Leamington Spa, and Stoke-on-Trent. Warrants were also executed in Manchester, Sheffield, Lancashire and Glasgow. It is understood many of the immigrants who pay the gangs are from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. So . far, officers have made 20 arrests in relation to their investigation . and another six in relation to other suspected offences including . immigration breaches. Identity: The Border Agency officials used this machine to take the fingerprints of a man suspected of being smuggled into the country . Chris Foster from UKBA said: 'We . believe this to be one of the biggest operations of its kind ever . undertaken in the UK, involving officers the length and breadth of the . country. 'My officers have . been working closely with their counterparts in France and Belgium as . well as other law enforcement agencies in the UK in the build-up to . today’s operation. 'We . believe we have successfully disrupted a significant organised network . suspected of being involved in a systematic attempt to evade the UK’s . immigration controls. 'Our investigation will continue with the evidence we have seized today.' Immigration . Minister, Mark Harper, said: 'The organised criminal gangs involved in . people-smuggling prey on the desperation of others in order to line . their own pockets. They are also a major factor involved in illegal . immigration to the UK.' The 20 men arrested in connection with the investigation included nine aged 19 to 33 who were held in London in Stockwell, Wood Green, Peckham, Southall, Manor Park, Peckham, East Ham, South Croydon and Harrow. Another four aged 18 to 33 were arrested in the Midlands in Smethwick, Birmingham and Coventry; and three aged 20, 21 and 25 were held in Peterborough. The remaining arrests were of a 38-year-old in Manchester, a 27-year-old in Leigh, Lancashire, a 36-year-old in Sheffield and a 31-year-old in Fareham, Hampshire. The other six not relating to the investigation were five men who were held on suspicion of immigration offences in Manor Park, east London, Southall, west London, and Palmers Green, north London. The sixth was a man who was arrested for ID card offences in Southsea, Hampshire. People smugglers are paying luxury yacht owners large sums of money to sneak illegal immigrants into the UK, it emerged today.

Stowaways: People smugglers are paying yacht owners large sums of money to sneak illegal immigrants into the UK. Brittany, pictured, is one area in which yacht owners are being targeted . Illegal immigrants have traditionally tried to smuggle into the UK on board HGV lorries and ferries bound for Dover. But officials in France say . mobsters are now targeting yacht owners in the Brittany area and bribing . them with huge sums to take immigrants into less guarded UK harbours. The . new menace to Britain's borders was revealed by French customs officers . who found 15 Albanian migrants huddled in the cabin of a £100,000 yacht . on January 12. Officials . in Cherbourg were carrying out a routine check on the yacht, based in . Brittany, which was heading north across the Channel towards the . Westcountry. The luxury . boat's two French skippers told a judge Kosovan gangsters paid them to . transport migrants on regular trips across the channel. Worrying: Officials in France say mobsters are now targeting yacht owners and bribing them with huge sums to take immigrants into less guarded UK harbours. This is a file picture . Police . were told the immigrants, who had no identification or paperwork, each . paid 1,000 Euros on the promise of a new life in Britain. The two sailors are currently in custody in France awaiting trial for smuggling. A French border official said: 'In 2012 they transited 30 foreigners without papers on two yachts, making five trips to the UK.' Border . officials in France say a 'turf' war between people smugglers from . Afghanistan, Egypt and Albania have seen them targeting new potential . ways into Britain - including posh yachts. Investigators . have begun probing a gang using ports on the north coast of Brittany - . where controls are less frequent than at Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk. A .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:54 EST, 8 February 2013 . Just weeks before he died of cyanide poisoning after winning a $1 million lottery jackpot, a Chicago businessman signed a deal to pass his share of several dry cleaning stores solely to his wife in the event of his death, the widow's lawyer has revealed. News of the unusual agreement has further fueled the fighting amongst Urooj Khan's relatives over his estate, once estimated at $2 million. Though Khan's wife Shabana . Ansari is not under formal investigation by police, the dead . millionaire's relatives are extremely suspicious that the victim's . younger wife may have had a role in the 46-year-old's death. Cruel death: Urooj Khan (right) poses with his lottery winnings alongside his wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) Meraj Khan, a sister of the deceased, has said her suspicions about Ansari have intensified since learning about the usual business agreement. ‘Things are getting more clear about why my brother is gone,’ she told The Chicago Tribune. ‘Out of nowhere she's the beneficiary for … the business?’ Ansari has been questioned by Chicago police detectives over her husband's death, but denies any wrongdoing and hasn't been accused of any crime. Under the terms of the contract, Ansari owns half the dry cleaning operation and real estate, valued at more than $1 million, instead of those assets being divided amongst heirs in probate court, according to her lawyer, Al-Haroon Husain. Questions: Urooj's sister, Meraj Khan and brother, ImTiaz have both spoken publically of their suspicions about what role Shabana Ansari played in her husband's dead . Widow: Ansari has been questioned by Chicago police detectives and denies any wrongdoing over her husband's death . He admitted the contract was unusual. ‘I just think he wanted to make sure his wife had a business and had attachment to the commercial property if something happened to him,' Husain told the Chicago Tribune. Khan died without leaving a will, but in 2007 had also signed a real estate agreement with his wife entitling her to sole ownership of their half a million dollar home. If those assets are not included, Khan's estate is worth only about $680,000, including the $425,000 in lottery winnings, according to documents filed Thursday by Husain. When a final value for the estate is determined, it will likely be split evenly between Ansari and Khan's 17-year-old . daughter from a previous marriage Jasmeen. Khan died last July, the . day after collecting an over-sized check from Illinois State Lottery . officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the . winning scratchcard. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum. Homicide: Khan, 46, died in July a day after collecting his $425,000 lottery winnings . The . initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was . ruled as by natural causes. It was only when his older brother ImTiaz Khan intervened that the . poison was found by further tests. Since then the final meal that Urooj, 46, consumed has become central to the case. Shabana Ansari prepared her husband's . last meal but didn't eat it, saying she was a vegetarian and couldn't . eat the meat in it. Her father, Fareedun Ansari, also didn't consume the . meal, saying he was on a diet and neither did Jasmeen. Khan's body was exhumed last month for further testing before it was buried again. Authorities had called . for the exhumation of his body to take samples of flesh, which could . provide valuable clues into the man’s mysterious death. Family members are hoping the autopsy will shed some light on Khan’s murder. The . results of the tests are expected later this month. Two weeks ago Khan's older brother . Imtiaz spoke publicly of his suspicions that family members may have . been involved in Urooj's death. The body of Urooj Khan was exhumed last month for a forensic autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiners office in Chicago . 'Shabana said Urooj had no enemies,' he continued. 'That’s because they were in the house. She was his enemy No. 1.' Imtiaz Khan said he remembers seeing . Fareedun Ansari pacing back and forth on the day his brother won the . lottery saying 'That lottery ticket was mine.' He says Shabana Ansari then tried to comfort him, saying 'Don't worry, Baba [father]. It will be yours.' Khan had come to the U.S. from Hyderabad, India, in 1989, setting up several dry-cleaning . businesses and buying into some real-estate investments. Despite having foresworn gambling after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2010, Khan bought a ticket in June. He jumped 'two feet in the air' and shouted, 'I hit a million', he recalled at a lottery ceremony later that month. He . said winning the lottery meant everything to him and that he planned to . use his winnings to pay off mortgages, expand his business and donate . to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital. Anger: . Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone . who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was . 'impossible' that his death was natural . He was just days from receiving his winnings when he died before dawn on July 20. With . no outward sign of trauma, authorities initially determined Khan had . died of natural causes. But a concerned relative - whose identity . remains a mystery - came forward with suspicions and asked authorities . to take a closer look. Further . toxicology tests found a lethal amount of cyanide in his blood, leading . the medical examiner in November to reclassify the death a homicide. Another element was added to this already-complicated family drama last month when Khan's ex-wife spoke . out to reveal that she had only learned their teenage daughter . was living in the U.S. after finding out her former husband was dead. Back in the day: The last time that Maria Jones saw her daughter Jasmeen was in 2000 when she and Urooj Khan divorced . One state away: Khan told Jones he was . taking their daughter to India, then after his death she discovered the girl had been living in Illinois all the time . Maria Jones said she thought that Khan had taken their . daughter Jasmeen to live in India after their acrimonious split but only . found out that Jasmeen lives in Illinois when she saw footage of Khan . accepting his giant lottery check. 'I was thinking ""Oh my God! My daughter!""' Jones said, who lives one . state away in Indiana. She says she was too poor to afford a lawyer at . the time so was unable to contest custody. Mrs . Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they . worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997. She . said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told . that he had left the U.S. for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come . back.","Urooj Khan, 46, died from cyanide poisoning the day after collecting his $1m check .

Hurtling down a mountain track on a mountain bike, with sheer drops awaiting careless riders, is a terrifying and thrilling way to spend your free time. But it's not adrenaline-fuelled enough for German extreme sports enthusiast Lutz Eichholz, who instead takes to some of the world's most rugged terrain on a unicycle. The 26-year-old, who has been unicycing since he was just nine, is a pioneer of extreme mountain unicycling and has travelled the world to indulge in his heart-stopping hobby. Scroll down for video . Eichholz pauses to survey the terrain before cycling his way down the Dolomite Mountains in Italy . Mr Eichholz, who is often joined by his friend Stephanie Dietze, recently took to the unforgiving Dolomite Mountains in Italy and the pair were filmed making their perilous descent, using an incredible amount of skill and physical fitness. The riders are often forced to bail on their one-wheeled machines, which have similar tyres to mountain bikes, as they take a spill during their hair-raising journey. Mr Eichholz has to 'bunny hop' down sheer rock faces, fight to maintain his balance on the treacherous shale beneath him and teeth-grindingly pedal up arduous steep slopes. His exploits have even earned him sponsorship from major sports brands. Eichholz (left) plunges down a slope as his friend Stephanie Dietze looks on . He is also the world record holder for the highest ever unicycle drop, landing a plunge from 6m of an overhanging rock in the Moroccan desert. Extreme mountain unicycling was pioneered during the 1990s on the West Coast of the United States, and has since attracted thousands of enthusiasts from around the world. 'People like the novelty of it,' Wendy Grzych, the president of the Unicycling Society of America,  told the New York Times. 'It’s a whole subculture, and a different makeup than your church friends or work buddies.' The pair won the support of Adidas sportswear, who sponsored their trip and provided a professional cameraman to record their unbelievably dangerous feats . Practitioners claim the sport is no more dangerous than mountain biking, despite the frequency of falls. 'We fall more often than mountain bikers, but we’re going slower so it’s not as bad. 'The same cliffs are out there,' said unicyclist Hans Van Koppen. 'Unicycling is by far much more exercise (than mountain biking),' Van Koppen added. 'You use every part of your body — arms, legs, stomach, back.' The sport has even spawned its own terminology for the many injuries it can cause, such as  'shindentations' (marks where rocks puncture the front of the legs) and 'calf tracks' (thin scars where the pedals cut into the back of the calves). Extreme unicycling is a niche sport but has grown in popularity, despite the dangers .","Lutz Eichholz tackles the terrifying and rugged peaks on his unicycle .

"By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 06:28 EST, 8 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:54 EST, 8 February 2013 . A leading hedge fund boss is suing Apple demanding the world's richest technology company moves to unlock its vast $137bn cash holdings to stockholders after the share price fell by more than a third since September last year. David Einhorn, boss of Greenlight Capital, said Apple, which has a current stock market value of $429.5bn, has a 'Depression-era' mentality that led it to hoard cash. Around two-thirds of Apple's $137bn cash pile is held overseas, and repatriating it into the U.S. would incur a steep tax bill, a problem faced by many top American technology companies. A magic wand? Hedge-fund boss David Einhorn, has filed suit against Apple saying the company needs to do more to unlock value for shareholders . Einhorn, a well-known short-seller, criticised Apple in an interview with CNBC saying it only investing in the safest, lowest-yielding securities. His lawsuit targets a proposal by Apple to change its corporate charter which would stop it from issuing a type of high-yielding share which could pay out billions of dollars. He urged Apple shareholders to vote against the plan at the company's annual meeting on February 27, and put forward a proposal of his own for the company to preffered stock with a perpetual 4 per cent dividend. Labelling Apple shares 'utterly . misvalued', at their current level, Einhorn said the company no longer . needs to grow at the near-triple-digit rates of the past. Breakthrough products: But the iPhone maker has seen its share price tumble by over a third in recent months . In an open letter to investors he said: . 'We understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our . frustration with Apple's capital allocation policies. 'Apple has $145 per share of cash on its balance sheet. As a shareholder, this is your money.' Einhorn claimed that for every $50 . billion in preferred stock that Apple gives away to shareholders, it . could unlock $32 a share in value for investors. But Apple hit back saying Einhorn's lawsuit over the shareholder proposal was misguided. 'Contrary to Greenlight's statements, . adoption of Proposal #2 would not prevent the issuance of preferred . stock,' it said in a statement. 'Currently, Apple's articles of . incorporation provide for the issuance of 'blank check' preferred stock . by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval. 'If Proposal #2 is adopted, our shareholders would have the right to approve the issuance of preferred stock.' The lawsuit is Apple's first major . challenge from an activist shareholder and comes as it grapples with a . tumbling share price and mounting competition in the smartphone and . tablet markets. There are also growing concerns among . potential investors about the company's ability to produce new . breakthrough products in the post-Steve Jobs era. Apple nearly went broke in the 1990s . before Steve Jobs returned and engineered a sensational turnaround, with . products such as the iPhone and iPad that became must-haves for . consumers around the world. The company's near-death experience has led Apple to be exceptionally conservative with its cash. Last . March, just months after Jobs' death, Apple responded to a barrage of . investor criticism over its large cash hoard by initiating a quarterly . cash dividend and a share buyback that would pay out $45 billion over . three years. At the time, Apple was sitting on $98 billion in cash. Apple shares, which had fallen 35 . percent from the record high hit in mid-September through Wednesday, . ended 3 percent higher at $468.22. Foreign: How America's biggest technology companies keep most of their cash abroad . Einhorn, whose Greenlight fund had a . sub-par year in large part because of Apple's late-2012 stock swoon, . said the company needs to fix its 'cash problem'. 'It has sort of a mentality of a . depression. In other words, people who have gone through traumas ... and . Apple has gone through a couple of traumas in its history, they . sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash,' Einhorn said on . CNBC. Investors, who have long railed . against what they saw as Apple's ultra-conservative attitude toward its . cash, rallied around Einhorn in principle. In an interview with Reuters, Einhorn . said he had gone to Apple CEO Tim Cook in recent weeks after the . company's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, brushed off his . entreaties in September. Hedge fund boss David Einhorn has a history . of activism, usually directed at struggling companies or those . grappling with management issues. In 2011, he urged Microsoft Corp to . get rid of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, accusing him of being 'stuck . in the past'. Einhorn slashed his stake in the software giant six months . later. Einhorn has enjoyed something of a cult following in the . $2 trillion hedge fund industry ever since his bearish call on Lehman . Brothers in early 2008. But 2012 was not his best year. Thanks to . losses on Apple and in the gold market, Greenlight Capital posted a . modest 8.3 percent gain for the year after losing 2.8 percent in . December, a person familiar with the fund's performance said. That . lagged the S&P 500 index's 13.4 percent gain, excluding dividends. You . could see Einhorn stirring up other activist investors, to twist them. I . would certainly applaud their efforts,' said Tim Lesko, portfolio . manager at Granite Investment Advisors, which owns Apple stock. Cook, who is rarely known to engage . investors in exclusive conversations, was unaware of the earlier . conversations with Oppenheimer, according to Einhorn. 'When I discussed this with Tim Cook, . and actually, the conversation has been going on for the last couple of . weeks, he said that he wasn't familiar with my previous conversations . with Peter Oppenheimer and whoever Peter Oppenheimer's advisers were. I . was surprised by that,"" Einhorn told Reuters. Analysts have expected stockholder pressure to increase as Apple's share price declines and its outlook grows murkier. The . California company had $137.1 billion in cash, short-term and long-term . marketable securities such as U.S. Treasuries at the end of 2012, with . over $94 billion of that overseas. 'This . is something that we continuously assess, the opportunities to both . invest in the business and return cash,' Apple's Oppenheimer said on the . company's post-results conference call last month. 'We do consider increasing these programs, and we'll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders. It remains to be seen whether other major Apple investors will get behind Einhorn's initiative. Mulholland . called the preferred stock idea 'Interesting and unique'. He also said . he supported Einhorn's opposition to the shareholder proposal and would . vote against it, saying, ""There's no reason to put something like that . in.' On the flip side, the . California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns 2.7 million . Apple shares, urged investors earlier this week to vote in favor of the . shareholder proposal, and opposes 'blank check' preferred shares. Money managers have complained that Apple stockpiles excessive cash and does a poor job putting it to work. The weighted-average interest rate . earned on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities came to . just 1.07 percent in its 2013 fiscal first quarter and 1.02 percent in . the 2012 fiscal year. Apple's late founder and CEO Steve Jobs (left) and current CEO Tim Cook (right) There are growing concerns  about the company's ability to produce new . breakthrough products in the post- Jobs era . Some questioned whether taking the company to court was the right way to induce action. 'If you own the company you should let management have some say in how they run it. I'm not a fan of using the legal system to address what should be a corporate issue,' said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage funds. Jeffrey Manns, an associate professor of law at George Washington University, said Einhorn does have legal standing to bring his case, even though it has little precedent. Greenlight's lawsuit takes aim at what it calls the 'bundling' of several proposals into a single vote. Greenlight wants the proposals separated so a vote can be taken specifically on Apple's move to strike preferred shares from its company charter. Greenlight alleges that Apple is not complying with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules requiring separate votes for distinct and unrelated amendments to the charter. 'This procedural legal strategy is merely a vehicle to raise his profile and promote his agenda about shaping Apple's corporate strategy,' Manns said of Einhorn. Einhorn's actions go well beyond increasingly common shareholder calls for Apple to increase its dividend or buy back shares. Einhorn argues preferred stock - . which functions like a bond in that it pays a fixed dividend over time - . is a better route because the company won't have to use cash right . away. Analysts say another benefit is up to . 80 per cent of the dividends from preferred stock can be tax-free for . corporate investors, and it is not logged as debt on the balance sheet. But the tactic is generally pursued by low-growth companies, where capital gains are less assured. 'The idea is powerful, and when I have . a chance to explain it to the shareholders, most will see it as an . enormous win-win', Einhorn told Reuters. Einhorn said he suggested . to Apple an initial preferred share distribution, in which dividends . could be funded on an ongoing basis by a relatively small percentage of . the company's operating cash flow. 'Apple rejected the idea outright in . September 2012,' he said, and then refused to withdraw the proposal to . eliminate preferred stock from its charter. Some investors saw . merit in Einhorn's argument. 'It's a great company but their greatest . weakness is capital allocation,' said Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager . of the $417 million Matthew 25 fund, which has some 17 per cent of his . portfolio in Apple.","David Einhorn accuses Apple of having a 'Depression-era' mentality .

Tory ministers are furious at the posters erected by Labour-run Lambeth council . A Labour council has provoked outrage with an advertising campaign warning benefit claimants that cuts will mean they ‘may have to find work’. Lambeth Council has spent hundreds of pounds of taxpayers’ money on 50 posters and an online advert opposing Coalition cuts in welfare. Ministers said it was evidence that Labour believes welfare claimants should be entitled to sit on state benefits without bothering to go to work. The advert, displayed on Lambeth’s website, features a giant pair of scissors slicing through a pound sign. It reads: ‘The government are making cuts to benefits. If you claim benefits, it is likely you will receive less and may have to find work or move to a different property.’ It then encourages claimants to contact the town hall’s benefits support team who ‘can help make sure you are getting all you are allowed to claim’. The Tories last night reported the council to the local government ombudsman for the abuse of taxpayers’ money. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘A poster like this suggesting that finding work is a worst-case scenario shows how out of touch Labour are.’ Council leader Lib Peck said it ‘has a duty to provide information, support and advice to its residents’. Tory local government minister Brandon Lewis said the authority had been ‘caught-red handed systematically misusing public funds’. From April, no household will be able to receive more than £26,000 in benefits – the average family income. Housing benefit rules are being changed so claimants will not receive full help with council tax bills if they have unoccupied bedrooms and many benefits will rise by only one per cent. But ministers condemned the use of public money to criticise government spending cuts. Mr Lewis said: ‘Lambeth have once again been caught-red handed systematically misusing public funds. ‘The money wasted on this scare campaign could have been spent on protecting frontline services,’ he told the Standard. A section of the Lambeth website suggests claimants may need to find a job to replace benefits . Two years ago Lambeth attracted similar criticism when it produced a series of posters saying: ‘The government has cut our money so we are forced to cut services."" Council leader Lib Peck defended the latest publicity drive, insisting it had cost only £600. ‘We are determined to do everything within our power to alert Lambeth residents to the government’s benefit cuts and provide support and advice to local people on managing their finances and opportunities to find jobs and training.' The row comes after Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas warned his party had to stop being seen as the defender of welfare handouts if it wants to win the next election. Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas warned Labour had become fixated with welfare payouts not solving people's problems . In . a speech to the Left-wing Resolution Foundation think tank last night, . he said the party had become fixated with offering tax credits . and benefit payments to the less well-off rather than dealing with their . wider problems. He also . revealed that Labour may not come forward with any concrete policies . until 2014, when his review enters its ‘second phase’. Mr . Cruddas, who is drawing up policies for Labour’s next manifesto, said . the party had ‘stripped down what we think people want into a series of . fiscal transfers, often administered by a remote bureaucracy – a . transactional culture’. He . said Labour policy had become ‘an exercise in fiscal transfers without a . deeper story of earning respect and a place in society’. He suggested the party should now focus on promoting ‘earning and belonging’ rather than just handing people money. ‘The . emphasis has to shift from demands exclusively built around simple . state expenditure toward interventions and campaigns that bring people . together and enable them to improve their common life,’ he said. ‘That . will be the future. The money is not there to rewind this. Nor should . we wish to do so and simply defend and back pass to the state.’ His . comments are a direct challenge to Mr Miliband who has campaigned . against every attempt by the Coalition to cut the bloated welfare budget . left behind by the last Labour government.","Lambeth council launches publicity campaign criticising welfare reforms .

Office on Drugs and Crime and Afghanistan’s anti-corruption unit showed no improvement in curbing the common practice of paying bribes for public services in the country. U.N. envoy Jean-Luc Lemahieu said: 'Corruption means you don’t get the best in the public sector, you get the best connected or those with the higher income.' That £2.5 billion was double the revenue collected by the government to provide services, said Mr Lemahieu. Vulnerable to bribes: The figures found that bribing Afghan teachers jumped from 16 to 51 per cent as offers were received in return for improved exam results and providing information about the contents of tests . The Afghan High Office of Oversight . and Anti-Corruption pledged to continue its efforts in fighting the . problem, saying the report was an important step toward locating . priority areas. U.N. envoy Jean-Luc Lemahieu: 'Corruption means you don't get the best in the public sector, you get the best connected or those with the higher income' Mohammad Rafi Amini, the head of policy and planning for the agency, said: 'The fight against corruption by the Afghan government and the people of Afghanistan will continue.' One . particularly troubling trend singled out by the U.N. was the emergence . of education as one of the most vulnerable sectors. The number of . Afghans bribing a teacher jumped from 16 per cent in 2009 to 51 per cent . in 2012, according to the survey. Offers were often received for improving exam results and providing information about the contents of the tests in exchange for bribes, raising concerns about the role of the practice in shaping the behavior and expectations of Afghanistan’s youths, the agency said. The survey also found that more of the public finds bribery acceptable. Of the adults interviewed last year, 68 per cent said it was OK for a civil servant to supplement a low salary by accepting small bribes, compared with 42 per cent in 2009. A roughly equivalent number said it was sometimes acceptable for a civil servant to be recruited on the basis of family ties and acquaintances. After decades of war, Afghanistan has long been plagued by corruption. The country also was ranked at the bottom of Transparency International’s corruption index in 2012, along with North Korea and Somalia. The index scores countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. Britain has been part of the Western forces active in Afghanistan since October 2001. Four hundred and forty British soldiers have been killed in that time.

Caitlin Hartley was barely a day old when doctors told her parents she would need major heart surgery if she was to survive past three months. She had four operations during which her heart stopped beating for three minutes and she suffered a collapsed lung. But she fought back each time and now 16 months on her parents say she is a 'bundle of energy.' Caitlin's transformation was partly thanks to a pioneering procedure during which surgeons replaced a faulty artery in her heart with a cow’s jugular vein. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Bundle of joy: Caitlin Hartley with her parents Marie and Steven. The 16-month-old has undergone four heart operations already . Her parent's Marie and Steven, who live in Edinburgh, were full of praise for their plucky daughter. ‘Caitlin is amazing,’ Mrs Hartley, 32, said. ‘She bounces back so quickly. She’s never been in hospital more than ten days after surgery. 'You’re always conscious, if she gets a cold or seems a bit off, that it could be something to do with her heart – but she is such a bundle of energy and we have to stay positive.’ The couple’s ordeal began the day after Caitlin was born at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on September 20, 2011, when tests revealed she had a heart murmur. They found out she had a condition called truncus arteriosus, which affects fewer than one in 10,000 babies. Instead of two arteries leaving the left and right sides of the heart, Caitlin had a single, large one – sending too much blood to the lungs. In October 2011 she had a cow's jugular vein fitted at Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow, but the surgery ran into complications. Little fighter: Doctors had to re-wire her heart using a cow's vein when she was just four weeks old . Cailtin is fed via a drip by her mother Marie, following her first open heart surgery . ‘We were devastated,’ Mrs Hartley recalled. ‘We . just cried and cried. During her first keyhole surgery her heart . stopped for three minutes. They couldn’t get it restarted so they had to . give her adrenaline and shock her.' Epic run: Caitlin's father plans to run 2,013km, which is equivalent to 48 marathons in 2013 . In February 2012 Caitlin went back in to have a stent fitted to reduce the pressure on her heart, but impressed her parents with her fighting spirit. ‘Caitlin never lets anything keep her down,' her mother said. 'After the second operation, she was taken to intensive care but the first night she ripped out all her lines, took herself off the ventilator and wanted to eat yoghurt.’ Caitlin also suffered a collapsed lung but again she pulled through and was out of hospital within seven days. Mrs Hartley said: ‘She likes to keep us on our toes.’ A second open heart operation came in August 2012 and in October she had three further stents put in. Now Mr Hartley, 35, has pledged to run 2,013km in 2013 to raise £10,000 – to be matched by his employer Standard Life – for the children's hospital that has saved Caitlin's life so many times. So far, he has signed up to eight marathons, half marathons and 10ks around the country to help him hit the target. Since January 1st he has managed to run 188km (117miles) - the equivalent of four and a half maratons. ‘To look at her, you wouldn’t think she has gone through all that she has, the way she dances and runs around the house,’ he said. ‘All you can say to the doctors and nurses is thank  you, but it never feels enough.’ For more on Mr Hartley's fundraising visit his webpage .","Caitlin Hartley born with rare heart defect that meant she had one large artery that sent too much blood to her lungs .

The project will provide a massive boost to the local economy in Spain which has a huge deficit and unemployment running at 26 per cent. The mastermind behind the scheme is 79-year-old American tycoon, Sheldon Adelson, and his company Las Vegas Sands Corp. Las Vegas Sands operates casinos and entertainment complexes in several locations around the world, including Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. Michael Leven, Las Vegas Sands CEO, said the group will cover 35 percent of the equity investment and assured Madrid authorities that funding to complete the rest of the project would be found.

Mr Leven said Spanish banks would be among the investors, but he did not reveal which.

More than a dozen organizations, mainly linked to environmental causes or to the political left, last year created the 'Eurovegas No' platform to oppose the project. The group reacted to yesterday’s announcement by saying Las Vegas Sands wanted to create an 'island' for gambling and will count on specially granted tax breaks and the relaxation of laws regulating smoking bans. Critics have said the project will promote unwanted activities such as prostitution and will only create 'low level' jobs such as posts for card dealers, waiters and chamber maids. They argue that what Spain - and especially its young people - needs are high skills roles.","£19billion resort will include 12 hotels, six casinos and three golf courses .

During her treatment, Mrs Gibson was given Herceptin, which caused her some heart problems, but this was not ruled as her cause of death . A mother-of-three who battled breast cancer died suddenly at just weeks after finishing treatment - depsite being of the disease. Kay Gibson, 53, was found dead in bed on October 19 last year by her husband, Alastair, at their home in Bolton, Greater Manchester. A post mortem examination found  there were no obvious signs of the cause of her death. An inquest heard that Mrs Gibson, a pharmacist, had been battling breast cancer after being diagnosed with the disease in December, 2010. But a post mortem examination found there was no cancer present when she died. She had a mastectomy in January 2011, which was followed by chemotherapy and then Herceptin treatment. The inquest was told that she started the Herceptin treatment in September, 2011, and had 17 injections at three-week intervals. During the treatment, she suffered some heart problems, a side effect of the drug, and was given further medication so she could continue taking the drug. She had her last session on September 26 last year and was given a follow-up appointment for January. Dr Patrick Waugh, who carried out the post mortem examination, said there were no obvious signs of the cause of her death. There was no naturally occurring disease, alcohol or drugs. He . said: 'There is the issue of Herceptin, with it being cardiotoxic . [where it damages the heart muscle so it can't pump blood through the . body as well]. 'Normally the problems are with people who have underlying heart disease, which she did not have.' Herceptin can cause heart problems, but this is only usually in people who already have heart disease . He said it could have been caused by a sudden arrhythmia of the heart, which is the most usual cause of death when there are no observable signs. He added: 'It is possible but I cannot say 51 per cent that Herceptin was involved.' Coroner Jennifer Leeming said there were two possible causes but no probable cause, so recorded an open verdict. Mr Gibson, also a pharmacist, met his wife through work and they married in 1987. He said: 'She wanted every treatment possible to get rid of it and give herself the best chance. 'She was quite tired at times but was determined to get through the course.' On the evening before her death she had been sick and could not face eating. The next day Mr Gibson got up at about 6am and was getting ready for work when his alarm went off at 6.40am while he was in the bathroom. He shouted through to her to turn it off, but when he went in to check on her he realised she was dead. The family declined to comment after the inquest.","Kay Gibson, 53, had recently finished treatment .

A six-year-old boy with special needs is being kept off school for his own safety after he suffered badly burned hands and a broken nose in separate accidents. His mother Elizabeth MacLeod hasn't sent her son Ellis Tattersall to St Clement's School, in Dingwall, since he was burnt on 13 December and claims staff weren't aware of either injury. Ellis has Angelman Syndrome, which severely affects his intellectual development meaning he has the ability of a 15-month-hold toddler. Six-year-old Ellis Tattersall's mum claims that he was injured twice in school without any adequate explanation . Ms MacLeod, from Alness. Ross and Cromarty, says Ellis returned in October with a broken nose. Six weeks later she was called to his class to find him screaming in agony with severely blistered fingers and she rushed him to accident and emergency. No available places at other special schools means Ellis has been out of education for two months. Education officials suggesting that Ellis should return to St Clement's but  Ms MacLeod has refused on safety grounds. Now a half-day slot has been offered to him at a local nursery while he waits for a place at St Duthus School 14 miles away in Tain. Ms MacLeod took Ellis to the hospital where he had both hands bandaged for the burns . Ms MacLeod questions why the school failed to keep Ellis safe. She said: 'I would be a terrible mum allowing him to go back there. My job as his mum is to keep him safe.' 'I don't trust them with his safety. I have kept him safe for nearly seven years and I don't understand why they couldn't do that for four months.' Ellis suffers from developmental delay, a lack of speech, seizures and walking and balance disorders. He is still in nappies, has little awareness of pain or danger and a growth deficiency means he is the size of a three-year-old. Ellis started at St Clement's in August and when he came home on October 30 his mum realised immediately that his nose was swollen, red and bruised. She took him to hospital in Invergordon and was told his nose was broken. She says St Clement's told her he didn't break his nose there and it was suggested it may have happened on the way home leaving the Mum unhappy with how they had dealt with it. On December 13 the school called to say Ellis was very distressed at lunchtime. Ms MacLeod claims that on her arrival at the school she heard Ellis screaming in 'absolute agony'. His mum asked what was wrong and Ellis put one hand on top of the other on his chest. She opened his hands to find 'massive' blisters on four fingers and claims she was told they had no idea what had happened. She took Ellis to hospital again and his hands were bandaged. During a meeting with the head teacher and through a formal report on the incident, she was told Ellis had pushed his hands into a hot mince pie due to his compulsive desire for food. The report claims he was happy eating lunch at 12.10pm, but was distressed 10 minutes later. Ellis burnt his hands by touching piping hot food at school. Ms MacLeod claims she found him screaming in agony clutching his hands to his chest . Ellis's fingers had massive blisters that were only treated when Ms MacLeod took him to accident and emergency . The mum says she got a call at 1.05pm and arrived at 1.20pm when she found the blisters. Elizabeth was unsatisfied and told the head that Ellis wouldn't be returning to the school as her 'trust in them had gone'. She said: 'I wasn't happy with him going back to school after what had happened to him in a four-month period. 'He attended nursery for three years and only had one incident, which was explained down to the last second. 'At St Clement's there was no explanation for the broken nose and I was unsatisfied with the explanation of how he burnt his hand. 'I know it's hard to understand a child in four months, but they get paid and trained and it is their job to try to keep him safe.' Ms Macleod with her son Ellis. the worried mother refuses to allow her son to go back to the school and is still waiting for an alternative placement . Ms Macleod wrote to education officials and during a meeting showed photographs of the injuries. She has now been told that she could take Ellis to Obsdale nursery in Alness for two-and-a-half hours each day, which she is happy to do. Council vice-convener Maxine Smith, said: 'It is my understanding that Ellis is being provided for at the same school as his sister in the meantime. 'The problem with the special school in Tain he is best suited to attend is that there is physically not enough room at this time. However, the education department is working on this. 'Regarding the injuries sustained, that sound horrendous. I am waiting for the council to investigate this, which will take some time, and get back to me.' Despite repeated contacts, no formal comment was available from Highland Council.","Ellis Tattersall broke his nose and burnt his hands in two separate incidents .

Men who took vitamin C supplements at least once a day had the highest risk of kidney stones . Men who take vitamin C supplements every day double their risk of suffering from kidney stones, new research suggests. The excruciating condition is on the rise - and Swedish researchers say a bi-product of the vitamin may be to blame. Men who took vitamin C supplements at least once a day had the highest risk of kidney stones. The condition affects 12 per cent of men and four per cent of women in the UK. 'It has long been suspected that high doses of vitamin C may increase the risk of kidney stones, said lead researcher Laura Thomas, from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm. This is because some of the vitamin C absorbed by the body is excreted in urine as oxalate, one of the key components of kidney stones. Stones are made up of tiny crystals, which can be formed by calcium combining with oxalate. The study tracked more than 22,000 middle-aged and elderly for 11 years. The current analysis included 907 men . who said they took regular vitamin C tablets and more than 22,000 who . didn't use any nutritional supplements. Swedish supplements, like those the . study participants would have taken, typically contain about 1,000 . milligrams (mg) of vitamin C per tablet. Most vitamin C supplements sold . in the U.K contain either 500 or 1,000 mg. A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice contains around 120mg. The condition affects 12 per cent of men and four per cent of women in the UK . Of the vitamin C users, 3.4 per cent . developed kidney stones for the first time during the study, compared to . 1.8 per cent of non-supplement users. The findings appear in the journal JAMA Internal medicine. The researchers said hat because there are no clear . benefits tied to taking high-dose vitamin C, people who have had stones . in the past might want to think before taking extra supplements. But the findings do not mean people . shouldn't get plenty of vitamin C through fruits and vegetables, since . the antioxidant is important for bone and muscle health - and severe . deficiency can cause scurvy. 'Vitamin C is an important part of a . healthy diet,' Thomas said. 'Any effect of vitamin C on kidney stone . risk is likely to depend both on the dose and on the combination of . nutrients with which it is ingested.' Kidney stones are stone-like lumps that can develop in one or both of the kidneys. The waste products in the blood can occasionally form crystals that collect inside the kidneys. Over time, the crystals may build up to form a hard stone-like lump. After a kidney stone has formed, the body tries to pass it out in urine. If a stone is small, this may even go undetected. However, it is fairly common for a stone to block part of the urinary system, such as the ureter (the tube connecting the kidney to the bladder) or the urethra (the tube through which urine passes out of the body). If this happens, it can cause crippling pain in the back, abdomen or groin, painful urinary infections and in some cases, . kidney failure. Many people who have suffered kidney stones descibe the pain as 'excruciating' and worse than child birth. ‘Our modern lifestyles are responsible, particularly because we don’t . drink enough water and eat the wrong foods,’ explains Daron Smith, a . consultant urologist at University College Hospital, London. A poor diet and dehydration are major risk factors (Saudi Arabia has one of the highest kidney stone rates in the world). Certain people have higher than . average levels of stone-forming chemicals in their body called oxalate. This means cutting down coffee, spinach and rhubarb – all of which are . high-oxalate foods.","'Excruciatingly painful' condition affects 12 per cent of men and four per cent of women in the UK .

A brain-boosting milkshake that is said to reduce symptoms of early Alzheimer's has gone on sale in the UK today. The drink contains a mix of ‘memory boosting’ nutrients including those found in breast milk and herring. The ‘medical food’ comes after a decade . of research into a formula food that might improve the brain function of . people in the early stages of the disease. Scroll down for video . The makers of Souvenaid claim it can help reduce the symptoms of early Alzheimer's . Souvenaid, taken as a 125ml once-a-day drink, has ingredients that work together to boost brain cells important for memory. It . contains omega 3 fatty acids, the nutrient found in fish which is known . to be good for the brain, with a daily dose equivalent to eating three . or four herrings. The drink also contains two other compounds . normally present in the blood - uridine, which is produced by the liver . and kidneys and found in breast milk, and choline found in meat, nuts . and eggs - B vitamins and other nutrients. It will be available . over-the-counter in pharmacies and online at £3.49 for a daily dose - . adding up to almost £1,300 a year - and consumers have to confirm they . have consulted a doctor or other health professional. Studies . originally carried out by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of . Technology suggest it helps improve memory performance after six months . in people with mild Alzheimer’s who are not taking drugs. However, a study on people with moderate Alzheimer’s who were on prescribed medication found no improvement. The Alzheimer's Society has warned the milkshake 'is a lot less effective than current drugs available for people in the early stages of dementia' Some . have welcomed Souvenaid for providing a new dietary aid to improve the . health of early Alzheimer’s patients, but critics warned it was an . expensive option that was less effective than drugs. Around 800,000 people in the UK live with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form. The . loss of connections in the brain called synapses which help relay . information is one of the key features of early Alzheimer’s. The . three main compounds in Souvenaid are needed by brain nerve cells to . make phospholipids, the primary component of cell membranes that form . synapses. Dr David Wilkinson, Consultant in Old Age Psychiatry, said . ‘Alzheimer’s disease is not part and parcel of aging but a serious and . progressive disease of the brain which prevents us from being able to . retain new memories. ‘As we age, our bodies become less efficient at . processing essential nutrients, meaning that we need to increase our . intake of food to absorb the same amount of nutrients in order to . maintain a healthy body. In the same way, we need the right nutrients . for our brains to keep them healthy. ‘Alzheimer’s disease sufferers . often find it very difficult to get everything they need through diet . alone and the nutritional intervention by the use of Souvenaid is a new . area of research offering promising results for the management of early . Alzheimer’s disease.’ Products marketed as food for special medical . purposes do not have to go through the same EU regulatory process as . drugs.

A mafia boss tried to ensure his daughter did well in a TV talent show by forcing his entire community to vote for her. Domenico Ferrara handed out mobile phones to neighbours and relatives in the district of Villaricca  in Naples so that they could cast multiple votes for 13-year-old Vania. He made sure the phones were returned so he could check his orders had been carried out, Italian police said yesterday. But the votes of the terrified community were only enough to propel  Vania to second place in the final  of Rai 1’s I’ll Leave You With A Song.

Police chief Captain Francesco Piroddi said: ‘The Ferrara clan exercised complete control over the district of Villaricca. ‘This number of phones cannot be explained by the fact that Ferrara did not want to have his calls intercepted, nor that they were for use by his gang members.’ I'll Leave You with a Song features a large group of children contestants who are . selected from among the leading students of Italy's most prestigious . music schools.

A woman whose mother died of breast cancer has become the first in Britain to take preventative medication to reduce her risk of developing the disease. The innovative treatment could now be offered to thousands more women after new guidelines were announced yesterday aimed at protecting those most at risk of breast cancer. Charlotte Stockton, from Altrincham, started taking tamoxifen in summer 2011 at the age of 35 because of her family history of the illness. Cancer-free: Charlotte Stockton has been taking Tamoxifen as a preventative for 18 months . She was healthy and had no signs of cancer but decided to take part in the trial at the Genesis Prevention Centre in Manchester to minimise her chances of falling victim. Miss Stockton's mother, Patti, died from the illness 20 years ago aged only 44, so she feared that she, too, could be vulnerable. When Miss Stockton, who is now 36, discovered two benign lumps, it gave her the impetus to sign up for the pioneering treatment. She was referred to the Genesis Centre where tests revealed she had a high risk of developing the cancer. But doctors say her risk of developing breast cancer has been minimised by taking part in the preventative medication study. Miss Stockton is one of 136 healthy women taking a daily tamoxifen pill for five years as part of the clinic's research. Family history: Charlotte Stockton, pictured left as a child with her mother, Patti, hopes to avoid breast cancer . The drug, which blocks the uptake of the hormone oestrogen by cancer cells, stopping them multiplying, is normally given to women with the illness to reduce their risk of the cancer recurring. But research has shown it can reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent when used as a preventative medication. International trials showed its preventative effects could last up to 20 years. Powerful drugs: Tamoxifen may now be used to prevent breast cancer . Yesterday the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) suggested women at risk of developing breast cancer should be offered the powerful preventative drugs raloxifene (Evista) or tamoxifen (Nolvadex, Istubal or Valodex). Even those judged to be at 'moderate' risk could be given daily medication for five years before or after the mediation in what has been hailed an 'historic step' in the history of treating breast cancer. NICE, the watchdog that advises the NHS on best practice, said it was recommending the drugs because there was 'good evidence' to show they worked in a preventative capacity. Breast cancer specialist Professor Michael Baum said the drugs were a 'reasonable option' for women at high risk because of evidence that they cut the death rate. He said ‘I don’t think women or doctors will be deterred from using them by the lack of a licence. ‘NICE's support for preventive drugs could encourage clinicians, it will give them more confidence when talking to women at high risk about their options.' Miss Stockton, an academic health researcher who lives with her partner Joanne, 39, said: 'It was obviously very hard losing my mum at the age of 15 and the memories of her illness have stayed with me even though I was very young. 'When I was told about the trial and asked to take part, it was a no-brainer. 'Anything to reduce my risk of breast cancer can only be a good thing, so I didn't have to think twice. 'I've been on the trial for a year and a half and I'm very happy with it: tests have shown that I'm cancer-free. 'It's great that this trial is leading the way nationally.' 'Anything to reduce my risk can only be a good thing': Charlotte Stockton takes tamoxifen daily . One in 10 women in Britain will develop breast cancer, and studies have shown a strong genetic link. The disease is the most common cancer in the UK with around 50,000 women and 400 men diagnosed with the condition each year. Women with faulty genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 are among those who have a more than 80 per cent chance of being diagnosed with the disease. Professor Tony Howell, research director at Genesis, said: 'The first patient to be treated with tamoxifen was treated at The Christie in 1969 so Manchester has a long history of leading the way in breast cancer research and treatments. 'Our studies have shown that it can help to reduce the risk of breast cancer by 70 per cent in some women so I welcome the draft guidance by NICE with open arms.' The hormonal drug tamoxifen has been a mainstay of breast cancer treatment for 30 years. It halves the chances of the disease returning or affecting the other breast and reduces the risk of dying from it. The drug is used for five years after surgery and works in breast cancers stimulated by the hormone oestrogen. Prevention trials show it cuts the chances of developing the disease by 30 to 40 per cent. Tamoxifen can be used in women before the menopause, unlike some newer drugs, as well as afterwards. According to Macmillan Cancer Support, possible side effects include hot flushes, nausea, indigestion, weight gain and leg cramps. Less common side effects can include depression, tiredness, headaches, blood clots, vision problems, voice changes and, in rare cases, womb cancer. Tamoxifen is still used by thousands of patients although newer, more effective drugs called aromatase inhibitors have become more important. Raloxifene, which is prescribed for thinning bones, halves the chances of developing invasive breast cancer and has fewer side effects than tamoxifen. It is not allowed as a first-choice treatment on the NHS but is an alternative if patients can't tolerate cheaper drugs.","Charlotte Stockton, 36, is perfectly healthy but takes tamoxifen daily .

A hospital has sparked outrage by announcing it is to erect a smoking shelter outside a cancer ward. Managers at the new £400 million University Hospital of North Staffordshire have applied for planning permission for five shelters on site after patients repeatedly ignored the no-smoking policy. They will be put up outside the hospital's maternity block, two main entrances and its accident and emergency unit. Bosses at the new £400 million University Hospital of North Staffordshire have applied for planning permission for five smoking shelters on site . But the final shelter is to be installed outside the hospital's cancer ward - a move which has infuriated victims of the disease and charities. Cancer survivor Harry Larkins, 70, from Cheadle, Staffs., who still has annual check-ups after beating the disease in 2009, yesterday (Wed) slammed the decision. He said: 'I know they have to accommodate smokers, but a lot of people in the cancer ward have smoked throughout their lives and don't need reminding that could be the reason they are there. 'It's just plain insensitive. It is a huge site and they could put them somewhere a lot more discreet. I think it's a terrible error of judgement.' Ron Locker, founder of the Staffordshire Moorlands Cancer Support Group, said: 'I understand the difficulty of people who have been smoking all their lives to just quit. The move was taken after ents repeatedly ignored the hospital's no-smoking policy (posed by model) 'But it is not pleasant for patients heading into hospital to have to walk through people smoking outside.' Councillor Colin Eastwood, chairman of Newcastle Borough Council's Health Scrutiny Committee, said: 'I don't feel the shelters are really addressing the problem of smoking. It is almost like condoning smoking. 'Smoking is a real issue in the local area and it concerns me that the hospital is providing for them. 'What they should be doing is supporting smokers who are admitted to hospital to quit the habit.' Hospital officials yesterday refused to explain why a smoking shelter was planned for the cancer centre. Chief Nurse Liz Rix said: 'We do not condone smoking on our premises by patients, visitors or staff. 'However, a degree of pragmatism has been adopted to keep the hospital clean and tidy and smokers away from building entrances. 'The beautiful main entrance has become a particular problem area with a large number of smokers congregating and at times it has been difficult to keep the area clean. 'We accept this has caused problems for neighbouring residential areas and are working with unions to see what actions can be taken to alleviate this. 'We enforce a blanket ban on staff smoking on our property and staff will not be allowed to use the shelters.'

'Grim fatalism': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says GPs are refusing to send patients for crucial tests to spot dementia because they believe there is no point . GPs are refusing to send patients for crucial tests to spot dementia because they believe there is no point, according to the Health Secretary. Jeremy Hunt blames shockingly low diagnosis rates on a ‘grim fatalism’ among doctors coupled with an ignorance of symptoms. His comments came as figures revealed nearly 400,000 dementia sufferers in Britain have never been given a formal diagnosis. The statistics obtained by the Alzheimer’s Society also found some NHS trusts are spotting only a third of all cases. Mr Hunt said: ‘As with cancer in the past, too many health professionals are not aware of the symptoms. Some even believe that without effective cure there is no point putting people through the anxiety of a memory test – even though drugs can help stave off the condition for several years. ‘It is a grim fatalism we need to shake off. Not just within our Health Service but in society as a whole.’ If dementia sufferers are given drugs such as Aricept and Ebixa early enough, the progression can be slowed by a year – possibly longer. Patients and their loved ones can also be offered vital care and support to help them come to terms with the debilitating illness. But writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hunt said: ‘It can be a total nightmare getting a diagnosis and the result is that shockingly, only 46 per cent of all dementia cases are identified. ‘Yet with access to the right drugs and support for a partner, someone can live happily and healthily at home for much longer. ‘We should be ashamed that we deny this to so many people in today’s NHS.’ The figures obtained by the Alzheimer’s Society show huge variation in the standards of dementia services across Britain. Not aware of symptoms: Figures revealed nearly 400,000 dementia sufferers in Britain have never been given a formal diagnosis and some NHS trusts are spotting only a third of all cases of dementia . In at least two primary care trusts, Wiltshire and Swindon, patients are being made to wait nine months before being seen at a memory clinic. Experts recommend that if a GP suspects a patient has dementia, they should only have to wait a maximum of six weeks for an appointment at one of these centres. And five NHS trusts are only managing to diagnose a third of all dementia patients. They include East Riding of Yorkshire, Dorset, North East Essex, and Kensington and Chelsea and Harrow in London. Using Freedom of information requests, the Alzheimer’s Society asked every primary care trust and health authority for the numbers of patients diagnosed for dementia last year. They then compared this figure with the estimated number of people likely to be living with the condition to work out what percentage had been diagnosed. Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘It’s disgraceful that almost half of all people with dementia are not receiving a diagnosis, and disappointing to see such a disparity in diagnosis rates in different regions of the UK.’","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said GPs are refusing to send patients for crucial tests to spot dementia because they believe there is no point .

Just months later, a routine hysterectomy made her age ten years overnight - leaving her with hollow cheeks and rotten teeth. Even worse, the dramatic effects of her surgery almost destroyed her new marriage. The 49-year-old, from Upton, Norwich, says she became depressed about her ravaged body. She now says she wishes she had never gone ahead with the operation. Change: Debbie Harvey, left, on her wedding day, aged 47, and right as she is now, just two years later . The procedure, intended to ease period pain, triggered premature menopause - and her body went into shock. The next morning, the sales manager's highlighted blonde hair began snapping off in clumps. Four of her teeth fell out in just days, her cheeks hollowed-out and her gums receded. ‘I’m not a vain person, but I was in no . way prepared to age so dramatically and unexpectedly, especially after I . had just been married,' she said. ‘I was devastated and felt such a burden . on my husband I even told him to leave me. I bitterly regretted going . ahead with the operation. ‘I’m a different person to the woman I . was before the operation. I will never be as confident but I have had to . accept the person I see in the mirror.’ Mrs Harvey, then 47, had been married . to electrician Charlie, then 45, for just six months when her GP . referred her to hospital after suffering years of crippling period pain. She’d suffered since she was a teenager and doctors had told her it would ease after she had children. Horrified: Mrs Harvey said she piled on the pounds, her teeth fell out and clumps of her hair snapped off . But after having three children during . her first marriage, daughters Sarah, 30, and Jamie, 26 and son Rob, 23, . nothing had changed. ‘I tried exercise, changes to my diet, . but nothing worked,' she said. 'In 2003, I had a laser procedure called . an endometrial ablation, which was fantastic, but the effects wore off . after about three years.' It was then her consultant suggested she consider a hysterectomy. ‘My family was complete so it made . sense. When they asked if I wanted my ovaries removed too, to reduce the . chance of ovarian cancer, I agreed. Mrs Harvey was told that the changes . would put her body into early menopause but says she failed to . understand the physical effect this would have. ‘I knew I’d likely have hot flushes but I had no idea at all that I would age so horrifically so quickly. ‘If I had known that there was any chance of that happening I would have continued managing the pain with painkillers. ‘My husband is two years younger than me and I’d always taken great pride in my appearance. Confident: Mrs Harvey, pictured looking healthy before the op with her grandson, said she felt unable to leave the house and even told her husband to leave her . ‘I was a size eight to ten and had my hair done regularly and took great care of my skin. ‘People often assumed he was the older one, which was quite a compliment. Life was wonderful.’ But all that was to change after the surgery in July 2009. Mrs Harvey was discharged four days after the operation, feeling 'horrific, like an old woman.' She could barely move and had to be helped into the car. The next morning she got the shock of her life when she noticed that most of her teeth felt wobbly. ‘I staggered to the mirror and gasped in shock. I didn’t recognise the woman looking back. She looked about ten years older than me.’ She made an emergency appointment with her dentist, who diagnosed periodontitis, a weakening of the bones supporting the teeth. Despite antibiotics, she lost four teeth over the coming days. ‘Losing the teeth changed the shape of my face,' she said. 'It sank in like an old lady's and my gums started receding. Every time I looked in the mirror I looked older. My dentist explained the shock of going through the menopause so quickly had most likely caused a huge hormone imbalance.’ Next her highlighted blonde hair snapped off like straw and her skin wrinkled and dried out. ‘I also gained weight no mater what diet I followed... in the end, just before our first wedding anniversary six months after the operation, I told Charlie he was better off without me and to go. ‘I was so depressed by what had happened to me. I had gone from a blushing bride to an old hag. I couldn’t see why he would want to stay with me. I was not the woman he married.’ Mrs Harvey sought help from her GP, who arranged for a new course of HRT, which eventually helped to settle the side effects a year after the operation. But it was another two years before she started to regain her confidence. ‘The damage was already done but I knew if I didn’t start to accept the changes I would lose everything. ‘Gradually I began to try and accept the new me and come to terms with it. But it has been a long road and it’s only the last few months that I can honestly say I’m getting there. ‘Charlie has been wonderful throughout and he has given me the strength to accept what happened. ‘It stopped the pain, but it was a huge price to pay and I still regret it every day. ‘A hysterectomy can be the answer for a lot of women, and I’m not warning against them, I just want women to be aware of the effects it can have on your looks and be prepared. 'I was not.’ A hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus and can be total - like Debbie Harvey's - or partial. It is a relatively common operation - up to one in five women in Britain will undergo this operation. In most cases, it should be performed only on women who have completed their family. There are many reasons for a hysterectomy: ovarian or uterine cancer; a severe haemorrhage; to remove multiple fibroids when a myomectomy is not suitable; to treat severe endometriosis; severe pelvic infection and prolapse of the uterus. In many cases, women opt for a hysterectomy to treat heavy periods. Recovery time is long - in some cases, it can take months before you are fully recovered because the operation triggers early menopause. Women who have has their ovaries removed will need to consider taking hormone replacement therapy.","Debbie Harvey's teeth and hair fell out and her cheeks sunk inwards .

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 11:16 EST, 11 January 2013 . Famous: Former boxer Muhammad Ali is one of world's best-known people to suffer from Parkinson's disease . A global team of scientists are hailing a major breakthrough in finding a significant link between exposure to an industrial solvent and Parkinson's disease. A team of scientists from the U.S, Canada, Germany and Argentina found that individuals who had been exposed in the workplace to trichloroethylene (TCE) were six-times more likely to develop Parkinson's. Due to concerns about its toxicity, the use of TCE in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned across much of the world since the 1970s. However, the chemical is still used as a degreasing agent. Dr Samuel Goldman of The Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, California, who co-led the study published in the journal Annals of Neurology, told the BBC: 'Our study confirms that common environmental contaminants may increase the risk of developing Parkinson's, which has considerable public health implications. 'Our findings, as well as prior case reports, suggest a lag time of up to 40 years between TCE exposure and onset of Parkinson's, providing a critical window of opportunity to potentially slow the disease before clinical symptoms appear.' Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain. It can results in limb tremors, slowed movement and speech impairment. Researchers wanted to look at the impact on people of exposure to six different solvents, including TCE. The new findings was based on analysis of 99 pairs of twins from America, one twin with Parkinson's and the other without. Scientists looked at the work history of the twins as well as hobbies and interests, so they could calculate their exposure to solvents. Diagnosis: This image shows a brain scan of a person suffering with Parkinson's disease . In the past TCE has been used in glue, carpet-cleaners, paints and dry-cleaning solutions. It is still used as a degreasing agent for metal parts. It is also estimated that 30 per cent of U.S. drinking water supplies are contaminated with the chemical. Dr Michelle Gardner, research development manager at Parkinson's UK, told the BBC that more research needed to be carried out to look at the link between solvents like TCE and Parkinson's. She added: 'This is the first study to show that the solvent TCE may be associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's. 'It is important to highlight that many of the previous uses of this solvent have been discontinued for safety reasons over 30 years ago, and that safety and protection in work places where strong chemicals such as this solvent are used has greatly improved in recent years.' Two other solvents - perchloroethylene (PERC) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) - were also found to pose a significant risk of developing the disease if people were exposed to them. There was no link found with the three other solvents examined in the study - toluene, xylene and n-hexane. PERC is used as a dry-cleaning agent and degreasing agent. CCl4's major use in the past was in the manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons for use as refrigerants.","Chemical is banned in food and pharmaceutical industries but is still used as a degreasing agent .

However after helping the casualty recover in a nearby bank, Miss Mair returned to her car to find she had been booked for illegal parking. The credit control manager had been driving to work at a book wholesaler in Leith, Edinburgh, when she spotted the woman ‘out cold’ and pulled over to help. She said: ‘I thought the girl was dead at first, but after a while she regained consciousness and I think she’d had a seizure or blacked out. ‘Obviously, I panicked when I saw that and parked up quickly to  get to her. At the same time two people arrived to help and when she came round she was a bit groggy and dazed. ‘She was complaining of stomach pains, so we took her into the Bank of Scotland to keep her warm and called an ambulance. ‘It was while we were in there I noticed I was getting a parking ticket – it had been a matter of moments. ‘My only concern was for the lady on the street, I wasn’t looking where I was parking.’ Harsh: Despite her kind actions, it appears that Edinburgh's notorious parking attendants saw Miss Mair as nothing more than an errant motorist . Bosses at NSL, which manages the city’s parking attendants, said they were ‘entirely satisfied’ that their attendant acted in a ‘sympathetic and professional way’. But Miss Mair, from Musselburgh, East Lothian, branded her treatment as ‘yet another example of an over-zealous parking attendant’ who was ‘chasing commission’.

A shopworker who had a clear view of the incident said: ‘We saw the woman being helped by some people and then being taken into the bank. ‘Next thing there was a parking attendant looking at the cars and he started writing a ticket. It’s unbelievable he could do that.’ Councillor Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh’s transport convener, said: ‘If Miss Mair was assisting with a medical emergency, we will of course cancel the ticket when she raises it with us. ‘We will also take her comments regarding the conduct of the parking attendant seriously and will investigate the matter with NSL.’","Lesley Mair abandoned her car in Edinburgh street to help young woman .

Magnetism: Scientists have found evidence suggesting salmon use the Earth's magnetic field to guide them back to their spawning grounds . Ever wondered how salmon navigate across thousands of miles of ocean without getting lost? After years feeding at sea, the fish swim through vast expanses of featureless water back to the rivers where they hatched. Now scientists may have finally answered a mystery that has baffled them for decades, after finding evidence suggesting salmon use the Earth’s magnetic field to guide them back to their spawning grounds. Researchers believe that when the fish first enter the sea, they memorise the location’s magnetic field and use it as a home address. The magnetic field varies across the globe, allowing animals to use it as a ‘map’ and determine their location. ‘To find their way back home across thousands of kilometres of ocean, salmon imprint on the magnetic field that exists where they first enter the sea as juveniles,’ said lead researcher Dr Nathan Putman of Oregon State University. ‘Upon reaching maturity, they seek the coastal location with the same magnetic field.’ To test the theory, they looked at fisheries data going back 56 years, documenting the return of sockeye salmon to the Fraser River in British Columbia. But to reach the river mouth, the fish must either swim around the north or south side of Vancouver Island. Scientists, who published their findings in the journal Current Biology, discovered their decision was influenced by the Earth’s magnetic field, which shifts slightly each year. The fish showed greater preference for the inlet that most matched the magnetic value of the Fraser River when they left it two years earlier. If it was closer north of the island, then the fish were more likely to opt for that route, while if it was south there was an increased chance they would migrate using that course. ‘When they attempt to return, they are confronted with a giant obstacle: Vancouver Island is blocking direct access to their river,’ said Dr Putman. ‘So the fish must make a choice: Do they use the northern inlet or the southern inlet in their detour?' He added: ‘Salmon have to get it right because they only have one chance to make it back to their home river, so it makes sense that they may have more than one way to get there. The research looked at fisheries data going back 56 years, documenting the return of sockeye salmon (pictured) to the Fraser River in British Columbia . Scientists found the fish showed greater preference for the inlet that most matched the magnetic value of the Fraser River (pictured) when they left it two years earlier . ‘The magnetic field is amazingly consistent, so that is a strategy that can withstand the test of time. But they may also use the sun as a compass, track waves breaking on the beach through infrasound, and use smell.’ Other animals believed to use Earth’s magnetic field to navigate include birds, turtles, and termites. And if you are ever lost in the countryside without a compass, don’t panic. Just look for a herd of cows and see which way they are pointing. Lead researcher Dr Nathan Putman said: 'Salmon have to get it right because they only have one chance to make it back to their home river' After monitoring the behaviour of thousands of cattle, scientists have found that they tend to face north, after using the magnetic field to align themselves. The behaviour is thought to be a relic of the days when the wild ancestors of today’s domesticated cattle used inbuilt compasses to find their way across the plains of Africa, Asia and Europe on long migrations. Animals are thought to use internal magnets - made of crystals of magnetite - to find their way around. Homing pigeons, for instance, have a tiny blob of these crystals in their beaks.","Scientists believe salmon memorise magnetic fields to remember locations .

'The stock will be collected over the coming days and returned to a central warehouse. 'It will be returned to suppliers if they are entitled to it.

'We are very grateful for the support we have received since our appointment and we will continue to ensure that employees are paid as they assist us during the closure.' Jessops had 192 high street stores, although five of them were closed after Christmas, before the appointment of the administrators.

Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under scrutiny over its safety record yet again - after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine mid-air and turn back three hours into a flight. The double-decker plane, which was carrying 430 passengers to Frankfurt, Germany, yesterday was in the air for three hours when crew reported a surge in one of its four Rolls-Royce engines. Pilots shut down the engine, turned flight SQ26 around and landed safely back in Singapore using the three other engines, the airline said. Scrutiny: Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under fire again, after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine and return a flight to Singapore yesterday . Worries: The double-decker plane, which was carrying 430 passengers to Frankfurt, Germany, was in the air for three hours when crew reported a surge in one of its four Rolls-Royce engines . The passengers were transferred to another plane which later took off to Frankfurt. 'The aircraft is capable of flying safely on three engines and at no time was the safety of our customers and crew compromised,' Singapore Airlines said in a statement. It did not specify the model of the engine involved, but the airline and Rolls-Royce said they would thoroughly inspect it and investigate what happened. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'We are aware of the situation and working with our customer to investigate.' It is the latest safety incident to hit the world's biggest passenger plane, which cost a staggering £250million each.

The minor cracks - no more than two . centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide . inspection.

But it said it would bring in the aircraft . for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of . hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem. It also said that these kind of problems were common in the first few years of a new aircraft, but they would eventually be ironed out. The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of . European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next . generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry. It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before.

Homes in London and the rest of the South are worth around £330billion more than the value of properties in all the rest of England, a report revealed yesterday. The report, from the Halifax bank, highlights the extraordinary gulf in property wealth between families living in the South compared to those in the North. It also reveals the nightmare facing young people trying to buy a home in the South who do not earn high salaries or do not have parents who can help them out with a deposit. North-South gulf: Homes in London (such as this elegant house in Kensington) and the rest of the South are wroth around £330billion more than those in all the rest of England . Overall, it found properties in the South are worth a total of £2,000billion, compared to a total of £1,670billion in every other English region combined - from the Midlands to the North. For example, official figures show the average cost of a home in the North East is just under £100,000. By comparison, the average price tag of a home in London is £372,000, with thousands of homes selling for more than £1million and some even costing tens of millions each. It comes after a separate report, from the estate agency Savills, found homes in London’s ten most exclusive boroughs are worth as much as those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined. The Savills report looked at the total value of all the homes in boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea, Richmond upon Thames, Hammersmith and Fulham, Wandsworth and Lambeth. 'Beverly Hills of Britain': The value of homes in Elmbridge, a corner of Surrey, is higher than the entire value of residential property in Glasgow . These homes are worth a total of £552.5billion, compared to a total of £552.7billion in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Lucian . Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: ‘More housing . wealth is being concentrated in fewer people’s hands. Property gap: Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: 'More housing wealth is being concentrated in fewer people's hands . ‘That restricts the ability of some groups, particularly younger generations, to get on to, or trade up, the housing ladder, creating longer-term implications on the lifetime cost of housing.’ Savills estimates the value of homes in Elmbridge, a corner of Surrey dubbed the ‘Beverly Hills of Britain’, is higher than the entire value of residential property in Glasgow. The district council of Elmbridge, which includes towns such as Claygate, Esher, Oxshott and Weybridge, has regularly been voted ‘the most desirable place to live in Britain.’ The Halifax report shows how the value of homes in Britain has ballooned over the last decade despite the double-dip recession and recent steep falls in house prices in many regions. In 2002, they were worth £2,568billion compared to £4,172billion today, an increase of 62 per cent. This is the equivalent of a jump of £71,200 for each home which is either owner-occupied or in the privately rented sector. Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, said the value of Britain’s private residential homes has risen much faster than the cost of living. The average home in London ‘earned’ more money last year than a typical worker in Britain with a full-time job, according to the Land Registry. The cost of the average home in the capital jumped by nearly £29,000, but the average worker earned only £26,000 before paying their tax and National Insurance bill.","The Halifax bank report found properties in the South are worth £2,000bn compared to £1,670bn in every other English region combined .

Never mind 8 megapixels on your iPhone 5: Nokia will be rolling out a new flagship phone with a 41 megapixel camera sensor, sources close to the Finnish company have confirmed. The camera technology, dubbed Pureview, first saw the light of day at the huge Barcelona mobile phone fair, Mobile World Congress, in February last year. But the technology was debuted in the last of Nokia's old range of smartphones, which used the now-defunct Symbian operating system. Picture this: The Nokia Lumia 920 is the current flagship model . Nokia's Pureview technology means that the shutter can be open for longer and getting better pictures in low light conditions . Since then Nokia has partnered with Microsoft to launch a range of handsets, the Lumias, sporting the Windows Phone interface. When Nokia and Microsoft launched the latest version of the Lumia, the 920, at the end of last year, observers wondered what had happened to the revolutionary technology, as the top of the range handset 'only' boasted an 8.7 megapixel sensor. Nowadays everybody carries a very capable camera in their pocket - on their smartphone. But cameraphones were first mooted as far back as the 1950s: there are patents dating back to 1956. Perhaps the first true cameraphone moment came on June 11 1997 when Philippe Kahn shared the first pictures from the maternity ward where his daughter Sophie was born. He wirelessly transmitted his cell phone pictures to more than 2,000 family, friends and associates around the world. Since then photosharing has exploded via social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The first camera phones, as successfully marketed by J-Phone in Japan, used CCD sensors and not CMOS sensors. Now everyone - even Sam, the cat with eyebrows - share pictures instantly from their phones. Now the amazing 41 megapixel sensor will be in the next top of the range Nokia Windows phone, which will be dubbed the EOS. But the resulting images will actually only be about 5 megapixels. However, they will be very high quality, because the both the pixels and the sensor in the new phone will be bigger than their counterparts made by other technology firms - which means a bigger area for light to be captured on. The sensor works by 'oversampling': each pixel also takes in information from surplus pixels around it. That means that 'noise' - the coloured flecks that mar the dark areas of photos taken in low light - can be reduced. It is difficult for handsets using the Windows Phone interface to stand out, as Microsoft defines the hardware specification and design very tightly. Nokia immediately sought to produce the best images possible on a camera phone. The current Lumia and the forthcoming EOS, which will launch in the US next summer, will use what Nokia calls its 'floating lens technology'. This helps stabilise a shaky hand - a gyroscope detects the movement and the entire camera mechanism moves to correct it. That means that the shutter can be open for longer, letting more light fall on pixels and reducing the need for flash - which is often very harsh on a camera phone. Nokia wouldn't confirm the move, only saying: 'While we are delighted with the attention the Nokia Lumia range continues to gather, it has been our long-held policy not to comment on market rumours or speculation.'","New Windows phone from Nokia will be called the EOS and debut in the summer .

The retired creche supervisor and carer said: 'I learnt on a Lambretta but I have always preferred Vespas. 'In the early 60s I drove a Capri and then I got a silver 125 Vespa. 'For the first test I turned up without my paper work so I failed. Then on the second one I lost the examiner. ""They used to stand on a corner, but I could not find him.

A teenage Maureen wanted to learn how to ride a scooter when she saw her 21-year-old boyfriend's red Lambretta, and despite her parents breaking up the relationship. When she turned 18 she was still determined and became involved in the mod gangs of the time. Maureen said she will ride her scooter until she is forced to stop (left) and in 2003 at a rally on a Vespa PX 125 (right) She added: 'I was a mod, but I was friends with some of the rockers, it was friendly rivalry. 'I was there for the Clacton riots. They were not that bad. I was probably on the back of my then boyfriend's red Lambretta. 'After all these years it is just really natural to me riding a scooter. 'I can drive my scooter better than I can walk now because I have arthritis in my knee. It is like having a mobility scooter. 'It is great because I never had to queue in rush hour traffic. My husband could never get the hang on riding a scooter. Maureen currently owns a bright red Vespa remake PX 125cc - a special edition made for the Olympics - and zips around the streets daily on it. As she approaches 70 her three terrified children have begged her to quit her mod scooter and get behind the wheel of a much safer car. Maureen in 1962 on her a silver Capri.

"By . Janet Street Porter . PUBLISHED: . 18:38 EST, 2 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:48 EST, 3 December 2012 . Today is Cyber Monday, the biggest day of the year for online sales. Fed up with parking charges, cold weather and the price of petrol, more of us than ever will be Christmas shopping on the internet. I'm as guilty as anyone - the booze and the fish for my festive dinner this Friday will be delivered and I won't have to carry a box more than a few feet from the front door. It's convenient to buy your Christmas stuff online, but is it morally acceptable? There are two big issues at stake. The first is tax avoidance. We know that the little people in this country pay a far bigger proportion of their earnings in tax than the rich, and the Revenue & Customs seems disproportionately obsessed with our piddling tax returns, rather than those of huge corporations. Starbucks, Google and Amazon have all been summoned to appear before a House of Commons committee to explain why they have paid so little tax in this country, if any at all... Recently, the extent of corporate tax manipulation was laid bare when the bosses of Starbucks, Google and Amazon were summoned to appear before a House of Commons committee to explain why they paid so little tax on their profits in this country. The figures were shocking - by basing their headquarters overseas, they cleverly avoid paying the same level of tax as UK-based retailers like John Lewis. These companies call it smart financial planning - I call it morally unacceptable, when they make such a big stink about their ethical values. Starbucks has 700 coffee shops in the UK, employing almost 8,500 people. They are expanding, planning another 300 stores, and yet their boss told MPs 'we are not making money in the UK'. In the last three years they paid no corporation tax at all here on sales of £1.2 billion.  Outraged customers threatened to boycott the chain and drink their coffee elsewhere, and now Starbucks has announced it is rethinking its 'approach' to tax and is in talks with HMRC. In other words, it's realised that such blatant manipulation of the system is a PR disaster. Bosses at tax-paying business John Lewis have called for an overhaul of a tax system littered with loopholes . Will Amazon follow suit? The UK accounts for 45 per cent of its sales in Europe, a whopping £3.35 billion in 2011, on which it paid just £1.8 million in tax - 2.4 per cent. No wonder the boss of John Lewis complains that retailers do not have a level playing field - if 27 per cent of your profits are going straight back to the Treasury, there's less to invest in expanding the business.  George Osborne says he is going to invest more in fighting tax avoidance schemes in his Autumn Statement this week, but I doubt these companies will suddenly be coughing up millions. Consumer power is the only way to force change - are you prepared to boycott Amazon until they pay the same level of tax as John Lewis? Christmas shoppers hit up a festively lit Guildford High Street and keep smaller retailers alive and kicking . The second issue is that online shopping is killing off the High Street. Every day, 32 shops close - over the whole country, one in seven is boarded up, and in spite of Mary Portas' Big Ideas (funded with a pitiful £5.5 million of government money), most will never open again. Marks & Spencer has reported a 10  per cent drop in profits, and the boss of the Accessorize chain says some of its 400 stores face closure. Things are grim - but what's the solution? The former chief executive of the defunct DIY chain Focus says old-style shopping centres have had their day, and the Government must focus on leisure - cafes, restaurants, galleries and advice centres - and not saving stores. As consumers, we can save our High Streets by choosing to use them. Instead, we stay at home, click a mouse, and there's no denying that's very convenient. Retailers want the Chancellor  to freeze . business rates, and  small-shop owners in trendy towns like Whitstable, . Kent, want landlords to delay rent increases. I have some sympathy, but . in the end, it's the consumers who control their destiny, and all the . signs are that we've fallen out of love with popping out to the shops. I want town centres to come alive again, but we can't turn back the clock. Online purchasing is here to stay, but . remember, every time you click that mouse for Amazon, you are increasing . the profits of a company that treats our tax system with contempt. Choose companies who are prepared to play by the rules. Odd nosh for Posh . David Beckham says he's taken cooking lessons and plans to open a restaurant with his pal Gordon Ramsay.

Going swimmingly: This goldfish has been given a tiny buoyancy to get it move around after a disability left it stranded on the bottom of its tank .

Footage of her new-found freedom has been making waves online after her American owner, known only as 'synirr', posted them on YouTube.

'She looks a little silly, but it is better than lying at the bottom of the tank all day!' And footage in which Ada happily takes food from her owner's hand is captioned: 'Have to make sure she's getting enough to eat. She is very tame :)' Buoyancy problems are fairly common among goldfish and can cause them to either float on the surface or sink to the bottom of the tank. The cause of this imbalance is due to complications with their swim bladder, a two-chambered air sack located in their body cavity that enables them to keep balance while they are not moving. Gloating about floating: Footage of Ada happily swimming around her tank has become a hit on YouTube . Disabled: Ada's owner says she has trouble maintaining her own buoyancy, which could have been caused by a problem with her swim bladder . Problems can occur for any number of . reasons including sudden changes in temperature, pressure from food or . air in the stomach, and infections. The condition can often be treated by changing the goldfish's diet as the problem usually arises from its eating habits. Owners are advised not to overfeed their fish and to try alternative floating or slow-sinking granular foods. It is also suggested changing the water or adding tonic salt to help reduce stress on the fish. If none of these measures work, it may be that the fish has permanent damage. But they can often live to a good age regardless, particularity if you have the added help your very own buoyancy aid.","Ada was stranded at the bottom of her owner's tank due to a disability .

He found that marks in a coating of aluminium powder could be seen from the other side of a translucent plate. The toy was launched in 1960 and became the top seller . that holiday season.

Embarrassing: When Hugh Robertson, pictured, tried to get into London 2012's new media centre without the necessary pass, he fell at the first hurdle . He might be the minister for the Olympics, but he’s hardly a household name. So when Hugh Robertson tried to get into London 2012’s new media centre without the necessary pass, he fell at the first hurdle. Failing to recognise the former Army major, the security men on duty correctly refused to let him into the multi-million pound venue. But their professionalism did not go down well with the Tory MP. ‘I’m the Olympics minister. You should damn well know who I am,’ he snorted. Faced with blank looks from the guards, the usually mild-mannered Tory MP is then alleged to have become ‘very angry’ – a claim flatly denied by Mr Robertson’s spokesman. A ten minute stand-off followed before someone inside the building vouched for the minister and he was finally allowed in. Afterwards a security officer recalled how  the MP had snapped at him: ‘He said, “I’m the Olympics minister. You should damn well know who I am”. ‘I didn’t have a clue who he was and we have to check everyone’s identification whoever they are. ‘He should know that better than anyone else.’ A second guard added: ‘He said “I’m on the television all the time”, but I had never seen him before. I think it was out of order.’ The guards complained to supervisors, but were told by press officers to let the former soldier inside so that he could address waiting journalists. A source at the London Organising Committee of the Olympics and Paralympics said Mr Robertson was ‘not happy’ when he was finally allowed into the building.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:58 EST, 2 August 2011 . The first close-up images of the massive asteroid Vesta have revealed a northern hemisphere littered with craters - including a trio nicknamed 'Snowman' - and a smoother southern half. Running along the asteroid's equator are deep grooves - a surprise to scientists who did not expect to see such features. Chief scientist Christopher Russell, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said last night: 'We're seeing quite a varied surface.' Scroll down for video . Rough terrain: A set of three craters - nicknamed 'Snowman' - are seen in this image of the northern hemisphere of Vesta taken by Nasa's orbiting Dawn spacecraft from a distance of about 3,200miles . The images were taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft, which began orbiting the 330mile-wide rocky body last month and has now started to beam back incredible surface details that the team is only beginning to pore over. It is the first time that Vesta has been viewed up close. Until now, it has only been photographed from afar. Since entering orbit, Dawn has taken more than 500 images, while refining its path and inching ever closer to the surface to get a better view. The probe will officially start collecting science data next week once it is 1,700miles from the surface. It will get as close as 110miles while it orbits Vesta for a year. Up close: Dawn began orbiting the 330mile-wide rocky body last month and has now started to beam back incredible surface details . An artist's impression of the Dawn spacecraft orbiting Vesta . Vesta's southern section is dominated by . a giant crater, the result of a collision eons ago that is believed to . have pelted Earth with numerous meteorites, or broken off pieces of . asteroids. The northern side is filled with older craters including three that scientists have dubbed 'Snowman'. Vesta . is 'so rich in features' that it will keep scientists busy for years, . said Holger Sierks, of the Max Planck Society in Germany, who helped to . operate the camera. Currently some 117million miles from . Earth, Vesta is the second-largest resident of the asteroid belt, a zone . between Mars and Jupiter filled with hundreds of thousands of space . rocks orbiting the sun. The belt formed some 4.5billion years ago, around the same time and under similar conditions as Earth and the inner planets. It . is thought that larger chunks such as Vesta could have merged into . planets had they not been foiled by Jupiter's gravity. Despite being . denied planethood, asteroids are of interest to researchers because they . date back to the early solar system. Powered . by ion propulsion instead of conventional rocket fuel, Dawn slid around . Vesta on July 15 after a 1.7billion-mile cruise. Most orbit insertions . are tricky because a speeding craft has to slow down or risk . overshooting its target. Since Dawn has been travelling slow relative to Vesta, the orbit capture was a ho-hum event. 'It wasn't dramatic, but it is exciting,' said chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Launched . in 2007, Dawn is the first mission to explore Vesta and Ceres, the two . largest members of the asteroid belt. It is also the largest . interplanetary probe launched by Nasa, measuring 64ft tip-to-tip with . its solar panels unfurled. Unprecedented: It is the first time that Vesta has been viewed up close. Until now, it has only been photographed from afar . Though . the $466million project was conceived long before the U.S. decided to . send astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, the data gathered by Dawn should . help future manned missions. After a year, Dawn will move on to Ceres, where it will arrive in 2015. Unlike dry and rocky Vesta, Ceres is icy and may have frost-covered poles. Due to the possible presence of frozen water, Dawn will not be able to venture as close to Ceres' surface for fear of contaminating the asteroid. The team does not plan to post raw images online as other Nasa missions have done. Instead, there will be just one picture released daily.

A schoolboy found hanged in woods may have been playing a prank which went wrong, an inquest heard. Liam Collier, 15, died on a rope swing just two months after his mother Deborah, 35, lost a battle with cancer. But the boy’s stepfather Alan Collier told the Sheffield hearing Liam was a 'joker' and had never spoken about harming himself following his mother’s death. He had been in a normal mood and was even 'playfighting' before he was found in a small wooded ravine about 400 yards from his home. Liam's stepfather Alan described him as a 'joker' and said: 'His personality was far better than anybody else's' Asked by assistant deputy coroner Louise Slater if he might have been playing a prank that backfired, Mr Collier, 47, replied: 'I do believe that, yes. 'His personality was far better than anybody else’s. He could make a party into a good party. His personality was second to none, he was a joker. 'My thoughts mainly are that something went wrong, terribly wrong that day.' Liam, from Elsecar, near Barnsley left home to meet friends at 6pm on Monday, April 30 last year. Two hours later family friend Keith Winder’s partner got a call from his stepdaughter who was 'in hysterics' and screaming that Liam had hanged himself. Mr Winder was the first adult on the scene and said: 'I was running down the banking and all the kids were at the bottom. They were all just screaming and I didn’t see Liam at first.' Liam's mother Deborah died just two months earlier . He tried to support Liam’s weight as paramedics were called but efforts to resuscitate the schoolboy failed and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Detective Sergeant Helena Day said Liam had two photographs on him which he had shown to his friends and said one was of his biological father. Liam, who leaves three brothers, had been alone on a rope swing and his friends were not paying attention to what he was doing. DS Day, who carried out inquiries said: 'A few of the young people did mention that following his mother’s death Liam had spoken about taking his own life. 'Two young people in particular mentioned that Liam had told them he had made slits to his wrist.' But no adults had seen the marks and his friends did not take the matter further so it was 'very difficult' to conclude what had happened. The police decided there were no suspicious circumstances and the cause of death was given as hanging. Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner told the schoolboy’s family: 'The circumstances surrounding Liam’s death are particularly sad and tragic, I’m really sorry for your loss.' After the hearing Mr Collier paid tribute to 'outgoing' Liam whom he nicknamed 'Jack the lad.' He said: 'It’s been rough. I’m glad with the verdict. I think it sums it up. I believe it was a prank gone wrong.' One neighbour at the time of Liam’s death spoke of 'a cheeky and mischievous lad with a heart of gold' while tributes on a memorial website included one from an aunt which read 'you brought endless sunshine until you went away.'

Foxes and hounds are usually enemies, but Roxy has lived for 13 years alongside dogs, going for 'walkies', playing fetch and chewing bones. She was rescued by staff at Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary, after being found almost strangled hanging off a bridge from rope around her neck. But as volunteers at the sanctuary nursed the red fox back to health, they noticed she had canine tendencies and was used to human interaction. When Roxy had recovered enough to be released back into the wild, staff were worried she had become too domesticated to survive - and were forced to let her stay at the sanctuary full time. Lucky Roxy now enjoys a dog's life - playing with squeaky dog toys, chasing balls, and chewing on bones in the sanctuary's gardens. She enjoys a daily walk with the centre's dogs, and walks to heel on the lead. She even snuggles up to staff for tummy tickles and wags her tail in appreciation. Geoff Grewcock, who runs the sanctuary, said: 'We found Roxy dangling from a bridge, caught in a rope. She was very lethargic, and obviously very ill.

Sergei Filin, 42, nearly lost his sight after suffering third-degree burns to his face and neck in the attack three weeks ago after a masked man threw acid in his face outside his home in central Moscow. Now in an extraordinary twist, the ballet's biggest star Nickolai Tsiskaridze claims managers have been dropping hints he was involved as part of a sinister campaign to oust him from the world-famous dance group. Real target? Nikolai Tsiskaridze claims that as the Bolshoi's 'most famous' dancer he is at the centre of a Stalin-style witch hunt . Mr Tsiskaridze, 39, believes that as the Boshoi's 'most famous dancer', it is he not Filin who is the real target of a Stalin-style witch hunt. And despite having a 'cast-iron and concrete alibi', he believes he is the victim of a conspiracy to link him with the attack. Acid attack: Sergei Filin, 42, nearly lost his sight after the attack outside his home in central Moscow . He told the BBC: 'It's like being back in . the days of Joseph Stalin. 'They're organising meetings against me, . they're trying to force staff to sign letters condemning me - they tried . that last week. 'But all the ballet teachers in the Bolshoi refused to sign it. 'They have decided to use this as an excuse for a witch hunt, to get rid of all the people they don't like. This isn't against Sergei Filin, It's directed against me.' Mr Tsiskaridze went on to accuse the ballet's general director Anatoly Iksanov of trying to 'settle scores' with him. He added: He wants to damage my reputation. But my reputation can't be damaged. I was, and, I still am the most famous dancer in the Bolshoi.' Filin, who is being treated for his injuries at a German Clinic, said he believes the attack was linked to his job as he has received repeated threats. A Moscow native, he joined the Bolshoi in 1988 and was named its artistic leader in March 2011, after three years in a similar position at another Moscow theatre. Such is the power and prestige of the post in Russian life that Anatoly Iksanov, director of the Bolshoi, said he believed the attack was a product of envy or rivalry.

Treatment: The artistic director of the Bolshoi ballet Sergei Filin was interviewed at the hospital in Moscow where he was being treated after the attack .

Bolshoi, which has both ballet and opera troupes, reopened last . February after a six-year renovation to its landmark colonnaded . building, close to Red Square in the very centre of Moscow.

After the . tightly controlled three-decade tenure of Yuri Grigorovich ended in . 1995, the Bolshoi Ballet went through five artistic directors before . Filin's appointment. He said: 'Someone really doesn't like what I've been doing there. Perhaps they don't like the fact I've been successful.' Dancers and staff at the Bolshoi, which has become a hotbed of infighting, backstabbing and overinflated egos, have claimed Filin may have even staged the attack himself. After Filin appeared on Russain Television without a bandage, Tsiskaridze, even went so far as to suggest he might not have been injured at all saying: 'If that really was acid you wouldn't be able to show your face for months.'

Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, faces demands to hand back up to £6 million in bonuses earned at the height of the rate rigging scandal. The state backed bank is preparing to appeal to Goodwin and former RBS investment bank chief Johnny Cameron to voluntarily give up their awards after deciding that the chances of successful legal action would be slim. But these efforts to ‘appeal to their better nature’ were described last night as ‘laughable’ by critics. The news came as chief executive Stephen Hester also faced growing pressure to forfeit a £2 million bonus awarded in 2010. Former Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Sir Fred Goodwin, pictured, has been asked to repay the £6m bonus earned during the rate rigging scandal . RBS, fined £390 million for criminally rigging crucial interest rates on Wednesday, has already pledged to use special ‘claw back’ powers to recoup £300 million from staff. But the bank believes its only option is to ask Goodwin and Cameron to voluntarily hand back some of the lavish rewards paid during their disastrous reign. Banks only have the power to dock ‘deferred’ bonuses – issued in company shares - that have not yet paid out.  RBS also introduced the policy in 2009, after it received a £45 billion bail out from taxpayers, meaning it cannot automatically recoup bonuses paid before then. This means those at the helm of RBS when the worst of the rate–rigging was going on are currently untouchable unless criminal statutes are enforced. One option is mounting a legal battle to retrieve some of Goodwin’s bonuses if the disgraced former boss refuses to co-operate. Goodwin was stripped of his knighthood last year over his role in the bank’s collapse. But insiders believe it would be too costly and the chances of success would be slim. Chairman . Sir Philip Hampton said on Wednesday that the option of asking ex . directors to voluntarily hand back their bonuses is ‘being addressed’. Under pressure: Chief executive Stephen Hester is facing growing pressure to forfeit a £2 million bonus awarded in 2010 . But this was slammed by critics. Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Centre said: ‘They had to force Goodwin to give back some of his pension - it’s highly unlikely that he will just hand back his bonus.’ She added:  ‘Morally you’d think Goodwin and Cameron would feel some obligation to make amends for what happened under their make money at all costs culture. But Philip Hampton is assuming that bankers still have some moral standards when they are quite happy to just take the money and run.’ Fred Goodwin ran RBS from 2000 until it collapsed in October 2008, and was rescued with a £45 billion bail-out from taxpayers. The rigging of Libor interest rates  started under his watch in January 2006 and went on until November 2010. Goodwin, received a £2.8 million bonus in 2006 and a £2.9 million pay out the following year when the worst of the wrong-doing occurred. He enjoys a £342,500 pension paid for by the taxpayer. He had been in line for a £550,000 annual pension, having cashed in a £2.7 million tax free lump sum, but was forced into giving up more than £200,000 a year after months of political pressure. Other executives who could receive a call from RBS include Johnny Cameron, the former head of the investment bank. Cameron, who has received a lifetime ban from the City for his part in the bank’s collapse, received over £4 million in bonuses, split between 2006 and 2007. This week Hampton warned of the ‘dangerous’ consequences if rogue traders are not locked up. He pledged to help authorities investigating 21 RBS workers involved in manipulating interest rates. This includes six individuals still working at the bank. He said: ‘If people don’t end up in prison over this scandal I worry it will further perpetuate the sense that there is one rule for the financial system and another set of rules.’ Incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney also described Libor rigging as ‘reprehensible’ and said it ‘should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law in the various jurisdictions that are affected.’ Chief executive Stephen Hester also came under fire last night for refusing to hand back a £2 million shares bonus awarded in 2010 while his traders cointinued to rig interest rates. Half of this bonus is due to pay out this year. Liberal democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said: ‘The  board looks more laughable by the day. Asking Fred Goodwin for a generous  gesture  now is like whistling in a hurricane. But the real test for the RBS board is to see how long it takes them to realise Hester cannot possibly ckling on to his £2m bonus awarded in 2010 when the bank was still rigging rates.’ The row comes amid reports that scandal hit Barclays is set to dish out between £1.5 billion and £2 billion in bonuses to staff for their work last year, despite being emboiled in a string of scandals. This would mark a drop from the £2.2 billion awarded for 2011, £1.5 billion of which was paid to its investment bankers. But it comes after arguably its most shameful year in its 323 year history. In the summer it was slapped with a £290 million fine for rigging crucial interest rates. It set aside another £1.6 billion to pay compensation to customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.  And it has built up an £850 million pot to compensate small businesses sold interest rate swaps alongside loans. These complex financial instruments were meant to protect firms, from care homes to hair salons, from rising interest rates. Instead they often left businesses with crippling bills when rates fell to record lows. Chief executive Antony Jenkins has attempted to douse public anger by banning upfront cash bonuses for more than a thousand top investment bankers.","Fred Goodwin ran RBS from 2000 until it collapsed in October 2008 .

A Conservative candidate whose attempt to rig a local by-election by forging signatures was uncovered because of a spelling mistake has been jailed for 12 months. Cengizhan Cerit, 47, known as Jem Cerit, needed ten residents to nominate him so he could stand as a candidate for Beaver Ward in the Ashford Borough Council by-election in November 2011. But the wealthy businessman and landlord, who owns fast-food chain Perfect Pizza, faked the  signatures on his election registration form and then tried to apply for hundreds of postal votes so he could rig the election. His cheating scheme was exposed by a simple spelling error - where a man was listed twice with two spellings of the name ‘Arnold’. Scam: Cerit faked the signatures of Beaver Ward residents on his nomination form to stand as a councillor for Ashford Borough Council, pictured . Canterbury Crown Court heard the . Turkish property owner, who ran an empire of 68 houses with more than . 300 tenants, failed to spot the mistake in the Electoral Register. The father-of-two, who denied the offences, was convicted by a jury of three charges of election fraud at . Canterbury Crown Court today and was ailed for 12 months. Judge Adele Williams told him: 'This was . a fraud which struck at the heart of democracy. You tried to corrupt . the legitimate electoral process. 'These forgeries were crude, but such was your arrogance that you thought you could get away with it. 'You sought to blame others - employees and your girlfriend - but there was only one person responsible and that was you. 'You sought to interfere with legitimate electoral process of our democracy. This is a very serious matter indeed.' Alex Chalk, prosecuting, previously told the court: 'This is a case about misconduct in the democratic process. 'Cerit, . a candidate standing for election, submitted electoral documents to the . Electoral Services Department knowing that the signatures on those . documents were false. Election cheat: Cengizhan Cerit tried to apply for hundreds of postal votes so he could rig the election result . 'Cerit was interviewed by the local Conservative Association on October 25 and selected as the Party’s candidate. 'He was provided with nomination forms and instructed to complete one of them within two days. 'The . Conservative Party agent Gordon Williams returned to his office that . morning and discovered the two forms had been delivered duly completed, . even though only one had been necessary. 'On . examination, however, he noted that two of the signatures looked the . same - with only a difference in the spelling of ‘Arnold’ Madzianura. 'He queried this but Cerit reassured him they were two different people. That statement was false.' The same day the forms were sent to the . Electoral Services Department and officials noted the signatures . appeared almost identical. The prosecutor said that later checks revealed the second ‘Arnold’ - recorded as ‘Anorld’ at another address - didn’t exist. Mr Chalk added: 'All, bar one, of the . signatures on the first form were false. All six voters who could be . contacted in respect of a second form confirmed that the signatures were . false.' Officials then received a list of 200 names and addresses in Beaver Ward wanting to register to make a postal vote just a week before the deadline. He . said: 'The information on these lists were found to be inaccurate . because some of the individuals recorded as wanting postal votes already . had them, some of them were recorded on both lists and other names were . recorded as no longer being resident at the address.' The court heard how CCTV later showed that it was Cerit who had delivered the postal vote applications to the council. Trial: Cerit denied election fraud but was found guilty by a jury at Canterbury Crown Court . An investigation was launched and . police raided a first floor office above ‘Perfect Pizza’ at in Ashford, . Kent, and Cerit was arrested. He was asked where the signatures came from and told officers: 'I send the guys around to get those people to sign.' Mr . Chalk added: 'When pressed on who the ""guys"" were, he mentioned Yanis . or Cameron, adding later that ""girlfriends"" might have done so too. 'He said he had spoken to people on the forms and had said he was standing as a councillor and he expected their support. 'He stated that he had spoken to the individuals first and confirmed that they were happy to vote.' The prosecutor said police had also . questioned ‘the guys’, who included Cerit’s partner Oksana Nadeja, her . sister Natalijia Ivanova and seven others, and 'all were able to state . they had not been asked to fill in, deliver or collect, application . forms'. He added: . 'Statements were later taken from some of the individuals whose names . appeared on application documents for electoral registration by post - . most were East European, Polish, Latvian and Rumanian - and they were . able to confirm that the signatures on the documents were fake.' Cerit, . from Kingsnorth, Kent, stood for election in May 2011 and polled 335 . votes - losing out to two other candidates who polled 481 and 479 votes. But four months later one of the councillors, Brendan Naughton, died, which resulted in the need of a by-election. DC Stuart Champion, from Kent Police, said: 'It was a long and complicated case and we are pleased with the result. We want to the send the message out that you just can't do this and it will not be tolerated.'","Cengizhan Cerit stood as a candidate for Ashford Borough Council in 2011 .

No care: Gloria Foster, 81, was found close to death after being left for nine days without treatment when police closed down the care agency looking after her . A council was warned by police that an 81-year-old woman needed urgent care but failed to act - leading to the woman starving to death in her own home, it has emerged. Stroke victim Gloria Foster depended on agency nurses who visited her home four times a day for food, water and medication. But . after the agency was closed down last month – for allegedly employing . illegal immigrants – her council did nothing to look after her. It has now emerged that on the day the raids took place, Surrey County Council was given a list of all the agency's clients and contact details by the Metropolitan Police. According to the Daily Telegraph, this included Mrs Foster. But the council failed to provide any alternative arrangements for the widow's care and she spent nine days alone at home. When someone eventually went to her . home, in Banstead, Surrey, on January 24, they found that Mrs Foster had . all but wasted away. She was severely dehydrated, suffering kidney failure, had serious bed sores and only a faint pulse. She was taken to Epsom Hospital but died on Monday. Detectives from Surrey Police are now investigating Mrs Foster's death and have seized her care register as evidence. She had been receiving help in her own . home from Carefirst24, but Surrey County Council . became responsible for her care after a number of its workers were . arrested last month following a UK Border Agency (UKBA) raid . The care register shows that Mrs Foster last received care on January 15. The nurse wrote that she gave Mrs Foster spaghetti bolognese and fruit juice. She also wrote that she put on the washing machine and left Mrs Foster watching TV. Mrs Foster was then found at home on January 24 with her walking frame out of reach in the lounge. The washing which the nurse placed inside the machine was still inside. Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Jo Wood, Mrs Foster's god-daughter, said: 'Can you imagine just lying there not being able to move for nine days? It must have been horrific. What happened to her is simply unforgivable.' Mrs Foster, left, from Banstead, Surrey, depended on nurses for food, water and medication . Her friends have previously said that what happened to her had been ‘appalling’ and demanded answers from Surrey County Council, the local authority responsible for her care. Ann Penston, from Sutton, said: ‘How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen? ‘How can they just close this thing down and not identify the people they were supposed to be taking care of? ‘She did not deserve to go out like this – in agony with a total feeling of being lost.’ Mrs Foster’s MP, Conservative Crispin Blunt, described her ordeal as ‘horrific’. He said: ‘Clearly there are questions to answer and I would expect a comprehensive investigation between all of the agencies involved.’ Mrs Foster, a lover of classical music and the theatre who is believed to have worked as a stenographer, had no children. Her husband Bob, an accountant, died in a car crash in Saudi Arabia about 30 years ago. Worrying: Six people were arrested when police and the UK Border Agency raided Carefirst 24's premises in Cheam, on January 15 . She had suffered a stroke and lived alone in the £200,000 house she had owned since 1984. Private agency Carefirst24 had a . lucrative contract from the council to look after her. But the agency . was suspected of employing illegal immigrants and six people were . arrested by UK Border Agency officials when its Sutton headquarters was . raided. Alternative arrangements should have been made but Mrs Foster did not get any replacement care. She had no idea the agency had closed . and was unable to call for help. A district nurse visited her by chance . and found her in a critical condition. Miss Penston, who had known Mrs . Foster since the 1980s, said she ‘couldn’t imagine’ how her friend would . have felt after being left alone for nine days. ‘I don’t know how she survived. She . had a glass of water by her bed. 'I don’t know if she managed to get up . and get it but my assumption is that for she was just lying there . waiting for someone to come.’ Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for . Sutton and Cheam, said the council needed to get to the bottom of why . its procedures did not work properly. The UK Border Agency said it had warned the council of plans to shut Carefirst24. Neighbours and residents condemned the failings that led to Mrs Foster’s death. A man named Robert posted an internet . message saying: ‘Surrey County Council Social Services should be . ashamed of themselves. Appalling.’ Disbelief: Ann Penston, a friend of Mrs Foster, holding a picture of the two. She said: 'How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen?' Forgotten: The woman was left without the four daily nurse visits she needed after Carefirst 24 was shut down by police and the UK Border Agency officers . Another resident said: ‘The way we treat the elderly in this country is disgusting. I hope someone is brought to task.’ All those arrested in the raid on Carefirst24 have been bailed until dates in March. Two British women aged 48 and 52, a . 52-year-old British man and a 34-year-old Mauritian man were held on . suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to facilitate foreign . nationals. They are alleged to have employed illegal workers using . former workers’ identities. Carefirst24 is owned by Mahen . Caussyram. The company’s website says: ‘Mahen is a family man who takes . his responsibilities quite seriously. He enjoys spending time at home . with family and friends.’ Mr Caussyram is a registered nurse . who ‘developed an interest in human resource management’ and worked as . an ‘activities coordinator’, the website adds. A spokesman for the council said: 'This . is now the subject of a police investigation and it would not be . appropriate to comment further other than to say we will cooperate . fully.'

A teenager who weighed more than 21 stone had a £6,000 gastric bypass on the NHS because she was tormented by school bullies for being fat. Emma Money, from Leeds, was told she had the health of someone who smokes 100 cigarettes a day. She had the operation at just 16 years old after a two-year hunt to find a surgeon willing to do it. The teenager, now 17, claims her weight, which reached 21st 6lbs, was down to a genetic condition passed down from her father. Emma Money, 17, who tipped the scales at more than 21 stone has had a £6,000 gastric bypass on the NHS because she was tormented by school bullies for being fat . The genetic condition is a controversial topic among specialists and is so rare and hard to prove, that it doesn't even have a name. It's now known that being obese can take years off your life and in some cases may be as dangerous as smoking. Researchers at the University of Oxford  found that people who were moderately fat, with a BMI from 30 to 35, lost about three years of life. Those who were morbidly fat, with a BMI above 40, lost about 10 years off their expected lifespan, similar to the effect of lifelong smoking. A healthy BMI is between 19 and 24. The conclusions were drawn after they followed nearly one million people for an average of 10-15 years. Moderately obese people were 50 per cent more likely to die prematurely than normal-weight people, said Gary Whitlock, the Oxford University epidemiologist who led the study. He said that obese people were also two thirds more likely to die of a heart attack or stroke, and up to four times more likely to die of diabetes, kidney or liver problems. They were one sixth more likely to die of cancer. Emma, who now weighs 15st after her surgery in January last year, said: 'Ever since primary school I've never felt accepted. I was terrorised and singled out, and I just didn't feel normal. 'When people are shouting, throwing things and pushing you around, it's hard to explain that you're fat because of genetics. 'I was upset and embarrassed because of my weight but the main reason I had the surgery was for my family. I wanted to reassure them that I will live a long, happy and healthy life. 'It hasn't been easy and many people have accused me of taking the easy choice out of this. But it has been tough, it has been painful, tiring and gruelling.' Emma started thinking about surgery at 14-years-old after years of abuse at school. She had always eaten healthily and could not understand why she kept putting on weight. Emma was physically abused by bullies at school who threw objects at her, and on one occasion, pushed her head into a wall. The vicious assaults caused Emma to . suffer from panic attacks, and she would fake illness to her mother Gwen . to avoid going to school. At size 28, and after . two long years of visiting specialists who told her she was too young . to have the surgery on the NHS, Emma found a surgeon in Sheffield . willing to operate. Unhappy: Emma when she was 16 and size 28 in February 2011 (left) and July 2011 (right). She received a gastric bypass in January 2012 . Emma with her mother, Gwen. The teenager maintains her weight was down to a genetic condition passed down from her father . Consultant Surgeon Roger Ackroyd at BMI Thornbury Hospital in Sheffield said PARAPHRASE ""As long as patients are post-pubertal there is no age limit for the surgery. 'Leeds Primary Care Trust sent Emma to me because I had experience of performing this surgery on adolescents. The surgeons in Leeds are extremely experienced bariatric surgeons but I don't think they had done any adolescents before.' The gastric bypass operation was not . performed on under 18s until a recent change in guidelines and is now . only available for patients with a BMI of 40 or more. The operation comes with a risk of bleeding, internal hernia and deep vein thrombosis. Emma's stomach was divided and formed . into a small pouch. Her bowel was then divided and brought up to join . the pouch in a complete overhaul of her plumbing system. Her . new stomach meant her food intake was restricted. She said: 'When I . first woke up, I thought I was dying because of how much pain I was in - . It felt like I was being stretched.' She spent three days in hospital recovering and it took a further six months for her stomach to get back to normal. Emma, aged four and three. She says that even at primary school, she never felt accepted - and was instead 'terrorised and singled out' After two years of visiting specialists who told her she was too young to have the surgery on the NHS, Emma found a surgeon in Sheffield willing to operate . She . said: 'For months after the surgery, I didn't even notice I was losing . weight but people kept telling me I looked great and a lot healthier. 'Then . I started to get a lot of support around school. It was so weird . because the people who had bullied me were now apologising for what they . had done to me and offering to carry my bags. 'I'd never really had a group of friends before. Now, I do feel a lot more accepted.' She now has a maximum of 1,000 calories a day and sticks to well-balanced healthy meals and tiny portions. She said: 'Now I don't really think about kebabs or McDonald's because I know it will just make me poorly. I'm happy with a piece of fruit or some salad.' Emma used to feel exhausted just . leaving the house or going shopping but is happy now she can go out . every weekend without getting tired. She is still losing weight and hopes to drop another dress size. Emma now weighs 15 stone. Unlike when she was 12 years old at school (right), she now feels more accepted . After . seeing a documentary about a plus size pageant, Emma decided to enter . Miss Teen Queen UK to inspire others - and she reached the second heat. She said: 'it upset me so much when people judged me before they even knew my name. 'I hope that by participating in the beauty pageant will give other teenagers the strength to accept themselves the way they are and to always hold their heads high against bullies. 'I hope to inspire teenagers to always follow their hearts and achieve what they want to achieve and be who they want to be. 'I hope people will see the real me now, and I want them to understand that it's not easy. But above all, I hope to show the bullies that they are wrong. Now, I just feel like I can do anything.'

Intellectual: The toddler, pictured with her Mensa certificate, scored an impressive 162 on the Stanford Binet test, matching some of the world's most notable intellectuals . Alice's advanced intellect means she is one of the 'top one per cent', with an IQ eight points higher than Carol Vorderman. Her score also matches that of Professor Stephen Hawking, who has never officially revealed his IQ, but which is gauged to be between 160 and 165. Family: Alice Amos, pictured with her one-year-old sister Katie, and parents Vitaly and Tatiana Amos at their home in Guildford, Surrey . The three-year-old's score means she is only one of 18 pre-school members of the society. She already spends her spare time reading Aesop's fables and other fairytales, also enjoying singing, dancing, painting, crafts and reading. CEO of British Mensa, John Stevenage, said: 'We are delighted that Alice has joined the society. 'At Mensa we aim to provide a . positive environment for gifted children as they develop and hope they . will benefit from interaction with other bright children.' Alice was admitted to Mensa after her parents submitted a . report by British psychologist Professor Joan Freeman. She scored 162 on the Stanford Binet test - an IQ quiz that looks to measure five factors of cognitive ability. These are fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory.

With an automatic rifle slung over her shoulder and her sights trained on Taliban territory, Alex Neil looks every inch a frontline soldier. Her role as a supply driver takes her deep into the war zone. She has been engaged by the enemy and  is expected to eliminate any insurgent who poses a lethal threat to her colleagues. Given that responsibility, Alex, 25, is a soldier first and a woman second. Everything about her appearance is geared towards operational effectiveness. Her mousy hair is pulled up inside her helmet, her body armour is strapped tightly to her torso and her SA80 rifle is fully loaded, with 30 high-explosive rounds ready for firing. Overall, Alex comes across as a contented soldier who relishes her role as part of 12 Close Support  Logistic Regiment. And, as the name of her unit suggests, she is seldom far from the action. In the line of fire: Army driver Alex Neil, 25, is angry at MoD ban that thwarts her dream role in the infantry . But one aspect of military life  perturbs Alex – that, as a woman, she is banned from transferring to any regiment in the infantry or the armoured corps. The decision appears blatant discrimination by the Ministry of Defence and it is now under scrutiny following a landmark step in America allowing women to fill all military roles. ‘If a woman is good enough, why not? Our infantry should definitely be opened up to female recruits,’ says Alex, fixing me with a steely gaze. ‘We carry the same amount of kit as the guys, we’re trained the same and we do many of the same jobs. ‘If it is opened up, I would certainly be tempted. Do the boys want us to join? I’m not sure. We work very hard and we deserve the chance. I am fit – I do a lot of running – and while some men might be fitter, by no means all are. I want a challenge, that is why I joined the British Army. Before that I was working in an office for four years. ‘I knew I had to get out of there and find something more exciting.’ Alex certainly shows no signs of wilting under the dangers and hardships she endures – the dusty  conditions and the sleep deprivation – when we meet in Helmand’s Nahr-e Bughra district. This is the area that was once christened the ‘Heart of Darkness’, such was the potency of the Taliban threat. But wearing her greyish green ‘multi-cam’ fatigues, Alex effortlessly blends into her harsh surroundings. She says that spending so much time with the men in her unit has meant that their speech and behaviour has rubbed off on her. High-risk: Private Nichola Bateman, a medic, treats casualties on patrol and said: 'I would recommend the same career to any woman or man' ‘I’ve ended up speaking like them and picking up their crude jokes,’ she says, ‘because we’re all part of the same team, the guys and the girls. Our job is to bring essential supplies to locations like this. We’re here for anything from six to 36 hours at a time, delivering ammo, food, you name it. And I have been engaged  by the enemy before, so I definitely know I’m on the front line.’ Back at Camp Bastion, the British HQ in Helmand, I saw scores of female soldiers maintaining their  fitness with long runs and sprint  sessions. They also carry more equipment than they used to on patrols. Pint-sized Private Nichola Bateman, for example, routinely carries 90lb on her back on battlefield hikes. This feat is all the more remarkable as her burden equates to fully two- thirds of her bodyweight. But the bubbly, 5ft 1in medic is too modest to accept any praise for it. ‘It might sound like a lot to carry but I get trained to do that, it is my job,’ she insists. ‘I go out on patrol with the guys as their medical support, with the same dangers. It is scary but I got used to it and learned more every day. Treating my first casualty was nerve-racking but I don’t think he cared if I was a woman or a man.’ Like Alex, Nichola is eager to emphasise that her gender is a secondary issue. So too is Nichola’s age. She is only 21 but is already a fully qualified Combat Medical Technician (First Class) – after leaving school with no qualifications for a medical career. Blatant discrimination: The decision by the Ministry of Defence to ban women transferring to any regiment in the infantry or armoured corps is under scrutiny following America's landmark step allowing women to fill all military roles . Nichola, from Darlington, Co Durham, . adds: ‘First and foremost out here I am a medic, not a woman. We are all . treated the same, male and female soldiers. ‘I . know the public see it a bit differently, which is quite annoying, but . we are equals. There are so many women on the front line doing very . important jobs. I am just one of them and the guys treat me just the . same. We’re all a band of brothers. ‘Do I think they’d treat me differently if I got wounded – would they lose their concentration and focus? I don’t think so. ‘I am lucky to be surrounded by such talented guys. And I am here with them because when I left school none of the jobs available on civvy street were as exciting or challenging as the military. So I joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Agreed: Former Secretary of State for Defence, Liam Fox endorsed a review that said women's capability under fire was beyond doubt . ‘I would recommend the same career to . any woman or man. Yes, it is dangerous but I expect the danger now and . deal with it on a daily basis.’ The . MoD insists there remains no way of knowing if mixed-gender teams . function as well as all-male teams in close-combat environments – a key . argument used to justify the exclusion of women from combat units. Its most recent review of the policy, . published in 2010, said women’s capability under fire was beyond doubt . but added that the situations they currently find themselves in were . ‘not typical of the small tactical teams which are required deliberately . to close with and kill the enemy’. With military chiefs opposed  to the units being opened up to women, the then Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox, endorsed the review. His decision was legally watertight because in test cases – brought before the UK courts and the European Court of Justice – gender inequality has been permitted when it has been intended to address a legitimate aim and was proportionate in the means of achieving that aim. The only glimpse of hope for female soldiers is that, under European Union law, the UK must reassess such discriminations at least every eight years. However, not every female on the front line wants to beat the guys at their own game. Twenty-four-year-old Private Alisha Henderson, originally from Edinburgh, is only too happy to play a supporting role. Speaking in the canteen at Forward Operating Base Shawqat, in Nad-e Ali district, she said: ‘Some women in the Army say you should push for equality – but I think it is impossible for most women to be as strong as men. I feel my role is in the kitchen and I’d be more of a hindrance to the lads if I went out on the ground with them. I am happy looking after them in here. ‘That is not to say I don’t have a frontline role, because I do. While I am a chef I also do guard duties two or three times a week, watching to see if the enemy approach the base. There’s a rifle and a machine gun in the guard post and, if required to, I would engage.’ An MoD spokesman said there were no plans to review the policy. Too risky: Afghan president Hamid Karzai has criticised civilian casualties caused by night raids launched by ISAF troops . Missions against the Taliban are being cancelled because it is considered too risky to go out in the rain or at night. The move follows criticism from Afghan president Hamid Karzai over civilian casualties caused by night raids launched by ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) troops. But the latest restrictions on UK operations have led to claims that, in the lead-up to the withdrawal of British troops next year, commanders are becoming too risk averse. Former Army commander Patrick Mercer MP said: ‘Stopping operations when it is wet and dark must be deeply frustrating for professional soldiers.  In war there is always a balance. We must not become risk-averse – otherwise the enemy will take full advantage.’ The restrictions caused by bad weather apply to what military personnel call ‘deliberate operations’ – those that are planned in advance and are not regarded as time-sensitive. Military sources say the greatest concern surrounds the safety of the RAF’s fleet of Chinook and Merlin helicopters. The pilots’ ability to take off and land is compromised in bad weather. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are unable to provide further details due to operational security.’","Women are banned from transferring to any regiment in the infantry or armoured corps .

A top doctor has issued an urgent warning that heavy drinking is killing people in their 20s. Liver specialist Dr Mark Aldersley says many young adults, who are not classed as alcoholics, are developing chronic liver disease after years of drinking at home. It has resulted in alcohol related admissions to hospitals doubling between 2003 and 2009. The consultant hepatologist works at St James's Hospital and the Spire Hospital in Leeds, West Yorkshire, which has the highest rate of hazardous drinking in the country. Many young adults are developing chronic liver disease after years of drinking at home . He said: 'As people are drinking more and drinking younger, we are seeing people dying from alcoholic liver disease in their 20s and 30s. 'Twenty years ago this was rare.' His warning comes as figures from the Department of Health revealed many drinkers are grossly underestimating their alcohol consumption. People who said they were moderate . drinkers consumed up to 40 per cent more alcohol than they thought, . exceeding daily safe guidelines of three to four units for men (a pint . and a half of four per cent beer) and two to three units for women (a . 175ml glass of wine). The research also revealed 80 per cent of those that drink too much acknowledge the . health risks but think of themselves - at most - as moderate drinkers. More than 60 per cent of these ‘moderate’ drinkers have no intention of cutting down. Dr Aldersley warns people are drinking at younger ages than ever . Now Dr Aldersley warns he is seeing a worrying rise in liver disease cases in his region as a result. Just under a quarter of people in Leeds are drinking at damaging levels and new figures show less than 30 per cent of Yorkshire residents admit they drink more than the recommended amount. Dr Aldersley said: 'All the common causes of death are decreasing, while deaths from liver disease are increasing. 'People are starting to drink at a younger age and are drinking larger quantities.' GP Dr Jason Broch, Chairman of NHS Leeds North Clinical Commissioning Group, stated that within a population of 200,000 there a communities suffering hardship, which can lead to problems related to alcohol. He said: 'What we are also beginning to see is a rise in the numbers of people living in more affluent parts of the city drinking more than the recommended limits of alcohol. 'This might be a bottle of wine after work or drinking lots of alcohol at the weekends. 'Any excessive drinking can lead to liver disease, mental health problems, weight gain, hypertension, some types of cancer, and domestic violence.'","Dr Mark Aldersley says young adults are developing chronic liver disease after years of drinking at home .

A former model, who claims tarot cards saved her life by predicting a flat fire, is suing the owners of the restaurant where it began for £300,000. Sally-Anne Jones, who lived above the restaurant, said she was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and suffered burns to her face as she escaped the fire on New Year's Day 2010. Miss Jones, 40, said she only survived the fire because a celebrity tarot reader had told her to be prepared for danger two weeks before the blaze that destroyed all her possessions. The socialite, who previously partied with the likes of Katie Price and Richard Branson, said she picked the tower card, which symbolise failure, ruin or catastrophe during the reading. Sally-Anne Jones, pictured with Katie Price, is suing the restaurant owners for £300,000 following the 2010 fire. She said she only survived because she had been forewarned by a tarot reader . Miss Jones, who now lives in Chelsea, west London, is suing Fate Limited, which own the Little Bay restaurant in York Road, Battersea, for injury, loss and damage. In papers filed to the High Court, her solicitors claim 'the traumatic experience' has left her with psychiatric problems, including panic attacks. She told The Evening Standard said: 'I was moving in circles with some big names and some quite important people before this happened. 'I don't feel in any fit state to make decisions in my life. 'It feels as if I have had a personality transplant. Some part of me has gone.' Before the fire, which gutted the restaurant and eight flats above, Miss Jones said tarot reader Valentin Borissov had told her the cards would not make sense after the reading but 'will in time'. She credited the 'premonition' with helping her to keep calm as the fire spread. The papers said she almost jumped from the window of her flat but instead fled the burning building through acrid smoke down the stairs. The Little Bay restaurant, owned by Fate Ltd, in Battersea was gutted in the fire and also damaged eight flats . The claim said she suffered smoke inhalation and coughed up black spit for weeks after the blaze. She also sustained superficial burns to her face and had recurrent chest infections, blurred vision and did not physically recover for six months, according to the papers. The claim also states she has suffered nightmares, flashbacks, confusion and impaired decision making since the fire. She also blames the distress on the breakdown of her relationship with her fiance and father of her child. The papers state that the restaurant's insurers had made an admission of liability 'subject to causation being proven.' In a statement Peter Illic, who owns the restaurant, said: 'The matter is being dealt with by Fate Ltd's representatives who are in negotiations with Miss Jones's solictors in relation to her claim.'","Sally-Anne Jones picked a card that symbolises catastrophe in the reading .

With the number of people being diagnosed with HIV falling, AIDS could one day be eradicated, experts claim. A report from the United Nations said this was thanks to better access to drugs that can both treat and prevent the incurable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. This meant the aim of ending the AIDS epidemic was not 'merely visionary' but 'entirely feasible.' A researcher in Barcelona working on a project for a HIV Vaccine: Some eight million people were being treated with AIDS drugs by the end of 2011 . Some 34 million people had HIV at the end of 2011. Worldwide, the number of people newly infected with the disease, which can be transmitted via blood and by semen during sex, is falling. At 2.5 million, the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 per cent lower than in 2001. Deaths from AIDS also fell to 1.7 million in 2011, down from a peak of 2.3 million in 2005 and from 1.8 million in 2010. The report said this allowed the . 'foundation to be laid for the eventual end of AIDS.' In 2012, over 100,000 people are living with HIV in the UK. Of these, a quarter do not know they are carrying the virus. However, sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected region with almost one in every 20 adults infected, nearly 25 times the rate in Asia. There are also almost five million people with HIV in South, South-East and East Asia combined. 'Although AIDS remains one of the world's most serious health challenges, global solidarity in the AIDS response during the past decade continues to generate extraordinary health gains,' the report said. It said this was due to 'historic success' in bringing HIV programmes to scale, combined with the emergence of new combination drugs to prevent people from becoming HIV infected and from dying from AIDS. Since 1995, AIDS drug treatment - known as antiretroviral therapy - has saved 14 million life-years in poorer countries, including 9 million in sub-Saharan Africa, the report said. Athlete Hannah England promotes HIV testing. A quarter of people in the UK with HIV don't know they have it . Some eight million people were being treated with AIDS drugs by the end of 2011, a 20-fold increase since 2003. The U.N. has set a target to raise that to 15 million people by 2015. Scientific studies published in recent years have shown that getting timely treatment to those with HIV can also cut the number of people who become newly infected with the virus. UNAIDS said the sharpest declines in new HIV infections since 2001 were in the Caribbean and in sub-Saharan Africa - where new infections were down 25 per cent in a decade. Despite this, sub-Saharan Africa still accounted for 71 per cent of people newly infected in 2011, underscoring the need to boost HIV prevention efforts in the region, UNAIDS said. HIV trends are also a concern in other regions. Since 2001, the number of new HIV infections in the Middle East and North Africa was up more than 35 percent from 27,000 to 37,000, it said, and evidence suggests HIV infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia began increasing in the late 2000s after being relatively stable for several years.","At 2.5 million, the number of new infections in 2011 was 20 per cent lower than in 2001 .

The devastated father of the 23-year-old student who died after being brutally gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi has described her as 'the hero' of her family. In a country where women are routinely pushed into lives of subservience, the bright physiotherapy student - affectionately called 'bitiya', or 'little daughter' by her parents - was going to lift her family out of poverty, he said. 'Without her we are lost,' said her grief-stricken father, who spoke out after the trial of five of the alleged attackers got underway at a fast-track court in India, adding: 'I want them to hang'. Going home: The father of the 23-year-old gang rape victim, whose body was brought back to her home in New Delhi (above), has said his daughter was 'the hero of the film in our family' The girl was savagely attacked when boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema on December 16. According to police documents the bus was under the control of six men out for a joyride. In an hour-long ordeal, the girl was repeatedly raped and brutalised, and her male friend was beaten, until they were eventually dumped, naked and bleeding, onto the side of the road. She was flown to hospital in Singapore for treatment, but slipped into a coma and died on December 29. Her mother, who told her cherished daughter that if she studied hard she could escape a life of poverty, said her 'dream has ended' with her child's death. Because of a legal gag order, the victim and her family cannot be identified until the end of the trial of the alleged rapists. A dream destroyed: A man bows his head at a candlelit vigil for the 23-year-old student - affectionately called 'Bitiya', or 'little daughter' by her parents - who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi . Outrage: The brutal gang rape of the young woman has caused widespread anger across India, where crowds gathered outside the Presidential Palace in New Delhi in protest . While the family was poor, 'life was . good', the girl's father said, adding: 'She was the hero of the film in . our family. Always happy. Always laughing.' While . Indian culture has a deeply rooted preference for sons, and many girls . are expected to spend their lives caring for first their brothers and . later their husbands, the 23-year-old's parents had encouraged their . hard-working daughter's dreams of becoming a doctor. 'I . never discriminated between my sons . and daughter. I could see nothing else in this world but my children. They had to study at any cost,' her father said, who supported his . daughter when she said she wanted to study physiotherapy in a hill town . far from her New Delhi home - a longer but more affordable route to a future career in medicine. As . money was scarce, he asked his older son, who is in his late teens, to . delay enrolment at an engineering college until his sister finished her . studies. 'My own father . could not educate me very much. He had no means. I wanted different . things for my children,' said the victim's father, who is in his . mid-fifties, and works 16 hour days as a baggage handler at New Delhi airport to support his family. In his absence, his daughter kept an eye on her siblings, he said, adding: 'She was the head of the family in . the real sense. 'Now that she is gone I can't even see . tomorrow clearly. I have no idea about the future.' She worked . night shifts at a call centre to help cover her rent and fees at a college in the Himalayan foothills. Most days she slept for just a few hours in her rented room, and her . parents would call her every morning to ensure she got up for class. Anger: Protestors tried to break through a police cordon at a demonstration in New Delhi following the savage assault, which has galvanised public anger in India over sex attacks . By December she was back in New Delhi, living at home and awaiting the results of her final exams. But on December 16, after getting on a . bus home after seeing a movie at a film with a male friend, she fell . victim to a devastating attack. According to police documents the bus . was being driven by six men out for a joyride. For almost an hour the . student and her friend were driven through the city. He was beaten. She . was gang-raped, and penetrated with metal rods, causing such severe . internal injuries that doctors found parts of her intestines floating . inside her abdomen. Eventually, the two were dumped, naked and bleeding, by a busy road on the cold December night. 'Imagine how much she must have . suffered,' her brother said. 'We would fight, you know. Brothers and . sisters fight too. And if I pushed her too hard she felt pain.' 'For almost 10 days her brain was alert,"" said her mother, a slim woman wrapped in a sari, her eyes red from weeks of weeping. Police and a magistrate took . statements from her in a New Delhi hospital. She remembered the names of . her attackers. She recognized the faces in the photographs police . showed her. She broke down only once. 'She told me ""Mummy, they beat me a lot"". 'That was the only time she showed her pain,' the mother said. 'Without her we are lost': In a country where girls are routinely pushed into lives of subservience, the student's parents had encouraged their bright, hard-working daughter to shine . When infection began to ravage her body, she was flown with her family to a Singapore hospital. But she slipped into a coma at Christmas and died on December 29. Now, her relatives feel varying degrees of rage and helplessness. 'Sometimes I want to kill them myself,' her brother said. 'But I know that would be wrong.' If convicted, five of the attackers could face death sentences. A sixth, declared a juvenile, would likely serve three years in reform home if convicted. 'I want them to hang. They should not come out alive after what they did to my child,' said the father. 'This is not just about my daughter. If there is no justice in this case it will hurt the progress of girls in the whole country. Every parent will be afraid for their daughters.' The girl's mother said: 'I always told my children, if you study hard you can escape this poverty. All my life I believed that. 'Now that dream has ended. My faith has left me.' Three weeks after the 23-year-old died, her parents learned that she had passed her final exams.","Parents of victim of brutal gang-rape in India have told of their grief .

GUests at Whitehall functions enjoyed £1,000 bottles of Chateau Margaux 1982, an older vintage than the bottle pictured . MPs and peers have been drinking bottles of fine wine costing more than £1,000 each at the taxpayer’s expense. Ministers, officials and their guests got through nearly 5,000 bottles of alcohol worth more than £55,000 in the last year, the annual report into the Government’s wine cellar revealed yesterday. The official figures show that guests at Whitehall events were treated to 23 bottles of a 1982 vintage Chateau Margaux Bordeaux, which sells for up to £1,100 a bottle. Mark Simmonds, the Foreign Office Minister, said most of the costs of the government wine cellar had been offset by selling 180 bottles worth £44,000, in a new ‘self-funding’ policy. But spending watchdogs warned that consumption of expensive wine and spirits will anger hard-pressed taxpayers during a recession. In total, 4,651 bottles were taken and £48,955 was spent replenishing supplies. The government continued its splurge on hospitality in the face of austerity cutbacks, popping the corks of 138 bottles of champagne at up to 230 parties. A 1906 bottle of Hine Grande Fine brandy worth on average £1,472 was also consumed. The alcohol would have been bought at much lower prices and cellared for decades. Guests also opened three bottles of Quinta Do Noval port 1931 which is such a rare vintage that no estimates for its worth is readily available. The nearest available vintage, 1934, sells for just over £1,900 a bottle. French wines were the most popular although in a nod to patriotism, 36 per cent of the wines were from English vineyards. Officials were quick to replenish the stocks, spending £48,955 on topping up supplies. The popped the corks of 138 bottles of champagne at up to 230 parties . Taxpayers paid for 2,400 bottles of . the English wine, Chapel Down Bacchus 2010 as well as 575 bottles of red . Burgundy and 600 bottles of the Chilean red, Concha y Toro Merlot. Civil . servants in charge of the shopping list also splurged on 53 bottles of . champagne and 360 bottles of English sparkling wine. In the year 2011-12, some 78 bottles of gin were consumed compared to just eight bottles of vodka. While it has never gone out of fashion in English tennis clubs, gin has recently made a comeback as a 'retro' drink across Europe. An additional 82 bottles of gin and 11 of vodka were bought to ensure that no government function would run dry of white spirits. French wine was the most heavily used, followed by English. Party-goers at official functions also drank four times the amount of New Zealand wine to Australian. The government wine cellar is controlled by the Foreign Office, which defended the serving of expensive drinks at official receptions . But the Taxpayers' Alliance (TPA) said the government should consider selling more of the valuable bottles during a time of austerity. Robert Oxley, the campaigns manager for the TPA said: 'It smacks of hypocrisy for the political elite to be quaffing fine wines at a time when ordinary families struggle to make ends meet. He added: 'Of course there will be a cost associated with hospitality but a time when savings have to be made, it would not be out of place to open more modestly priced bottles of wine. Government departments sitting on such valuable assets should look at selling them rather than drinking the potential profits.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Whether it is national celebrations, state visits, or receiving guests of government, the UK prides itself on giving a warm welcome through its business hospitality. The Government Wine Cellar supports this work in a cost effective way. 'The Government Wine Cellar has been in operation for over 90 years enabling the Government to buy in bulk and also purchase and store young wines for use when are fully mature. These help fund the cellar through sales of wine which has matured over time to a greater value. 'A review ordered by the Foreign Secretary in 2010 found that the Government Wine Cellar was the most cost effective way of catering for Government events, and the cellar is used exclusively for that purpose.' The costs of the Government Wine Cellar have been a closely guarded secret in previous years. The last Labour government spent £80,662 topping up stocks in its final year of office, 2009-2010. William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, considered abolishing the cellar but decided to keep it because it was cheaper to buy wine in bulk for the future rather than acquiring it at short notice.","Whitehall functions enjoy 5,000 bottles of wine and spirits in the last year .

A 1794 silver dollar, which many experts believe was the first such coin struck by the U.S. Mint, sold for a record $10 million at auction on Thursday. The Flowing Hair Silver Dollar more than doubled the previous $4.1 million record for a coin set in 1999, auction house Stack's Bowers Galleries said. Legend Numismatics, a rare-coin firm based in New Jersey, bought the coin, which was the highlight of the evening sale in New York that fetched a total of $17.2 million. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ka'Ching! A rare 1794 silver dollar has set the record for the most pricey transaction at auction concerning a coin - $10 million . 'We felt in our heart that this would be the very first coin to exceed the $10 million barrier in auction and were in fact prepared to bid much high in order to acquire this unique piece of history,' the company said in a statement, adding it had no plans to sell the coin in the near future. David Bowers, chairman emeritus of Stack's Bowers Galleries, said the coin has unique features that make it particularly valuable. 'It is the first American metal dollar struck and the finest known. You have these combinations coming together. No museum has an equal piece,' he told Reuters. Seller: Martin Logies bought the coin three years ago as part of the 'Cardinal Collection' The coin was part of the Cardinal Collection, amassed by the collector Martin Logies. Bowers described the collection as the 'Old Masters' of coins struck during the earliest years of the U.S. Mint. 'I think it is extraordinary and I am very pleased that the first silver dollar is the first to top the $10 million threshold,' said Logies, who purchased the coin three years ago. The $10 million price includes the buyer's commission. Like the buoyant art market, which is expecting another good year in 2013, Bowers said coins are a good investment, have a worldwide market and have risen steadily in value. 'We're continually surprised by surprises,' he said, adding there are several million coin collectors around the globe. 'They want to collect coins for appreciation, art, rarity and beauty.' The record-setting coin shows a profile of Miss Liberty facing right surrounded by stars representing each state in the union. The design was only used in 1794 and briefly the following year. Another top seller in the sale of 94 lots was the 1792 Half Disme, which dates back to David Rittenhouse, the first director of the U.S. Mint.

Two major insurance companies have been fined £2.17million for tampering with customer complaints files before passing them to the City watchdog. Churchill and Direct Line, owned by state-backed Royal Bank of Scotland, were found guilty by the Financial Services Authority of amending old complaints files and forging signatures to ensure they passed muster. Direct line - perhaps not a good deal better after all! The case will infuriate taxpayers, who will have to foot the bill, and heaps embarrassment on RBS, which was fined £2.8million a year ago for ‘multiple failings’ in complaints handling. The fine relates to 50 closed customer complaints files sent in April 2010 to the FSA during its investigation into how well the firms were handling complaints about general insurance. Of these, 27 had been altered before they were sent to the FSA, and seven internal documents were found to contain signatures that had been forged by a member of staff. Some 28 documents in the 27 bad files had either been altered or created by the firms’ staff. Tracey McDermott, the FSA’s acting director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘This is a serious breach. The firms’ attempts to ensure complete files were provided to the FSA backfired.’ Insurance firm Churchill has been fined for fudging complaint files, including signature forgery, the City watchdog said today . In . February 2010, the FSA informed Direct Line and Churchill that it would . undertake a review of files to assess the effectiveness of the companies' complaint-handling process. In . preparation for this review, the firms asked a major accountancy firm to do a . sample or practice review and discovered that 28 per cent of the 110 files submitted . failed to meet complaint-handling requirements. Before the . two companies sent the 50 files off for the official review with the FSA, they . conducted a conference call with staff, in which they warned that any similar . failure could lead to enforcement action for the firm. Staff were . also told that, if they were found not to be operating to the required . standard, they could face disciplinary investigation. Following . the warnings to staff, the firms sent off the files, which were later . discovered to contain the altered paperwork. Paul . Geddes, chief executive of RBS Insurance, said: 'We very much regret the . findings of the FSA investigation. 'Although . no customers were disadvantaged, we are very disappointed that we did not meet . the standards we expect of ourselves and which the FSA expects of us.' The two . firms agreed to settle the case at an early stage and qualified for a 30 per cent . discount - without the reduction, the FSA would have fined them £3.1million. Argos forced by FSA to shut down price comparison website . Argos was forced to shut its price comparison site yesterday - just four months after it relaunched. The . tool, which was powered by Beatthatquote.com, compared credit cards and . insurance deals but fell foul of new guidance issued by the Financial . Services Authority. A statement on the site simply reads: ‘We're sorry, Argos compare is no longer available'. Gone: Argos has taken down its comparison service because it didn't sit comfortably with new guidance from the FSA, a spokesman said . An Argos spokesman said the site is . ‘under review'. A relaunch will remain firmly in the pipeline until the . company has rewired its operation. ArgosCompare.co.uk . sprang up again in October to much fanfare. It boasted two best buy . credit cards from Barclaycard and offered a £20 Argos gift card as a . sweetener to anyone spending £100 or more on the cards in the first 60 . days.

It had an . estimated 71,000 unique visitors a month, according to Google . analytics, compared to some seven million at Moneysupermarket.com. ArgosCompare's tough battle for market share, though, was not behind a decision to take a short sabbatical from the web. In a statement, Argos said: ‘Following . revised guidance by the Financial Services Authority regarding the . regulation of UK price comparison websites, Argos has placed . ArgosCompare.co.uk under review and the site is currently unavailable to . new business. We are working to resolve the situation as soon as . possible. 'Customers are . still able to claim their Argos gift cards from previous transactions . via the website and other Argos financial services, including insurance, . are unaffected and are available at www.argos.co.uk.' The FSA published new guidelines for insurance comparison sites in October, citing concern over ‘the possibility that consumers could . be misled about the services and information they receive'. This could happen if it is unclear whether an insurance quote is tailored to an individual or is just an ‘illustrative' figure. The . FSA said: ‘We expect firms to take reasonable steps to ensure consumers . buy insurance policies that they will be eligible to claim on.' The . guidelines also raised the issue of price comparison services . 'white-labelled' to a third party.

"By . Beth Stebner and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:25 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 29 January 2013 . The top executives at several organizations that received taxpayer-funded bailouts also received increasingly generous salaries and bonuses, a watchdog group alleged Monday. The internal watchdog group, which keeps check on taxpayer bailouts, further noted that the U.S. Treasury Department failed to curb this spending for the second year running. The CEOs of three companies that received major bailouts – AIG, General Motors, and Ally Financial – each received ‘excessive’ pay for the last two years and fought Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to ensure they would receive full pay. Payout: Top executives at firms that received taxpayer bailouts still receive government-approved 'excessive' compensation, SIGTARP said Monday, with dozens receiving more than the pre-approved $500,000 salary . Pay day: Treasury-approved pay packages of $5million or more went to the CEOs of Ally, AIG, and GM, the watchdog firm claims . The report, which was published by the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Trouble Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), shows that 68 out of 69 executives at the three companies received an annual compensation of at least $1million, oftentimes much more. And the Treasury signed off on it, the report claims. The report also states that the top 16 executives within AIG, GM, and Ally received a combined pay of over $100 million. One of Congress’ goals when it passed the TARP program was to curb ‘excessive’ executive pay among top managers. But the report claims that CEOs still got heavily compensated, with the Treasury's so-called 'pay czar' approving multi-million dollar pay packages. The Treasury's pay czar, or 'special master’ Patricia Geoghegan, was tasked with limiting 'excessive' pay at companies the government bailed out using taxpayer money during the financial crisis. But the Office of the Special Master did not follow the rules it had set for compensation, instead letting companies define pay themselves, according to a report by the inspector general for the government's bailout program. Heads: Left, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson, and right, Robert Benmosche, chief executive officer of American International Group Inc. Too big to fail? Tim Geithner is the U.S. Treasury Secretary . In 2012, the pay czar acceded to company requests in approving multi-million dollar pay packages and pay hikes for top executives at General Motors, AIG and Ally Financial. The pay czar approved all 18 pay raises requested by the companies, for a total of $6.2 million, and approved pay packages of at least $1 million for 68 of the 69 employees at the companies it was overseeing, the report found. 'While taxpayers struggle to overcome the recent financial crisis and look to the U.S. government to put a lid on compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the U.S. financial system, the U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to allow excessive executive pay,' the report said. Ms Geoghegan said in the report that it was normal for the top executives at these firms to receive more than the suggested $500,000. SIGTARP fired back: ‘That might be true if companies had not been bailed out and were not still significantly owned by taxpayers.’ Special Inspector General Christy Romero said it was not surprising companies asked for large pay packages and higher pay. 'But what we saw in 2012 that is somewhat different than prior years is that this time the companies pushed back on pay, but they seemed to have met no resistance,' she said in an interview with Reuters. Protesting: Pat Corsi, an Occupy Dallas member, holds a placard asking GM to stop using U.S. Tax payers bailout money to exploit workers . Romero is tasked with overseeing the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, which pumped $68 billion into AIG, $50 billion in GM and $17 billion in Ally Financial, among others, to save them from collapse during the 2007-2009 crisis. In December, the Treasury sold the last of its common stock in AIG and said it plans to sell its remaining shares in automaker GM in the next year or so, leaving Ally as the last major company that still owes the government under TARP. The acting pay czar, Patricia . Geoghegan, said her office achieved its mission, cutting average cash . compensation for the top 25 executives at bailed-out companies from what . they were getting prior to the TARP bailout. In 2011 and 2012, the office also froze pay for the chief executives of General Motors, AIG, and Ally Financial. 'While taxpayers struggle to overcome the . recent financial crisis and look to the U.S. government to put a lid on . compensation for executives of firms whose missteps nearly crippled the . U.S. financial system, the U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to . allow excessive executive pay.' But last year, Romero's office found pressure from financial institutions undermined efforts to limit executive pay at bailed-out companies, especially as some Treasury officials were more concerned with getting TARP funds back than in limiting pay. Romero said the situation has worsened since then. Contrary to recommendations the inspector general made last year, the pay czar's office has not developed procedures for how to decide compensation or when to determine high salaries are warranted. 'Without developing some criteria ... Treasury put itself in a position of essentially letting the companies drive what pay Treasury was approving,' she said. Under the rules governing pay for TARP recipients, cash salaries are supposed to rarely exceed $500,000. But in 2012, 70 percent of the top executives at TARP recipients overseen by the government had cash salaries of $500,000 or more, a number that has quadrupled since 2009, the report said. Ninety-four percent got cash compensation of $450,000 or more. Angry: People protest against corporate bailouts in front of AIG office during the nationwide 'Take Back the Economy' protest in Los Angeles in 2009 . Romero said in one situation, the Treasury approved a pay raise of $50,000 for one GM employee because the company wanted to 'do a little extra for him. 'This shows the complete lack of appreciation that GM has for the fact that they're owned by taxpayers, and that Americans are in tight budgets and don't have any extra (funds),' she said. In another case, the pay czar approved a $200,000 pay raise for an employee of Residential Capital LLC, the bankrupt mortgage lending unit of Ally, despite knowing the unit was about to go bankrupt.Romero said the government's pay curbs were unlikely to have a lasting impact. The report found it likely AIG will return to its 'past practices' in setting high executive compensation now that it has repaid the government's TARP funds. 'The responsibility shifts to the Federal Reserve Board to ensure that AIG does not encourage excessive risk taking through compensation,' the report said.","Watchdog report released Monday claims that top executives at AIG, GM, and Ally Financial each received 'excessive' pay .

Off the hook: A lawyer overseeing the federal investigation into Lance Armstrong says there are no plans to charge him over the doping scandal . Lance Armstrong will not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses during three of his seven Tour de France victories. It's the latest outrage since the shamed cyclist admitted using performance-enhancing drugs and doping in his career. Armstrong's lawyer told USA Today that his client has no intention of repaying Texas-based SCA Promotions, which paid and insured the $12million . he was awarded in bonuses during three of his seven Tour de France wins. Those victories came in 2002, 2003 and 2004 - all races in which Armstrong admitted that he cheated to win. The dispute may now end up in court, as the company says it will file a lawsuit to get the funds back. But the Armstrong camp insists that the money is his, and it's non-refundable. Mr Herman told USA Today: 'My only point is no athlete ever, to my understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation. Not [New Orleans Saints coach] Sean Payton or anybody else. Payton was banned from the NFL for the entire 2012-2013 football season for his role in pushing a 'crush-for-cash' bounty program on the team. Herman added: 'They were suspended, but nobody said you've got to give your paycheck back.' Should Lance Armstrong be charged for perjury after admitting to Oprah that he had doped? Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Armstrong is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators. The ex-Tour de France champion is potentially facing charges of obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation relating to the systematic cover-up of his drug-taking when he was competing. The revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, Andre Birotte, who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of Armstrong, 41, only to suddenly drop it this time last year. A little help: Armstrong celebrates after winning the 15th stage of the Tour de France in 2003 - one of the years that he admitted to cheating . Sources told ABC News that agents had recommended an indictment for the drug-cheat on charges of drug distribution, fraud and conspiracy and were stunned when the case was suddenly dropped. Last night, a high level source told the network: 'Birotte does not speak for the federal government as a whole.' According to the same source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, 'Agents are actively investigating Armstrong for obstruction, witness tampering and intimidation.' An email to an attorney for Armstrong was not immediately returned to ABC News. The statement made earlier today by André Birotte, the U.S. attorney based in Los Angeles, follows Armstrong's confession in a blockbuster interview last month. 'We made a decision on that case a . little over a year ago. Obviously, we've been well aware of the . statements that have been made by Mr Armstrong in other media reports. Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . 'That does not change my view at this time,' Birotte said at a news conference in Washington to announce an unrelated lawsuit against Standard & Poor's. The government will continue to look at the case, Birotte added, but Armstrong's admission 'hasn't changed our view as I stand here today.' In February 2012, Birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by Armstrong. Birotte's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission. On Tuesday, Armstrong tied with former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o in atop a Forbes poll ranking America's most disliked athletes. Speculation about charges began anew . after Armstrong reversed his past doping denials in an interview with . Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey. Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . He told Winfrey he used performance-enhancing drugs and doping in cycling tournaments. Legal experts said Armstrong exposed himself to possible charges of perjury or obstruction of justice. Separately, Armstrong faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, accusing Armstrong of fraud. The U.S. Justice Department has not . said whether it intends to join the suit, and Birotte did not address . the suit at the news conference. Armstrong has been banned from cycling for life and stripped of race wins, including seven Tour de France victories. Herman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Opponent: Armstrong has a continuing feud with USADA CEO Travis Tygart, who spearheaded a probe into doping on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams . Armstrong's lawyers said last month that he will talk more about drug use in the sport, just likely not to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that led the effort to strip him of his Tour de France titles. The question is: When? In a testy exchange of letters and statements revealing the gulf between the two sides, USADA urged Armstrong to testify under oath to help 'clean up cycling.' Armstrong's attorneys responded that the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more good - namely to cycling's governing body and World Anti-Doping Agency officials. USADA's response to that: 'The time for excuses is over.' The letters underscore the continuing . feud between Armstrong and USADA CEO Travis Tygart, the man who . spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on . Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport. In the Oprah interview, Armstrong said he owed a long list of . apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he . can compete again. His most realistic avenue toward that . might be telling USADA everything he knows in a series of interviews . the agency wants started no later than today. That seems unlikely.

The source added that Schindler told Hirtzel that if he couldn’t have her, he was going to take his own life and drove off. Knowing that something needed to be done, Hirtzel then reported the affair to her commanding officer, the sources said. Sources further added that Hirtzel was cleared of any charges, despite the alleged relationship with Schindler, who fatally shot himself on the side of the Long Island Expressway on February 13, 2012. Schindler’s widow, Gina Schindler, filed a lawsuit against the NYPD, the city, and Hirtzel, claiming that her late husband was forced into having the affair with his superior officer or face the prospect of a bad schedule. The lawsuit, which was filed earlier this week, alleged that the reason the veteran police officer committed suicide was because he was forced to have sex with a female boss in order not to be punished by workload and scheduling. Officer Matthew Schindler, 39, shot himself on February 13 last year after pulling onto the side of the Long Island Expressway, New York on his way home from work. His widow Gina Schindler has claimed that her husband was driven to his death because his boss Sgt Christine Hirtzel forced him into an affair from which ‘he could not escape’. According to the suit, filed at Queens Supreme Court, the highway officer was 'made to understand that he would suffer tangible detriment in his job, job assignments, work conditions and future prospects if he did not submit to the sexual advances and demands...', according to the New York Post. The widow, who was left to care for the couple's five-year-old twin girls after her husband died, is suing the NYPD and the Sgt Hirtzel. She is seeking unspecified damages. Mrs Schindler alleges that her husband had an affair with the woman from March 2011 until the time of his death. Officer Schindler reportedly tried to put an end to the relationship on February 13, saying he would kill himself over the guilt.

Cooperating: Lance Armstrong may testify in hopes of ending his lifetime ban from cycling . Lance Armstrong may spill all the details of his cheating career to anti-doping officials in a possible bid to compete on his bike again. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says that Armstrong has asked for an extension on a deadline to testify about his cheating in the sport as he won seven Tour de France titles. The deadline was imposed by USADA in an effort to have Armstrong confess about how he was able to keep doping and his use of performance-enhancing drugs a secret for so long. In a statement on the agency's website, the agency CEO Travis Tygart said: 'We have been in communication with Mr. Armstrong and his representatives and we understand that he does want to be part of the solution and assist in the effort to clean up the sport of cycling. 'We have agreed to his request for an additional two weeks to work on details to hopefully allow for this to happen.' The move to testify is a complete turnaround for the cyclist, who has previously said he would only talk to World Anti-Doping Agency officials in favor of USADA. In a testy exchange of letters and . statements revealing the rift between the two sides, USADA urged . Armstrong to testify under oath. Armstrong's attorneys responded that . the cyclist would rather take his information where it could do more . good - namely to cycling's governing body and World Anti-Doping Agency . officials. USADA's response to that: 'The time for excuses is over.' A little help: Armstrong celebrates after winning the 15th stage of the Tour de France in 2003 - one of the years that he admitted to cheating . Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs, but he denied that he used them for his 2009 comeback . The letters underscore the continuing . feud between Armstrong and Tygart, the man who . spearheaded the investigation that uncovered a complex doping scheme on . Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories last year and he has been banned for life from the sport. Off the hook? SCA Promotions says it will sue Armstrong over the $12million in bonuses he refused to return . In the Oprah interview, Armstrong said he owed a long list of . apologies and that he would like to see his lifetime ban reduced so he . can compete again. Neither Armstrong nor his attorney responded to emails from ABC News seeking comment. At . the same time, Armstrong is the target of a federal investigation for . lying to investigators and bullying anyone who knew the truth about his . doping to stay silent. The ex-Tour de France champion is . potentially facing charges of obstruction, witness tampering and . intimidation relating to the systematic cover-up of his drug-taking when . he was competing. It's the latest in an ongoing conflict for Armstrong, who admitted to cheating at the sport during a blockbuster interview last month with Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey. Yesterday, it was revealed that the company that awarded Lance Armstrong $12million in bonuses for three of his seven Tour de France victories will now fight him in court to get it back. Armstrong had said earlier this week that he would not be paying back the the millions he collected in bonuses from Texas-based SCA Promotions during three of his seven Tour de France victories. Those victories came in 2002, 2003 and 2004 - all races in which Armstrong admitted that he cheated to win. Shamed: Armstrong told Oprah that he never tried to stop or change the culture of drug use in the sport . Despite the Oprah confession, the Armstrong camp insisted that the bonus funds are his, and they're non-refundable. Armstrong's lawyer Tim Herman told USA Today that his client has no intention of repaying Texas-based SCA Promotions, which paid and insured the $12million. Opponent: Armstrong had a continuing feud with USADA CEO Travis Tygart, who spearheaded a probe into doping on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service teams . Mr . Herman told USA Today: 'My only point is no athlete ever, to my . understanding, has ever gone back and paid back his compensation. Not . [New Orleans Saints coach] Sean Payton or anybody else. Payton was banned from the NFL for . the entire 2012-2013 football season for his role in pushing a . 'crush-for-cash' bounty program on the team. Herman added: 'They were suspended, but nobody said you've got to give your paycheck back.' Separately, Armstrong faces a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed by former teammate Floyd Landis, accusing Armstrong of fraud. Meanwhile, it has been revealed that Armstrong is the subject of an active criminal investigation by federal investigators. The revelation runs contrary to statements made today by the U.S. Attorney for Southern California, Andre Birotte, who spent nearly two years on a criminal investigation of Armstrong, 41, only to suddenly drop it this time last year. In February 2012, Birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by Armstrong. Birotte's comments come amid a firestorm of backlash against the disgraced cyclist with his actions since his doping admission. On Tuesday, Armstrong tied with former Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o in atop a Forbes poll ranking America's most disliked athletes.","Armstrong asks for extension testify before U.S. Anti-Doping Agency .

The devastated father of the 23-year-old student who died after being brutally gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi has described her as 'the hero' of her family. The bright physiotherapy student - affectionately called 'bitiya', or 'little daughter' by her parents - was going to lift her family out of poverty, he said. 'Without her we are lost,' said her grief-stricken father, who spoke out after the trial of five of the alleged attackers got underway at a fast-track court in India, adding: 'I want them to hang'. Going home: The father of the 23-year-old gang rape victim, whose body was brought back to her home in New Delhi (above), has said his daughter was 'the hero of the film in our family' The girl was savagely attacked when boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema on December 16. According to police documents the bus was under the control of six men out for a joyride. In an hour-long ordeal, the girl was repeatedly raped and brutalised, and her male friend was beaten, until they were eventually dumped, naked and bleeding, onto the side of the road. She was flown to hospital in Singapore for treatment, but slipped into a coma and died on December 29. Her mother, who told her cherished daughter that if she studied hard she could escape a life of poverty, said her 'dream has ended' with her child's death. Because of a legal gag order, the victim and her family cannot be identified until the end of the trial of the alleged rapists. A dream destroyed: A man bows his head at a candlelit vigil for the 23-year-old student - affectionately called 'Bitiya', or 'little daughter' by her parents - who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi . Outrage: The brutal gang rape of the young woman has caused widespread anger across India, where crowds gathered outside the Presidential Palace in New Delhi in protest . While the family was poor, 'life was . good', the girl's father said, adding: 'She was the hero of the film in . our family. Always happy. Always laughing.' While . Indian culture has a deeply rooted preference for sons, and many girls . are expected to spend their lives caring for first their brothers and . later their husbands, the 23-year-old's parents had encouraged their . hard-working daughter's dreams of becoming a doctor. 'I . never discriminated between my sons . and daughter. I could see nothing else in this world but my children. They had to study at any cost,' her father said, who supported his . daughter when she said she wanted to study physiotherapy in a hill town . far from her New Delhi home - a longer but more affordable route to a future career in medicine. As . money was scarce, he asked his older son, who is in his late teens, to . delay enrolment at an engineering college until his sister finished her . studies. 'My own father . could not educate me very much. He had no means. I wanted different . things for my children,' said the victim's father, who is in his . mid-fifties, and works 16 hour days as a baggage handler at New Delhi airport to support his family. In his absence, his daughter kept an eye on her siblings, he said, adding: 'She was the head of the family in . the real sense. 'Now that she is gone I can't even see . tomorrow clearly. I have no idea about the future.' She worked . night shifts at a call centre to help cover her rent and fees at a college in the Himalayan foothills. Most days she slept for just a few hours in her rented room, and her . parents would call her every morning to ensure she got up for class. Anger: Protestors tried to break through a police cordon at a demonstration in New Delhi following the savage assault, which has galvanised public anger in India over sex attacks . By December she was back in New Delhi, living at home and awaiting the results of her final exams. But on December 16, after getting on a . bus home after seeing a movie at a film with a male friend, she fell . victim to a devastating attack. According to police documents the bus . was being driven by six men out for a joyride. For almost an hour the . student and her friend were driven through the city. He was beaten. She . was gang-raped, and penetrated with metal rods, causing such severe . internal injuries that doctors found parts of her intestines floating . inside her abdomen. Eventually, the two were dumped, naked and bleeding, by a busy road on the cold December night. 'Imagine how much she must have . suffered,' her brother said. 'We would fight, you know. Brothers and . sisters fight too. And if I pushed her too hard she felt pain.' 'For almost 10 days her brain was alert,"" said her mother, a slim woman wrapped in a sari, her eyes red from weeks of weeping. Police and a magistrate took . statements from her in a New Delhi hospital. She remembered the names of . her attackers. She recognized the faces in the photographs police . showed her. She broke down only once. 'She told me ""Mummy, they beat me a lot"". 'That was the only time she showed her pain,' the mother said. 'Without her we are lost': In a country where girls are routinely pushed into lives of subservience, the student's parents had encouraged their bright, hard-working daughter to shine . When infection began to ravage her body, she was flown with her family to a Singapore hospital. But she slipped into a coma at Christmas and died on December 29. Now, her relatives feel varying degrees of rage and helplessness. 'Sometimes I want to kill them myself,' her brother said. 'But I know that would be wrong.' If convicted, five of the attackers could face death sentences. A sixth, declared a juvenile, would likely serve three years in reform home if convicted. 'I want them to hang. They should not come out alive after what they did to my child,' said the father. 'This is not just about my daughter. If there is no justice in this case it will hurt the progress of girls in the whole country. Every parent will be afraid for their daughters.' The girl's mother said: 'I always told my children, if you study hard you can escape this poverty. All my life I believed that. 'Now that dream has ended. My faith has left me.' Three weeks after the 23-year-old died, her parents learned that she had passed her final exams.","Parents of victim of brutal gang-rape in India have told of their grief .

A trust-fund playboy, who is accused of strangling his girlfriend at one of New York's most exclusive members' clubs, allegedly told her during an argument that using escorts was 'not a big deal'. The startling admission was revealed today after a judge ruled that Nicholas Brooks' voluntary statements to police following Sylvie Cachay's death can be used as evidence at his murder trial. Miss Cachay, a 33-year-old successful swimsuit designer, was found half-clothed and face up in a bathtub at the Soho House hotel at 3am on December 9, 2011. Brutally murdered: Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found strangled in a bathtub at the Soho Hotel in Manhattan on December 9, 2011 . In the hours after Miss Cachay was found, Brooks gave several statements to the NYPD. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner ruled on Monday that the 27-year-old's remarks would be admissible in court. A preliminary date for Brooks' murder trial was set for June 4, according to the New York Post. Party lifestyle: Brooks is on trial for the murder of his girlfriend at the trendy hotel in the Meatpacking District in 2011 . Brooks' remarks are likely to cause major problems for his defense lawyers including the accused's statement that when he left his girlfriend at the hotel to go out drinking, she was sleeping in the bed and not taking a bath. Several minutes after the then 25-year-old was seen leaving on surveillance cameras at the hotel in the trendy Meatpacking District, guests began to complain about water leaking through the ceiling from the couple's room upstairs. It is unclear whether other statements he made after he was arrested - including asking an officer 'How much could I get for something like this' - will be allowed at trial. Miss Cachay's mother Sylvia, who was at court with her father Antonio, told the Post today: 'We realize we are going to see justice, and I am sure New York justice is going to be in our favor.' Miss Cachay, whose designs have been worn by a string of celebrities, was known to have a volatile relationship with Brooks, who was 25 at the time. According to investigators, she had red marks around her neck and a bite mark on her hand when her body was found. It was later discovered that on the eve of her tragic death, Miss . Cachay sent a message to Brooks with 'F*** . you' written in the title field. It was revealed by prosecutors last month as they applied to a judge to include it as evidence in the long-awaited trial. Beauty: Sylvie Cachay had a successful career as a designer and led a glamorous life in Manhattan when she was brutally killed . The expletive-laden email accused Brooks of stealing from her credit card and threatening to go to police, it has been claimed. Brooks is the son of late Oscar-winning composer and alleged sex attacker Joseph Brooks. 'The subject line was ""F*** you,"" and it said she was going to the police, and that’s relevant,' prosecutor Jordan Arnold told a court as he argued that the District Attorney did nothing wrong in plundering Brooks' email account for clues. Justice . Wittner agreed that it would be in the public interest to . disclose the contents of his emails to a jury. Awaiting trial: Nicholas Brooks, 25, the son of Oscar-winning composer Joseph Brooks, stands trial accused of murder . Celebrated designer: Miss Cahchay's designs have been worn by a string of celebrities . But Brooks' defence lawyer Jeffrey Hoffman told the New York Post that the . email is inadmissible, adding: 'This is nothing more than a given . feeling at a given moment that was different two moments before and two . moments after.' On the night of her death, Miss Cachay and Brooks checked . into the hotel after a fire in her apartment. Police allege Brooks left . her there to die while he went to party. Ms Cachay lived in an apartment in Manhattan's West Village and had a membership at the Soho House, an elite club and hotel that has hosted such stars as Nicole Kidman, Victoria Beckham and Naomi Watts. She made swimsuits for Victoria’s Secret, Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs and Syla, her own label. Brooks’ father, Joseph, who won an Oscar for the 1977 hit 'You Light Up My Life,' committed suicide in 2011 amid multiple charges of sexual assault. Grim find: Sylvie Cachay's body is removed from Soho House hotel after its discovery in December 2011 . Plush: Soho House Hotel is one of New York's most exclusive members' clubs known for its lavish bedrooms (publicity picture) He was charged with 91 counts of rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, and other crimes. However, he committed suicide before his case or his son's could go to trial. The elder Brooks left no money to his children and was nearly broke when he died, the New York Post reported. It's unclear whether the proceeds of his biggest hit, which still rakes in royalties, will go to his son. Brooks is facing 25 years to life in prison, if convicted.","Sylvie Cachay, 33, found face up in bath at the Soho House hotel in 2011 .

Mother-of-two Evelin Matamoros, 36, was leaving a Chinese restaurant in Miami, Florida on January 24 when she was approached by 20-year-old Kamiah Lanier. Lanier allegedly demanded she give him her purse but even though she did, he shot her. The bullet bounced off her cheek bone, travelled through her mouth, fractured her lower jaw bone, and then lodged itself in her neck, where it can be seen in the x-rays. Survivor: An X-ray shows a bullet lodged in Evelin Matamoros' neck after she was shot in the face . 'She had a gunshot wound on the left . side of her face,' Dr. Gabriel Ruiz, clinical instructor of surgery at . Ryder Trauma Center at the Jackson Memorial Hospital, told Local News 10. 'There were many organs that could . have been damaged with that trajectory. It's a very serious injury . because of the location and the type of trauma she received.' But Matamoros miraculously pulled through and in an astonishing show of bravery, helped detectives identify Lanier from a line up. On Wednesday she will undergo reconstructive surgery in which Dr. Michael Peleg, an oral and . maxillofacial surgeon, will replace the area of her shattered jaw . with a custom-fitted titanium plate.

'We think she'll be able to chew, (and) be able to open her mouth without any restriction,' he said. 'I'm very . optimistic and I believe we can provide a very good result.' Doctors say Matamoros will probably need . three or four surgeries, and that her recovery could take as long as a year. Matamoros was shot after Lanier approached her as she left the Cafe Ruyi restaurant last week in what police called a 'senseless crime'. 'He shoots her deliberately and in broad . daylight after she gives him her purse,' Officer Kenia Reyes with . the Miami Police Department said. Fighter: Matamoros will need three or four reconstructive surgeries but should make a full recovery . Battle: The mother of two will have a titanium plate fitted to replace the area of her shattered jaw . An off-duty police officer saw Lanier . run into a parking lot after the shooting before watching a grey Dodge . Charger speed away, investigators said. The . officer reported the car's tag number and a Miami-Dade officer later . saw the vehicle and stopped it, finding Lanier's sister in the car. The . woman told officials she had driven her brother to the scene that day . and gave officers a photograph of Lanier. Matamoro was then able to . identify him as the shooter. Police arrested Lanier at his Florida City home, where they also found Matomoro's purse. Arrest: Kamiah Lanier, 20, allegedly shot Matamoros, stole her bag and fled the scene in a car . Caught: An off-duty police officer saw the car and noted down the plates, and Lanier was later arrested . He has been charged with one count of . armed robbery with a firearm, one count of attempted murder, one count . of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and one count of use of . firearm during the commission of a felony.

Promoting: Mrs Storm made an appearance on The View to help publicize Burn Awareness Week . The 50-year-old journalist proudly lifted the extensions and showed how tiny patches of real hair are beginning to grow. ‘It’s starting to come back!’ she said happily. The accident occurred when she had been preparing dinner for her daughters on the outdoor grill. Because it was a windy night, the flame blew out and she did not wait for the recommended 15 minutes until she returned to reignite the grill, causing the explosion. She previously said: 'There was an explosion which blew the doors of the grill off. A wall of fire came at me, it was like a movie. I looked down and I saw that I was on fire.' During this morning’s segment, she showed more pictures of her wounds while she was in the hospital as a part of Burn Awareness Week. Damage: Storm shared pictures of herself in the hospital following the December 11 accident . She told the female co-hosts that in the moments when she was on fire at her home in Connecticut, one of her teenage daughters called 911 on her cell phone and was told by the operator to call back on a landline. Storm laughed as she told the hosts that she thought to herself: ‘Does she even know how to use the home phone?’ Growing back: The shorter hair underneath her fake bangs is her natural hair beginning to grow back .

Now, the professional organizer has managed to save up enough from living at her $700-month space to afford an apartment more than double the size, and recently gave a tour of the space. Scroll down for video . Massive upgrade: Ms Cohen has now moved into a 500-square ft apartment just two blocks away . Snug: Felice Cohen, a professional organiser, lived in the 90-square ft apartment in New York for five years . ‘There are so many people who are so . angry with the small spaces. I think it doesn’t matter what size space . you have. It’s about just finding, making any space your home,' she told . Faircompanies.com. The artist and writer said that it was . never a sacrifice living in her 12ft by 7ft living space, adding that . she managed to fit more belongings there than she does at her new . 500-square-foot residence. Strangely, Ms Cohen got rid of many . of her belongings in the move, saying that getting more space didn’t . equate filling said space with more things. ‘If I don’t really love it, I don’t want it,’ she said. Spacious living: Her new apartment allows for more space - even for decorative floral vases . Coming down: Her bed, now in a room of its own, is no longer brushing the ceiling . The final frontier: Once Ms Cohen's knees were brushing the bathtub when using the restroom, but now, there's plenty of space . Ms Cohen moved to her new Upper West . Side location after her landlord tried to double her $700-a-month rent, . having found out that she wasn’t the person whose name appeared on the . lease. Facing eviction, Ms Cohen had no . choice but to leave the Lilliputian flat behind. Luckily, she had saved a . significant amount of money from her rent, and could afford a place . more than five and a half times the size of her former residence. Her belongings fit in some 34 boxes. ‘I really paired down,’ she told Faircompanies.com, showing off white . cubbyholes full of neatly-folded clothes. Genius: In her old apartment, Ms Cohen cleared out furniture and made sure she stored upwards . Inventive: With no kitchen in the tiny flat, Cohen bought a miniature fridge and stored fruit in the microwave . In 2010, Ms Cohen posted a video of how she worked with the pokey space, receiving millions of hits from impressed viewers. The 'microstudio', which was lined with clearly-labelled storage boxes to the ceiling, had no kitchen. Instead, . she relied on a miniature fridge and would use a toaster over and hot . pot to cook meals. She also owned just two plates, one fork and one . spoon, to save on space. She climbed a ladder to get into bed, . where she slept with her face just inches from the ceiling. It was so . cramped she suffered a panic attack on the first night she slept there. Cramped: Cohen demonstrates how close she slept to the ceiling. The first night, she had a panic attack . Balance: Using the bathroom, which Cohen claimed was 'pretty big', proved to be tricky business . In her bathroom, which she claimed was . 'pretty big' for the size of the flat, she had to be careful not to bash . her knees on a cupboard as she sat sideways on the toilet. By the bathroom door, Ms Cohen stored . her clothes behind a curtain, and would regularly fillet the wardrobe . to make sure it did not grow beyond the boundaries of its small space. The 'living room' was little more than a chair by the window with a reading lamp. 'I looked at the space like a challenge. I knew I could make it work,' Ms Cohen, 42, told the New York Post. 'I . never felt cramped. I also never thought I’d stay five years.' Ms Cohen said it was help from her father - . a bankruptcy lawyer - and her grandfather - who survived the Holocaust - . that taught her to live frugally. 'How much stuff do we really need?

The 33-year-old mother has been missing since . January 21 when she was supposed to return home to Staten Island from . the two-week solo trip. Turkish police have set up a special unit to find her . and her husband and brother have flown to Istanbul to help with the . search. According to local news reports, Sierra had exchanged emails with a person called 'Taylan' - although it is not known if this is his real name. The two agreed to meet on Galata Bridge, which was around a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported. Authorities are now scouring security camera images near to the bridge to see if the meeting did in fact take place, the news agency said. Staten Island Rep. Michael Grimm confirmed to Staten Island Live that police in Turkey are searching for at least one man, but he did not know their relationship or if they had met. 'There's nothing remarkable about their conversation, but the fact that . he's the last person she had any contact with makes him a person of . interest,' Grimm said. 'That's a solid lead that needs to be followed up . on.' He added that he spoke with Sierra's husband Steven on Tuesday, and that the man was meeting with local authorities and had provided them with passwords to her social media sites.

Sierra was in constant contact with him throughout the trip and knew she . had travelled outside Turkey. 'These are things she made me well aware . of,' he told Staten Island Live before leaving for Istanbul. 'She kept me 100 percent updated.' Turkey's Dogan news agency said police had learned that Sierra had travelled . to Amsterdam on January 15 and then on to Munich on January 16, before returning to . Istanbul on January 19. Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in . contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was . going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video . chat, she was touching base with us.' On Tuesday, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared. No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul January 7 and has since vanished.

But the former Miami Dolphins star did come clean about his affair with CBS production assistant Donna Savattere to the one person to whom it mattered the most - his wife of 28 years, Claire. 'Danny did, as difficult as it was, tell his wife in 2005, when this occurred,' a source told the New York Post.

Sources told the New York Post that Marino, who has worked as a pre-game analyst for CBS since 2003, even kept the child hidden from his bosses and his long-time agent-lawyer, Marvin Demoff. While Marino had used Demoff to negotiate his contracts with the Dolphins and CBS for 30 years, he turned to a different lawyer when he paid money to Savattere because he was 'embarrassed'. He only told the network about the scandal on Wednesday after The Post told Marino it would be publishing the story about his affair, a source told the paper. He then told Demoff.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 10:03 EST, 1 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:30 EST, 1 February 2013 . Details of the final terrifying hours of workers held hostage by terrorists at an Algerian gas plant have been revealed, as footage emerged of the site two weeks after the crisis unfolded in the Sahara desert. At least 38 foreign workers - including six Britons - died at the facility, which is part operated by BP, after it was over-run by heavily-armed terrorists on Wednesday January 16. The Algerian general manager of the site has told how between eight and 10 western hostages had been tied to metalwork at a gas construction complex on Thursday January 17, while the hostage-takers - some clad in suicide vests - set about building a bomb. Damage: The damage was evident as the Algerian government opened the desert gas plant for the first time following the four-day siege which saw dozens of workers slaughtered by militants . Lofti Benadouda said: 'There was one big explosion and we saw the fire burning all night.' According to a report in the Daily Telegraph . Mr Benadouda said the hostages had been chained to the metalwork at . varying heights; some at ground level close to the car containing the . bomb, others further up. 'The terrorists wanted a big explosion. They wanted to destroy the plant and make a big impression,' he said. Bloodshed: Bullet holes in the wall of a building in the residential area of the sprawling In Amenas complex in Algeria . Hostage crisis: Workers in hard hats stand before blackened towers at the In Amenas plant, which is now under heavy military guard . The manager, who was used by the . militants to relay messages between them and Algerian forces surrounding . the site, said that when he . attended the plant to try and identify the bodies of his colleagues, the . sights he witnessed suggested three terrorists had detonated suicide . vests. Mr Benadouda said a Norwegian and possibly a Briton were among the dead following the explosion. BBC video footage shows the now heavily-guarded facility . still bears the signs of the carnage wrought by terrorists during the four-day siege two weeks . ago, from bullet-holes visible in the walls of the employees' living . quarters, to the machinery blackened by fire and explosions. Aftermath: The site was opened to western media for the first time since dozens of foreign workers were killed during a four day stand-off that ended in a bloody showdown between militants and Algerian forces . Explosion: The manager of the site has described how a group of western hostages were tied to metalwork at a central gas processing facility by militants wearing suicide vests . The militants, who called themselves . the Signatories in Blood Battalion, stormed the 37-acre site on January . 16, attacking two buses carrying employees and killing two, before . driving to the main facility where they took hostages. The following day saw more bloodshed when Algerian forces attacked as the militants tried to move the hostages. The . plant was surrounded by Algerian military on Friday January 18, who . moved in the following day amid reports the terrorists were killing . hostages. The Algerian prime minister later announced that at least 38 civilians had been killed during the course of the siege. Horror: A blackened tower at the gas processing centre suggests a bomb was detonated . Bullet-holes: The terrorists stormed employee living quarters at the sprawling gas plant and took hostages . Security: The manager wants to see a military presence maintained at the site in the Sahara when the plant resumes producing gas . Manager: Lofti Benadouda has called for a permanent military presence at In Amenas . Scottish father-of-two Kenneth Whiteside, a planning manager at In Amenas who died at the hands of the militant hostage-takers a fortnight ago, was buried in Fife yesterday. His family has said he was 'lined up and shot dead' alongside three other hostages at the Algerian gas plant. Among the other UK nationals killed were 46-year-old security expert Paul Morgan, systems supervisor Garry Barlow, 49, from Liverpool, and 26-year-old engineer and father of one Sebastian John.","Footage shows the remote In Amenas plant two weeks after the crisis .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 09:13 EST, 30 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:45 EST, 30 January 2013 . A boys' school is planning to introduce a controversial new anti-drugs policy that will see hair samples collected from students for random testing. Around 60 strands of hair will be taken from each of a group of randomly selected pupils at Rockhurst High School in Kansas, Missouri, to be tested for cocaine, PCP, marijuana and other substances. Participation in the scheme, set to be introduced at the Jesuit school at the start of the 2013/14 academic year, will be mandatory. New policy: Hair samples will be taken from students at Rockhurst High School in Kansas for random drug testing . A member of staff Rockhurst who is a barber will be tasked with collecting their hair, which will be taken away and assessed for evidence of banned substances or alcohol abuse over the preceding 90 days. 'Our point is, if we do encounter a student who has made some bad decisions with drugs or alcohol, we will be able to intervene, get the parents involved, get him help if necessary, and then help him get back on a path of better decision making, healthier choices for his life,' Rockhurst principal Greg Harkness told local news website KSHB.com. Any student who tests positive will be given a 90-day period to be drug-free. The guidance councillor assigned to that pupil will be notified, and will meet with the student and their parents for a discussion over how best to help the boy concerned. Under the new policy, the incident will be noted in the student's guidance file, but no administrative personnel will be informed. The file is destroyed upon graduation and its contents are not sent to colleges or universities. Testing: Strands of hair collected from Rockhurst students will be tested for evidence of the use of cocaine, PCP, opiates, marijuana and other substances . The school decided to introduce the new policy after carrying out a survey of its students that revealed pupils' perceptions about drug use among their classmates were far removed from reality. 'What was most alarming for us is that when you asked our students if everyone else is doing it, they said ""Yes"". But, in fact, they weren't,' Mr Harkness said, adding that the misconception was fuelling peer pressure among teenagers. '...There's this idea that ""Everyone is doing it, so I guess I have to do it myself"",' the teacher said. Mr Harkness - who said almost all parents of Rockhurst students were 'on board' - said the policy was also being introduced in light of the impact of addiction and intoxication on the brain development of teenagers. The new rules will come into force at the start of the new academic year following two years of discussions among staff, administrators and parents. The school's junior class president Matthew Brocato said while some pupils were 'impressed' by the steps taken by Rockhurst to address the possibility to substance abuse, others regarded the impending drug testing as an invasion of privacy.","Rockhurst High School in Kansas, U.S., is to introduce random drug testing .

Authorities said that they are trying to track down Harmon, who is still considered ‘armed and dangerous.’ Documents show that Harmon was slated to go into a law office in the same building on Wednesday over a contract dispute and had a shaky history with business CEO Steve Singer, 48, who he allegedly killed. While Phoenix police did not immediately release the names of those wounded, law firm Osborn Maledon said one of their lawyers, Mark Hummels, was wounded, and was ‘representing a client in a mediation’ when he was shot. The third victim, a 32-year-old woman, suffered non-life threatening injuries. Police Sgt Tommy Thompson said that the two men were intentionally targeted by the shooter. ‘It was not a random shooting,’ he told the Associated Press.

Public records show that Harmon is married to Ivett Veronica Huska, and has a son, Timothy G. Harmon. Police were interviewing both of them Wednesday over Harmon’s whereabouts and possible motives. Mr Panzarella, who represented a man who was being sued by Harmon for causing a fender bender, added that Harmon had ‘obvious anger issues’ and was consistently ‘rude and disrespectful.’ Witnesses reported hearing multiple shots around 10.30am and said there was significant amounts of blood in the lobby area of the office building.

A cyclone had passed over the area shortly before the mystery man, who is believed to be Polish and in his 20s, attempted to navigate his way across the shark infested waters of the Torres Strait on his hastily assembled raft. It is thought he may have been planning to claim asylum when he reached his destination, but he only made it as far as Saibai Island, a few miles off the coast of Papua New Guinea, where he was eventually discovered in a mangrove swamp.

Residents on the island, which lies in Australian territorial waters, caught sight of the man - believed to be named Vazlavand - and alerted authorities, prompting a search for the sailor.

More than 130 organisations have been given leave to fly unmanned drones in the skies over the UK, it has emerged. Scores of private firms and government bodies have been granted permission to fly small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in British airspace, to the alarm of privacy campaigners who are calling for an urgent review of regulations surrounding the technology. Police forces, fire services and defence firms appear on a list of bodies granted permission to fly the vehicles by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), as does the BBC, the National Grid, and even a marketing company that is using a drone to create promotional videos for golf courses. Routine: Drones may become a familiar sight in the skies above Britain as it was revealed more than 100 organisations have sought permission to use the technology . UAV technology can be used for a variety of purposes; from scientific research and conservation, to surveillance and armed attacks. The CAA has granted permission to fly small drones over 160 times when multiple or expired licences are taken into account. Defence companies BAE Systems, Qinetiq and missile manufacturer MBDA all appear on the authority's list. Forensic and crime scene science specialists GWR & Associates are also using the vehicles, which are either controlled by 'pilots' on the ground, or are pre-programmed to complete set tasks. Concern: Privacy campaigners are calling for a review of regulations surrounding the use of UAVs, and have warned of the potential impact on civil liberties . Surveillance: The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Assocation has said the technology is becoming simpler and cheaper all the time . Police forces in Merseyside, Staffordshire and Essex have also been granted permission to fly drones, as have fire services in Dorset, Hampshire and the West Midlands. Video Golf Marketing has started using a UAV to create promotional videos for golf courses around the country. Eric King, head of research at campaign group Privacy International, told the Guardian the increasing use of drones by private and public organisations posed a 'unique' set of problems. He said the CAA needed to consider more than just health and safety issues when deciding whether to grant a licence to operate drone technology. 'We need new regulation to ensure privacy and other civil liberties are also being taken into account during the decision-making process,' he said. Search: Police forces in Merseyside, Staffordshire and Essex have all been granted permission to fly drones in UK airspace . The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association said the use of drones would continue to increase. General . secretary John Moreland, who said the vehicles can operate anywhere in . the UK 'within reason', said the technology was becoming less expensive . and simpler to use all the time.

Shooter: Suspected gunman Arthur Douglas Harmon, 70, is accused of firing shots inside an office building . The gunman who allegedly opened fire in a Phoenix office building yesterday killing one and injuring two others shot himself dead today, police said. The car of William Arthur Harmon III, 70, was found abandoned in a parking lot in a Phoenix suburb and Harmon's body was found close by with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Documents show that Harmon went into a law office on Wednesday over a contract dispute and had a shaky history with business CEO Steve Singer, 48, who he is accused of killing. While Phoenix police did not immediately release the names of those wounded, law firm Osborn Maledon said one of their lawyers, Mark Hummels, was wounded, and was ‘representing a client in a mediation’ when he was shot. The third victim, a 32-year-old woman, suffered non-life threatening injuries. Police Sgt Tommy Thompson said that the two men were intentionally targeted by the shooter. ‘It was not a random shooting,’ he said . Attorney David Panzarella, who dealt with Harmon five years ago over a separate legal dispute, said that Harmon had been involved in at least 10 civil suits. Scroll down for video .

"By . Kate Bevan . PUBLISHED: . 12:43 EST, 6 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 6 February 2013 . The record for the world’s largest prime number has been broken – by over four million digits. The number – 2 to the power of 57,885,161 minus 1 – is 17,425,170 numerals long and if you spent 12 hours a day writing it out at the rate of one digit a second it would take 403 days to complete. A prime number is only divisible by itself and 1, with the first ones being 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. Although of little significance, they have long fascinated amateur and professionals and the discovery of a new one is a badge of honour in mathematical circles. The number-cruncher: mathematician Curtis Cooper has found the largest prime number ever . Prime mover: Greek mathematician Euclid first mooted the theory of prime numbers in 300BC . Although there are an infinite amount . of prime numbers, the hunt for the largest has in recent years centred . on rare Mersenne primes, named after Marin Mersenne, a 17th-century . French monk and mathematician. Mersenne primes are 2 to the power of p minus 1, in which p is also a prime number and the latest is only the 48th to be found. ‘It’s sort of like finding a diamond,’ Chris Caldwell, of the University of Tennessee, told the New Scientist. ‘People like these large primes and so they have a value.’ The number was found with the Great . Internet Mersenne Prime Search, a network that harnesses the spare power . of 360,000 computers around the world. If you wanted to print out the new number, it would eat up 5,319 pages of A4 if you used the Courier New font at 11-point. In 300BC the Greek mathematician Euclid is thought to have published the first proof of the theory that prime numbers are infinite. The man behind the discovery is Curtis Cooper, which makes a hat trick for him: he also found two earlier highest prime numbers. That's a lot of numbers! This is just a tiny fraction of the 17 million digits that make up the very rare Mersenne prime . The previous record was held by a prime number that is a mere 12,978,189 digits long. The icing on the cake is that this discovery is also a very rare Mersenne prime - the 48th, in fact. The find breaks a long dry spell: it has been four years since the last biggest ever prime number was found. Maths is full of riddles. And every mathematician loves a challenge. None more than Professor Andrew Wiles (pictured), who decided as a child that he would one day prove one of the final enduring puzzles of maths - Fermat's Last Theorem. It was mooted by Pierre de Fermat, doodling in a copy of Arithmetica, in 1637. While it looks deceptively simple - the theorem states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than two - nobody had managed to prove it. After years of work, Wiles was confident enough to announce in 1993 that he had proved the theorem, instantly becoming the toast of the mathematical world. However, his hopes were dashed when it became clear that his proof contained an error. Two years later, Wiles and his former student Richard Taylor finally proved that Fermat had been right, 358 years after the theorem was conjectured. Of all the numbers between 2 25,964,951-1 just 1,622,441 are prime, and of those, only 42 are Mersenne primes. Prime numbers have little value in themselves to mathematicians, but they are nonetheless prized as oddities that are difficult to find. Says Chris Caldwell at the University of Tennessee: 'It's sort of like finding a diamond. 'For some reason people decide they're like diamonds and so they have a value.' This latest giant prime number was found as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a project that uses spare processing power on thousands of volunteer computers to look for and calculate prime numbers. Dr Cooper's computer took 39 days of flat-out computing to verify that this number was indeed a prime. He had crunched the number as a result of running the GIMPS software on 1,000 computers at the university. Dr Cooper's find was verified by other powerful computers running different software. Anyone can download the software and put their own computer to work on finding ever bigger primes from www.mersenne.org, which announced the finding. And if you're fired up by the hunt, the Electronic Frontier Foundation is offering a prize $150,000 to the person who discovers the first 100 million-digit prime.","Number fund at a Missouri university using software on 1,000 computers .

It is thought the brakes may have failed on the bus, which careered down a mountain route close to the town of Forest Falls, before colliding with a car and flipping over, then ploughing into a pick-up towing a trailer. Emergency workers spent hours extricating people from the stricken bus - which was carrying tourists returning to Tijuana, Mexico, after a day of skiing at California's popular Big Bear resort - following the 'devastating' crash on State Route 38 at 6.30pm last night.

Hurt: Victims of a fatal bus crash reach out to comfort each other in the wake of the smash, which left eight dead and dozens more - including children - injured . A Highway Patrol officer at the scene, Mario Lopez, confirmed the death toll and said almost 40 people were rushed to hospital in the aftermath of the accident. Some passengers were thrown from the bus, while others were left trapped among the wreckage. Children were among the injured. 'It's horrific, it is tragic, it is carnage,' Terri Kasinga, from the California Department of Transport, said in the wake of the crash. 'It is so bad up there it's hard to understand what really happened,' she told ABC Local Los Angeles. The bus driver reported having brake problems as it came down the mountain on State Route 38, rear-ending a sedan then flipping over and hitting a pickup truck that was pulling a trailer, he said. Passengers on the bus were part of a tour group from Tijuana, Mexico, and a representative from the Mexican consulate was at the crash scene. The bus was heading down the mountain carrying passengers returning from a day of skiing and snowboarding at Big Bear, according to NBC Los Angeles. Survivors told the network those on board heard the driver shout something about the vehicle's brakes, then the bus began weaving in and out of traffic as it sped down the route before colliding with the sedan and flipping over.

Many were left trapped in the bus, which came to a rest lying sideways across both lanes of State Route 38 with its front end crushed. 'It's horrific, it is tragic, it is carnage' Terri Kasinga, California Department of Transport . People were still being extricated from the bus more than an hour after the crash on the mountainous stretch, which runs through the San Bernardino National Forest, and rescuers were still searching the wreckage for victims hours later. Television footage showed the bus sitting upright but turned sideways on the road, which was littered with debris. 'It's really a mess up there with body parts,' Michelle Profant, a spokeswoman for California Department of Transportation, said of the 'shocking' crash scene. At least seven ambulances were called to the scene, and patients were taken to several hospitals. Mr Lopez said more than a dozen survivors pulled from the wreckage had sustained life-threatening injuries. He told press gathered at the crash scene last night: 'We still don't know what caused the bus to accelerate down the 38. There's a possibility of mechanical issues. 'The bus rear-ended a Saturn sedan then rolled or overturned,' he said, adding that the bus then collided with a Ford pick-up truck towing a trailer, resulting in 'multiple fatalities'. 'It's a terrible crash,' he said. 'We are trying to get investigators in there and hopefully determine exactly what happened.' Arrowhead Regional Medical Center said four women had been admitted from the crash and their conditions were still being determined.

Catastrophe: Investigators survey the scene with the battered bus and trailer taped off and items like shoes, probably belonging to victims, strewn on the road . Redland Community Hospital said it received one person in critical condition and one with minor injuries, while two more were en route with minor injuries. Community Hospital of San Bernardino said it had received one patient with undetermined injuries, while St. Bernadine Medical Center said it had two patients, whose injuries were being assessed. Lettering on the bus indicated that it was operated by Scapadas Magicas LLC, a company based in National City, California. Federal transportation records show that the company is licensed to carry passengers for interstate travel, and that it has had no crashes in the past two years. A call to the company was not immediately returned. Jordi Garcia, a manager for InterBus Tours, said his company ran the trip yesterday. He told U-T San Diego that the group departed Tijuana at 5 a.m. for a day of skiing at Big Bear. 'The information that we have is that the bus brakes failed and the accident occurred,' he said. The California crash comes less than a day after a bus carrying 42 high school students and their chaperones slammed into an overpass in Boston. Massachusetts state police said 35 people were injured and that the driver had directed the bus onto a road with a height limit.","Smash happened on State Route 38 near Forest Falls, 80 miles east of LA .

Fragments of a plate buried in Scotland 1,500 years ago have been used to illustrate the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by elite members of Roman society. Archaeologists were able to create this digital reconstruction of the ornate silver plate based upon two chunks of the original rim, which unearthed along with an enormous collection of Roman hacksilver in East Lothian in 1919. The 'highly decorative' silver fragments and the 70cm diameter of the reconstructed plate indicate that this was dinnerware 'fit for senators and the Roman elite', researchers said. Lavish: A digital reconstruction of the ornate Roman plate based on two original fragments unearthed near Haddington in East Lothian, Scotland, in 1919 . Fragment: This scrap of an original silver Roman plate discovered in Scotland was used to help create the digital reconstruction of the artefact in its original form . The pieces of the plate were part of the biggest collection of Roman hacksilver ever found, discovered at Traprain Law, a hill near Haddington, in 1919. A research team has used laser scanning to make what they believe is an accurate, full-size reconstruction of the dish, based on the curve and appearance of the surviving fragments. With a 70cm diameter, it is believed to be one of the largest known dishes from across the whole of the Roman Empire, and would have been a 'high status object', experts said. The reconstruction for National Museums Scotland was undertaken as part of the Glenmorangie Research Project, supporting the study and understanding of Early Medieval Scotland. High status object: The fragment, left, used as the basis for the digital reconstruction, right, was found among the Traprain Law hoard - the biggest collection of Roman hacksilver ever discovered . Alice Blackwell, Glenmorangie research officer at National Museums Scotland, said: 'The silver fragments are highly decorative and combined with what we now know about the plate’s size, this plate could only have been a high status object, fit for senators and the Roman elite. 'We are thrilled that the digital reconstruction has provided us with such a unique insight into the contents of this treasure hoard. 'Now, thanks to the support of Glenmorangie, we can build on our knowledge of Scotland’s early history, the murky transition from the Roman to Early Medieval periods and the enduring importance of silver in Scotland’s past.' Silver items in the Traprain Law hoard had been cut and folded into parcels, either to be exchanged or melted down and recycled into new objects. It is unlikely the contents of the haul were ever used in Scotland, as experts believe they were cut up before they arrived. The hoard is believed to have been buried in the middle of the 5th century AD, at a time when Roman silver was an important indicator of status and wealth. Hamish Torrie, a spokesman for the Glenmorangie Company, said: 'This is yet another exciting reveal from National Museums Scotland and follows on from other discoveries they have made during the course of our partnership. 'It’s great to see modern technology being used to re-evaluate the world famous Traprain hoard. We are proud to be associated with this exciting research into early Scotland.'","A chunk of the decorative silver plate was unearthed in East Lothian in 1919 .

A Florida teenager has struck a blow for female equality by becoming the first girl in the state to play football as a quarterback alongside her male classmates. Erin DiMeglio has long been training with the boys, and on Friday she had her moment of glory when she took the field towards the end of a game for Plantation High School. The 17-year-old's school was winning 31-14 when she entered the arena with just a few moments left. A State First: Many females have played football in Florida, but only one has assumed the role of signal-caller . A Historical Hand-Off: Erin DiMeglio becomes the first female in the storied history of high school football-crazed Florida to play quarterback . With the crowd cheering, 'Erin! Erin! Erin!' and her proud parents looking on, she closed out the contest with a hugely symbolic hand-off. Afterwards Erin said: 'I have always wanted to play football ever since I was a little kid. Parents said, ""It was too rough for you."" 'I have nothing to say - I am just out here to prove myself, I am just going to prove by doing on the field.' Her mother talked of her joy at seeing the girl achieve her dream. 'My heart starts racing so excited for her and for all this attention for her today,' Kathleen Dimeglio told ABC News. 'She has these great abilities and I knew she could do this. I just wanted her to be able to prove it.' History Made: Erin DiMeglio takes the field for her high school team in the final seconds of her team's Friday contest . Proud Parents: DiMeglio's mom said she had never had a doubt that her daughter could do anything to which she applies herself . The 17-year-old is a backup . quarterback for the South Plantation High School Paladins, in Sunrise, . Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. The teen has been practicing with the team since May and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the Paladins game on August 24, calling plays and completing two passes, a sign that more field time could be in the cards during the upcoming season. Unfortunately, the game had to be called off early, with 2:43 remaining, due to heavy lightening in the area and the Paladins lost to Seminole Ridge High School, 35-20. 'I couldn't take the smile off my face,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel about her field play last week. 'The other players have been great. After the game, they shook my hand and said it was great I was playing football.' A basketball star in her own right, Dimeglio was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained, her natural talent for the sport became evident. Paladins football coach, Douglas Gatewood, observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born. Warm Up Tosses: DiMEglio readies herself for her big moment before the game, which her school won 31-14 . No special treatment: Dimeglio's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship, insisting that she has to hold her own . Football in Florida is like a religion. The Sunshine State has been a breeding ground for NFL greats like Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and current up-and-comer Jets QB Tim Tebow. The state is joined by Texas and California in producing the most NFL players. Though high school football has seen female participation in the past, most have been in spots like kickers, receivers, defensive backs and offensive linemen (or linewomen). Rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team. Logistically speaking, Dimeglio joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room. She changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room, on the other side of her school. Off the field: Erin Dimeglio (left) says her older sister Amy (right) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys . 'She doesn't ask for any special treatment,' Coach Gatewood said about his no-nonsense approach to incorporating Dimeglio. 'She's not trying to show anybody up, she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way, that's on him, not on her.' 'She's got to walk in the middle of [the football huddle] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do,' the coach added. State records show a total of 523 female Floridians have taken to the field in high school football since 1973. In 2011, a total of 36 girls played for teams across the state. 'We've had girls in South Florida that had the ability to [play quarterback], but they never have,' Larry Blustein, a Florida high school football analyst, told the Sun-Sentinel. 'You have to give her credit. I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. Leader: As QB, Erin has had to earn the respect of her teammates 'they better listen to her ... and they do,' her coach said . Erin said her older sister, Amy, thinks she is crazy, but 'I just think this is so much fun,' she said. 'I've played flag football since the fourth grade. Scoring on boys is really fun, just to see their reactions, see the coaches get mad. I'll be nervous, yeah. But this is like any other game. You just have to get in the zone and play.' Despite Erin's enthusiasm, her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries. As a veteran athlete, the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team, including a broken nose, a broken finger and multiple concussions. 'I've often joked that I wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on,' Kathleen DiMeglio, Erin's mother, said. 'She's no weakling and I think I have confidence after seeing her strength. But of course my greatest fear is injury,' the concerned mom added. And her mom isn't the only one concerned for her safety. Paladin lineman Kevin Avila said that having a girl on the team makes the defensive line feel like they need to step it up. From the court to the field: The 17-year-old high school senior got her start on the basketball team . 'I see her like a sister and you wouldn't want nobody to hurt your sister,' Avila said. 'Since she's a girl, you don't want her to get hurt,' Avila said. 'We want to have more protection for her.' Coach Gatewood has assured her parents that she'll have minimal field time, and would only be brought in to play when the game is going favorably for the team, to avoid unnecessary roughness. With all the fanfare surrounding her athletic pursuits, the teenager insists that it isn't all about sports to her. ‘As important as playing basketball is in my life, school and my education are a priority,’ she wrote in her profile on a local sport's recruiting website. Adding that her motto is ‘work and train hard, both on the court and in the classroom. It is as important to take care of your body as it is your mind.' Despite her tough-guy approach on the field, Erin isn't afraid to show her girly side. After her momentous field time in a preseason contest last week, her coach encouraged her to take off her helmet to greet the crowd as she exited the field . 'Coach, my hair's all messed up,' she said in protest. 'Don't worry,' he said 'You just played football. Get used to it.'","Erin DiMeglio, 17, played in a fourth-quarter mop-up role in her team's winning effort on Friday ."

Five years after a gunman forced five women into the back of a Chicago clothing store and shot them dead execution-style, police are still searching for answers. Authorities have received 6,700 tips about the 2008 killings at the Lane Bryant store in Tinley Park, but they are no closer to knowing who took the women's lives - or why. Store manager Rhoda McFarland, 42, Jennifer Bishop, 34, Carrie Hudek Chiuso, 33, Sarah Szafranski, 22, and Connie Woolfolk, 37, died in the grisly shootings on February 2, 2008. Shortly after 10 a.m., a man posing as a . delivery man walked into the store and chatted with two . customers and two employees. He then pulled out a gun and . announced a holdup. Victims: Store manager Rhoda McFarland, 42, (left) and shopper Carrie Hudek Chiuso, 33, (right) were among the five women shot dead by a gunman in a Lane Bryant store in the Chicago area in 2008 . He forced the four women into the back room of the store, bound them . with duct tape and forced them face down on the floor, police said. Two more women . who later entered the store were also taken into the back room, tied and forced next to the others. When the gunman was distracted, store manager Rhoda McFarland managed to call 911 from her cell phone even though she was bound by duct tape. Dispatchers logged the call at 10.44 a.m. and heard her frantically describing what was happening. On the call, the man could also be heard saying: 'I'm losing it.' Loss: Jennifer L. Bishop, 34, (left) and Sarah Szafranski, 22, (right) were also marched into the back room of the store and shot execution style by the gunman who has never been caught . Missed: Mother-of-two Connie Woolfolk, 37, died as she shopped for an outfit for a girls' night out . He then shot the six women execution style, fatally shooting five. The sixth victim pretended to be dead until police arrived a few minutes later. By the time authorities arrived on the scene, the man had fled. He left bullet casings from a .40-caliber Glock behind, but took the gun with him. The one survivor was able to describe him in detail as he had not been wearing a mask. She said he was  a 6 foot African-American . man with braided hair and . cornrows, and aged between 25 and 35. She noted that his hair was pulled back but that one braid hung by his right cheek with light-green beads on the end of it. The woman did not recognise the man and investigators did not find a connection between him and any of the other victims. Wanted: A sixth victim survived the shooting by pretending to be dead and described the gunman to police. Investigators created this image to show their suspect, but he has not been found . Authorities believe the killings could have been motivated by robbery as he took a few hundred dollars from the store, but they have not been able to confirm this. Today, three investigators work on the case full time and . tips keep coming in - although they are becoming less frequent. In . 2008, there were 5,600 calls while there were just 87 last year. Investigators have followed leads as far afield as Texas, North Carolina and London, but nothing has helped solve the crime, and there were no security cameras in the store to assist police. With specialist training courses and help from agencies including NASA, the police department in Tinley has spent nearly $2 million trying to find the killer. 'There is somebody out there who knows who did this,'  Cmdr. Pat McCain told the Chicago Tribune. Scene: Police stand watch outside a Lane Bryant store where the shooting occurred in Tinley Park, Illinois . Search: Investigators have received thousands of tips yet the grisly crime has not been solved . Tragic: Officials remove the remains of a victim in Tinley Park after the five women were shot dead . 'Maybe their . conscience is bothering them. Maybe they will get themselves in a jam . and need to help themselves out. I don't care what their motivation is. We need them to come forward.' But not all family members are seeking such closure. Jennifer Bishop's sister Michelle Talos said she fears the pain that would follow an arrest. 'We would all have to go through all that again,' she said. 'Sometimes, I would like to just imagine that he's dead somewhere.' On Saturday, family members will gather outside the store, which has been empty since the murders, to remember their loved ones. Store manager Rhoda McFarland was scheduled to be off on the day of the killings, but had stopped by the shop to help with markdowns. Pain: Greg Zanis reacts after putting up five crosses in front of the store the day after the murder . Site: The shop, at Brookside Marketplace Mall, is now being renovated for new tenants . Jennifer Bishop, 34, was enjoying a weekend away from home with her husband when she nipped into the shop, which specialised in clothes for plus-size women, and unsuspectingly became a victim. Carrie Hudek Chiuso, 33, was shopping for an outfit for a get-together with old college friends, while mother-of-two Connie Woolfolk, 37, was looking for new clothes for a girls' night out that evening. Sarah Szafranski, 22, visited the shop to buy some winter work clothes for her new job in the accounting . department at CNA Financial in downtown Chicago. The site is now being remodelled for a new tenant.","Five women shot dead in Lane Bryant store in Tinley Park in February 2008 .

Monday is set to be the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures warming up over the next couple of days. Parts of the country will see the mercury reach as high as 32c (90f) at the start of the working week. Sunglasses were out at Glastonbury yesterday as the rain stayed away and revellers dried out and looked forward to a scorcher of a weekend . Warming up: Revellers at Glastonbury can expect temperatures as high as 30c on Sunday . Despite the good news, sun worshippers would be wise to make the most of it, because this is not the start of a glorious summer. More a heat ripple than a heat wave, cooler temperatures are due to return as quickly as  the middle of the week, forecasters said. Today is due to start off a little damp and drizzly across the country, but the weather  will warm up in most parts with maximum temperatures of around 25c (77f). Sun hats were out in force at Wimbledon yesterday as a full house watched day five of the tournament . Tomorrow will be warmer still, hitting 30c (86f) in the South-East, and on Monday Mother Nature will turn up the dial to a 32c maximum. The sun should allow for a good day of tennis at Wimbledon today and, after an extremely soggy start, thousands of mud-addled revellers at Glastonbury can finally look forward to their moment in the sun. A Met Office forecaster said yesterday: ‘Most parts of the UK will see some decent weather this weekend. 'It will feel warm, particularly in the South, and on Monday we are expecting the hottest day of the year so far.

Mud glorious mud: Revellers at Glastonbury have been faced with a wet and muddy site as they arrive for the annual music festival . ‘But it looks like things will be getting cooler as we get further into next week.’ The blast of sunshine might not be . welcomed by many farmers, after the Environment Agency stated that the . current drought is still not over, despite many parts of England and . Wales already receiving higher than average rainfall for June . The forecast has also prompted a heat-health alert for the East Midlands, East of England and the South-East, warning of the dangers of high temperatures, particularly for the very old, the very young and those with chronic health conditions. Chief forecaster at the Met Office Andy Page  said: ‘There is a 60 per cent chance of some places in East Anglia, the East Midlands and south-east England reaching 30c on Sunday and Monday.’ Its head of health forecasting said: ‘There is the possibility of daytime and night-time temperatures reaching trigger thresholds. ‘These temperatures, together with high humidity, pose a risk to vulnerable people.’ Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, parts of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire and western Norfolk remain in a state of drought.

A schoolboy who was found hanged in his bedroom was being bullied because he suffered from learning difficulties and was dating a younger girl, his family and friends have claimed. Joshua Maddox, who suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had allegedly suffered months of cruel taunts from classmates because the condition had left him struggling with his schoolwork. His devastated mother Michelle Maddox, 34, also claimed today that her son was called 'paedo' by classmates because his girlfriend of two months was two years younger than him. Tragic: Joshua Maddox pictured two weeks before he was found hanged at his family's Walsall home, left, and in a school photo taken when he was a Year 8 pupil . Devastated: Joshua's mum Michelle and stepdad Philip Downes have both claimed that the teenager was bullied because he had ADHD and was dating a younger girl . She issued a desperate plea for tougher punishments to be handed to bullies. The 15-year-old was found hanged by his younger sister Leighlauren at the family home in Walsall, West Midlands, as she went to wake him for school last Thursday morning. Miss Maddox said: 'I want young people to see what effect bullying can have and educate them better about how to deal with children who have mental health issues. 'I think bullies need a stronger punishment, I feel deep down that nothing will be done about this and I worry it could happen to another family. 'He was my baby, I can't replace him, he's never coming back and I want people to be aware of what bullying can do to people. 'We all went to bed the night before, he never gave any indication or let on that anything was wrong. 'That day he'd been playing with his brothers and they'd been laughing and joking together. 'The only thing we do know is he deleted stuff off his phone just before he died, the police are looking through it for any clues. Memorial: One of the pictures posted on a Facebook tribute picture set up in memory of Joshua Maddox . 'He was very good at putting up a front, you wouldn't be able to find out what was wrong with him. 'Even if you asked he'd say he was fine.' Heartbroken Miss Maddox said that her son, who died just a month before his 16th birthday, had been dating a younger girl since just before Christmas. She added: 'We only knew that he had been bullied about his girlfriend because his sister was in the art room when it happened, otherwise we probably never would have known. 'They were calling him a ""paedo"" because she was two years younger and making fun of the fact that she had glasses. 'We were told about it the week before he left us but he said he wanted to deal with it himself and didn't want me to get involved. 'The problem when children are bullied is that they feel like if they tell on people they'll just get it back ten times worse.' Scores of Joshua's friends took to social networking sites to play tribute to the 'lovely' and 'cheeky' Year 10 student who was known as Josh, but others hit out at bullies who had targeted him. Friend Jessica Mary posted on a facebook page set up in his memory: 'R.I.P gorgeous! We was always so close. 'I hope the bullies die inside, I hope they suffer I don't get how they can bully you because you have adhd, its so sick you was lovely lad you was so nice sleep tight lovely x (sic)' 'Well-liked': Schoolmates and friends of Joshua Maddox, pictured, have described him as a 'lovely' and 'cheeky' boy . Stepdad Philip Downes, 32, said that Josh behaved as though he was much younger due to his ADHD and autism. He said: 'I think children need to be more aware of the symptoms of ADHD and other mental health problems. 'Josh showed no physical difference to the other children his age, but in his head it was a different story. Grief: Joshua's mum Michelle and stepdad Philip Downes are pictured holding a picture of the teenager outside the family's Walsall home . 'His body was 15 but his mind was more like a twelve-year-old. 'His body had gone through puberty but his brain hadn't, he just didn't fit in any more with the other children so they picked on him.' Friends of the youngster who attended St Thomas More Catholic School in Willenhall, West Midlands, described him as a talented artist, footballer and keen video-gamer on the site. Kirsty Price wrote: 'Josh u was truely amazing and just a total ace person I will never forget u the way u flipped ur hair the way u alway had a smile on ur face we have lost a true angel. 'I will never forget the laugh we have had when we had piggy back race down all the streets. 'U was so amazing at drawing and I will never forget the time I popped ur nose and u still had a smile on ur face rip josh I will never forgett u xxxxxx (sic).' A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman confirmed that Joshua died at the family's Walsall home. She said: 'We were called to a medical incident, one patient was confirmed dead at the scene. 'No-one was taken to hospital.' A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed officers were called to a medical emergency at around 7am last Thursday. Detective Inspector John Smith said: 'We are completing routine enquiries on behalf of the coroner; the death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Standing out: The rocket launcher is pictured along with the 2,600 other weapons turned in at the gun buyback . New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said during a news conference on Tuesday that nearly 95 per cent of all the weapons purchased were fully operational. Mr Chiesa told Fox 5: 'I'm not here today suggesting buybacks are the singular answer.' 'However, there's no question that buybacks are part of the solution, and we believe that they're making a difference in New Jersey as evidenced by the 700 illegal firearms collected in this buyback.' He said that about $324,000 was given out in the guns-for-cash program - and nearly $100,000 of that total was in vouchers because organizers ran out of money.

Mercer County residents received $25 to $250 for each firearm depending on type, condition and legality. About 700 of the weapons collected were illegal, MyFoxNY.com reported. About $100,000 was budgeted but because of the huge turnout, the amount spent is expected to be well over double that.

China has leapfrogged the United States to become the world’s largest trading nation in a further sign that economic power is shifting from West to East. The total value of Chinese imports and exports hit $3.87trillion (£2.45trillion) in 2012 – edging past the $3.82trillion (£2.44trillion) trade registered by the US. It marked another key milestone for the rapidly-growing Chinese economy which is now the second largest in the world behind the US having overtaken Japan. Leapfrogged the US: China has become the world's largest trading nation with the total value of Chinese imports and exports hitting £2.45trillion in 2012 . Analysts said the trade figures were all the more remarkable because although China is catching up fast it is still only half the size of the American economy. It was seen as an indication of the reliance of Beijing on the rest of the world to generate income compared with America whose economy was twice the size but more self-contained. ‘It is remarkable that an economy that is only a fraction of the size of the US economy has a larger trading volume,’ said Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

But sales to Germany fell from £32.6billion to £32.1billion while exports to France dropped from £22billion to £21billion and to Italy from £10billion to £8.1billion. Jim O’Neill, the Goldman Sachs economist who first used the term BRIC to describe the fast-growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said China will become an increasingly important trade partner to the West - and could seriously disrupt old alliances in Europe. ‘For so many countries around the world, China is rapidly becoming the most important bilateral trade partner,’ he said. ‘Germany may export twice as much to China by the end of the decade as it does to France.’","Growth in global trade slowed sharply last year, but China still led the way among the world's largest economies .

Aside from a smattering of nervous laughter, the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel descended into silence on Sunday night  as Jodie Foster began a  speech that many Hollywood  observers have long believed she would never make. On stage to accept a Cecil B. DeMille  lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, she announced she had a ‘sudden urge to say something that I’ve never really been able to air in public’. In the rambling seven-minute speech that followed, Foster talked obliquely and sometimes even in the third person about a private life she has guarded fiercely for decades. Outspoken: The usually fiercely private star addressed her personal life in a heartfelt speech at the Golden Globes as she accepted her lifetime achievement award . Some are still wondering what exactly the Oscar-winning star of The Accused and Silence Of The Lambs did admit, but the text of her speech left little room for doubt. For the first time in her career, Foster  publicly addressed her own sexuality. Although she never mentioned the words ‘gay’ or ‘lesbian’, Foster appeared to end years of speculation about her private life. As her two sons watched from the audience in a rare public appearance with their mother, Foster plunged in. She said she had to acknowledge Cydney Bernard, ‘one of the deepest loves of my life, my heroic co-parent, my ex-partner in love but righteous soul sister in life’. As she said this, the woman in question sat with her head bowed with emotion a seat away from their two boys.‘Thank you, Cyd. I am so proud of our modern family. Our amazing sons, Charlie and Kit, who are my reason to breathe and to evolve, my blood and soul.’ As the showbusiness world digested the speech yesterday, it was clear from social media sites that scores of fans had been taken completely by surprise by the 50-year-old Foster’s coded revelations. Many simply wanted to know who Cydney Bernard was. For years referred to simply as Foster’s ‘constant companion’ or ‘close friend’, Miss Bernard’s relationship with the actress has long been cloaked in uncertainty thanks to Foster’s intense privacy. They met on the set of the 1993 Civil War film Sommersby — in which Foster starred with Richard Gere — and were reportedly quickly in a serious relationship together. Miss Bernard — a film producer nearly ten years older who could pass for Foster’s dowdier sister — soon moved into the actress’s West Hollywood mansion. 'My righteous soul sister': The actress with her former partner Cydney Bernhard in Hollywood . In 1998, their relationship was cemented after they took shared parenting roles for the first of  Foster’s children, Charles, who was conceived by artificial insemination. Foster had her second son, Kit, in 2001 in the same circumstances. The father of both boys is believed to have been a friend of Foster, a gay casting director named Randy Stone, who died of heart disease in 2007. It is believed it was the lasting influence of Mr Stone, who campaigned for understanding for gay teenagers struggling with their sexuality, that convinced Foster she had to come out. Mr Stone’s mother, the Reverend Beverly Bates, said this week that her son treated Jodie Foster’s two boys as if they were his own, but agreed to sign papers guaranteeing to keep secret the truth about their paternity. Foster, she added, plans to tell her boys their father’s identity when they turn 21. In interviews, Foster has talked about her determination to give the boys a ‘normal’ family life, which she never had. Thus it was that Miss Bernard legally adopted both children and shouldered many of the parenting duties, taking turns with Foster to drive them to school in their matching BMW convertibles. The couple spent most of their time at home, indulging their shared passions for yoga and organic food. Although Foster said she refused to have the usual household staff employed by Hollywood stars because she didn’t want a ‘bunch of strangers’ in the house, friends suggested she was simply terrified of her unconventional home life leaking out. Foster’s secrecy would lead to bizarre scenes at film premieres, as Miss Bernard and the children waited quietly in the crowd for Foster’s red-carpet arrival before making their own way inside,  unnoticed by photographers. For several years, the two women wore matching eternity rings on their wedding fingers, and in December 2007 Foster first publicly acknowledged the relationship, gushing at a private awards ceremony speech about ‘my beautiful Cydney, who sticks with me through the rotten and the bliss’. Modern family: The 50-year-old actress, hugs sons Kit, 11, and 14-year-old Charlie, at a Golden Globes party at the Beverley Hilton Hotel . Within five months, however, they had split. It emerged that Foster had found a new lover, screenwriter Cindy Mort, whom she had met two years earlier on the set of the film The Brave One. The glamorous Miss Mort was 14 years younger than Foster, and famous for writing explicit sex scenes for America’s usually prudish TV sitcom world. 'Deepest love': Bernard and Foster on holiday in Rome in 2005 . She couldn’t have been more different than the somewhat mumsy Miss Bernard, and she left the actress the following year, leaving Foster reportedly deeply upset. Beverly Bates said the last she had heard, Foster had been dating a South American athlete, although it is clear that nobody has replaced Miss Bernard in Foster’s affections. Indeed, despite speculation that Cydney could have laid claim to a portion of the actress’s $25 million fortune, the pair separated amicably, and Miss Bernard is now understood to live in one of Foster’s LA homes. Though this week’s touching tribute has made plain Foster’s affection for Miss Bernard, their 15-year relationship was not Foster’s first experience of lesbianism. She had an unsettled childhood after her father, a retired air force colonel, left her mother, film  producer Brandy Almond, shortly after Foster was conceived. Her mother then moved in with a lesbian lover named Josephine Dominguez, whom Foster and her older three siblings called ‘Aunt Jo’. From the age of three, when she appeared in a TV commercial for suncream, Foster was the household’s sole breadwinner. A 1997, biography of the actress by her disaffected brother Buddy described a supremely dysfunctional showbusiness family. Brandy was portrayed as hot tempered and sometimes violent, frittering away her children’s showbiz earnings. As for his sister’s sexuality, Buddy claimed she’d had several boyfriends and had become ‘smitten’ with British actor Julian Sands after starring together in the 1987 erotic drama Siesta. But he had never doubted she was lesbian or bisexual, he said. A furious Foster cut her brother off for good. Firm friend: The late Randy Stone, seen with Foster at the Emmy awards in 1997, left, and the 1997 Oscars, right, is rumoured to be the father of her two sons, who were conceived through artificial insemination . It would be a psychiatrist’s job to say whether her father’s desertion of her mother coloured Foster’s view of men, but it is certainly true to say she has spent her career picking roles of strong women fighting against abusive men. Foster became famous at 14 playing a child prostitute opposite Robert De Niro in the 1976 film Taxi Driver. She went on to win Oscars for her performances as a gang-raped waitress in The Accused and as an FBI agent on the trail of a serial killer in The Silence Of The Lambs. What is particularly noticeable is that she hasn’t had a romantic lead since gazing into Richard Gere’s eyes in Sommersby 19 years ago — coincidentally, the film on which she met Cydney Bernard. Perhaps she didn’t want to take on major roles when she was devoting so much time to raising her sons — or perhaps directors thought audiences might find Foster smooching with male leads faintly ridiculous given the rumours. Celebrations: Mel Gibson was seated at Foster's table at the ceremony, where she was honoured with a lifetime achievement award for her decades in the movie business . Proud: The Oscar-winner's sons looked on with pride from the audience as their mother made her emotional speech at the Golden Globes . Even if she has had to watch as the glitzy roles have gone to less talented actresses, Foster has stolen the limelight back now. She spoke forcefully at the Golden Globes about how actors had the right to privacy, which begs the question of why she bothered to step out of the closet now. Was it simply because she is a  little mature for glamour roles and no longer needs to worry about her public image? Certainly lesbianism can damage an actress’s career in America. Comedian Ellen DeGeneres said it took three years to resurrect her career and personal life after she came out in 1997. For now, we must wait to see what effect, if any, the Golden Globes speech has on Foster’s career. America’s gay community is divided; some admire her candour, others complain it took far too long for her to acknowledge the truth (gay activists tried to force her to admit her sexuality as long ago as the Eighties, when they plastered posters of her bearing the aggressive phrase ‘Absolutely Queer’ around American cities). Still, nobody was left in any doubt that Foster’s speech, though carefully scripted, was from the heart. ‘I want to be seen, to be understood deeply and to be not so very lonely,’ she said with a smile. Observers took it to be a reference to her song My Name Is Tallulah, in which — aged 13 — she crooned ‘You don’t have to be lonely’ to a room of smitten child gangsters in the 1976 film Bugsy Malone. It was surely meant lightheartedly, but as an actress who has spent most of her career concealing her true self, it seemed strangely fitting.","The actress publicly addressed her sexuality for the first time as she accepted a Cecil B.

A yacht bobbing on the Mediterranean is dwarfed by a furious waterspout in this incredible picture. Holidaymaker Isabelle Filippini had been admiring the calm sea off the coast of the French island of Corsica when the enormous, powerful vortex formed above the surface of the water. Mrs Filippini, who ran to grab her camera, said witnessing the phenomenon had left her stunned. Waterspout: The enormous vortex appeared over the sea off the coast of the French island of Corsica . 'My family and I had been admiring the sea, despite the low clouds,' said Mrs Filippini, 43. 'Then all of a sudden one of the clouds was pointing towards the sea and I realised it was forming a tornado. I was amazed as the waterspout touched the sea,' she said. 'On the ground everything was quiet - the weather had been stormy for a few days but there was no strong wind and no rain. I ran to catch my camera, changed my lens and caught a classic view of the spout.' Waterspouts occur when tornadoes form over oceans, lakes and rivers. The intense funnels are formed when . layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep . up from underneath, forming a column of condensation. The tornadoes can pose a threat to boats, swimmers and aircraft in their path. Phenomenon: Stunned holidaymaker Isabelle Filippini captured the natural display on camera . The mother-of-one snapped the pictures during a visit to her parents' seaside home north of Bastia, on Corsica. 'I have spent my holidays in Corsica since I was born, but never saw such a tornado,' she said. 'I'm so amazed I got this photo of the boat in front of the huge water spout - they must have been so scared.' Despite having never spotted one of the phenomena in the past, Mrs Fillipini witnessed two on the day she took the photos. Intense vortex: The funnel-shaped clouds, composed of water droplets formed by condensation, can pose a threat to boats, swimmers and aircraft . 'I don't think I will ever see anything like it again. It seems to be quite rare, but happens sometimes in the Mediterranean. The tornado lasted around 10 minutes and then disappeared. About 20 minutes later, another appeared to the south, close to another boat. 'This one was even quicker,' Mrs Filippini, a computing company worker living near Paris, France, said.

A burglar whose leg was partially blown off by a homeowner whose house he was trying to ransack has been jailed alongside his accomplice. Robert Richards, 30, had to have his leg amputated after he was shot by retired clock-maker Malcolm White during a bungled break-in. Richards and his accomplice Darren Randall, 26, intended to raid White's rural village house, in which they knew was being grown cannabis worth £18,000. Robert Richards, 30, was shot in the leg after he and Darren Randall, 26, right, broke into a country house . The pair broke into the detached house in the picturesque Worcestershire village of Whitbourne armed with a crowbar, chisel and cable ties, hoping to steal cash and drugs. But the burglary went wrong when Mr White opened fire on the intruders, shooting Roberts in the leg with an illegally-held shotgun. The pair, both from Birmingham, drove to the village of Leigh Sinton eight miles away to seek help for Roberts' injury, and were arrested. Roberts later had his leg amputated. At Wolverhampton Crown Court the hapless duo were sentenced to a total of 23 years following a trial. The court heard how the men broke into the £420,000 house through a ground floor window while the homeowner, Malcolm White, 63, and his partner Josephine Merrick were inside. Mr White went outside and fired a shotgun at the burglars, hitting Richards in the leg. Tranquil rural setting: But Malcolm White's home was found to contain cannabis and firearms . The house in the village of Whitbourne on the Herefordshire/Worcestershire border was the scene of a violent confrontation . While Mr White called the police to report the break-in, which happened in October 2011, Richards and Randall fled the scene before being later arrested by officers. Richards and Randall denied aggravated burglary but were found guilty by a jury last November. Sentencing the pair, His Honour Judge Mithani QC sentenced Richards to 10-and-a-half years in prison and Randall was jailed for 12 years. The court heard how the men broke into the £420,000 house through a ground floor window while Malcolm White (pictured) and his partner Josephine Merrick were inside . Randall also received a 16-month sentence for possessing illegal ammunition and 12 months for the production of cannabis, after ammunition and drugs were found at his home address during the investigation. The additional sentences are to run concurrently with one another, but consecutively to his time for aggravated burglary. Each will have to serve at least half of that time in jail before they will be considered for release on licence. Detective Sergeant Frank Real from Hereford CID said the investigation turned out not to be as straightforward as it initially seemed. He said: 'On attending the home of White and Merrick in Whitbourne, we discovered £18,000 worth of cannabis and a number of firearms and ammunition, which White did not have licences for. 'As the investigation progressed, it became clear that the drugs and money were the motivation for the burglary, but Richards and Randall left empty handed when Richards became injured.' White has pleaded guilty to a number of firearms offences and also the production of cannabis at Worcester Crown Court earlier in 2012. Merrick, a nursery nurse, also pleaded guilty to being concerned in the production of cannabis at the same hearing.  The pair are still awaiting sentencing for these offences. DS Real added: 'This was not an opportunistic burglary but a planned operation carried out by a professional criminal outfit. 'Richards and Randall spent a great deal of time planning this burglary and went to the house in Whitbourne on that evening well prepared with cable ties, balaclavas and gloves with the intention of parting Merrick and White from their possessions. 'Offences like this are extremely unusual in our force area and this has been a highly complex investigation.' After the 2011 raid, police found thousands of pounds worth of cannabis in Malcolm White's home .","Robert Richards, 30,was shot in the leg by Malcolm White, 63, during raid .

Two men who burned down a 400-year-old wedding venue causing £5million worth of damage have been jailed. Disgruntled ex-employee Thomas Richardson, 27, and his 'vulnerable' accomplice Mark Hall, 28, torched a barn at Chilford Hall in Linton, Cambridgeshire, in June last year. Fuelled by alcohol, the pair started a blaze in a 'cruel and calculated attack', destroying the 18th century barn and forcing the cancellation or postponement of more than 100 weddings, Cambridge Crown Court heard. Grudge: Former employee Thomas Richardson, left, recruited Mark Hall, right, to help him burn down Chilford Hall in Linton, Cambridgeshire, three years after he had been sacked for stealing alcohol . It led to members of staff being made redundant and had a knock-on effect on local businesses which relied on the venue for custom. Prosecutor Christopher Morgan said: 'The loss of these buildings and personal items was irreplaceable. It also had a widespread impact on the local economy.' Richardson had been sacked by the venue for stealing alcohol exactly three years before the blaze and had long held a grudge. He had driven autistic Hall to the barn and encouraged him to take part in the arson attack, jurors were told during their trial. Earlier in the evening Richardson told his girlfriend of his plan. She called the fire service to warn them but it was treated as a hoax call. Police found Richardson and Hall after the blaze with bin bags containing several bottles of empty spirits and white tissues soaked in alcohol in a car. Richardson, 27, admitted arson while Hall, 28, was found guilty by a jury after a trial. Both of the men from Haverhill, Suffolk, were cleared of the more serious charge of being reckless as to whether life was endangered. Heartache: Hundreds of couples had to rearrange their big day after the wedding venue was burnt down in June last year . Widespread impact: The court heard how the closure of Chilford Hall had a major impact on the local economy . Judge Gareth Hawkesworth jailed Richardson for five years and four months and Hall for four years. He said: 'Chilford Hall was a family business and a much loved asset within the East Anglia community. 'The . fire started in the dead of night when the venue was deserted but the . owner, Fiona Alper, and her son were asleep a matter of yards away. 'It was only the bravery and dedication of the fire service which prevented damage to their home and danger to them. 'The fire burnt fiercely all night and it wasn't until the next morning that it was fully controlled.' He added that Mrs Alper's husband had died in 2002. Before that he had dedicated himself to building up the business. 'One can barely grasp the trauma you have caused to Mrs Alper and her son in watching his work go up in smoke,"" the judge said. 'This . fire, deliberately set as it was, was a cruel and calculated attack not . only on the Alpers and their employees but the community as a whole.' Mr . Morgan told the court that, as one of the main attractions in a small . village, the fire had a major effect on local businesses. The . year before the fire, the barn spent £539,000 with suppliers, with one . butcher estimating 30% of its income came from the venue. An extensive art collection, built up by Mrs Alper's late husband, Sam, was also destroyed. Adam Budworth, mitigating, said Richardson offered his 'sincerest apologies for such disgraceful behaviour'. He added: 'Whoever started the blaze, there is only one person responsible for burning down the barn and this is Mr Richardson'. Mark Shelley, mitigating on behalf of Hall, said his client had autism and very low IQ. Mr . Shelley added: 'He was not a main mover. He was heavily in drink and . was led by Mr Richardson into going along to the hall and doing what he . did.' Trauma: Owner Mrs Alper and her son had to watch the venue burn to the ground . Damage: An extensive art collection built up by owner Mrs Alper's late husband was also destroyed in the blaze . Speaking after the sentencing, Mrs Alper told the Cambridge News: 'Nothing can change what has happened and the huge loss we have suffered. 'We have been deeply touched by the overwhelming support from the . public. Since the fire we have been working hard to re-establish our . core business and are now looking forward to a bright new future for . Chilford Hall.' Det Con Tracey Griffin, who led the police investigation, said: 'This was a revenge attack by an ex-employee and his accomplice which caused a considerable amount of damage, not to mention the heartache this caused couples who were due to get married at the wedding venue. 'When officers arrived the fire was well lit and the Alper family were still asleep in their beds. The officers woke the family and moved them to a place of safety until firefighters arrived to fight the blaze. 'The fire not only put officers and fire officers in danger but has also had a detrimental effect on the local community and local businesses. 'Thankfully no-one was hurt and I hope today's result sends out a strong message to others of the serious consequences of arson.'","Thomas Richardson, 27, started the blaze at Chilford Hall in Linton, Cambridgeshire, with accomplice Mark Hall, 28, in June last year .

Sisters from the infamous ‘God Hates Gays’ extremist religious hate group, who picket military funerals and high profile events, have apologised for the ‘hurt’ they caused after leaving the family church to start a new life. Megan Phelps-Roper, 27, and her sister Grace, 19, have left the controversial Westboro Baptist Church founded by their grandfather, which saw them holding placards with the words ‘God Hates Fags,’ ‘Fags Doom Nations’ and ‘Thank God for Dead Soldiers', at the funerals of U.S. personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and publicly celebrating when a stranger contracts cancer. Miss Phelps-Roper, who was once called as the ‘future leader’ of the church, has confirmed that after 27 years she has made the decision to leave, effectively being cut off from her family. 'God Hates Fags': Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Phelps-Roper (pictured back row, right with other members and documentary maker Louis Theroux) has left the church, known for holding placards with controversial, anti-gay messages . She wrote on blog platform medium.com on Wednesday: ‘Up until now, our names have been synonymous with “God Hates Fags”. ‘We know that we’ve done and said things that hurt people. Inflicting pain on others wasn’t the goal, but it was one of the outcomes. We wish it weren’t so, and regret that hurt. ‘We know that we dearly love our family.

He said at the time: ‘I’ve always been fascinated by this organisation. They operate as a cult, but are pretty unique in that they have allowed the media, and me, in. Yet after our first programme, two of the children of the family left the church, and contacted me. ‘I’m not claiming they left because of the programme, but it was obviously a factor. I was curious to go back, to see why.’ Exodus: Former member Libby Phelps Alvarez, 29, recently spoke about her departure from the church and starting her new life which did not restrict her from having a haircut, traveling and being confined to the borders of the U.S .","Megan Phelps-Roper, 27, and her sister Grace, 19, have left the church .

During the riots of 2011, Leslie Austin turned Good Samaritan as others looted shops and vandalised property. He led an elderly woman to safety and searched a smoke-filled building for trapped inhabitants, with police thanking him for his efforts three times. But, despite his public-spirited bravery, Mr Austin suffered months of misery after the Metropolitan Police mistakenly put his photograph on a ‘Wanted’ poster – and failed to remove it despite numerous complaints. Wrongly wanted: Leslie Austin, 49, pictured in the Metropolitan Police wanted poster that wrongly identified him as a rioter . Now the 49-year-old has launched a libel case against the police, seeking up to £50,000 in damages for what he says was a serious smear on his character which almost cost him his job and led to him enduring abuse. Mr Austin, from Hackney, East London, has served on a number of voluntary bodies as well as working for Hackney Homes, helping to manage council estates. According to his legal claim, submitted at the High Court, he had just finished work one day in early August, 2011, when one of the worst waves of riots Britain had seen for years began. Unable to drive home from work because of the disorder, Mr Austin set off on foot. Claim: He has launched a libel case against the Metropolitan Police, seeking up to £50,000 in damages for what he says was a serious smear on his character which almost cost him his job and led to him enduring abuse . When he saw a distressed woman in her 70s from one of the council estates he managed, he helped her to find her way home through the turmoil. He then spotted a bus driver, whose vehicle had been attacked by rioters, who was unable to drive on because of debris in the road. Mr Austin reassured him and moved the obstacles. As the riot grew in intensity he saw a terrified woman clutching a baby in the window of a building as a torched car burned outside. Realising she feared the flames would spread, he went in to help. Once she was safely outside he scoured the premises, despite thickening smoke making breathing difficult, banging on doors to see if anyone needed to evacuate. According to his legal claim: ‘On three separate occasions police officers thanked him for his assistance.’ But although Mr Austin escaped any injury, he says his real ordeal was yet to begin – when at the start of May 2012 the police issued a ‘Wanted’ poster with his photograph on it. Under the heading ‘Identity Sought’, it declared: ‘Police in Hackney are appealing for the public’s help in identifying those involved in the disorder during August 2011.’ Mr Austin’s photograph was featured among those of a number of suspects. But he only found out when he went into a Tesco and an assistant told him he was pictured on a poster in the foyer. His image was also on the police website, where it remained for six weeks. Bravery: Mr Austin was praised on several occasions for his acts of bravery during the London riots in 2011 . Alarmed, he swiftly visited Hackney police station to make clear his actions during the riots. Mr Austin claims he was told the posters would be removed within two hours, and after his bosses demanded proof of his innocence, officers provided a letter making clear he was eliminated from inquiries. Detective Sergeant Ian Coleman said at the time: ‘The public-spirited attitude of this member of the public is outstanding and I apologise on behalf of the Met for any distress caused.’ Yet Mr Austin says the ‘Wanted’ image remained on display for more than three months, until a year after the riots. It also appeared in a local newspaper. He is seeking damages of up to £50,000 for libel and an injunction to stop police publishing any more defamatory allegations against him.

There were reports the teenager had been dangling over the balcony before plummeting two floors. Shock: Paramedics treating two people injured when one fell onto the other at Westfield Stratford . Dozens of police and security guards cleared the area ‘within minutes’. Despite the massive force of the impact, both men – whose names have not yet been released – survived and were taken to hospital, where their condition last night was described as stable. The drama unfolded outside the Party Fiesta store in the East London mall on Thursday afternoon. The teenager, from nearby Newham, was spotted on the balcony by shop staff as the other man, from Great Dunmow in Essex, walked below. Lucian Cosme, 29, an assistant at the iPlayNTalk mobile phone shop, said: ‘We could see the man holding onto the barrier and his body was dangling over the side. ‘I saw him for a second and then he fell. I heard a loud noise, like an explosion. ‘He was lying on the ground, his jeans were ripped from the impact and he had fallen onto a white man who had his wife with him. She was obviously really scared and was crying. He definitely jumped.’ Incident: Police were called to the scene after stunned shoppers saw the man fall from the upper floor and land on the pedestrian at about 3.30pm yesterday . Stunned: Store security guard Lakhdar Segar described hearing groans of pain after the falling teenager landed on a 47-year-old man walking below . A shop assistant at Party Fiesta said: ‘I heard a loud crash like a car crash.  Everybody started screaming and shouting. I went outside and saw a big black guy, he had fallen and hit a man. ‘The white man was moving but the black man was totally unconscious. The man who was hit was with his wife. She was really upset, crying and shaken up.’ The shop assistant said a doctor who was shopping with his baby rushed to help. He said: ‘The man who was hit was obviously in a lot of pain and was touching his shoulder. The other man was around 6ft, and he was broad and stocky. If you get hit by him it is going to really hurt. ‘The doctor rushed over and helped to treat the men while he still had his baby in one hand. It was lucky for both of them he was walking past.’ Investigation: Police have said inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident . The two men were taken to Royal London Hospital to be treated for their injuries . Lara Ferrer, 32, who works at the David and Goliath clothes shop, said: ‘I heard a loud noise and looked out. I saw a black man lying totally still. The last thing I saw, he was being stretchered off. ‘He was in a neck brace and had fastenings on his body to stop him moving.’ After the men were taken to The Royal London Hospital, officers cordoned off the area.

Dinosaurs vanished earlier than previously thought and 'within a gnat's eyebrow' of the cataclysmic meteor impact blamed for their extinction, say scientists. Corrected dates for both events suggest they occurred almost at the same time, around 66million years ago. Previous studies indicated that the impact pre-dated the death of the dinosaurs by as much as 300,000 years. Previous studies suggested that a cataclysmic meteor pre-dated the death of dinosaurs by as much as 300,000 years - but new research shows they occurred within 33,000 years of each other . The disaster was probably the 'final straw' for the dinosaurs but may not have been the only reason the reptiles which ruled the world for more than 150million years died out, scientists believe. A 110-mile crater in the Caribbean off the coast of Mexico marks the spot where a six-mile-wide object, either an asteroid or comet, smashed into the Earth. Clues to the event remain in the form of iridium-enriched dust, glassy spheres and shocked quartz that was spread around the planet. Scientists used new radioactive dating techniques to determine both the date of the impact and that of the dinosaurs' extinction. The research, published in the journal Science, shows they occurred within 33,000 years of each other. A 110-mile crater in the Caribbean off the coast of Mexico marks the spot where a six-mile-wide object, either an asteroid or comet, smashed into the Earth . Lead scientist Professor Paul Renne, from the University of California at Berkeley, U.S., said: 'The impact was clearly the final straw that pushed Earth past the tipping point. 'We have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat's eyebrow, and therefore the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions, but it probably wasn't just the impact.' Dramatic climate fluctuations over the previous million years, including long cold snaps, may have brought many creatures to the brink of extinction before the meteor struck, he said. 'These precursory phenomena made the global ecosystem much more sensitive to even small triggers, so that what otherwise might have been a fairly minor effect shifted the ecosystem into a new state,' Prof Renne added. 'The impact was the coup de grace.' The researchers also concluded that the Earth's atmospheric carbon cycle returned to normal within about 5,000 years of the impact. In contrast, it took between one and two million years for the oceans to recover.","110-mile crater off Mexico marks spot where 6mile-wide object hit Earth .

A super-fit teenager died in her sleep from an undiagnosed heart condition just days before her parents learned she had gained six A* grades and four As in her GCSEs. Alex Reid’s parents were given her outstanding results after the 16-year-old died, an inquest heard. On the day of her death, the part-time model had gone with her mother to buy a dress and jewellery for her school prom. She then baked cupcakes with her younger sister before bedtime. Alex’s father, a GP, found her body the next morning and fought in vain to save her until paramedics took over and declared her dead. In a statement read at the hearing in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, Mr Reid, 52, said he realised something was wrong when his daughter was not up at 6.30am as usual. ‘I knocked on the bedroom door expecting her to be up but she was still in bed,’ he said. ‘I shook Alex but there was no response. She was a pale blue colour. I couldn’t feel a pulse and her pupils were dilated.’ He and Mrs Reid, 51, began CPR on their daughter on the bedroom floor while Alex’s sister Jennifer, 15, phoned for an ambulance. Paramedics arrived at the family’s home near Worksop, Nottinghamshire, but Alex could not be revived.

She did not appear to have any problems and had a positive attitude and wanted to go to Newcastle University to study medicine.’ The keen skier was one of the fittest pupils at her independent, all-girls school, had swum for the City of Sheffield Swimming Club and played netball at county level.

Her neighbour, a policeman, had a look at the shell and confirmed it was a bomb before calling the police. Three officers arrived to inspect the device, a 29mm Spigot Mortar - also known as a Blacker Bombard - and contacted a Royal Navy bomb disposal team.

Incredible new images from the surface of Mars have provided a new glimpse into the NASA mission, including more possible evidence that there was once water on the on the Red Planet. They are the latest in a series of snaps from the Martian landscape that have come courtesy of the Curiosity rover, which has been on the planet since August 5. The new photos came on the heels of an incredible photo from Mars' surface that appeared to be a flower blooming among the rocks. Scratching the surface: An image from the Curiosity rover's Mast Camera shows the surface of the planet with inclined layering known as cross-bedding . Rock steady: This image released by NASA shows the flat area of Mars where Curiosity will conduct its first drilling site . A piece of bright material can be seen to the left of this image captured by NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars . But those hoping the flower would unlock evidence of life on other planets may be saddened to learn that the 'Martian flower' is nothing more than another rock. The space agency said on Monday that the 'flower' was a particularly shiny piece of sediment in the area. Some of the images show veins in the rock that may hold clues to history of water on Mars. Meanwhile, scientists have zeroed in on a target area for Curiosity to begin drilling: A rock outcrop as flat as a pool table that's expected to yield fresh insight into the red planet's history. Running a bit behind schedule, Curiosity was due to arrive at the site in the next several days. After an inspection of the surroundings, the car-size rover will test its drill for the first time 'probably in the next two weeks,' project manager Richard Cook of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Tuesday. Water works? Curiosity drives toward a flat rock with pale veins that may indicate the presence of water on the planet . Exploring: This photo provided by NASA shows well-defined veins filled with whitish minerals, which are believed to be calcium sulfate - a white mineral that's common on Earth . The highly anticipated drilling has been billed as the most complex engineering task since the acrobatic landing inside a Martian crater last summer. Curiosity is on a quest to determine whether environmental conditions could have been favorable for microbes. By boring into a rock and transferring the powder to the rover's onboard chemistry lab and other instruments, scientists should get a better understanding of the region's mineral and chemical makeup. 'We're thrilled, and we can't wait to get drilling,' said project scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology. Previous rovers Opportunity and Spirit carried a grinding tool that peeled away rock layers. Rocky road: The rover's next task will be to drill into the surface of the planet . Curiosity is capable of drilling down several inches to collect a sample from the interior - a first on Mars. Opportunity is still operating on the surface of Mars, but Spirit lost contact with Earth in 2010. Since the $2.5billion Curiosity mission launched in 2011, engineers have been troubleshooting an issue with the rover's drill in which flakes of Teflon can break off and get mixed with the rock samples. Cook said the contamination should not affect the mission.'We are reasonably confident that it's something that we'll be able to work our way around,' he said. As the most high-tech interplanetary rover, Curiosity has been on a slow streak since its action-packed arrival. Grotzinger said the pace of the mission was '100 per cent discovery-driven' and can't be rushed. The NASA Curiosity rover used to capture the image of the flower-like substance on Mars . Already, Curiosity has lingered longer than expected at its current location because scientists have been captivated by the sedimentary rocks that differ from the pebbles found at the landing site. After some last-minute studies, the rover will head to the rock outcrop dubbed 'John Klein' after a mission team member who died in 2011. Curiosity's ultimate goal is to drive to the base of Mount Sharp, a six-month journey with no stops. The plan is to begin the road trip after drilling is complete with pauses along the way.","So called ‘Martian-flower’ captured by NASA’s Curiosity rover appears to be .

To adapt one of the most famous lines in British TV comedy: ‘Don’t mention that we won the war’. The Government is said to be against a series of celebratory events for commemorations from next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War - in order to avoid upsetting Germany. War author Sebastian Faulks said the tone of events must be ‘modest, inclusive and reverential of others’ - while a source on the planning team said ministers are keen ‘not to upset the Germans’. Thoughts: War author Sebastian Faulks (left) said the tone of events must be ‘modest, inclusive and reverential of others’. British troops negotiate a trench during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 (right) in the First World War . ‘Celebration is completely the wrong note, certainly for 2014, although it might be more relevant in 2018,’ Mr Faulks, who wrote the 1993 First World War novel Birdsong, told The Sunday Times. ‘A degree of humility is needed, initially particularly, as this was an avoidable calamity.’ Other committee members believe the Government should commemorate at least one battle to show why Britain went to war - instead of highlighting the slaughter of a war that cost 16million lives. Respected First World War historian Professor Sir Hew Strachan said the events should be a mixture of victory celebrations and commemorations of lost lives. He told The Sunday Times: ‘Germany has almost as great a sense of guilt about this war as it does about the Second World War. ‘Therefore we don’t put ourselves in the wrong in German eyes by opposing German imperialism, by opposing the Kaiser’s regime.’ Days gone by: Crowds celebration VE Day in 1995 in London, 50 years after the end of the Second World War . German leaders are scheduled to attend many ceremonies with the Allies – including memorial events to mark the declaration of war in August 2014 and the Battle of Gallipoli in 2015. The Battle of the Somme will be marked in July 2016 and Passchendaele in 2017, reported The Sunday Times. The events will end with the Armistice Day centenary in November 2018. Meanwhile the British Commission for Military History wants Andrew Murrison, who is handling the centenary events for Prime Minister David Cameron, to include the Battle of Amiens. A spokesman for the group of military historians said the junior defence minister should consider the August 1918 battle, which marked the end of the Western Front stalemate. The BBC has insisted that it will mark the occasion with ‘a wide range of programming’ and it ‘will not be politically correct coverage’.

Hoax: Mel Greig and Michael Christian of 2Day FM in Sydney went into hiding and received death threats following the phone call last month to King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, central London . Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate’s ward, was found dead in nurses’ housing three days later, prompting a huge backlash against Miss Greig and Mr Christian.

Mel and MC returning to work when the time is right, in roles that make . full use of their talents,’ Austereo chief executive Rhys Holleran told . Agence France-Presse. He added that the network will discuss future roles with the presenters ‘when they are ready’. Tragic: Jacintha Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate's ward, was found dead in nurses' housing three days after the call . Miss Greig and Mr Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in the call, which led Austereo to suspend prank calls by all of its radio stations and saw both presenters make a tearful apology on TV for their actions. An investigation into the call by Australia's media watchdog is underway, and Scotland Yard has also launched a probe. But the pair are thought to be unlikely to face prosecution. Ms Saldanha's grieving husband and two teenage children clutched each other last month as they gathered with hundreds of mourners in a small town in India for her funeral. Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.' The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'. In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy. Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life. 'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through.

Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened. 'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.' Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank. They went into hiding after receiving threats while at least eight other senior staff members at the 2Day FM radio station and its parent company, SCAustereo, were also under protection of security guards. One of the letters sent to Mr Christian was littered with foul language and is alleged to have warned him that there was a bullet with his name on it along with mentions of a shotgun.","Mel Greig and Michael Christian are still employed by network Austereo .

The Queen's closest aides are to be publicly grilled by MPs to justify her spending, the Mail can reveal. Members of Prince Charles’s inner circle will also give evidence to Parliament about whether they are wasting taxpayers’ money. The amount of public funds going to the Royal Family soared last year, despite Government cuts. Now the most powerful watchdog in Westminster, the Public Accounts Committee, will scrutinise royal finances to ensure the country is getting value for money. Value for money: The finances of Queen Elizabeth II, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh during her Diamond Jubilee Pageant, will be scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee . Committee sources say the MPs, chaired by former Labour minister Margaret Hodge, will hold hearings into the money paid to Prince Charles, before moving on to the Crown Estates, the £7billion property empire from which the Queen derives her income. In April, Buckingham Palace will receive a payment of £36.1million of public money to fund the Queen’s official duties, a 16 per cent increase on the £31million paid by taxpayers to finance the Monarchy last year. Public funding to support Prince Charles rose by 11 per cent last year, taking the contribution from the taxpayer to almost £2.2million. His spending rose by 3.6 per cent to more than £20.2million. The unprecedented Parliamentary probe will mean that Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse – effectively the Queen’s treasurer – will face being questioned in front of the television cameras. Sir Christopher Geidt and William Nye, the private secretaries to the Queen and Prince Charles who usually operate behind the scenes, could also be called to give evidence. ‘The plan is to do the Prince of Wales first and then look at the Queen,’ a source told the Mail. ‘We need to be sure when other public services are being cut that there is value for money.’ The committee will focus on the Queen’s use of public money to perform her official duties, including official receptions, investitures, garden parties and maintenance of the royal palaces. She pays for the running of her household from private income. But it will also look at Prince Charles and Prince William’s travel arrangements. The £2.2million extra Clarence House received last year was primarily spent on overseas tours. But critics claim some of the money goes on private visits. The inquiry has come about because of a change this year in the way the Royal Family is funded.Chancellor George Osborne has scrapped the Civil List – an annual handout to the Royal Family that had to be approved by Parliament since 1760 – in favour of paying the Monarch 15 per cent of the income from the Crown Estates assets, which include Regent Street and Ascot racecourse. But a second part of the deal – enacted into law in 2011 – means the royal finances are now subject to scrutiny by the National Audit Office. And now the Public Accounts Committee is set to take up its option of holding public hearings into the Royal Family’s funding. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he backed the move to give Parliament scrutiny of the Queen’s expenses as long as it was ‘proportionate’. He added: ‘It would be unreasonable to examine the Queen’s private sources of income and expenditure. Labour MP Austin Mitchell, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘It is about ensuring that the public are getting good value for money. At the moment there is no accountability for spending what is a considerable fortune.’","Buckingham Palace will receive £36.1m to fund the Queen's official duties .

The former media director for Syracuse University's athletic department pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he secretly filmed at least 108 athletes taking post-game showers. Roger Springfield was arraigned in Onondaga County Court on four counts of unlawful surveillance. He was released on his own recognizance and ordered to return to court January 22 for a pretrial hearing. Charges: Roger Springfield, left, the former media director for Syracuse University's athletic department, and his lawyer, James McGraw, right, walk into Onondaga County Court in Syracuse . Prosecutors said the charges stem from at least four secret videos the 57-year-old Springfield made between the spring of 2010 and November 2012 in the Carrier Dome. Authorities said Springfield made the videos in the locker rooms of the football team and the men's lacrosse and soccer teams. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the investigation began after a Syracuse employee noticed 'clearly inappropriate material' on an 'exceptionally long' segment of locker-room footage on a video from Syracuse's football game against South Florida on October 27 in Tampa, Florida.

Fitzpatrick said the charges stemmed from videos that included the Louisville football game on November 10, a soccer game last year and two lacrosse games in 2010. Authorities have identified 108 victims, all of them male athletes. Fitzpatrick said there is no evidence that Springfield disseminated the recordings or still images to anyone else. There also is no evidence that Springfield engaged in any inappropriate sexual contact with any of the athletes, the district attorney said. Filming: Authorities said Springfield made the videos in the locker rooms of the football team and the men's lacrosse and soccer teams . Authorities said at least 10 other videos were found, including one made in Massachusetts and one shot in Akron, Ohio, but they fell outside the statute of limitations. Syracuse police are still investigating, police Chief Frank Fowler said. Fitzpatrick said investigators quickly discounted the fact that the footage might have been accidental. 'You can see him setting up the camera, and it appears from the evidence uncovered that he placed the camera at waist level and used a piece of tape to conceal the red light on top of the camera indicating it was on and working,' Fitzpatrick said. 'This is in no stretch of the imagination a victimless crime.' Syracuse has reached out to all student-athletes involved to offer them support and assistance, said Kevin Quinn, senior vice president for public affairs.

Doctors failed to spot that Elizabeth Hart had a retained placenta after she gave birth to daughter Poppy . A mother has described her suffering after bungling medics left her placenta inside her – for two agonising months. Elizabeth Hart, 30, says doctors failed to spot the potentially fatal complication when she gave birth to daughter Poppy. In the eight weeks that followed, her battle with constant pain and exhaustion left her unable to breastfeed. But she claims that doctors at Queen’s Hospital in Romford, Essex, weren’t interested in her plight – and even refused to examine her when she went to A&E. In desperation, she eventually booked an appointment with a private gynaecologist, who told her that she had not  delivered the placenta and it had become infected inside her. She said: ‘I was really ill [after the birth]. I was sent back to Queen’s two weeks later and they admitted me to the gynaecology ward. ‘I told the gynaecologist how ill I’d been and she wasn’t interested. The doctor at my eight-week check-up wasn’t interested either. ‘I was in lower-back and stomach agony and I didn’t have any energy. I’d tried to breastfeed, but I was too exhausted. ‘I didn’t bond with my daughter because I felt so ill and I had a bit of post-natal depression as a result. It made a big impact on my life.’ She has now set up a charity to support expectant mothers. ‘I don’t want this to happen to someone else,’ she said. The placenta normally separates from the uterine wall during delivery and is expelled from the vagina within 30 minutes after giving birth. If part or all of it fails to be delivered, the uterus can't contract and close off all the necessary blood vessels. This means it will continue to bleed and it can lead to infection. In extreme cases this haemorrhage can cause death, so it's extremely important that tissue is removed. If the doctor is unable to do this by hand then surgery is needed. ‘My aim is to build a network of . midwives, social workers and mums with their own stories to help and . guide women who are struggling.’ The make-up and hair designer, from . Romford, said doctors at Queen’s Hospital had mentioned the condition . ‘retained placenta’ anecdotally but did not diagnose her with it . following Poppy’s birth last June. Retained placenta is potentially . life-threatening if left untreated because it carries a high risk of . infection or internal bleeding. A spokesman for Queen’s Hospital . said: ‘I am sorry if Ms Hart is unhappy with the care she received. We . have not received a complaint from Ms Hart, but would be happy to look . into her concerns if she would like to contact us.’ On the website she has set up, Miss . Hart explained that she struggled to breastfeed Poppy because her blood . count was half what it should be. A spokesman from Queen's Hospital in Romford, said: 'I am sorry if Ms Hart is unhappy with the care she received' ‘After having Poppy, I felt seriously ill,’ she said. ‘However, the hospital and  my own GP . told me there was nothing wrong with me, and that it was normal to feel . like this after giving birth. In fact, after my GP told me that I had . an alarming amount of white blood cells, I paid privately to get to the . bottom of the problem. ‘The only issue health visitors or gynaecologists from the NHS seemed to care about was that I was not breastfeeding. ‘The fact that I could not breastfeed because I was so unwell didn’t occur to them.’ Ms Hart has set up a non-for profit organisation to support women having problems during pregnancy or as new mothers.

The in-depth picture shows clusters of unsightly damage under 30-year old Kelly Hughes' features which can lead to cancer.

Experts hope that their campaign will . help highlight the dangers of sunbeds to youngsters, who are often . inspired by shows such as The Only Way Is Essex to get a permatan. This UV scan shows that after 14 years of using sunbeds, 30-year-old Kelly Hughes has clusters of unsightly pockmarks which can lead to cancer . Kelly started using sunbeds at the local gym when she was 16 to maintain a holiday glow. She said the results of the scan were shocking . UV rays from sunbeds or over-exposure to the sun can damage the skin's DNA and, over time, this damage can build up and lead to skin cancer . Kelly, an account manager from Beaconsfield, Bucks, said: 'I started using sunbeds at the local gym when I was 16 to maintain that holiday feel . 'I would have more sessions in the winter as I did not want to look pale - my skin is freckly and moley so I knew I could be at risk of skin cancer but did not really want to think about that. 'When I look back at my university years I was tanned pretty much all the time. The results of the scan were a shocker. I was the oldest girl there and the UV damage was much worse than the others. 'It really made me think. It was scary. I have not had any sunbeds since - not for Christmas parties and not for New Year. I have been looking online for a bronzer.' Skin expert Dr Askari Townshend, who reviewed the X-rays, said: 'Kelly has easily the greatest degree of damage. Clusters of speckled areas are seen . right across the face. Her top lip has escaped but the cheeks, bridge of . nose, sides of face and forehead have not. It's hoped the campaign will highlight the dangers of sunbeds to youngsters often wanting to emulate the tans of The Only Way Is Essex stars, such as Sam Faiers (left) and Mark Wright and Lauren Goodger . This month Cancer Research UK is raising awareness of the danger of sunbed use with a campaign entitled 'R UV UGLY', backed by leading skin specialists sk:n clinics. Fine and coarse wrinkles are seen on sun damaged skin. It may also become patchy, or mottled darker patches of increased pigmentation may appear. Sometimes these patches become irregular and produce what are known as lentigos. In areas around the back of the neck, a leathery texture and coarseness with deep lines is frequently seen, the skin may feel dry and scaly. Chronic sun exposure will also produce a thickened layer in the upper dermis known as solar elastosis, which gives a yellowish chicken skin look. The initiative aims to stave off the temptation to hit the sunbeds this winter by showing the ugly truth beneath the tan. Figures show using a sunbed just once or more a month could increase the chance of developing skin cancer by 50 per cent. Malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is the second most common cancer amongst 15 to 34 year olds. The campaign will see experts touring shopping centres with the machines, which offer in depth images of faces, to let people see first-hand how damaged their skin might be. It calls on people across the nation to face the damage, often invisible to the naked eye, being inflicted on their skin in pursuit of a tan, by offering free skin assessments at sk:n clinics across England. The skin scan highlights such things . as pigmentation and premature wrinkles, caused by overexposure to UV . rays from sunbeds, a turn off for all young women worried about their . appearance. Cancer . Research UK's senior health campaigns manager Caroline Cerny said: 'We . are glad to be bringing R UV UGLY back to England this February. The initiative aims to stave off the temptation to hit the sunbeds this winter by exposing the often unnoticed, long-term skin damage sunbeds can cause . 'We have seen many young people know about the risks of sunbed use, but still believe they make them look and feel better. 'Working with sk:n, this initiative will allow people to see the cosmetic damage from sunbed use, showing every time someone uses a sunbed they are damaging their skin, making it look worse in the long run and making skin coarse, leathery and wrinkled. 'No one wants to look older before their time, so we hope the skin scan will really help to change people's minds about using sunbeds. Spokesman David Djukic said: 'You may look perfectly fine on the surface but what the scanner does is show up what is going on underneath. 'Our model in the picture is just a member of the public who had been using sunbeds not even that much. Obviously, she was horrified, and is not using them any more. As well as the public being able to . visit sk:n clinics, Cancer Research UK will be taking R UV UGLY on tour . this month at major shopping centres in Sheffield, Manchester, .

UK sales of the new generation of BlackBerry smartphones have been better than expected with one model already selling out, the company's chief executive has said. Thorsten Heins hailed the success of his company's latest devices and said he is confident that Blackberry can make up ground lost to Apple and Android. The new phones were launched in the UK just last week, after excruciating delays allowed Apple, Samsung and others to build commanding leads in the industry. 'It's beyond expectations': BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured at the launch of BlackBerry 10 in New York last week, says the UK release of the company's new phones has gone better than they planned . Mr Heins said a substantial number of UK users are moving from other platforms to BlackBerry and said that is an encouraging sign because they first targeted long-time BlackBerry users. 'It's beyond expectations,' he said. 'White is sold out already. The black is hard to stock up again. It's very encouraging. 'I won't share the number because I need to verify it, but we are getting a substantial number of users moving from other platforms to BlackBerry. That is an interesting data point.' BlackBerry shares closed up 15 per cent yesterday on initial reports of strong UK sales and after an analyst upgraded the stock. That came after a 12 per cent fall in value immediately following the launch. But Mr Heins admitted the real struggle for the revamped company, formerly known as Research In Motion, will come with the U.S. launch slated for mid-March. BlackBerry's Z10: Mr Heins said a substantial number of UK users are moving from other platforms to BlackBerry . He told the Associated Press that he was disappointed that the U.S. release date lags so far behind other markets, a result of the rigid testing systems of authorities and phone networks there. 'We need to respect that. Am I a bit disappointed? Yeah, I would be lying saying no. But it is what it is and we're working with all our carrier partners to speed it up as much as we can,' he said in the interview. Mr Heins said they have to retake market share in the US for BlackBerry to be successful. The US has been one market in which RIM has been struggling, even as the company is doing well in many places overseas. According to research firm IDC, shipments of BlackBerry phones plummeted from 46 per cent of the US market in 2008 to just 2 per cent in 2012. The iPhone and Android now dominate. Mr Heins, who a year ago replaced long-time executives who had presided over BlackBerry's fall, said he is confident that BlackBerry can become the third ecosystem behind Apple and phones running Google's Android operating system. 'We need to win back market share to be relevant,' he said. 'We have to be aggressive in the US market.' The new BlackBerrys are a make-or-break product. The pioneering brand, once a business essential, lost its cachet not long after Apple's 2007 release of the iPhone, which reset expectations for what a smartphone should do. The company promised a new system to catch up, using technology it got through its 2010 purchase of QNX Software Systems. But it has taken more than two years to unveil new phones that are redesigned for the new multimedia, internet browsing and apps experience that customers are now demanding. BlackBerry's new Z10 handsets do not have a home button, instead using a user's thumb to 'flick' across the screen. They also have a new 'peek' feature that allows owners to see their email and other messages from anywhere in the phone's menu system by swiping from the left of the screen. The firm also said it had worked to create the 'best typing experience' of any handset. The new BlackBerry 10 OS also boasts a new feature called balance to switch between a personal and business mode - each with its own applications, wallpaper and settings. 'People run around with two phones, a private one and a personal one,' said Mr Heins at the launch last week. 'We wanted to address that, and people can switch with a single flick.' He said the new handsets were for 'people who are hyper-connected socially, who need balance in both personal and professional lives. 'People who want to flow, who don't want a home button. Blackberry 10 will keep them moving.'","Thorsten Heins claims the white BlackBerry Z10 is already sold out .

It's only the earliest of early birds and the most nocturnal of night owls that will get to take advantage of the UK's speediest broadband... at 4am. That ungodly hour is the best time to surf the internet, according to a survey which shows there is only a small window of opportunity to enjoy the maximum speeds touted by providers. It found when the clock rolls around to the 9pm post-dinner primetime, demand on services like streaming video and music slows broadband connections by up to two-thirds. Night owl: If you want to get up to enjoy the UK's best broadband speeds at 4am it will still be dark at this time of year. By 9pm speeds slow by as much as 60 per cent in some parts of the country . That means most people are only able to get the connection speed promised by their internet provider at a time when they are fast asleep in bed. The study by price comparison site uSwitch.com based on more than 2.3 million consumer speed tests over the past six months revealed that it is the nation’s insomniacs and early risers that get the best speeds. With average download speeds falling by as much as 60 per cent during peak times in some parts of the UK, the busy evening hours are actually the slowest time of the day to go online. The research showed that the average connection speed in Britain's biggest towns and cities is a nimble 14.83Mbps at 4am, but that slows 28 per cent on average by 9pm, leaving users with just 10.72Mpbs of bandwidth. The slowdowns are caused when thousands of other internet users nearby all log on at once, stretching the capacity of broadband infrastructure to its limit. The survey also showed that there were massive differences between regions. Source: uSwitch . Residents of Birmingham and Middlesbrough enjoy the fastest evening broadband speeds, experiencing 12.88Mbps and 12.87Mbps at 9pm respectively. But spare a thought for those broadband users in Aberdeen and Swansea who have to make do with speeds of just 6.08Mbps and 6.99Mbps respectively at peak times – half the speed of the fastest cities. Slow: Internet users can wait much longer to access content during peak hours as thousands of users logging on strains broadband infrastructure . Meanwhile, broadband users in Stoke-On-Trent experience the most consistent broadband throughout the day, with speeds between 4am and 9pm only dropping by 0.7 per cent. The difference in broadband speeds during peak and off-peak times is most significant in heavily built up towns and cities, due to a greater demand on services. For example, at 4am in Dudley, average broadband speeds are a super-fast 31.81Mbps. But at 9pm, they drop by 60% to 12.62Mbps. Just eight miles away, Walsall residents are also suffering from unpredictable speeds. The drop off between 4am and 9pm is a staggering 51 per cent. Neighbouring Bolton and Huddersfield are also seeing some of the biggest variations in broadband speeds between off-peak and peak times – of 57 per cent and 51 per cent respectively. Julia Stent, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, says: 'This research shows the incredible strain that is placed on broadband when everyone logs on at the same time, particularly in densely populated areas. 'And the big rise in streaming and downloading – be that films for our tablets, or games for our smartphones – means that striving to deliver consistent speeds will be a long, hard slog for broadband providers. 'It certainly explains why some people may never actually feel like their connection is as fast as the one promised by providers when they signed. 'The obvious solution of setting your alarm at 4am to use the internet is far from practical. 'Instead, run an online speed test at home to check that you are getting the best possible service available in your area. If you think you could do better, consider shopping around for a new deal.'","By 9pm peak time speeds in some areas slow by as much as 60 per cent .

A jewellery company has used 3D printing to create personalised Pez dispensers - allowing owners to get sweets from inside their own head. Popular in the U.S. but originally from Austria, Pez candy is well known for the mechanical dispensers it comes packaged in which are topped with the heads of pop culture icons. Pulling back the head at the top of the packet dispenses a sweet, which appears to emerge from mouth or beneath the chin of the character featured. Is there nothing you can't print? A Canadian firm has used theirs to create personalised Pez dispensers . The personalised Pez dispenser hack was the work of Canadian firm Hot Pop Factory, who had been asked to come up with a unique and innovative Christmas gift for one of their client's employees. Specialists in 3D printing, Toronto-based Hot Pop Factory generally focus on designing low-cost jewellery with elaborate, geometric designs. But the versatility of their equipment meant they were able to use it to remix the iconic Pez sweet dispensers with 3D scanned doubles of the workers' heads. Cannibalised: Once the heads were 3D printed, the makers exchanged them with the heads on retail Pez packs . It's me! One of the clients holds up her personalised Pez dispenser . Using an Xbox Kinect controller, they took a 3D scan of each of the people they were making the products for, pretending to carry out a mysterious 'research' project so as not to give the game away. They then used computer aided design software to clean up the scans and add the fitting for the Pez dispenser, before feeding the files to their Makerbot Replicator 3D printer. Finally, they cannibalised a bunch of retail Pez packs, pulling off the Disney princess heads and replacing them with their unique, personalised ones. They were a hit. 'We could not have imagined a better reaction! Big smiles and laughs all around,' said a post on the company blog.","Jewellery firm uses 3D printer to make the dispensers for client's workers .

US Vice President Joe Biden today raised fresh concerns about Britain leaving the European Union as he flew into meet David Cameron and Nick Clegg. Mr Biden arrived in Downing Street on the last leg of a tour of Europe, and attended meetings with the two coalition party leaders. The prospect of closer trade links between the EU and the US was on the agenda after Mr Cameron’s promise of an in-out referendum raised fears in the White House that America’s closest ally was risking severing ties with Brussels. Scroll down for video . US Vice President Joe Biden met David Cameron in Downing Street today . The two men discussed the prospect of a trade deal between the US and the European Union, amid concern in the White House that Britain could sever ties with Brussels . Mr Biden said the White House view was that the UK was ‘stronger as a result of its membership’ of the EU. ‘And we believe the EU is stronger with the UK's involvement,’ he said in an interview with The Times. Last month President Barack Obama told Mr Cameron that the US ‘values a strong UK in a strong European Union’. Mr Clegg did not mention the issue directly as he welcomed Mr Biden to Number 10 - though he did hail the prospect on progress towards a US/EU trade deal. Mr Biden also met Deputy PM Nick Clegg, and joked that the pair usually only see each other via video calls . Mr Biden attended a meeting of the National Security Council in the No.10 Cabinet room. He sat between Mr Clegg and Home Secretary Theresa May . Mr Clegg told Mr Biden: ‘It’s great to see you again. We’re going to discuss a lot of things. 'Foreign policy challenges which we share and work together on, whether it’s our common endeavour in Afghanistan, the challenges in north Africa, the issue of Iran or the urgent and ongoing need to make progress on the Middle East peace process. ‘And also we’ll be discussing the prospects for a transatlantic free trade agreement between Europe – the EU – and the United States, which is something that has been talked about a lot for many, many years, but it’s been an elusive project to get going. ‘But if we can work together to overcome the obstacles on both sides of the Atlantic, I’m absolutely sure that it will be, we’re all sure it will be something that will create a significant boost to prosperity and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.’ Mr Biden joked about his swearing in as Vice President for a second time, telling Mr Cameron: 'It was easy, nothing to it' Asked whether Mr Cameron would use the opportunity of today's visit to outline his position on Europe to the vice president, the PM's official spokesman said: ‘They will certainly be discussing EU/US trade. ‘As I understand it, the US position that the administration has expressed is a strong, outward-looking EU with a strong Britain inside that. That is very much our position.’ On international issues, the PM and vice president were expected to ‘discuss our shared agenda around international co-operation and how the UK and US continue to work closely together on a whole series of issues’, said the spokesman. Mr Biden joked that he usually only spoke to his British counterpart via video phone. ‘We spend more time looking at each other in the situation room on cameras and on video talking to each other than we get to do in person,’ he said. ‘We’ve established a great relationship and as you all know, the most open relationship we have with any nation in the world is with Great Britain, and we do have a lot to discuss because we both have a lot to say in the areas you mentioned.’ He said Mr Obama ‘sends his best’ to Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg. Mr Biden was last month sworn in as vice president to Barack Obama, who saw off Republican challenger Mitt Romney to return to the White House. ‘So you signed up for another four years?’ Mr Cameron was heard to say as the pair entered Downing Street's White Room for talks. ‘We did, we did. It was easy, nothing to it,’ Mr Biden replied.","White House concerned its closest ally will lose European influence .
