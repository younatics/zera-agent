"Lewis Hamilton moved right back into the fight for this season's Formula One World Championship after winning Sunday's action-packed British Grand Prix.

"She's an Indigenous icon and one of the country's most successful athletes, but Nova Peris has been no stranger to controversy during her two decades in the spotlight. On Thursday morning, the Labor senator was the subject of allegations byÂ The Northern Territory News that she sought taxpayer money to solicit a sexual liaison with sprint star Ato Boldon in 2010. Peris 'categorically' rejected the allegations and Boldon said the newspaper's article included 'gross fabrications'. Peris has bruised many egos during her time as a star athlete and politician. Daily Mail Australia recalls some of the most dramatic moments of Peris' tumultuous career. Scroll down for video . Nova Peris is the country's first Indigenous woman elected to the nation's parliament and has also represented Australia at the Olympics in two sports . Sprint star: Trinidad and Tobago runner Ato Boldon has denied wrongdoing . Tensions on the track . Fresh from becoming the first Indigenous athlete to win Olympic Gold as part of the Hockeyroos in 1996, Peris' decision to try her hand at athletics caused a stir. She had a tense relationship with sprinter Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, particularly following an incident at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Peris came under fire when Gainsford-Taylor collapsed near the finish line of the 200m final because Peris did not rush to help her after she won the race. Peris won gold as part of the Hockeyroos in 1996 and then became a star sprinter . Gold! Peris kisses her medal after taking out victory in the 200m final at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur . Peris later said she had been unaware of what happened to her fellow competitor until several minutes after the event. In an interview with the ABC, Peris said she believed some of the criticism was spurred on by racism. 'Mel is blonde and beautiful and a media favourite, while I am an Aboriginal from the Top End,' she said. 'It's never quite stated, but I did sense some racist undertones in some of those (critical media) articles.' Tensions between the two athletes reportedly continued through the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. A tumultuous personal life . Sprinter Daniel Batman, Peris' second husband, died in a tragic car crash in 2012 . Ms Peris' personal life has often been turbulent. In 2001 she divorced her first husband, Sean Kneebone, who was her manager and the father of her daughter, Jessica. In 2002, she would marry Australian sprint star Daniel Batman.Â The couple had two children, Destiny and Jack, but divorced in 2010 following lengthy proceedings. Batman, 31, was tragically killed in 2012 when his car rolled over south-east of Darwin. She reportedly met her third husband, Scott Appleton, while he was  working at an Indigenous boys mentoring program. The couple married in 2013. Ugly Labor warfare . In a political gamechanger, in early 2013 Prime Minister Julia Gillard (left) announced Nova Peris as her 'Captain's Pick' for the Labor senate seat in the Northern Territory. She replaced Senator Trish Crossin (right) Senator Peris delivers her maiden speech in the Senate . Peris' most recent career move also put noses out of joint. In one of the most surprising political developments of 2013, Prime Minister Julia Gillard nominated Peris to become Labor's next senator for the Northern Territory. She would become the nation's first Indigenous female to be elected to Parliament - but not without a messy preselection battle with the woman she replaced. Incumbent senator Trish Crossin, who had held the seat for fifteen years, was upset by Ms Gillard's decision, which the prime minister dubbed her 'Captain's Pick'. In her memoir, My Story, the former prime minister recalled the outgoing senator becoming emotional when she told her about her decision. Crossin blasted Ms Gillard's decision in her valedictory speech to the Senate. A fiery Crossin said: 'Do we need more women in parliament? Of course we do, but not at the expense of each other.â 'Do we need Indigenous representation? Most certainly we do, but not in a vacuum without or plan or strategy.' Crossin also took a veiled swipe at the prime minister. 'Just because one person says it must be so does not make it democratic.' A row at the school sport's track . Senator Peris' every move has come under scrutiny as an elected official. She was last month accused of 'abusing' a volunteer school sport official by a Northern Territory newspaper. Peris was accused of scolding school track and field officials, saying she was an Olympic athletes and knows how 'how athletic events work' Quoting unnamed sources, The Northern Territory News alleged Ms Peris became upset when she failed to register her son on time for a track event. The newspaper said Peris scolded officials, telling them she was an Olympic athlete and knew 'how athletic events work'. Peris apologised for the alleged row in a statement. 'I'm both shocked and surprised to hear that my comments may have caused offence,' the newspaper quoted her saying. 'However, if any offence was caused, I apologise.'","Labor senator Nova Peris was the subject of  allegations this morning .

"Judy Murray has said it is time for womenâs Grand Slam finals to be extended to five sets. Her call came after Petra Kvitova took only 55 minutes to win her second Wimbledon title on Saturday after one of the finest displays ever seen in a final at the All England Club. But Murray, the Great Britain Fed Cup captain, said: âThere is no reason why women canât play best of five sets. When you have a big showcase like a Slam final, there is a case to be made for it being best of five sets. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eugenie Bouchard in a photo-shoot for Sportsmail! Spoken out: Judy Murray thinks it's time for women's Grand Slam finals to be extended to five sets . Belief: Murray thinks 'there is no reason why women can't play best of five sets' in tennis . Longer: Murray thinks the semi-final and the final should be decided by five sets to give players time to settle . 13% - Only two of the 15 (13%) womenâs matches from the fourth round to the final went to three sets. That's Angelique Kerberâs win over Maria Sharapova and Sabine Lisickiâs victory over Yaroslava Shvedova. The rest were all won in straight sets. 47% - By comparison, seven of the 15 (47%) menâs matches from the fourth round to the final went beyond three sets. 3Â¾hrs - Kvitova spent just three hours and 43 minutes on court in her quarter-final, semi-final and final. Novak Djokovic played for 10 hours and 16 minutes in his last three games. âBut it probably shouldnât just be best of five sets in the final â I think you would need to do it in the semi-final as well, so there is a run into it. âAfter watching the final on Saturday when it was over so quickly, you got that sense that maybe it would have given Bouchard a little more time to settle into the match and also to see whether Kvitova could have held her level for longer. âThe time is probably coming for best of five sets in semis and finals in the slams for women to be considered.â Kvitovaâs 6-3, 6-0 victory over Canadian 20-year-old Eugenie Bouchard should have been a privilege for those in attendance to witness. This was a player stepping up and producing her best when it mattered most, hitting 28 winners in a relentless show of power and aggression to which her opponent had no answer. But some spectators paying Â£124 for a Centre Court ticket may have left around an hour or so after the start feeling a little short-changed. In fact, at this yearâs Championships â for the first time at a Grand Slam since the 2009 US Open â all the matches in the womenâs draw from the quarter-finals onwards were completed in straight sets. Unfortunate: Eugenie Bouchard had no answers to Petra Kvitova on Centre Court in two sets . Brave: Bouchard was runner-up but lasted just 55 minutes in the Wimbledon women's final . Respect: The pair shake hands on Centre Court after the match which ended 6-3, 6-0 to Kvitova (right) The inevitable remarks about equal prize money followed on social media just moments after Kvitova had fallen to the turf on her back in celebration on Saturday. The comments came again yesterday as some made reference to the fact that the first set of the menâs final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic was only four minutes shorter than the whole of the womenâs final. Whatever your stance on the issue, equal prize money is here to stay. In 2007, Wimbledon was the last of the four Grand Slams to award equal pay to men and women and it will never again be anything other. It is worth pointing out that there is no difference in the various costs which come with travelling on the ATP and WTA tours. âThis is the modern day,â said former British No 1 Anne Keothavong. âShould we really still be debating whether women should receive equal prize money? I donât even think there should be an argument about it any more. âPetra Kvitova played anÂ  awesome final. Even if that match had been best of five sets, she could have potentially won it in less than an hour-and-a-half. âI would have been more than happy to play best of five sets and I think the majority of the girls would, too.â For all the debate about prize money, it is ironic that 24-year-old Kvitova does not care too much for the stuff. Debate: The female winners get the same prize money as the males, but play less time . All eyes on her: Champion Kvitova beat Bouchard in 55 minutes on Centre Court . The moment: Kvitova drops her racket after hitting a superb winner on championship point at SW19 . Off her feet: Kvitova's match was just four minutes longer than Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer's first set . Menâs singles . Winner: Novak Djokovic (SER) Runner-up: Roger Federer (SWI) Womenâs singles . Winner: Petra Kvitova (CZE) Runner-up: Eugenie Bouchard (CAN) Menâs doubles . Winner: Vasek Pospisil (CAN), Jack Sock (USA). Runner-up: Bob Bryan (USA), Mike Bryan (USA) Womenâs doubles . Winner: Sara Errani (ITA), Roberta Vinci (ITA).

Runner-up: Max Mirnyi (BLR), Hao-Ching Chan (TPE) The cheque of Â£1.76million may come in handy for the house she is planning to build for her parents in the Czech Republic. But what meant more to her was winning the Venus Rosewater Dish, a perfect early present for her tearful dad Jiri who celebrated his birthday yesterday. âIâm not really interested in the money,â said Kvitova. âItâs not my job. I have a manager for that. I know that I can buy anything but this trophy I canât buy. âMy dad was coaching me until I was 16 and everything that you saw during this tournament is for him. He spent a lot of time with me so I think that this is the best present I can give him.â Britainâs Jordanne Whiley and her Japanese partner Yui Kamiji won the womenâs wheelchair doubles, beating Dutch pair Jiske Griffioen and Aniek van Koot.

"The Â£4,500 cost of moving a palm tree 300 metres was described as farcical last night. Torbay Council, which faces budget cuts of Â£3.8million, was already under fire for stumping up Â£7,000 to import the 20ft Canary date palm from Spain to erect on a roundabout billed as the gateway to Torquay in Devon. But now the tree has been moved to a new site just up the road at the entrance to a shopping centre to make way for a dual carriageway. Scroll down for video . Council officials were forced to spend Â£4,500 moving the Â£7,000 tree, pictured, just 300 metres up the road . Torquay mayor Gordon Oliver said the palm tree would make an 'impact' to visitors to the Devon town, pictured . The GMB unionâs local branch secretary, Paul Raybould, who discovered the cost of the move, said: âThis looks farcical. Council staff facing redundancies would be astonished and aghast at such a waste of public money.â The tree was the brainchild of Torbay Councilâs mayor, Gordon Oliver, who said âwe wanted to make a real impact so we decided to âgo largeââ with the palm. During last winter the tree had to be wrapped in a hessian sack, to stop it being damaged by frost, which critics claimed made it look like a giant phallus. The tree was the idea of Torbay Councilâs mayor, Gordon Oliver. He said: 'We wanted to make a real impact so we decided to âgo largeâ by bringing in the six-metre high palm.

"A pick-up truck driver whose 'fast and mad' driving moments after sending a text message led to him hitting and killing a cyclist has been jailed. Roofer Timothy John McLoughlin, 45, was on his way home from playing golf when he lost control and crashed his pick-up truck, hittingÂ 55-year-old cyclist Graham Devlin. McLoughlin had been speeding and tailgating other cars before trying to overtake between two traffic islands on November 17 last year. Timothy John McLoughlin killed 55-year-old cyclist Graham Devlin after he lost control of his pick-up truck when speeding and tailgating other vehicles . Other drivers were incredulous at his 'fast and mad' driving that afternoon with one witness saying: 'Jesus Christ, look at this nutter.' Panicking as he neared a bollard and oncoming traffic, McLoughlin cut in sharply and hit the driver's door of a van. His truck flipped and careered across the road in Billingham, County Durham, 'at great speed and with great power', Teesside Crown Court heard. The Mitsubishi L200 struck Mr Devlin, riding his bike to work in a high-visibility jacket and helmet, on a cyclepath set away from the wet 40mph road. He was catapulted from his bike and died instantly. McLoughlin had sent a short text message seconds before the accident  and there was an increased likelihood that this contributed to the crash, prosecutor Jo Kidd said yesterday. Graham Devlin (right) with wife Margaret and daughter Katie, 20, who have been left 'struggling to cope' since the accident . The driver, who had drunk two pints of beer, was unconscious at the scene, suffered a punctured lung and stayed in hospital for three weeks. Then he 'buried his head in the sand' and went on holiday to Egypt before going to speak to police. McLoughlin, of Stainton, Middlesbrough, admitted causing death by dangerous driving, sayingÂ in a statement: 'I fully accept responsibility for the wrong dangerous decision to overtake.' The driver said he remembered nothing after his van skidded and he was 'gobsmacked' to hear of the fatality two days later. Apologising to Mr Devlin's family, he said he was 'constantly upset and saddened' for them. He said: 'I know my sincerest apologies to his family cannot in any way undo the devastating loss I have caused the family. 'However I do wish to convey how deeply sorry I am for what I did. 'Also my actions have devastated my family.' Timothy JohnÂ McLoughlin covering his face as he left Teesside Crown Court, where he was later jailed for three years and nine months . Judge Howard Crowson said: 'No sentence I can pass can assuage the grief or match the loss. 'The sentence I impose is not intended to place a value on the life of Mr Devlin. That life is priceless.' He told McLoughlin his crime was persistent dangerous driving, killing a man who 'should have been entirely safe'. McLoughlin was jailed for three years and nine months, banning him from driving for four years. In a statement read in Teesside Crown Court, wife Margaret Devlin opened her heart in a statement. She said she loved Graham dearly, and the family's life was 'destroyed' by the news of his death. Mrs Devlin said: 'In that split second I realised I had lost a husband of 23 years, my daughter Katie had lost her father and my sister-in-law had lost a brother.' She added: 'Everyday life is very painful and less worthwhile without Graham being there to share it with. I have had to leave my job due to ill health and I am struggling to cope with day-to-day life. If there is a Hell, we are living it.' She described her husband as a family man who 'worked to live' and enjoyed time with his friends, visiting the gun club, listening to music and playing bass guitar. She said: 'Everything he did, he did safely and by the book. 'He had recently signed up to be a volunteer fireman and was so proud when he had passed the driving test which enabled him to drive the fire tenders. 'We are still all very bitter and angry that someone has taken a huge part of our life away.' She said the family wanted Timothy McLoughlin to be 'severely punished to the full extent of the law'. A statement given after the sentencing said: 'The family has been truly devastated by the loss of a wonderful husband and father who is greatly missed. It didn't matter what prison sentence that man received. It will never compensate for their loss.' The family urged drivers to be aware of cyclists and remember their duty to drive responsibly. Senior investigating officer PC Neil Foster said he hoped the sentence would bring some comfort, and reminded drivers of their obligation to 'keep others safe'. How can I put into words what Graham meant to me and my family and the true impact of life without him? On Sunday November 17, 2013 our lives were destroyed by the news that Graham, who had been cycling to work on the cycle path next to Haverton Hill Road, had been struck by a vehicle and had died at the scene. In that split second I realised that I had lost a husband of 23 years, my daughter Katie had lost her father and my sister-in-law had lost a brother. Five months later we are in no better shape and everyday life is very painful and less worthwhile without Graham being there to share it with. I have had to leave my job due to ill health and I am struggling to cope with day-to-day life. I am trying to stay strong for my daughter but it is so hard. If there is a Hell, we are living it. Graham was a family man. He worked to live and would spend his time, when not with his family, out with friends at the club or enjoying one of his many hobbies. These included visiting the gun club, playing the bass guitar or just listening to his favourite music, loud. Graham was a joiner by trade but had recently gone to work as a security officer. Everything he did, he did safely and by the book. When riding his bike he would always wear a helmet and the appropriate clothing, and ensure his bike was properly maintained with correctly fitted lights. He had recently signed up to be a volunteer fireman and was so proud when he had passed the driving test which enabled him to drive the fire tenders. He would frequently visit his sister Jane and do odd jobs around her house just to help. Graham would often be in his front room and I would be in the TV room to the rear of our house. Although we were in separate rooms doing different things, I still felt close to him and knew he would be there for me if I needed him. I loved him dearly. In some ways Katie has been hit hardest by this tragedy. She misses her father so much and is in a continuous state of panic that something terrible is also going to happen to me. She has to remain in constant contact with me to ensure that I am safe. She hardly sleeps, eats and is struggling to maintain her job. Nightmares are frequent as are the panic attacks. We are still all very bitter and angry that someone has taken a huge part of our life away. We all agree that the person responsible for killing Graham did not intend to do so, but nevertheless it has occurred and we would like him to be severely punished to the full extent of the law. This will not bring Graham back but it will show that the actions of one man can destroy the lives of so many and that this behaviour is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.","Timothy John McLoughlin was driving dangerously before crashing truck .

Six weeks ago, former England and . Lancashire batsman Mal Loye told Sportsmail howÂ  Vincent offered him . Â£10,000 to score fewer than 10 runs in the game against Durham. Vincent . doubled the offer the next day. Loye turned him down. ECB chief executive David Collier . said: âWe are extremely pleased that the matter has now been brought to a . satisfactory conclusion and that an individual who repeatedly sought to . involve others in corrupt activity for his own personal gain has . accepted that his conduct warrants a lifetime ban from cricket.â Vincent, 35, who played 23 Tests and . 102 one-day internationals between 2001 and 2007, said he had been . persuaded to come clean after meeting his future wife Susie and learning . about âunconditional loveâ. He said: âI can finally look my . children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy â . even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times. I now believe in . myself as aÂ  person again and I donât wake up every morning hating . myself. âToday is the day I offer my deepest, . deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world, to the loyal . fans, to the dedicated coaches, staff,Â  players past and present.â He refused to blame the depression he suffers for his misdeeds, adding: âMy actions I will regret for the rest of my life.â VIDEO Match-fix cheat Vincent banned for life . You'd never guess: Vincent - here batting for Lancashire against Derbyshire in 2008 - was at it for years . That was echoed by ICC chief executive . Dave Richardson, who said: âI encourage all the players to note how . engagement in this type of activity can destroy careers and lives.â England all-rounder Stuart Broad also applauded Vincentâs life ban. âThat would scare a lot of people out . of it, Iâd hope,â he said. âFor a lot of people who play cricket, . cricket is everything to them. You finish your career at 35. If you get a . life ban from cricket then what on earth are you going to do with your . life?â Four cricketers have been imprisoned . in England for the involvement in corruption: the Pakistani trio Salman . Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamer, plus Essex seamer Mervyn . Westfield. But the possibility of criminal . proceedings against Vincent would depend on whether the Crown . Prosecution ServiceÂ  considered a trial to be a sensible use of public . funds. My name is Lou Vincent and I am a cheat . I have abused my position as a professional sportsman on a number of occasions by choosing to accept money in fixing. I have lived with this dark secret for so many years, but months ago I reached the point where I decided I had to come forward and tell the truth. It's a truth that has rightly caused uproar and controversy in New Zealand and around the world. I have shamed my country, I have shamed my sport, I have shamed those close to me. And for that, I am not proud. I lost faith in myself, in the game, I abused the game I loved. I had to put things right. Speaking out, exposing the truth, laying bare the things I have done wrong, is the only way I could find to begin to put things right. The time has come for me now to face them like a man and accept the consequences â whatever they may be. I could not live with my wrongdoings any longer and after meeting my future wife Susie, after learning what unconditional love really is, I felt strong enough to tell her what I'd done and she has helped me take the painful steps in telling my parents, my wider family and then the authorities. I am proud of the ones I love, especially my immediate family and friends. Their strength, support and forgiveness has enabled me to address some of the deepest, most uncomfortable issues one can face. I can finally look my children in the eyes and tell them that honesty is the best policy â even if it feels like the hardest thing to do at times. I now believe in myself as a person again and I don't wake up every morning hating myself. Today is the day I offer my deepest, deepest apologies to the public and the cricketing world, to the loyal fans, to the dedicated coaches, staff, players past and present. I apologise to and thank the ACSU for the help and support that is out there for all players, that has helped me a great deal, Chris Morris and his legal team and all the associations that have handled the sensitive situation with professionalism and respect. The people who know me know I'm vulnerable, but they also know that I am not stupid. And I know what is right and what is wrong. I do suffer from depression â that is absolutely no excuse for all I've done wrong. I used to think mistakes were made by bad people, but now I even know that good people can make the worst of mistakes. My actions I will regret for the rest of my life. For sport to prosper, it is up to players to police the game, because they are the ones that will ultimately lose out and allow themselves to be used as pawns to make money. No one should ever be put in a position and no one should ever allow themselves to forget what sport is about and let money rule their decisions. The decisions I made were wrong. Players must be better than that; above reproach, for the fans, for the sport. For the first time in a very long time I feel positive about my future, I am finally becoming the man I want to be. I have to face up to my wrongs and make them right. I have kept my head down for too long now and it's time to man up to my mistakes and today, I can stand with a better conscience because I know I am doing the right thing. It is entirely my fault and I'll never be able to stand in front of a game again, it's entirely my fault that I will not be able to apply my skills in a positive way to help future cricketers, but it is entirely possible that I can use this moment to convince others not to be tempted by wrongdoing. To do the right thing for themselves, for family and friends and for the sport they love.I accept my punishment.","Former New Zealand international admitted he'd been fixing for years .

"Responsible for looking after his mate's boat while he was on holidays, the last thing that Peter Estephan expected to see was the cruiser coasting along Sydney waters. Mr Estephan was driving overÂ Tom Ugly's Bridge near Sans Souci, southern Sydney, at 12.50pm on Wednesday when he spotted his friend's $1.8 million boat cruising along St George's river - even though the owner was overseas. The coincidental timing saw Mr Estephan thwart a joyride on the 52ft motor cruiser by three adults and one teenager who have been charged over the incident. Two men, a women, and a teenager were charged for taking Allan's $1.8 million boat (pictured) on a joyride . The last thing that Peter Estephan (pictured) expected to see was his mate's almost two million dollar cruiser, which he was responsible for looking after, coasting along Sydney waters . 'Funnily enough, I'd left work early yesterday and was driving home over the bridge and had a look on the left and said, 'S***, that's Allan's boat',' he told Fairfax media. Mr Estephan called Allan's brother, who said he hadn't taken the boat. He then called the St George Motor Boat Club marina manager, Mark Norden, who then called a local boat salesman, who thought he had seen a couple of young girls take it out for a ride. The entire time Mr Estephan was driving around keeping his eye on the boat which was heading towards Captain Cook Bridge. Eventually, he convinced Mr Norden to get a small runabout and the pair jumped in and chased the boat down the Georges River - just as the owner, named only as Allan, called from overseas to confirm the boat was definitely stolen. 'Everyone was saying, ""Relax, who's going to steal a boat?"",' he said. Peter Estephan was driving over Tom Ugly's Bridge (pictured) near Sans Souci, southern Sydney, at 12.50pm on Wednesday when he spotted Allan's $1.8 million boat cruising along St George's river . Botany Bay Water police were then contacted and chased down the motor cruiser which was 'being driven erratically and at speed' along the river towards the Captain Cook Bridge. The officers managed to catch up to the boat and board it where they allegedly discovered two men, a woman and a teenage girl inside but no one in control at the helm. The stolen boat was returned to the wharf with only minor graffiti damage and the four people were arrested and taken to St George Police Station. Mr Estephan is relieved he followed his gut instincts. 'I wasn't gonna stop, I just knew something was wrong,' Mr Estephan said. 'I suppose I'm a bit of mental case.' He has now gained the nicknames of 'Water Rats' and 'Miami Vice'. But, rather than let the newfound glory go to his head, Mr Estephan and his son spent the next day repairing and polishing the boat before Allan returns from holiday. Two men aged, 20 and 24, were charged with being carried in conveyance while the younger man was also charged with destroy or damage property. A 20-year-old woman was charged with being carried in conveyance and granted conditional bail to appear in Kogarah Local Court on October 14. A 16-year-old girl was charged with take and drive conveyance and be carried in conveyance and will appear in a children's court on October 14.","Three adults and a teen took a $1.8 million boat for a joyride in Sydney .

"On 18 April 2014 a Nasa spacecraft was sent crashing into the far side of the moon. This was on purpose as the mission came to a close, but scientists had struggled to actually find out where it hit the surface. Now, in new images, the impact site has been revealed in the form of a new crater on the moon. Scroll down for interactive module . The images reveal a crater caused by the impact of Ladee (shown). Around the crater ejected material can be seen thrown out on the surface. Ladee crashed into the moon on 18 April 2014 after six months in orbit. The images were captured by the LRO spacecraft that is still in orbit . The crater is believed to have been created by the impact of the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (Ladee) spacecraft on 18 April 2014. Launch: Sept. 6, 2013 . Launch site: Wallops Flight Facility, Virgina . Launch vehicle: Minotaur V . Planned mission duration: 100 days . Actual mission duration: 128 days . Mass: 844 lbs (383 kg) Power: 295 watts . Cost: Â£167 million ($280 million) Mission legacy: Ladee identified various components of . the thin lunar atmosphere. It also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all the . surface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites. Scientists hope to use the data to address a long-standing question: was lunar dust, electrically charged by sunlight, responsible for the pre-sunrise glow seen above the lunar horizon during several Apollo missions? Ladee also hosted Nasaâs first dedicated system for two-way communication using laser instead of radio waves. It was spotted by Nasaâs Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has orbited the moon since 2009. The crater was hard to spot because the impact energy of Ladee was not particularly high compared to, say, a large meteorite. To perform the impact the spacecraft had been slowly lowered in its orbit and, and the time of crashing, was travelling about 3,800 mph (6,000 km/h). While that might seem fast, in cosmic terms it is relatively slow compared to meteorite impacts. This meant the actual crater the impact created was small. In order to find the crater, scientists used images taken before and after the impact. By dividing the before image by the after image they were able to spot changes to the surface. In this instance the ejected material from the impact forms a triangular pattern that extends up to about 1,000 feet (300 metres) from the impact site. Ladeeâs engines fired on 11 April 2014, to perform a final orbital maintenance maneuver and adjust to guarantee it would impact on the farside of the moon and away from the Apollo landing sites. Drag vertical line on module below for before and after the Ladee crash . Over a seven-day period, Ladeeâs orbit decreased and the spacecraft orbited very low to the surface and close to the walls of lunar craters and mountain ridges to give the team a chance to collect valuable science data. Finally, Ladee impacted the eastern rim of Sundman V crater on April 18. Ladee (illustration shown) identified various components of the thin lunar atmosphere. It also studied the dusty veil surrounding the moon, created by all thesurface particles kicked up by impacting micrometeorites . The impact site is about half a mile (780 meters) from the crater rim with an altitude of about 8,500ft (2,590 meters). It was only about two tenths of a mile (300 meters) north of the location mission controllers predicted based on tracking data. 'As it turns there were several small surface changes found in the predicted area of the impact, the biggest and most distinctive was within 968 feet (295 meters) of the spot estimated by the Ladee operations team,' said Mark Robinson, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) principal investigator from Arizona State University in Tempe. 'I'm happy that the LROC team was able to confirm the Ladee impact point,' added Butler Hine, Ladee project manager at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. 'It really helps the Ladee team to get closure and know exactly where the product of their hard work wound up.'

The goal of the talks was to reach a settlement within nine months. However, negotiations failed before the target date, amid a low point in relations between Israelis and Palestinians. Kerry said in a statement that Indyk, a former . U.S. ambassador to Israel, would return to his position as vice . president and director of foreign policy at The Brookings Institution . think-tank in Washington but would continue to serve as special adviser . on Mideast peace issues. 'Ambassador Indyk has invested decades of his extraordinary career to . the mission of helping Israelis and Palestinians achieve a lasting . peace' Kerry said, reaffirming the commitment of the U.S. in resuming the peace talks. With the peace process in hiatus, it is unclear whether Indyk will be replaced. His deputy, Frank Lowenstein, will assume the envoy position on an interim basis, the officials said. Indyk's resignation marks the second time the Obama administration has lost a Mideast peace envoy following a failed bid to bring the parties together. Former Sen. George Mitchell stepped down from the post in May 2011 after two years of frustrating efforts to get negotiations going. The latest effort collapsed in March, when Israel and the Palestinians each backed out of pledges they had made when the peace talks resumed. Each side blamed the other for the breakdown. Indyk (pictured left), talking with Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured right.) Kerry appointed Indyk to the position of special Mideast envoy in July 2013 . 'The United States remains committed not just to the cause of peace, but to resuming the process when the parties find a path back to serious negotiations,' Kerry (pictured left) said in a statement Friday . The Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on a promise of releasing prisoners and continuing to construct Jewish settlements on disputed territory, while the Israelis accused the Palestinians of seeking greater recognition with the United Nations. The Palestinians then formed a unity government backed by the militant Hamas movement, which Israel refuses to deal with. Indyk, 62, had taken a leave of absence from his job as vice president and foreign policy director of Brookings when he was appointed envoy on July 29, 2013. At the time, he thanked President Barack Obama and Kerry for 'entrusting me with the mission of helping you take this breakthrough and turn it into a full-fledged Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.' Israeli security forces detaining Palestinian men during a July 22 operation. The peace talks stalled between the two sides in March 2014, when both sides reneged on previous promises . 'It is a daunting and humbling challenge, but one that I cannot desist from,' Indyk said then. Prior to joining Brookings, Indyk had served as former President Bill Clinton's ambassador to Israel and was a key part of the 2000 Camp David peace talks. Prior to this, he had experience working with Near East and South Asian affairs.","Martin Indyk, who was appointed as special Mideast envoy in July 2013, announced his resignation Friday .

"Kieran Richardson is expected to have a medical at Aston Villa on Friday ahead of his proposed transfer for an undisclosed fee. The 29-year-old had been the subject of interest from West Ham, West Brom and Crystal Palace, but Villa now seem poised to sign him.

Owner Randy Lerner has made it clear to Lambert there will be little funds for new signings in this transfer window. And the acquisition of the former England midfielder is seen as an astute piece of business due to his versatility that allows him to play left-back, midfield and in an attacking role. Fulham are still dealing with the financial ramifications of their relegation from the Premier League and will let the former Black Cat midfielder leave for a modest fee. The news of Richardsonâs likely switch to Villa Park will come as a blow to West Brom where he is still fondly remembered after playing an integral role in helping retaining their Premier League status in 2005.

"Some see penalty shoot-outs as a lottery - a cruel way to decide any match, let alone a World Cup semi-final. But Argentina's win over Holland on Wednesday night in Sao Paulo wasn't just down to the luck of the spot-kick. Goalkeeper Sergio Romero guessed correctly for two of Holland's penalties in the 4-2 shootout win after a nervy 0-0 draw... or did he? VIDEO: Scroll down to see the video of Romero looking at his notes . Back to school: Romero is seen looking at his homework notes as he walks along the line . Top drawer: Romero made two wonderful saves during the penalty shoot-out victory . Cheeky: Romero then puts the notes down his shorts as he prepares to 'guess' the correct way . The Sampdoria stopper was seen with crib notes between each penalty, saving from Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder of Galatasaray. The 27-year-old put the notes back down his shorts as he prepared to 'guess' the correct way and become Argentina's hero. Romero, who clearly studied each taker before the showdown, knowing there was a good possibility the game could go all the way, saw his homework pay off to put Argentina into their first World Cup final in 24 years. Holland manager Louis van Gaal revealed two players had refused to take the first penalty after their shootout defeat. Argentina scored all four penalties to secure a place in the World Cup final against Germany in the Maracana Stadium on Sunday. Van Gaal wasn't able to send specialist goalkeeper Tim Krul on in goal for the penalties as he did last week as he had already used three substitutes. To add to his pain, Argentina goalkeeper Romero once played for him at AZ Alkmaar. Experienced: Romero has 51 Argentina caps and also played in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . 'We didn't lose against them, but the penalties are down to luck,' he added. 'I taught Romero how to stop penalties, so that hurts.' It's not the first time crib notes have been used in a major tournament, and Argentina were on the receiving end of some extra homework in 2006. Germany and then-Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann revealed he had notes while saving two of Argentina's four spot-kicks in the quarter-final win at the World Cup in 2006 in Berlin. Master and apprentice? Holland coach Louis van Gaal (left) claims he taught Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero, who saved two spot-kicks, how to save penalties while managing him at AZ Alkmaar . Hero: Romero was the star of the show for Argentina, saving two penalties during the shoot-out . Lehmann guessed correctly for the other two penalties, also, and was unlucky not to save all four, but the stopper attributed the win to the studies of the Argentina players' penalty habits. For Argentina's second penalty-taker, Roberto Ayala, the note said: 'Ayala - look at shooting foot, left low.' Predictably, Lehmann saved Ayala's penalty to give Germany the advantage before blocking Esteban Cambiasso's deciding kick. Lehmann's note sold in a charity auction for $1.3million months later.

"For almost half a century, a Brazilian man with no medical training has performed surgical procedures to millions of people from all corners of the globe. JoÃ£o de Deus, or John of God, is a spiritual healer who runs a healing clinic called Casa de Dom InÃ¡cio de Loyola, 'The Casa', in a small Brazilian town called AbadiÃ¢nia. Millions of people from around the world visit JoÃ£o, 72, for his alternative treatment and next month, the enigmatic figure is visiting Australia for a three day healing and prayer event. JoÃ£o de Deus, or John of God, is a spiritual healer who runs a healing clinic called Casa de Dom InÃ¡cio de Loyola, 'The Casa', in a small Brazilian town called AbadiÃ¢nia . Millions of people from around the world visit JoÃ£o, 72, for his alternative treatment . JoÃ£o claims he is merely a medium, who prays to god to incorporate the spirits that can heal those in need . He labels himself a 'psychic surgeon', but John has a wealth of other titles-ranging from 'holy healer' to 'shameless charlatan'. Stephen Parnis, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association,  toldÂ The Australian he wasÂ 'extremely sceptical about this person [JoÃ£o de Deus]; I  find it hard to see any motivation apart from personal profit for him and his organisation.' The event costs $295 per session but a three session package at a cost of $795 is encouraged for  optimum results. Influential television host, Oprah Winfrey, vouched forÂ JoÃ£o's spiritual healing powers, after visiting him in 2010, where she nearly fainted during the 'blissful' encounter. Oprah featured her healing experience in an episode of the Oprah Winfrey Show titled 'Leap of Faith: Meet John of God'. But despite Oprah's endorsement, JoÃ£o has no shortage of testimonies from others who claim to have been miraculously healed by the 'psychic surgeon'. Jana Jones, a Sydney based mother, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  in 2001, a  disease which carries an average survival rate of three years - which is the time frame Ms Jones was given. During a follow up trip to another neurologist, Ms Jones got word of a Brazilian man in the jungle with miraculous healing powers - JoÃ£o de Deus. JoÃ£o has no shortage of testimonies from people who claim to have been miraculously healed by the 'psychic surgeon' People seek cures for illnesses at 'The Casa' Jana Jones, a Sydney based mother, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2001, and was given only three years to live by her doctors . 'I researched him as much as I could. In those days there was almost no information about him, but eventually I discovered his name and where he operates.' In February 2002, Ms Jones flew to Brazil. 'I met with a leade who escorted me to his clinic, 'The Casa'. It was beautiful.' The following day, JoÃ£o performed a 'visible surgery' on Ms Jones in hopes of curing her of the disease . 'He placed a long pair of forceps inside my nose and started sort of moving them around. There was  no antiseptic used.' Ms Jones says her mouth filled with blood, and JoÃ£o advised not to swallow it. After this, she was taken to an infirmary. 'I had a terrible headache for about a day afterwards, then it was like a veil had been lifted. Suddenly I had all this energy, despite being drained beforehand. I wanted to jump on a roof and scream.' Ms Jones says she was overwhelmed with 'feelings of love.' Upon returning to Sydney, a doctor said her condition had  improved dramatically and now, MsÂ Jones has a much less severe condition called Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy. She  visits 'The Casa' at least twice a year. Howard Toose, who suffered a grave spinal injury in 2006, travelled to AbadiÃ¢nia in Brazil Â in hope of alleviating the constant pain. He saidÂ since meeting with JoÃ£o he has seen a drastic improvement in his quality of life, halfing and then quartering the medication he needed to cope with the pain . Howard Toose reached 'The Casa' in Brazil, where he was directed to a room full of people in white robes . Footage of JoÃ£o's surgeries show the medium shove a pair of forceps up the nose of a third and twists them until he draws blood . Another patient of Medium JoÃ£o is Howard Toose, a former Telstra supervisor who suffered a grave spinal injury in 2006. 'I hit my head against a low ceiling extremely hard, causing an abnormal growth in my nervous system canal and it slowly strangled my nervous system. 'I was bedridden after that', he said. 'The pain was so bad I could hardly cope with light or noise - I was hardly ever sleeping from the pain.' Doctors told Mr Toose, who was confined to a wheelchair, that his condition would never improve. Like Ms Jones, he got word of JoÃ£o, and decided to travel to the healer's town in hope of alleviating the constant pain. While travelling to Brazil, Toose suffered excruciating pain. When he reached 'The Casa', Toose was directed to a room full of people in white robes. 'First I received a spiritual blessing then I got the surgery,' he said. 'I was directed to go to a room with elderly people and other patients in wheelchairs - I could feel an incredibly strong energy there, and I knew he was close.' JoÃ£o arrived to the 'operation room' and told Toose to put his hand on his heart. 'I closed my eyes and he said ""In god's name may everyone be healed,"" I felt these amazing waves of energy on my head - my spine was manipulating inside. 'After this I was taken to one of the waiting rooms - after years of insomnia, I sunk into the deepest sleep of my life.' Footage of his surgeries show JoÃ£o scraping the eyes of a patient with what looks like a scalpel. According to Diego Coppola,Â JoÃ£o's translator, 'His [JoÃ£o] treatment is a complement to conventional medicine' JoÃ£o claims he is 'merely an instrument in God's divine hands' Diego Coppola,Â JoÃ£o's translator . Since meeting with JoÃ£o, Toose has seen a drastic improvement in his quality of life. Initially, Toose was able to halve his medication to cope with the pain and now he has been able to quarter the dose. After witnessing first-hand JoÃ£o's healing abilities, both Toose and Jones have replaced conventional doctors withÂ JoÃ£o's treatment. 'I am receiving everything I needed from JoÃ£o,' Ms Jones said. 'I've never been back to the doctors' said Toose. 'They gave up on me.' John of God's translator Diego Coppola said giving up conventional medicine goes against his teachings. 'John is categorical about stating that everyone must continue to see doctors after the consultations', Mr Coppola said. 'His treatment is a complement to conventional medicine.' Coppola said that JoÃ£o is merely a medium, who prays to god to incorporate the spirits that can heal those in need. 'He never claims to heal anyone - it is the spirits that do the work.' In November, Australians will have the chance to witness JoÃ£o's healing abilities at Sydney Olympic Park in Homebush. A spokeswoman for NSW Fair Trading Minister Matthew Mason-Cox said the department will be attending John of God's Sydney healing and prayer ceremony, and will 'closely monitor the event for any potential breaches.' In the past, Brazilian authorities charged and jailed JoÃ£o for performing medical procedures without a licence. John of God will feature on Channel 9's program,Â 60 minutes,Â on Sunday night at 7.30pm .","John Of God, JoÃ£o de Deus, Â is visiting Australia for a three day healing and prayer event .

"Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? At times it was like watching a Beat-âEm-Up arcade game instead of Brazil. They can be a team of bruisers when they need to be. James Rodriguez was on the carousel in Fortaleza last night, kicked to death as Brazilâs players took it in turns to nobble him. Colombiaâs No10 was the danger-man, the World Cupâs leading goalscorer after hitting the target five times on their journey to the quarter-finals. Brazil did a number on him. VIDEO Scroll down to see Brazil fans' reactions after scoring against Colombia! Ouch: James Rodriguez was targeted by Brazil as Fernandinho brings Colombia's No10 down . Hit: Rodriguez was Colombia's danger-man but could do little to get past a brutal Brazilian defence . Chase: Brazil were on the hunt for Rodriguez and often made sure they got their man . On the deck: Rodriguez and his team-mates will wake with a few bruises to show for their efforts . 31 - Fouls committed by Brazil . 5 - by Marcelo . 4 - by Fernandinho, Hulk and Fred . 3 - by Paulinho . 23 - Fouls committed by Colombia . 6 - Rodriguez and Cuadrado were fouled six times each during the 2-1 defeat . 54 - Most fouls of 2014 World Cup . 51 - Previous most (Brazil vs Chile) Fernandinho did him first, somehow escaping a yellow card from Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo in the opening minutes. After that, this bruising World Cup quarter-final was a free-for-all. There were 54 fouls in all and thatâs plain daft at this level. In fact, that's the most fouls committed than in any match at this tournament so far. The previous most was 51 from Brazil vs Chile. By the finish, when Colombia substitute Juan Quintero just bundled over Oscar by the touchline, Carballo had completely lost control of the match. Colombia got their revenge of sorts when Neymar was stretcher off in the final minutes of this incredible quarter-final tie in Fortaleza. Set aside the brilliance of his delivery for Thiago Silvaâs seventh minute strike and David Luizâs belting free-kick, this game belonged to another era. A regular sight: Rodriguez lies on the ground clutching his knee while Colombia's team approach the referee . Friends or foes: Brazil's David Luiz comforts Rodriguez after a bruising performance that ended in defeat . Our emotional attachment to the 1970 Brazil team, when Tostao, Pele, Jairzinho and Rivellino ruled the world, will not be eclipsed by this team. Instead they can be remembered for this wild night in the Estadio Castelao for bullying their way past Colombia and a referee who let them get away with it. To think that Carballo is one of the best referees in Europe and yet he let Brazil get away with ambush tactics on Rodriguez, Juan Cuadrado and Victor Ibarbo. All three were smashed to bits. Short of grabbing Rodriguez by his testicles, Brazilâs players went through the card when it came to finding ways to stop the Colombia forward. At least he got a goal, his sixth of the tournament. Fernandinhoâs challenge was âa reducerâ as Ron Atkinson used to love calling the first, brutal tackle of any match. Paulinho, David Luiz, Marcelo and Brazilâs captain Thiago Silva all had a crack at him after that. The poor kid isnât streetwise enough just yet to shake them off and he knew that every time he took a touch then someone in one of those yellow shirts was about to snap him in half. By the time he headed for the tunnel at the break, he had been fouled four times. Cuadrao (three) and Ibarbo (three) were not far behind. Until Rodriguez slipped the ball through for Carlos Baccos to earn Colombia a penalty, he was a passenger in this passionate arena. Busy night: Referee Carlos Valasco Carballo is confronted by Colombia's players after another decision . One of the best: Carballo is considered to be among Europe's elite referees but let Brazil's ambush continue . Finally! Thiago Silva is shown a yellow card by Carballo, who let Brazil rough Colombia up throughout . 6 - James Rodriguez (Colombia) 4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil) 3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland) Those in italic are out of the World Cup. He scored from the spot, his sixth goal of this incredible tournament, but it felt like it was too late to change the direction of the game. We are watching a 21st century Brazil at this World Cup, a team who can play a bit and kick a bit. Itâs not always easy to watch. When Neymar is on the ball, teasing his way through opposition defences with those mesmerising runs, they are still a joy. Then there is the nasty side, the predatory attacks when defenders jump out of darkened alleys and take out the main men. This is the way they have to play, particularly with so many of Luiz Felipe Scolariâs key personnel playing their football at the highest level in Europe. David Luiz, Marcelo, Thiago Silva, Maicon, Paulinho, Fernandinho, Neymar, Oscar and Hulk have all played Champions League football. It feels barbaric at times and yet they have found a way to out-muscle their opponents. When the going gets rough, Brazil get going. Opposites: Brazil can be easy on the eyes but their win over Colombia was tough to watch . Rough: Luiz chases the ball as Colombia's Carlos Bacca goes to ground after being fouled . Don't mess with him: Luiz (pictured), Marcelo, Thiago Silva, Maicon, Paulinho and Fernandinho were rough .

"Ahead of Germany's huge World Cup semi-final showdown with hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Joachim's Low's side. Player of the tournament: Manuel Neuer (5 games, 3 clean sheets) The Bayern Munich stopper was already widely regarded as one of the finest keepers in the world, but this World Cup has seen his stock rise even more.

Billed as one of the biggest matches of the group stage, Joachim Lowâs team had the game won at half-time after going 3-0 up before Thomas Muller completed a hat-trick in the second half. The demolition of a fierce group rival inside 45 minutes was enough to convince many that Germany were only heading for the latter stages (again). Danger man: Thomas Muller scores his third goal of the game during Germany's convincing 4-0 win against Portugal . Tournament lowlight: Struggling past Algeria . But just when you thought Lowâs team were shoe-ins for the quarter-finals they so nearly blew it in the last 16 against Algeria. Expected to cruise past the African side, Die Mannschaftâs high defensive line was constantly exploited by the minnows who time and time again were fumbled by Neuer â who was playing as a keeper, a centre-back and a right-back as he ridiculously charged out his goal at all costs to soak up one defensive error after another.

Best goal: Andre Schurrle v Algeria, 2-1 last 16, Estadio Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre) There wonât be many German strikes in contender for winning goal of the tournament, but Andre Schurrleâs clever and instinctive back flick to turn home a low Thomas Mullerâs cross proved crucial in helping Germany break the deadlock against Algeria in extra-time.

"Non-partisan voter mobilization group Rock the Vote dropped a star-studded parody of Lil Jon's summer hit Turn Down For What on Monday as part of a campaign to get young people to the polls next month. Playing a version of himself, Lil Jon goes to his area polling place to cast his vote, only to run into Girls' star Lena Dunham and celebrity trainer Tracy Andersen, voting together in the same booth. The theme of the video is Turn Out For What, a play on Lil Jon's own song, and the video features the rapper and other celebrities, including Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armison and Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne, who are reportedly an item. Scroll Down for Video . 'Turn Out For What?': In Rock the Vote's latest PSA rapper Lil Jon turns his summer hit Turn Down For What into a voting anthem . Lyonne states that she's voting because she'd like to see criminal justice reform, and, Lil Jon shares, unsurprisingly, that he's in favor of marijuana legalization. 'Hi, I'm Fred, and I'm turning out because I want to impress my friends,' 47-year-old Armisen says. 'That's the only reason to ever do anything.' At one point in the video Dunham gets her dance on, sans pants. Not to be missed is Lil Jon's phone call with his 'aunt' Whoopi Goldberg at the beginning of the three and a half minute long public service announcement. In a throwback to his memorable appearance on Dave Chappelle's show for a 'Moment in the Life of Lil Jon' nearly a decade ago, Goldberg repeatedly tells her nephew that she can't hear him. He hangs up the phone after a few moments to go vote in the midterm elections. At his polling location Lil Jon runs into a poll worker named Lil' Ben who thinks he looks just like his favorite rapper . He also bumps into Girls' star Lena Dunham and celebrity fitness trainer Tracy Anderson . There he meets a Lil Jon wannabee who goes by the name Lil' Ben, and, of course, looks absolutely nothing like the 43-year-old musical artist. 'Wow. Mr. Jon. I'm a big fan. I saw you perform last week in 'da club,' Lil' Ben, a young, white poll worker tells him. 'This is pretty, pretty crunk. 'Sometimes people think we kind of look alike, I don't know if it's the glasses...' A bewildered looking Lil Jon interrupts the nerdy-looking volunteer to get his ballot, and is promptly instructed that 'there are voting booths from the windows over to the walls' that he can 'rock the vote' in - another pun on Lil Jon's music. 'Skeet, skeet, skeet,' the poll worker hollers after his idol. At one point in the video a pantless-Lena Dunham gets her groove on . Rock the Vote, while categorically nonprofit, often features celebrities in its videos who are openly supportive of Democrats, including Dunham, who infamously cut an ad for Barack Obama during the 2012 presidential election about her 'first time' - voting, that is. Glee star Darren Criss, who appears in the Turn Out for What video as well as a 2012 PSA about the history of voting sponsored by the organization, headlined a fundraiser for Obama's reelection campaign two years ago. He again performed for Obama during his second inauguration, along with Glee co-stars Naya Rivera and Amber Riley. As such, the actors and actresses in Rock the Vote's most recent PSA say they are turning out to vote for historically liberal policy proposals such as 'global warming awareness' and 'reproductive rights.' The overall message of the voter mobilization group's most recent video is for young people to turn out to vote for the issues that important to them, whatever they are, though. The midterm elections will take place on Tuesday, Nov. 4. Every state must decide who they want to to do their bidding in the House of Representatives, while 36 states will have the opportunity to select new senators and governors.","The non-partisan voter mobilization group dropped a star-studded parody of Lil Jon's hit Turn Down For What on Monday .

"Hungary today scrapped a planned tax on internet data transfers after angry protests by tens of thousands of people in the last week. A draft tax bill sparked anger across the country for including a provision for Internet providers to pay a tax of 150 forints (40 pence) per gigabyte of data traffic. Critics said the law would not only increase the tax burden on people but also curb their fundamental democratic rights and freedoms. Scroll down for video . Thousands of Hungarians lift their mobile phones in protest at plans to impose a tax on internet data transfers . Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which has been accused of anti-democratic policies, first unveiled plans for the new tax last week in the draft 2015 tax bill submitted to parliament . Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has been widely accused of adopting anti-democratic policies, shelved the proposals, saying 'people have questioned the rationality' of the measure. He said the government will hold a national consultation from mid-January about regulating and taxing the Internet and reconsider the matter next year. Mr Orban also said Hungary would stick to its plan to offer broadband Internet access to every household by 2020. The backdown came after tens of thousands of Hungarians took to the streets of Budapest in protest at the new law.

The organisers of '100,000 against the Internettax' said in a press release: 'The move... follows a wave of alarming anti-democratic . measures by Orban that is pushing Hungary even further adrift . from Europe. 'The measure would impede equal access to the internet, . deepening the digital divide between Hungary's lower economic . groups, and limiting internet access for cash-poor schools and . universities,' they said. At one point, protesters held up their mobile phones, lighting up the square in front of the ministry. Then they . walked to the city's historic Heroes Square.

It . said monthly payments would be capped at 700 forints and internet providers would pay the tax. But some protesters said the new tax was an epitome of the . government's mistaken economic policies. 'This would be a double tax on us, as I have already paid a . sky-high VAT when I bought the gadgets, computer and router,' said Attila Sos, 43, who came to the protest with his family.

"New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will make his first appearance at Old Trafford in a pre-season friendly against Valencia on August 12. Van Gaal's role as Holland coach will end after Saturday's third-place play-off against Brazil at the World Cup and he will then turn his attention to making the Red Devils competitive again after last season's seventh-placed finish - a dismal season which cost David Moyes his job.

Midfielder Darren Fletcher said: 'Obviously they (Herrera and Shaw) will have a taste of it playing on the tour in the US but it will be nothing like playing at Old Trafford. Thatâs where it is, the bread and butter. Thatâs where the real fans come and watch. 'Theyâll be looking forward to it. Itâs a magnificent arena. Where itâs still a friendly it will be good but it wonât be like what it can be, so it will be a gentle introduction for them which will be nice. 'They will soon realise in the league and cup games what Old Trafford can be like. On its day, with the fans behind us, thereâs not many better places in the world, and they will experience that.' Looking . ahead to the new campaign under Van Gaal, Fletcher said: 'Itâs another . season and an exciting one with a new manager coming in.

"American lingerie line Victoriaâs Secret sparked controversy last week with its latest campaign, which has a line-up of super-skinny models next to the slogan âThe perfect bodyâ. Does it promote an unrealistic body shape, fuelling low self-esteem and eating disorders? Probably â but itâs just a drop in the ocean of airbrushed images of doll-like perfection that bombard us every day. The fact is, not even the VS Angels are born like that. Their fashion show comes to the UK next month, and models such as Adriana Lima and Doutzen Kroes will follow a gruelling diet and workout schedule to prepare. Victoria's Secret models train intensely for five hours a day before catwalk shows, pictured in New York . Theyâve been open about the extremes they go to, dispelling any notion they just flop out of bed and into a pair of diamante knickers. Lima admitted to living on meal replacement shakes for nine days before she hits the catwalk. Thereâs even a training camp for them in Tulum, Mexico, led by Michael Olajide Jr, the former boxer behind the 1,000-calorie workout. It involves up to five hours of exercise a day. No wonder these girls are known as the athletes of the modelling world. The fashion âdietâ of cigarettes and coffee seems to have been replaced, thankfully â but is this new version any healthier? Models such as Adriana Lima and Karlie Kloss (pictured) follow a gruelling diet and workout regime . Why I've fallen for park runs . No wonder they choose this time of year for the New York marathon, which takes place today. I usually hate running, but the fall weather is so nice in NYC that Iâve been inspired to get outside and jog around my local park. Not only does it feel refreshing to mix up my usual routine with something different, but there are all sorts of benefits to exercising outdoors. You increase your workload by up to ten per cent by running outside compared to on the treadmill, and the constantly changing environment maximises the co-ordination between your muscles and your nervous system. As most of us are Vitamin D-deficient, any activity that means more exposure to sunlight is surely a good thing. Fuel up before hitting the gym . Q: Iâm always starving after exercise and find myself craving chips, chocolate and everything I know I shouldnât be eating. Do you have any tips for helping me avoid this? A: Feeling hungry right after you work out could be a sign that youâre not fuelling up properly before you hit the gym. Sports dietician Marni Sumbal recommends a small carb-based snack about 45 to 60 minutes before your workout: âTry eating half a piece of pita bread with a teaspoon of peanut butter, or a small banana and a few nuts.â You could also be mistaking thirst for hunger â especially if youâre craving salty foods such as chips. If you do work out on a regular basis, you need to up your overall water intake to reflect this and could also experiment with a home-made electrolyte drink to sip in the gym â simply add a pinch of sea salt and a squeeze of fresh lime to your regular water bottle. Before hitting the gum you should drink plenty of water and eat a small, carb-based snack, says sports dietician Marni Sumbal . Drinking coconut water after your workout will also help replace the electrolytes you lose in your sweat, and satisfy your sweet tooth for very few calories, too. Most importantly, though, you shouldnât try to fight these cravings as ignoring your hunger is a sure-fire way to set yourself up for a binge later in the day. But instead of reaching for the nearest chocolate bar, my nutritionist Gena Hemshaw suggests seeking out natural sources of sugar and salt. âFor a sweet post-workout treat, I love to have two pitted Medjool dates stuffed with almond butter. And if youâre craving something salty, how about some chickpeas roasted in coconut oil, sea salt and pepper. This snack is a fabulous source of protein, fat, sodium, and complex carbohydrates,â she says. Taking a little more effort to have these kinds of snacks on hand after your workout is well worth the effort. But remember you can also time your workout so that itâs time for one of your proper meals when you finish. Exercising right before lunch or dinner means you can tuck in to your heartâs content. You might have seen enough of pumpkins for one year, but the word in the wellness world is that pumpkin seed oil (PSO) is acquiring superfood status. Packed with Vitamins A and E, zinc, omega-3 and 6, fatty acids and antioxidants, PSO has benefits for hair, skin and diet â and itâs showing up on menus and in beauty products everywhere. The juicing backlash has begun on my side of the pond, over sugar content. Latest government guidelines recommend fewer than 25g of sugar per day, while the famous Doctor Green Juice at cult outlet Juice Press contains 38g â one gram less than a can of Coke here. Next big thing? Green smoothies, which are higher in fibre.","Victoria's Secret models train intensely for five hours a day before shows .

"From being cut off in the middle of an important call, to finding yourself stranded, everyone has experienced the frustration of their smartphone running out of battery at the most inconvenient moment. But this could be a thing of the past, as scientists in the US have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance - even while itâs still in your pocket â so you will never run out of juice again. The prototype MagMIMO wireless charger can charge an iPhone 4 battery  in  five hours, at a distance of 12 inches (30cm) away. Running out of phone battery at the most inconvenient moment (illustrated) could become a thing of the past becauseÂ scientists in the US have developed a device that could charge your phone at a distance, while itâs still in your pocket â so you will never run out of battery again. While wireless chargers already exist, they require a phone to be placed directly on a charging âpadâ so users still have to remember to charge their phones and place them on the device in the right way. Dina Katabi, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who is behind the new technology, told New Scientist: âIn our vision we wanted to have people's phone charge the minute they are sitting next to their desk: they go to a meeting, they come back, the phone starts charging again.â The prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it doesn't matter how the phone is positioned â so it could be lying on a desk or in someoneâs pocket. The idea is that coils could one day be placed around homes and offices to top up the batteries of devices detected nearby. The prototype uses a magnetic coil to beam energy to a phone around 12 inches away and it doesn't matter how the phone is positioned â so it could be lying on a desk or in someoneâs pocket. It means that users wouldn't have to use a lead (pictured) and remember to charge devices as they do now . MagMIMO uses magnetic fields to charge a mobile. The MagMIMO transmitter has a number of coils to generate a magnetic field. Coils could one day be installed around the home and offices. When a phone enters that field its presence is detected. The transmitter varies the field generated by each coil to focus the magnetic field in the area of the phone. âMagMIMO consumes as much power as existing solutions, yet it can charge a phone remotely without being removed from the user's pocket,â Dr Katabi and her team wrote in a paper which they shared at the International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking in Maui, Hawaii. MagMIMO's transmitter has a number of  coils inside to that generate a magnetic field. When a phone enters that field, its presence is detected by the transmitter. It then focuses its energy on the phone that is within range by generating varying frequencies. This  creates a stronger overall magnetic field that can reach the phone. In the experiment to demonstrate an early prototype, Dr Katabi connected a small wire coil to an iPhoneâs charging point. The magnetic field induced a current in the coil to charge the phone. Unlike strongly focused Wi-Fi, focused magnetic fields do not have a heating effect on human skin. The technology could be made available to consumers relatively quickly, because a number of smartphones already have a coil built in. Nokiaâs Lumia range as well as several Samsung devices and the LG G3 can be charged using current wireless charging pads. It could also help speed the take-up of smart watches, which will likely need to be charged daily, such as the Apple Watch, which supports wireless charging. The wearable devices have little room for batteries, so it would be ideal for a small battery to be frequently recharged from a distance without a wearers having to take them off. A Carphone Warehouse spokesman told MailOnline: 'This is a very exciting development and could be the first step in alleviating one of our customersâ biggest bugbears â smartphone battery life. Imagine a world where handsets charge automatically when in range of these wireless devices â it means phones will run for much longer without ever having to be hard-wired to the mains. It will also make it much easier to use a phone while it is charging, however it may be slower to reach full charge than a wired connection.'","Prototype MagMIMO wireless charger can charge an iPhone 4 battery in five hours, at a distance of 12 inches (30cm) away .

"'I want to grieve': Louise Troh, 54, was confined when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8 - but is now free . The first 48 people to be quarantined in the wake of Ebola landing in the US have now been given the all-clear after showing no symptoms of the deadly disease. All 48 were sealed off from contact with other humans after it was revealed that Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed with the virus on U.S. soil, had come into contact with them. Among the group are Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancÃ©e, and her children, and friends and family members who has been kept under armed guard at a secret location in Dallas. Most of the others were health workers who had contact with Duncan when he arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas on the day he was diagnosed with Ebola, sparking fears across the country that the virus would spread. When the clock struck 10pm on Sunday night, it marked three weeks from the date that Duncan was finally admitted to the hospital. Everyone who came into contact with him before that is now in the clear. Since Duncan died on October 8, two more people have contracted Ebola. Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were both involved with caring for Duncan and are now themselves being treated in isolation units in hospitals. Federal officials are meanwhile ramping up readiness to deal with future cases. A top government official said revised guidance instructs health workers treating Ebola patients to wear protective gear 'with no skin showing.' The Pentagon said it is forming a team to support civilian medical staff in the U.S. In Dallas, Louise Troh and several friends and family members are now free to leave a stranger's home where they have been confined under armed guard for 21 days â the maximum incubation period for Ebola. Troh said: 'I want to breathe, I want to really grieve, I want privacy with my family'. She added: 'Even though the quarantine is over, our time of mourning is not over. Because of that, we ask to be given privacy as we seek to rebuild our home, our family and our daily living. We will not give any interviews at this time. I do have a story to tell, and I look forward to telling it in my own way at the right time.' She added: 'Our hearts also go out to the two brave women who have been infected by this terrible disease as they were trying to help him. We are also aware of how much this has affected many other people of my city, Dallas, and my country, the United States of America, even as it has in the country of my birth, Liberia.' Scroll down for video . 'Patient zero': The 48 were quarantined because of their contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas and became the first person to die of the disease in the U.S. Also released: Youngor Jallah (left), Troh's daughter, and her partner Aaron Yah (right) were in isolation as well - and have now been released . She emerges from quarantine with 'nothing.' During the frantic operation to seal off her apartment where Duncan stayed in Dallas and eliminate all traces of the disease, she also lost the majority of her belongings. Only a few personal documents, some photographs, and a single Bible escaped the cleansing operation. 'They were left with nothing. They are completely devastated by this, so there's need to have their lives rebuilt,' her pastor George Mason said. Troh described Dallas health care workers and officials as 'angels from God' for the way they cared for her and her family during their three-week quarantine, ABC News reported. She added that she hoped 'that God will bring healing to all in our community soon,' but said that as happy as she and her family are that their ordeal is coming to an end, 'our happiness is mixed with sadness'. The incubation period also hasange passed for about a dozen health workers who encountered Duncan when he went to the Dallas hospital for the first time, on September 25. Duncan was sent home but returned by ambulance on September 28 and was admitted. Pham and Vinson followed later. Vinson's family issued a statement Sunday saying they have hired a lawyer and are troubled by comments and media coverage that 'mischaracterize' Vinson, who is being treated at Emory University in Atlanta. Vinson 'has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else,' the statement says. Dallas County and federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials cleared her to fly last week to Dallas from Ohio, and 'suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful,' the family says. Every day, the Ebola sufferers in the United States and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste PER DAY. Masks, gloves, linens, utensils, medical instruments--everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up. While one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste, some states have already said 'no way' to requests they accept the tainted garbage. Missouri's attorney general has even made moves to bar Ebola-contaminated waste from being destroyed at a St. Louis facility, reports the LA Times. Earlier this month, a Louisiana waste disposal site refused to accept the ashes generated when a Thomas Eric Duncan's belongings from his apartment were incinerated and a judge even signed an order temporarily blocking the disposal in the state. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference that the virus is not considered to be hardy in the environment and that incineration and chemical treatment of the infected waste is sufficient to remove any risk. Friends and family: Relatives including Duncan's mother Garteh Korkoryah, center, are pictured above at a North Carolina memorial service, which Troh and her family missed because of the quarantine . On Sunday, a Carnival Cruise Lines ship returned to Galveston, Texas, from a seven-day trip marred by worries over a health worker on board who was being monitored for Ebola. The lab supervisor had handled a specimen from Duncan and isolated herself on the ship as a precaution. About 4,000 passengers on the cruise had to miss a stop in Cozumel, Mexico, where the boat was not allowed to dock because of the scare. Carnival said it was informed by U.S. health authorities Sunday morning that the worker tested negative for Ebola. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said those caring for Duncan were vulnerable because some of their skin was exposed. The CDC is working on revisions to safety protocols. Earlier ones, Fauci said, were based on a World Health Organization model for care in remote places, often outdoors, and without intensive training for health workers. 'So there were parts about that protocol that left vulnerability, parts of the skin that were open,' Fauci said. Health officials had previously allowed hospitals some flexibility to use available covering when dealing with suspected Ebola patients. The new guidelines are expected to set firmer standards: calling for full-body suits and hoods that protect worker's necks; setting rigorous rules for removal of equipment and disinfection of hands; and requiring a 'site manager' to supervise the putting on and taking off of equipment. Epicenter: Duncan went to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital in Dallas when he was suffering from Ebola. Many of those quarantined were health workers who dealt with him . The guidelines also are expected to require a 'buddy system' in which workers check each other as they come in and go out, according to an official who was familiar with the guidelines but not authorized to discuss them before their release. Hospital workers also will be expected to exhaustively practice getting in and out of the equipment, the official said. Nurses have been clamoring for more guidance and better garb, saying they have never cared for Ebola patients before and feel unprepared and underequipped. 'If hospital administrators had to take care of Ebola patients, they would have the gold standard and hazmat suits,' said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, a union with 185,000 members. In some places where they have the suits, nurses have not practiced taking them on and off. 'The hospital is sending them essentially a link to the CDC website. That's not preparation. That's like a do-it-yourself manual,' DeMoro said. On Sunday the Pentagon announced that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had ordered the formation of a 30-person military support team to assist civilian medical professionals in the U.S. to treat Ebola. The team will be formed by Northern Command's Commander, Gen. Chuck Jacoby, and will comprise 20 critical care nurses, five doctors trained in infectious disease and five trainers in infectious disease protocols. Once formed, the team will undergo up to a week of specialized training in infection control and personal protective equipment at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, then remain in 'prepare to deploy' status for 30 days. The team won't be sent overseas, and will 'be called upon domestically only if deemed prudent by our public health professionals,' Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement.","Quarantined people had come into contact with Thomas Eric Duncan .

"I hope Ashley Cole enjoys his time in Italy, heâs the best player England has had for many years, and the most misunderstood footballer this country has ever produced. We should be proud of this guy, but instead too many judge him on peripheral nonsense rather than his talent and success. Judge him on his football, not his marriage, a training-ground prank gone wrong, or a broken promise at Arsenal. Letâs start with the story that turned Arsenal fans, and many others, against him: Cole swerving his car when he found out he was being offered Â£55k a week. If you took a dislike to him because of this, turn the situation on yourself. Happy man: Ashley Cole takes a selfie with the Roma shirt after being presented to the media . Italian job: Cole has landed in Rome ahead of his move to Serie A side Roma . New start: The former England defender was a free agent after leaving Chelsea . Imagine youâre earning Â£25k a year. All your colleagues doing the same job are on at least three times more, some picking up quadruple your wage. Youâre on such a relatively low wage because this is your first job. You ask for an increase, youâre told youâll get a rise of Â£10k a year. You donât settle for that. So you ask for more, to bring you closer, but still behind, some of your colleagues. Youâre promised the new salary you ask for - Â£60k a year. You accept, despite colleagues saying youâre worth far more, and despite other companies offering more. But when the offer is put on paper, itâs actually Â£55k a year. How would you feel? Replace the word âyearâ with âweekâ and you have Coleâs reasons for being angry with Arsenal Football Club. Breaking through: Cole made his Arsenal debut in the late 1990s and played more than 150 times for the club . Dream come true: Cole was pictured with the First Division trophy as a youngster and then played for Arsenal . Part of the team: Cole played alongside the likes of Robert Pires and Kolo Toure . It wasnât the amount of money that made him nearly crash his car, it was what he perceived as a broken promise from employers he trusted. You would all feel annoyed if your employer broke a promise to you, so itâs hypocritical to judge Cole on this. Heâs been judged on the break-up of his marriage to Cheryl. Maybe he did wrong, and it wouldnât surprise me if he had regrets but in the heat of a relationship, who knows what is said and done behind closed doors? Do you have all the details of their break-up? Do you know the whole truth? In the middle of a failing relationship people can say and do some awful things that they quickly regret. Youâre very lucky if youâve not been in that place. In the public eye: Cole's marriage to Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy was popular with newspapers . Failed romance: Cole and Cheryl started dating in 2004 and were married in 2006 but divorced in 2010 . Cole shot a work experience kid at the training-ground. Who can defend that? He was an idiot. But he isnât a gangster. People over-reacted to a bit of stupidity. Hereâs what Cole should be judged on: he has won literally everything in the game at a club level. He was an England international at 21, and won more than 100 caps. He was brilliant for his country, one of the very few of his generation who can hold his head up high and say he was excellent at international level. Starting out: Cole made his England debut back in 2001, against Albania in a World Cup qualifier . Class apart: Cole is the best player England have produced since Bobby Moore . Landmark: Cole made it to 100 caps, captained the team and eventually ended his career on 107 . And who wasnât impressed with Cole when after captaining England last summer, he described it as a âdream come true.â He went on to say: âIâve lived a little boyâs dream today.â Thatâs the kind of commitment and emotion I want to see from players. Coleâs got the quality and ability to back it up. Unfortunately too many fans preferred to overlook the footballing talents of Cole, instead they chose to misinterpret and blow out of proportion stories away from the pitch. Lesser characters would have been ruined by such criticism. Cole continued to be brilliant. Strength of character, passion for playing, quality and consistency are all his hallmarks. Blue day: Jose Mourinho signed Cole for Chelsea in 2006 . The trophy years: Cole won nine trophies in his time at Chelsea, including the Champions League . Time to say goodbye: Cole applauds the Chelsea fans after his final game away at Cardiff . But he also had the ability to compete with and be better than the very best the world could throw at him â look at the battles he won against Cristiano Ronaldo. How many England players in the past can genuinely make that boast? He may not be a goalscorer or a fantasy-player, he may not be in an eye-catching, headline-making position on the field, but for consistency, quality, and being as good for his country as he was for his club, Cole is the best England have produced since Bobby Moore. Do you remember him having a bad game for his country? Me neither. Arsenal can feel proud they produced him, Chelsea can feel proud they continued that development and success, and English football should be proud of Ashley Cole.","Arsenal broke promises over new deal for Cole in 2006 .
Cole has represented England 107 times and never let his country down .
Cole should be remembered as one of the best England players since Bobby Moore ."

"Taxpayers are forking out Â£2,000 a day for David Cameronâs grace-and-favour country retreat, it emerged today. The Prime Minister has access to Chequers â a sprawling Buckinghamshire mansion just an hour and a half from Downing Street â as a perk of the job. The mansion has been the weekend home of successive Prime Ministers since 1921. But the eye-watering cost of running the country escape as sparked calls for a review of how it is run. Mr Cameron regularly uses the retreat to relax as well as to entertain foreign dignitaries and Tory MPs. Figures released to the Sun on Sunday show it is now setting back taxpayers Â£700,000 a year. The huge sum â nearly four times the average cost of a family home â goes on staff and maintenance. The scale of the bill has sparked calls for a crackdown on its use â or even opening up the 16th-century Buckinghamshire pile to the public like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayersâ Alliance, said: âIt should never be used for donor dinners and political ends. âHow about opening it to the public for a couple of months a year so taxpayers can see what theyâre paying for?â Mr Cameron showed the Queen around Chequers in February this year. The mansion has its own tennis court, which the Prime Minister is known to enjoy using . The Cabinet Office handed Â£2.165million grant-in-aid to the Chequers Trust â which runs the estate â in the first three years Mr Cameron was in office. A Downing Street source said yesterday: âThe cost of running it has come down under the Conservatives.â Mr Cameron enjoys entertaining political rivals, friends and even foreign leaders at the Buckinghamshire estate. But it emerged earlier this month that Boris Johnson, the London mayor, has turned down five separate invitations to stay with Mr Cameron at Chequers, it has emerged. Chevening in Kent is the grace-and-favour country home shared by Nick Clegg and the Foreign Secretary . The Chancellor George Osborne has access to Dorney Wood in Buckinghamshire . Mr Cameron repeatedly extended his hospitality to the London Mayor, his wife Marina and their four children in the two and a half years since he was elected, but was turned down each time on the grounds that Mr Johnson was ""too busy"". A source close to the Mayor told the Sun that the real reason he had declined the invitations was because he was not a fan of the Prime Minister, who he has known since the pair attended Eton College together in the 1980s. A Downing Street source denied that there were serious tensions between the two men, saying: âDavid and Boris are actually quite close. Boris has a busy diary too, and the PM understands that.â","Sprawling Buckinghamshire mansion is a perk of being Prime Minister .

"A proposed new black and white flag for New Zealand has been compared to one that's flown byÂ Islamic State militants. British comedian John Oliver drew similarities between the new design and the infamous ISIS flag, saying it could lead to future awkward situations for New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key. During his show on Sunday - Last Week Tonight with John Oliver - he continued to mock the proposed design, describing it as a 'flag of a vegetarian pirate ship'. Scroll down for video . The proposed new design for New Zealand's flag (right) has been compared to the black flag of ISIS (left) British comedian John Oliver (pictured) put forward his suggestion for an alternative design - one of a bundy-jumping sheep . Oliver further attempts to imitate Key's New Zealand accent, after showing a clip of the re-elected Prime Minister vowing to hold a referendum to change the flag in 2015. 'Key is now back in office and ready to tackle the most pressing issues facing the country,' Oliver said. 'He wants to change the New Zealand flag, or as they call it there, the ""fleg"". 'Now why's he going to do this? Well one reason might be that it looks too much like Australia's flag.' Another video is then shown of a radio interview with Key, who said: 'There's just a huge confusion factor...the number of times I'm in an international meeting and the number of times they sit me down in front of the Australian flag or the Australian area. It's not funny, it happens all the time.' The Australian flag (left) and is often confused with the New Zealand flag (right), according to New Zealand Prime Minister John Key .

'If you think mistakenly being seated under the Australia's flag was bad, wait until they put you under the one for ISIS,' he said. Instead Oliver puts forward his suggestions, including a bungy-jumping sheep, as an alternative. The current New Zealand flag has the same Blue Ensign on the top left corner as Australia and is defaced with four red stars outlined in white representing the Crux Australis - also known as the Southern Cross. Australia's flag has a large white seven-pointed star, known as the Commonwealth Star, under the Union Jack. The Southern Cross constellation on the flag is made up of five white stars. The proposed new design has a silver fern which is the same trademark logo for the All Backs - New Zealand's beloved national rugby union team.","John Oliver says New Zealand's new flag designs could be mistaken for the flag flown byÂ Islamic State militants .

"Argentina and Holland will meet for the ninth time in Wednesday night's World Cup semi-final. The South Americans have recorded just one victory over the Dutch - but it was the most important match of the lot.

Dutch of class: Johnny Rep rises to head the ball as Jorge Olguin (left) and Alberto Tarantini look on . Up for the Cup: Argentina president Jorge Rafael Videla hands the trophy to Daniel Passarella . Mario Kempes was the hero for the host nation, scoring twice as Argentina won after extra-time. Kempes gave Argentina a first-half lead before a late Dick Nanninga equaliser. And in the added 30 minutes, Kempes bundled Argentina back in front before Daniel Bertoni put the result beyond doubt. Having lost the 1974 World Cup final 2-1 to West Germany, Holland found themselves heartbroken once again. Johan Cruyff, the player of the tournament in 1974, had retired from international football in October 1977, but left a Dutch side still boasting such talent as Ruud Krol and Johan Neeskens. Aside from 1978's top scorer Kempes, Argentina could count defensive linchpin and captain Daniel Passarella and striker Leopoldo Luque among their key men. Maiden win: The victory brought Argentina the first of their two World Cups to date . Home advantage: Argentina delivered the World Cup in front of a partisan crowd in Buenos Aires . Passarella was a part of the 1986 squad that lifted Argentina's second and last World Cup. The Dutch have still not shaken off their bridesmaids tag and they were runners-up for a third time in 2010 as Spain lifted their first World Cup. Victory over Argentina on Wednesday night though would give them a fourth bite at the cherry.

"Walker says Lewis Hamilton faces an impossible task in the Drivers Title . Hamilton is 29 points behind his team-mate going into Silverstone . Walker thinks Hamilton is a faster driver, but not a cleverer one . Lewis Hamilton faces an almost impossible task of winning this yearâs World Championship, according to Murray Walker. The incomparable voice of Formula One believes Hamiltonâs Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg who holds the intellectual edge, and thus the advantage, in this most intense of intra-team battles. Hamilton heads into the British Grand Prix â the 50th edition to be held at Silverstone â 29 points adrift of Rosberg as he bids to claim his second title. âHamilton understandably and justifiably thinks that he should have been world champion more than once and the only reason he hasnât been is because Sebastian Vettel is a brilliant driver and was in a car that was much better than the rest,â said Walker, who celebrates his 91st birthday later this year. VIDEOÂ Scroll down to see Hamilton's Silverstone simulator . Walker thinks Rosberg will once again have Hamilton's measure at Silverstone . âHamilton wants to be the world champion, and so does Rosberg, but I donât think it is unfair to say that Hamilton is a lot more emotional about it and that can affect his driving. The more he is beaten by Rosberg, the more it could hypothetically hurt him emotionally, and that brings about more pressure. âWith Rosberg being 29 points clear, he is more than a race win ahead of Hamilton, so even if he fails to finish at the British Grand Prix and Hamilton wins, Rosberg is still going to be leading by four points. âIn a nutshell it is going to be very, very difficult for Hamilton to win the championship because Rosberg is a thinking driver. Hamilton is faster but I donât think he is cleverer than Rosberg. Rosberg is very bright indeed and he is a very good technician as well.â Murray Walker still keeps a close eye on the action on the track . Hamiltonâs relationship with Rosberg hit rock bottom in Mayâs Monaco Grand Prix after the Briton accused his team-mate of deliberately running off the road during qualifying to scupper his final shot at pole. Rosberg, who was cleared of any wrongdoing by the stewards, went on to beat Hamilton to victory with the pair subsequently at the centre of a very public spat. âHe felt he had been cheated out of a win, and we donât know, do we?,â said Walker on Hamiltonâs surly demeanour in Monte Carlo. âHamilton appeared (to think), and for all I know still thinks, that Rosberg did the dirty on him. So, it is very understandable he should be thoroughly fed up. Hamilton could struggle to cope with Rosberg's speed around Silverstone . It is easy for people sitting at home watching the television to say: âThatâs not very sporting is it!â Well, why should he smile and embrace him? I think his reaction was understandable but from the point of view of public relations, it was regrettable.â Mercedes have made every effort to repair the damage, with the pair back on talking terms at the races in Canada and Austria. A mechanical failure in Montreal followed by a qualifying spin in Austria, saw Hamilton lose 25 points to his rival despite a brilliant recovery to finish second after starting ninth at the Red Bull ring. But Hamilton, 29, hasnât won at Silverstone for six years and was feisty when asked how he might cope if he did not clinch the title despite having the best car. Relations between team-mates Hamilton and Rosberg have become strained this season . VIDEO Hamilton's Silverstone simulator . âThatâs not really something I want to think about or put out there,â he said. âWhy would I even consider it? Itâs all about positive energy.â And Walker believes such an outcome wouldnât lead to a early exit from the sport as some have suggested. He added: âHamilton is pragmatic enough to be able to shrug his shoulders and say âthat is racingâ but he certainly wonât like it and why should he? âBut he is not going to have a nervous breakdown and leave the sport. He enjoys it too much and he gets so much out of it psychologically and financially. Lewis has done a hell of a lot for Formula One, but Formula One has done a hell of a lot for Lewis.â","Walker says Lewis Hamilton faces an impossible task in the Drivers Title .

"One determined woman lost 50lbs in seven months so that she could attend her 50th high school reunion wearing the 50-year-old dress she adored as a student. Carol Highsmith, a 68-year-old photographer based in Tokoma Park, Maryland, who stands at 5ft 1in and weighed 175lbs at her heaviest in February, was desperate to show up to her September reunion as svelte as she was when she was 18. She created her own plan of attack, which she dubbed the 'WWW' lifestyle, according to CNN, and consists of simply 'walking, water and watching what I put in my mouth.' Scroll down for video . Success! Carol Highsmith, pictured at 175lbs (left) with the dress she'd worn when she was 18 and could no longer fit into and (right) after losing 50lbs, wearing the dress to her high school reunion . Like many women, Ms Highsmith had for years squirreled away the clothes that didn't fit her any more - the 50-year-old dress included - but could never bring herself to get rid of them entirely. 'I had wonderful, pretty dresses and slim pants that were put away... as I continued to gain weight and hated myself for it,' she told the publication. But something about the upcoming reunion forced her to drag those clothes out of her closet and re-assess her health, her weight, and her wardrobe. Emboldened to reach her goal and lose 50lbs, she prophesied: 'I will not need to buy a thing. I will just go upstairs and pull out lots of attractive outfits that I have longed to wear for years.' The three W's: Ms Highsmith, pictured (left) before the weight loss and (right) after, obeyed what she calls the 'WWW' lifestyle, which consists of 'walking, water and watching what I put in my mouth' Her path to success was not easy, especially at the beginning. Ms Highsmith, who travels a lot for work, was formally accustomed to gas station snacks and had no problem throwing back 'five Krispy Kreme donuts in one sitting.' 'Two candy bars and I am in another zone!' she recalls of her sugar-guzzling days. 'It is like I have taken a drug. My mood changes. I am tired, I think negative thoughts and I hate myself for eating bad things.' As her youthful metabolism inevitably slowed over the years, Ms Highsmith, who is married, gradually piled on the pounds. Her health had nosedived and so had her mood. For years, she avoided tucking her shirt in so as to mask the weight gain, and eventually settled into an existence of stretchy polyester pants. But once she had made her choice to fit into that dress again, nothing could sway her from her path. Roomy: Ms Highsmith (pictured now)  travels a lot for work and was formally accustomed to gas station snacks and throwing back 'five Krispy Kreme donuts in one sitting' Ms Highsmith educated herself on healthy eating and vowed never to consume anything that wasn't good for her body from then on. For breakfast, according to her research, this meant fruit, poached eggs and ham, with coffee and milk. She made a point never to eat lunch out of habit, only when she was truly hungry; after which she would munch on sugar-free low-fat yogurt, fruit and nuts, or a fresh salad. Dinner was grilled fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables. During the time, Ms Highsmith was travelling extensively around America on a work project, so avoiding the rows of sugary treats at every pit stop was tough. To stave off cravings, she carried with her a selection of unsalted nuts, and as an absolute last resort, a can of baked beans. High school days: Ms Highsmith, pictured when she 18 years old . Result! On September 17, Ms Highsmith attended her Minnehaha Academy reunion in Minneapolis wearing the dress she had worn when she was 18 (second row, far right) She still stopped off at Cracker Barrel chains along the road, but eschewed the fried, fatty foods and gravies for fresh grilled catfish with a baked sweet potato. Drinking enough water - 5 to 6 bottles per day, cold, to burn more calories - was key too, as was a good deal of walking; 10,000 steps and 10 flights of steps a day. Even when Ms Highsmith was staying in motels and had little time for exercise, she would trudge the halls and stomp up and down the staircases in order to reach her daily goal. Ms Highsmith credits her Fitbit, a wearable device that tracks activity level, and My Fitness Pal, an app which logs calorie intake, for keeping her on the straight and narrow. Time flies: Ms Highsmith, pictured now (left) and early on in her weight loss journey (right) when she tucked her shirt into her pants for the first time in years . 'Every day, no matter what is on my plate - figuratively rather than calorically speaking - I have walked my steps, drunk my water, and not touched sweets. Not one,' she said a few months into her new WWW regime. The hard work paid off. On September 17, Ms Highsmith attended her Minnehaha Academy reunion in Minneapolis wearing the dress she had worn when she was 18. And her mission has not yet drawn to a close. Ms Highsmith plans to lose 20 more pounds by her birthday - another major milestone - in May 2015. 'I trust this story will be an inspiration to others who are determined to lose weight â no matter what their age,' she concludes. 'Yes itâs hard, Iâd say to them â no getting around it â but so very worth it.'","Carol Highsmith, once 175lbs, lost 50lbs in seven months so she could fit into her 50-year-old dress .

"Bronca, Diego Maradona called it. The emotion was his driving force throughout his career. Marcela Mora y Araujo, translator of his autobiography El Diego, described it as representing âanger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontentâ. It would appear Luis Suarez, perhaps the player most like Maradona at this World Cup, is motivated by bronca, too. Nothing else explains his mood swings, his brilliant destructiveness, the intensity of his creative blaze and sudden self-immolation. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Suarez appears to bite Chiellini . Passion: Luis Suarez seems to be driven by an emotion referred to by Diego Maradona as bronca . Driven: Maradona claimed bronca represented his 'anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent' Suarez was angry long before he sank his teeth into defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was angry after defeating England the week before, angry on the eve of the final group meeting with Italy, too. He used every opportunity to rail against his critics, his detractors in England, those who dare to suggest that football is better without racism, cheating and acts of aggravated bodily harm. It is as if he possesses dual personalities. There is the Suarez whom team-mates recognise, and he is a universally popular figure. This Suarez gives selflessly for his team, is a disciplined and dedicated trainer and a quiet family man, still devoted to his childhood sweetheart and their young family. Controversy: Suarez (9) clearly moves in to bite Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini . Then there is the Suarez possessed by bronca, uncontrolled, without boundaries, illogical. Viewed together this pair make no sense, Jekyll and Hyde but without the potions. It does not follow that Suarez can depart from reality into a state where he is moved to bite another human being. It does not follow that this behaviour is repeated, that it has a pattern immune to censure or judgement. What Suarez does baffles all understanding. It is as if he is, in the truest sense of the phrase, out of his mind. If it were possible to review a substantial library of great and important goals that had been scored by virtue of biting an opponent, it would not make his behaviour correct, but it would at least begin to explain the motivation. If there were games that had been won only because of occlusive biting, there could at least be understanding. We do not condone diving or simulation in the area, either, but we accept it can get results. Flashpoint: Suarez holds his teeth in pain after the incident during Uruguay 1-0 Italy . Yet what Suarez does can only have a negative effect. At worst, he is sent off, or banned, if spotted. At best? Well, what is the positive outcome here? Chiellini was not going to become incapacitated, unable to continue due to his injuries. Biting, while horrible, is in fact a rather inefficient way of gaining advantage over an opponent. The best Suarez could hope for was shock. Yet Englandâs defenders also looked pretty shocked in Sao Paulo, and no teeth were bared to achieve that outcome. Suarez is at his least dangerous when he opens his mouth. It is his feet, and his brain, that terrify, combining to provide the movement, instinct and clinical nature that are his most effective qualities. Biting, Suarez is almost worthless. Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed . So why do it? Any mental health professional will say it is a spontaneous act. Suarez did not go into the match with Italy thinking he would bite Chiellini, given the chance. It is also an opportunist crime, and born out of fear. Suarez has a history of biting, but usually when the game is not going well. He was murdering England, and behaved impeccably, he was frustrated by Italy when the bronca overwhelmed him. This conforms to type. Suarez was getting little joy against Chelsea the day he bit Branislav Ivanovic, and Liverpool were losing at the time. The Ajax match in which he bit Otman Bakkal of PSV Eindhoven in 2010 ended in a 0-0 draw. Psychologists will also say Suarez bites when he feels threatened or is unnerved by circumstances. There is no record of an attack being perpetrated when his team are winning, or even in a game in which he has already scored. Previous: Suarez has a history of biting when the game isn't going his way . This excuses nothing, of course, because what English football has found is that Suarez does not respond to patience, understanding and our most decent human emotions. He responds to a big stick. He had his greatest season in the last campaign for Liverpool, following a 10-match ban for biting Ivanovic. Yet in the loving arms of la celeste he goes unchallenged, unquestioned, unchecked. Uruguay are Suarez-dependent. They need him like an addict needs his fix. Nothing he does can be wrong. And Suarez indulged is Suarez unhinged. That is why we are back here again. Cristiano Ronaldo has found it close to impossible to affect Portugal at this World Cup, yet Uruguay have been driven to eliminate England, and then Italy, by Suarez. He is the nearest in talent to Maradona here in his ability to singlehandedly drive a team. Angry: Branislav Ivanovic (left) was getting the better of Suarez during Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Liverpool . The return is that nothing he does can be wrong in their eyes. Uruguayâs part in this Faustian pact is that they will defend the indefensible, endorse the ludicrous and feedÂ  paranoia, a perverse victim mentality, that is plainly unhealthy. Oscar Tabarez is a hugely respected coach on the South American continent, who even Maradona refers to as el maestro, yet he, too, was moved to foolishness by his refusal to acknowledge that Suarez had done wrong. Tabarez claimed the allegations were a conspiracy, conducted by people âhiding in treesâ. That Suarezâs act was beamed live across the world escaped him. Diego Lugano, Uruguayâs captain, said Chiellini was a snitch and had shown the referee an old scar. Similar: Suarez (right) is the nearest in talent to Maradona in his ability to single-handedlyÂ  drive a team . Even those from Uruguay who are here, ostensibly, as impartial observers failed to locate their critical faculties. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about Englandâs controversial World Cup goal in 1966. There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about Englandâs controversial World Cup goal in 1966. âIt would be good if these English people who are worried and are pushing to have Suarez suspended can explain how they won the World Cup in 1966 with a goal that wasnât a goal, one that bounced in front of the goal-line after hitting the underside of the crossbar,â said Tenfieldâs correspondent, utilising logic that could have explained Suarezâs bite on Ivanovic away as a response to a tackle by Chopper Harris in 1968. Investigation: The Uruguay star looks concerned as he walks through the team hotel in Natal, Brazil . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, a former Uruguay international with 26 caps, attempted to explain the different cultures before the World Cup began by saying that where Suarez comes from there is not such a strong ethical pressure around a sporting contest. âI know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,â he said, âbut not for us. Itâs part of the game. If Iâm the last man and youâre running and I pull your shirt and you go down and I get sent off â is that cheating? No, itâs not cheating.â Yet, around Suarez, such moral ambivalence can have dangerous consequences. The hangers-on and ego-fluffers amid his employers and advisers conspire to indulge Suarez the monster, while only the quiet men of the FAâs disciplinary arm have succeeded in controlling those animalistic excesses. Going? English football will be missed if he decides to leave Liverpool in the summer . Everything he rails against in English football â the critics, the press, those who decry a destructive attitude he confuses indulgently with desire â are actually all that is good for him. Pandered to by his coach, his grateful team-mates and a slavish, cheerleading media, he is then set on a course of self-destruction. That is the Suarez irony. He feels he punished England with the goals that ended this countryâs World Cup ambitions. He feels he was avenged. Yet avenged for what, exactly? Everything he despises about the English game is what keeps him in check. If Suarez plays no further part in this World Cup, or in football for many months to come, it will be because he failed to learn the lessons of his brief exposure to the standards of the English game. If only he knew it, weâre the best friends he has.","Diego Maradona claimed an emotion called 'bronca' was his driving force throughout his career .

"The mother of a teenage girl who was taped to a tree and sexually assaulted has launched an anti-bullying campaign after her daughter attempted suicide. The Adelaide high school student, known as 'Sarah', wasÂ tied to a tree and sexually assaulted by a group of boys on school grounds in 2011. The female Year Nine student at the unidentified site was allegedly filmed on the perpetrators' mobile phones screaming as eight fellow students pulled down their pants and rubbed their genitalia on her. The incident occurred in 2011 but it was not reported to the Education Department or South Australian police until April this year, a department spokeswoman said. 'I didnât tell anyone about this for a long time because I thought it was my fault,' Sarah told A Current Affair. 'But I didnât agree to when the boys came over. It was front of whole school yard, so about 20 people would have been watching it,' she said. 'They were all just watching waiting for it to happen.' Scroll down for video . The Adelaide high school student, known as 'Sarah' was tied to a tree with tape and a garden hose before being sexually assaulted by other students . The female Year Nine student at an unidentified Adelaide high school was allegedly filmed on the perpetrators' mobile phones . Sarah was screaming as eight fellow students pulled down their pants and rubbed their genitalia on her. Pictures of the incident were posted online, adding to Sarah's humiliation. 'It made me feel the exact way I did when it was happening to me. I felt disgusted with myself. I thought how stupid I looked and how ugly I looked.' Sarah's mother Julie said that she noticed her daughter becoming withdrawn, and that she had constant headaches and had started skipping class. Sarah eventually dropped out of school altogether, and only revealed to her mother the reason why in April of 2014. Sarah's mother Julie immediately contacted the school, the Department of Education and filed a police report to take action on behalf of her daughter. While Sarah tried to swear her mother to silence, Julie explained to her that the only way to stop her attackers from acting again was to teach them that their behaviour was unacceptable. 'I said to her, I cant let these people do this to you. If we do nothing theyâll continue to do this. Theyâll grow up to be domestic violence perpertrators, or bullies in the workplace, because they're not going to be held accountable by anyone.' Julie was outraged that the incident had occurred in full view of other students, and within sight of the teachers lounge, and yet no one had intervened to help her daughter. 'To think that she wasn't protected by adults,' Julie said. Police investigating the incident found that the most the perpetrators could be charged with was offensive behaviour, and that too much time had passed to take action. Senior Constable Mick Abbott told the Daily Mail in July that the matter was an ongoing police inquiry and he could not comment. 'It's been ongoing investigation with the Education Department as well,' After filing the police report, the family experience backlash, with their house and car egged several times, and Julie's car window smashed in with a brick. 'It made me feel the exact way I did when it was happening to me. I felt disgusted with myself. I thought how stupid I looked and how ugly I looked,' said Sarah . 'I said to her, I cant let these people do this to you. If we do nothing theyâll continue to do this,' said Julie . Julie has now started an anti-bullying social media campaign to raise awareness for the impact of the behaviour, to prevent what has happened to her daughter from occurring in other schools. The angry responses the family received, including Sarah's Instagram account being hacked, pushed her to attempt to take her own life. The angry responses the family received, including Sarah's Instagram account being hacked, pushed her to attempt to take her own life. 'I really felt that life was not at all going to change, and that it was only going to get worse,' she said. 'I thought, I can't do this anymore, I donât want to be here anymore. I thought that (suicide) was the best option.' Sarah said that she feels lucky to have the support of her family, and has resumed her education at a different school.

An Education Department spokeswoman said that the school was reviewing its bullying and harassment policies and procedures, and had reinforced its practices with staff and students. The spokeswoman added that the girl's mother has requested that the Education Department's initial focus be on her daughter's education and wellbeing needs. 'While the student had already left the school concerned when the incident was disclosed, counselling was made available to her from the school's counsellor, and this support continues at her new school,' she said.","Year 9 student was tied to tree with sticky tape and then garden hose by fellow students .

"Children are notoriously fussy eaters. So one airline is calling in the experts to help design its new menu for youngsters - the kids themselves. Monarch Airlines enlisted the advice of children from across the UK to taste-test a range of meals specially created from British kidsâ favourite dishes. The panel marked the dishes on taste, smell and presentation and gave each dish an overall score, providing detailed comments on each one. Pudsey's Panel: The experts have had their say in Monarch Airlines' new children's menu . The children marked the dishes on taste, smell and presentation and gave each dish an overall score . Meatballs with tomato sauce and wholemeal penne pasta, and roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings are the dishes that came out on top, and will be available to the 19,000 children who fly with the airline every year. The children were joined in their deliberations by Pudsey Bear, and a donation from each meal sold will go to BBC Children in Need. Recipes were whipped up by Carl Jones, head chef at Alpha LSG - the airline's on board partner - and were put to the test. Rayna Constantine, 10, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said that the meatballs were 'better than my mum's by a million!' Firm favourite: The roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings did particularly well in the tasting session . A beary good meal: Chef Carl Jones gets a helping hand from Pudsey Bear . Seven-year-old Erin-Isla Yates, seven, from Leeds, said: 'The roast potatoes were the nicest'. The crunchy chicken bites with crispy potatoes, sweetcorn and peas however, were less popular with the panel, with comments such as 'I don't like the sauce', 'I hate peas' and that it 'just smells of plain chicken'. Charlotte Cornwell, 11 from Epsom, Surrey, said: 'I was really excited to help pick the meals. I'm not keen on some foods, but these were all really tasty â my favourite was the meatballs - the pasta was soft and the meatballs weren't chewy. It also looked really good in the dish.' Charlotte's mother Julie said: 'This is such a great idea â I've lost count of the times when one of the children hasn't wanted to eat their airline meal on a flight.' Pauline Prow, Chair of The Monarch Foundation, said: 'As part of our partnership with BBC Children in Need, we are delighted to support the 2014 BBC Children in Need campaign through our new on-board children's meals. Mini masterchef: Seven-year-old Erin thought that the roast potatoes  'were the nicest' Big decisions: The youngsters took their responsibilities very seriously and gave extremely detailed feedback .

"Hull City have completed the signing of Tom Ince from Championship club Blackpool. The 22-year-old had been linked with a host of clubs including Stoke and QPR but has decided to join the Tigers. The frontman, having opted to remain in England in search of a Premier League club following talks with Italian giants Inter Milan, has signed a two-year-deal with Steve Bruce's side. Done deal: Tom Ince has joined Hull City from Blackpool and signed a two-year deal with the club . Ongoing: Despite being a free agent, Hull will still have to agree a fee with Blackpool as Ince is under 24 . Ince, son of former Manchester United midfielder Paul, said: âIâm looking forward to the challenge ahead. It will be my first full premier League season.âIâve come to a club with great ambition. The moment I stepped in I could see a project and Iâm very happy to be here. âI feel that Iâve proved myself at Championship level and the next step is the Premier League. I think itâs the right move for me at this time. âIâve come to a club that is in the same situation as I am - looking to become established in the Premier League. âItâs no easy feat. You have to work hard in the Premier League. Weâve got a good squad here and itâs improving all the time. The challenge is to push us up the league and try to finish higher than last season.â Right move: The England under 21 international is looking to establish himself as a Premier League player . He told Sky Sports News: 'I've known Steve Bruce on a personal and professional level for quite some years, being in a former team with my old man. 'I also know a lot of the players so it felt like home to me. I didn't feel like a stranger walking into the dressing room, into the ground. 'The staff there, the people on the board, made me feel ever so welcome and sometimes you have to go with your heart. 'To be given an opportunity to play again in the Premier League, it's a fantastic opportunity for me and one that I'm relishing.' Ince also feels Hull can look to the future with optimism with the squad they are building. Familiar face: Hull manager Steve Bruce played with Ince's father Paul at Manchester United . 'You walk in and there's a strong British core throughout the team,' he said. 'The manager's bringing in some big names who have Premier League experience and we want to try and build on last season. 'The cup run was fantastic for the club. Now we have to look at having a stronger Premier League position, the Europa League is a fantastic achievement as well. 'There's a lot going on at the club at the minute and that shows it's moving in the right direction.' The England Under 21 international, who ended last season on loan at Crystal Palace, was a free agent after his contract with the Tangerines expired. However, as Ince is under the age of 24, Hull will still need to pay a fee to Blackpool and a tribunal may be necessary if a figure cannot be settled upon. Wing wizard: Ince ended last season on loan at Crystal Palace as the Eagles finished 11th . He met with Hull officials last week and a deal was concluded after further talks on Monday. Ince came through the youth ranks at Liverpool at had a loan spell at Notts County before moving to Blackpool in 2011. He has been linked with a return to Liverpool on numerous occasions in the past but a move back to Anfield never materialised. Ince becomes the Tigers' third signing of the summer following the arrivals of Jake Livermore and Robert Snodgrass. Manager Bruce is keen to expand his squad ahead . of a potential European campaign in the coming season. Hull will play in . the Europa League qualifiers after reaching the FA Cup final last term.

It meant Hamilton completed 14 laps, crucially 21 fewer than his rival Rosberg. Hamilton said: 'The car felt pretty good here but unfortunately I lost my most important run of the day this afternoon when I stopped out on track with an engine problem.

'We will . change my programme around tomorrow morning to try and recover the time . that I lost and make sure that I can complete my race preparation with a . long run. It's not ideal but we'll recover.' Rosberg meanwhile was dealt a boost in his title ambitions after he escaped punishment for passing Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso under red flags following Felipe Massa's huge shunt in the opening session. The German was called to see the stewards, but they opted to take no further action. The stewards stated in their decision that Kvyat's speed had dropped to just 24mph which contributed to their ruling. 'Having reviewed data from several cars in the same area of the track, several angles of video and having spoken to the driver concerned, the stewards determined that: the driver of car 6 had driven the lap fully within the regulations and was travelling at a safe and reasonable speed throughout,' an FIA statement read. 'At the moment of the overtake, car 26 pulled fully off line and slowed to as low as 38kph in what appeared to be a very unusual manner, in an area of the track that was visibly completely clear; and that the driver of car 6 took reasonable avoiding action of a car.

Today, the stewards stated in their decision that Kvyat's speed had dropped to just 24mph which contributed to their ruling. 'Having reviewed data from several cars in the same area of the track, several angles of video and having spoken to the driver concerned, the stewards determined that: the driver of car 6 had driven the lap fully within the regulations and was travelling at a safe and reasonable speed throughout,' an FIA statement read.

McLaren's Jenson Button was handed a three-place grid penalty for a similar incident at last year's United States Grand Prix, but the race stewards, including 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, deemed the telemetry cleared the championship leader of any wrong-doing. It is the third time this year that Rosberg has escaped punishment following an investigation by the stewards. He was cleared in Monaco after running off the track during qualifying and thus thwarting Hamilton's best shot at pole position. And at last month's Canadian Grand Prix, he escaped any action from the stewards despite cutting the final chicane en route to posting the fastest lap of the race. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was the best of the rest, more than a quarter-of-a-second slower than Hamilton and behind the Mercedes pair. Daniel Ricciardo in fourth, was quicker than Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel once more. Valtteri Bottas saw his engine cover dramatically explode to add to Williams' woes. Earlier, Susie Wolff, on her full Formula One debut, completed just four laps in the opening practice session, before she stopped with an oil-pressure problem while Massa wrecked his Williams. The Brazilian took part in the afternoon session but was over two seconds slower than Rosberg. Elsewhere, Jean-Eric Vergne suffered a wheel failure and was forced to retire from the session with 13 minutes remaining after his front-left tyre worked loose.","Lewis Hamilton clocks fastest time in practice at Silverstone .

"Party leader Nick Clegg depicted a 'diminished and divided' nation out of the EU if Cameron ruled alone . The Lib Dems sought to frighten voters off a majority Tory government last night by evoking a nightmarish image of Britain if David Cameron ruled alone. Party leader Nick Clegg depicted a 'diminished and divided' nation out of the EU, the economy 'halted in its tracks'. In a wounding attack, he forecast David Cameron turning 'trapped between being a poor man's Margaret Thatcher and a rich man's Nigel Farage'. The onslaught, dubbed 'Nightmare on Dave Street' by Lib Dem insiders, came as he admitted to party activists at the first day of the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that they faced 'the fight of our lives' at the next Election. The conference opened with the party languishing at just six per cent in one opinion poll and amid fears half the current 57 Lib Dem MPs could lose their seats next year. But Mr Clegg aimed to revive spirits with an impassioned plea for voters to deny Cameron or Ed Miliband a majority. The Deputy Prime Minister, stung after an unnamed aide to Home Secretary Theresa May last week described him as a 'w****r', reserved his sharpest words for the Tories. He said: 'Imagine... Britain, diminished and divided after a botched attempt to renegotiate our relationship with Europe and a vote to withdraw from the EU. Companies pulling out of the UK left, right and centre, the markets losing confidence, hiking up our borrowing costs.' The future Tory Party would be 'in hock to their Right wing, desperately pandering to Ukip's ugly nationalism', he claimed. But the Lib Dem leader also conjured up dire images of Labour majority government, 'borrowing a few million here, a few billion there. Throwing good money after bad at every problem that comes along. Debt piling up and up until the day of reckoning'. In a wounding attack, Clegg forecast Cameron turning 'trapped between being a poor man's Margaret Thatcher and a rich man's Nigel Farage'","Lib Dems evoked a nightmarish image of Britain if Cameron ruled alone .

"October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which means the #DareToBare campaign is soon to return. #DareToBare is being led by Escentual.com and Cancer Research UK to raise money and awareness for breast cancer â the UKâs most common cancer, with one in eight women affected by the disease during their lifetime. The campaign is asking women to ditch the cosmetics and go bare-faced in October - whether it's for the whole month, a week or just a day. Scroll down for video . Beauty junkie Binky will be giving up make-up Â to raise awareness of breast cancer . To get involved, all you need to do is post your #DareToBare selfies to Twitter and Instagram, make a donation to Cancer Research UK, and nominate friends to do the same. It's an easy thing to do to raise funds for such a worthy cause. Full details on how you can take part will be revealed very soon, but for now I thought Iâd share some skincare tips for those of you who may be more reluctant to #DareToBare. As a self-confessed beauty junkie, I admit giving up make-up is quite a daunting prospect. However, following the right skincare regime will give you the confidence you need to let your natural radiance shine through without the need for cover-up. Here are some of the key products Iâll be using while I #DareToBare this October: . Binky dared to bare last year and plans to forsake make-up for the whole of October this year . THE BARE NECESSITIES: My #DareToBare Kit . 1 â Cleanse . In preparation for going bare-faced, Iâve been cleansing my skin with the Nuxe Micellar Foam Cleanser twice a day. The soft, foamy formulation feels super fresh and soothing on the skin, plus itâs completely soap free meaning it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin at all. For breakout prone skin, I highly recommend the REN ClearCalm 3 Clarifying Clay Cleanser. Whether youâre 13 or 30 and suffer from blemishes, this kaolin-based cleanser banishes the build up of sebum, dead skin cells and bacteria, leaving skin looking clear and feeling purified. 2 â Tone . Toner is a product many people think itâs fine to omit from their skincare regime, but I canât stress enough how important it is to use a toner daily to ensure your skin stays supple and keep your pores tight. Binky usually opts for high glamour make-up looks so going cosmetics free will be quite the challenge . One of my current favourites is the Caudalie Moisturising Toner. My skin can get quite dry sometimes, particularly in the colder months, and the gentle yet effective formula of this toner leaves it feeling hydrated and refreshed. If you have larger, more troublesome pores, I would suggest the Vichy Normaderm Purifying Pore-Tightening Toning Lotion. Its powerful formula â made with blemish-busting salicylic acid â both unclogs and tightens pores for a more even, matte complexion youâll be confident to bare. 3 â Moisturise . My moisturiser of choice while I #DareToBare in October is looking likely to be the La Roche-Posay Hydraphase Intense UV Light. Perfect for dry or sensitive skins, the formula drenches dehydrated skin with long-lasting moisture without leaving it looking or feeling greasy. If you're an oily-skinned gal, the Bioderma Sebium Mat Moisturising Mattifying Fluid will change your life! Its lightweight, gel-like formulation immediately mattifies the skin and leaves it looking fresh. The fluid also treats shiny skin from the very core, by regulating sebum production and preventing pores from getting blocked. Bye-bye shine, hello flawless skin! Binky says that if you are going cosmetic free you can still make your face look fresh with cleansers . 4 â Exfoliate . Ensure your bare-faced skin is the most radiant and beautiful it can be by exfoliating once or twice a week. There are a whole host of facial exfoliators around for even the most sensitive of skins, so select your weapon wisely and youâll reap a world of benefits without having to worry about your skin becoming irritated. Iâve been loving the Trilogy Gentle Exfoliant recently. It gently buffs away impurities and dead cells on the skinâs surface, leaving you with a radiant, glowing complexion. The gorgeous macadamia and rosehip scent mean itâs a real treat to use, too, making this scrub a definite #DareToBare staple for me. For skin thatâs prone to oiliness and blemishes, try the Avene Cleanance K Exfoliating Cream-Gel. It controls oil-secretion and reduces shine while offering a deep cleanse to the complexion, leaving skin feeling soft and fresh. While I #DareToBare Iâll also be treating myself to a few relaxing Skinbreeze facials in order to keep my skin looking as fresh and radiant as it can while I go sans make-up. Donât forget your eyes â if youâre planning to #DareToBare like me in October, make sure your peepers look bright and healthy by using an under eye gel like REN Vita Mineral Active 7 Eye Gel to banish puffiness and dark circles. Finally, use a good quality lip balm every day to combat chapped lips. My ultimate favourite is the Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm â slather a layer of this gorgeous honey-scented, creamy balm over your lips at night and youâll be guaranteed to wake up with a super-soft, kissable pout. So whether youâre planning to go bare-faced for a day, a week, or the whole month of October, get your skin ready with your own #DareToBare prep kit - all the products Iâve recommended are available at Escentual.com. Until next time, . Binky xxx .","Binky will be taking part in the #DareToBare campaign .

"Brazil need to start playing with their heads and not with their hearts. Against Chile they seemed to allow the emotion and pressure of the situation affect their football, they looked to be strangled by fear. I know theyâre not a typical Brazilian team of the past - with all the tricks and samba skills - but the amount of long balls on Saturday evening, along with the lack of organisation defensively, meant they were not too difficult to play against. Colombia will have taken note. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the secret history of Brazil's iconic jersey . Use your head: Jamie Carragher says Brazil must control their emotions if they are to win the World Cup . You see it in their play. Iâve never seen a Brazil team play so directly before and the tension definitely affected them against Chile. Their opponents on Friday, Colombia, will not approach the game with any concern. They have to stop Neymar, yes, but they will fancy their chances. They will come into the game with confidence and they will believe they can beat the hosts. Brazil need more organisation and control of their emotions as only Neymar has that typical Brazilian X-factor we have seen in their teams over the years. Star man: Carragher believes Neymar (right) is the only current Brazil player with their trademark X-factor flair . Do they look hard to beat? Not right now. Fred and Hulk are obviously valued by the manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, and Iâm sure they give something to the team, but weâve yet to see the evidence. Oscar, a gifted player for Chelsea, played well in the first game against Croatia, scoring the thirdgoal, but he has drifted and was on the fringes of the following matches. Iâd like to see his Stamford Bridge team-mate Willian come in to add more energy and power. The supportersâ role has been huge and I think they dragged the team to penalties against Chile, as they looked drained. Fervent backing: Brazil's fans have been vociferous in their support of the host nation this summer . VIDEO Team Profile: Brazil . When a team and the crowd come together like that it can feel unstoppable for a player. I have witnessed it at Anfield on those big Champions League nights. I can remember Liverpool making fast starts â scoring early against Chelsea in 2005 and 2007, Juventus in 2005, Real Madrid in 2009, feeding off the crowd. You canât play like that for 90 minutes, but they influenced the results and the performance in a positive way. Itâs not always the case, however. Jose Mourinho was the Chelsea manager in those Champions League games and, during Soccer Aid recently, I spoke to him about this very subject. We talked about the game at Anfield last season when Chelsea won and effectively ended Liverpoolâs chance of winning the title. Until that point, it looked as if Liverpool would be champions. Jose said he felt Liverpool were too emotional that day, too hyped up. He cited players tryingto wrestle the ball off him on the touchline after ten minutes. He said they became desperate and were shooting and crossing from stupid angles. Tear-jerker: Neymar (front) was crying in delight after Brazil's last-16 penalty shootout win against Chile . I saw similar signs of such desperation in Brazilâs play on Saturday. When the emotion cascades down from the crowd, the players need to show cool heads. Right now, they are too wrapped up in the passion as the host nation. I know they want to avenge the 1950 tournament where they lost to Uruguay at home, which istotally understandable. But the head has to overrule the heart. After the Chile victory, there were scenes with Neymar crying and Scolari looking close to the same reaction â but it was a last-16 game, not a semi-final or a final! Danger: Colombia's James Rodriguez will pose a threat to Brazil having scored five World Cup five goals so far . They need to get themselves in check because there is a long way for them to go if they are towin this and more emotional examinations. They have not yet put in a top-class performance in four games â if it continues they will come unstuck, possibly on Friday when James Rodriguez, who has been brilliant, and his team arrive. Watching the Brazilian players sing their national anthem has been the most inspiring thing for me in this tournament, but the emotion in that - the build-up and atmosphere around the games as the hosts and favourites - can be very draining. They need to deal with that better than we have seen so far or they will be out.

"The latest Banksy artwork found in Bristol was covered in black paint on Monday night . A new Banksy artwork which appeared in his hometown of Bristol has been vandalised within hours of it being completed. The painting is a parody of the famous Girl With A Pearl Earring by the Dutch master Vermeer with a yellow alarm box replacing the earring of the original work. The elusive artist has called it 'Girl with a Pierced Eardrum' and admitted it was his handiwork on his official website on Monday. But hours later the 15ft-high mural - potentially worth tens of thousands of pounds - had been splattered with black paint. The new painting was created late on Saturday night and is on the wall of the Dockside Studio on Bristol's harbourside which is owned by Bristol City Council. Tenant Ellie Morgan, 47, who is joint owner of the recording studio, said: 'It's a real shame and a bit annoying. 'It was vandalised on Monday night between seven and eight. Someone just snuck down, did it and then snuck off. 'One of the bands that was recording came in and said someone had thrown paint on it. When we went out it was still wet and dripping. 'Banksy had already been back to touch it up once. He had come back to touch up one of the corners as it looks different to what it did first thing on Sunday. 'Hopefully Banksy will come back and touch it up again. 'The paint has splashed across the bottom of the chin. Originally, there was a lot of grey paint down that side. 'Where it was still wet, we thought about trying to clean it off but were worried that putting a hose on it might have damaged the painting. 'It's really disappointing because there is nothing to gain from doing something like this.' Banksy's artwork has been targetted by rival graffiti artists and vandals elsewhere in the country. 'Art Buff' in Rochester, Kent had a penis drawn on it while thieves have tried to steal the 'Spybooth' piece in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.","Artwork created in Bristol on Saturday called 'Girl with a Pierced Eardrum'

"He looks just like any happy five-year-old boy, but Harvey Hawkins lives with a lump on his brain which could kill him at any time - and his parents have no choice but to let it grow. Harvey was diagnosed six months ago with a rare growth called a colloid cyst after he started vomiting and became delirious for days on end. But his parents Anita and Neil, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, face an agonising wait because the 9mm lump is so hard to reach that surgery could do Harvey more harm than good. Ticking time bomb: He looks just like any happy five-year-old, but Harvey Hawkins lives with a lump on his brain which could kill him at any time, and his parents have no choice but to let it grow until surgeons can reach it . Doting: Harvey's parents Anita and Neil (pictured), from Milton Keynes, keep a close eye on his symptoms . They have been told they must wait for the non-cancerous cyst to grow before surgeons have a hope of removing it, even though it can cause severe brain damage and even sudden death. If the cyst grows it will begin to . stop vital fluids from entering his brain, which means his parents must keep a keen eye on his symptoms and take him for regular brain scans. Mrs Hawkins, 37, said: 'If you saw him you wouldn't think there is anything wrong with him. He's just a normal happy little boy, but with a ticking time bomb in his brain. 'We just have to wait for the worst to come and then it is a matter of time whether we can save him. It could be tomorrow or it could be in 20 years, but once it grows too big it can cause sudden death. 'It's very hard to live with but we will try our utmost to save him when it comes to the worst.' Mrs Hawkins, 37, said: 'We just have to wait for the worst to come and then it is a matter of time whether we can save him. It could be tomorrow or it could be in 20 years, but it can cause sudden death' Colloid cysts are rare, making up just 1.5 per cent of brain tumours according to the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. The jelly-like masses are usually found on the third ventricle, one of four fluid-filled structures which provide a core for the brain and help protect it. Although they are not cancerous, they have the same life-threatening effects as any abnormal lump. They push other cells out of their way and cause symptoms including headaches, vomiting and even sudden death. Despite the cysts measuring up to 5cm in extreme cases, medics are unable to agree on what causes them. Harvey's symptoms first showed just before Christmas last year when he began to vomit, but he was initially turned away from . the doctor with suspected gastritis. His mother took him back to the doctor two days later when the vomiting refused to stop, and he was admitted to hospital where he remained for five days for tests. But he was sent home again, and returned only once he began vomiting violently on Christmas Day. The little boy had an MRI scan at . Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital which confirmed he had a colloid cyst on the third ventricle of his brain. Surgeons analysed the amount of pressure the cyst was placing on Harvey's brain and decided operating on it would be more risky than leaving it until it became easier to reach. Now the family have to rush Harvey to hospital whenever there is a slight change in his condition. 'If his temperature goes above 37 degrees, or he has weakness in his limbs we have to act fast,' his mother said. 'I had a call from his school that he was complaining his eyes were hurting, we spent three hours in A&E and it turned out he was just tired - but we can't take any chances. 'They call it a ""sit and wait"" condition as there is nothing we can do. We try to put it to the back of our minds and to live a normal life, but this is reality.' Fundraising: Harvey's parents want to take him on holidays while he is still guaranteed to enjoy them . Sarah Lindsell, chief executive of the Brain Tumour Charity which offers advice and support to patients and their families, said: 'Our hearts go out to Harvey and his family. 'Being told that your child has a potentially life-threatening condition is every parent's worst nightmare. 'It is even more agonising - and frightening - to be told you must wait before any treatment is possible. 'The most important thing is that Harvey's family and those around him know exactly what to look out for and who to speak to on his medical team if they are worried at any point that things have changed.' The family is raising money to take Harvey on holidays while he is still guaranteed to enjoy them, including to Lourdes in France, where his devout Catholic parents believe he could be healed. 'I want him to get blessed so that when the operation comes, he will be okay,' his mother said.

"Neymar is a fitness worry for Brazilâs quarter-final against Colombia after Luiz Felipe Scolari voiced his annoyance at the âtreatmentâ the hostsâ star man was receiving. The 22-year-old knocked in the winning penalty against Chile as they stumbled through a tricky last-16 tie. Scolari, whose relief at the result was palpable as he spoke about their luck in going through, was angry at the force in which Neymar has had to deal with. Heavy knock: Neymar is a doubt for Brazil's quarter-final clash against Colombia on Friday night . Star quality: The 22-year-old slotted home the decisive penalty against Chile in the last-16 on Saturday . Breaking down: Neymar was overwhelmed when the hosts scraped past their South American rivals . âWe have four or five days to get Neymar in shape for the next match. It is a big problem, his thigh is swollen,â he said. âI remember when I was Portugal coach and, in the fifth minute of the game, Netherlands defender Khalid Boulahrouz broke Cristiano Ronaldo in half and he had to go off 10 minutes later. âWhen I saw Neymar after the game today I remembered that. Some people say Neymar falls too easily. He fell three times.â It had looked for all the world that the hosts would be dumped out of the competition towards the end of a tense extra time when Mauricio Pinilla thrashed the crossbar, but they â largely thanks to the heroics of goalkeeper Julio Cesar â rolled on to the quarter-finals. Scolari freely admits that the shootout win, and indeed the three games preceding that, havenât been virtuoso performances by any stretch â a pattern that is worrying the Brazilian public. That was evident in Belo Horizonte on Saturday night, with screeches only matched in volume by gasps as their team lost momentum against a vibrant Chilean outfit, mirrored by sombre television commentary. The head coach is all too aware that they are finding expectation levels tough to deal with and said after the penalty win: âIf you don't exploit the few opportunities you get, you can go out. âWe almost paid the price in the 118th minute when the ball hit the bar. âWe had three or four chances to score a (second) goal and didn't do it. We had even possession and more shots on goal, but when you don't score you always run more of a risk.â Going through: Head coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was a relieved man as Brazil progressed in Belo Horizonte . Got down low: Goalkeeper Julio Cesar was the hero of the hour after saving two Chilean penalties . VIDEO Brazil breathe a sigh of relief . Cesar â who was captured in tears even before the spot-kicks were taken - wasnât quite as pragmatic as his boss in the aftermath, although did reiterate the enormous weight dumped at the door of the squad. He said: âWe had a good first half and created a lot of chances. After the equaliser Chile came into the game and made life hard for us. All we can do is thank the fans and our team-mates for keeping the faith. âThere's huge pressure in representing our country, and it was tough on a psychological and emotional level. I got very emotional four years ago, and today I was crying again, but this time out of happiness. âNot many people know what I've been through, but I knew my international career wasn't over. We've got three more steps to go now and I want to see Brazil celebrating. That's my big dream.â","Barcelona forward picked up a thigh injury against Chile .

"For several long minutes at the end the boy wonder of Brazil 2014 stood alone in the middle of the mighty Maracana, looking up at his own face staring back at him from a giant screen, taking it all in. James Rodriguez had scored twice to send himself soaring to the top of this World Cupâs goal charts. Step down a rung Senor Messi and Herr Muller. The first, that exocet volley on the turnÂ  from well outside the box after chesting the ball down, has to be the most magnificent of all here so far. Stand down a notch Messrs Cahill and Van Persie. Scroll down to see highlights of Colombia . Unstoppable: James Rodriguez scored the tournament's best goal as Colombia beat Uruguay . Next big thing: James Rodriguez is top of the World Cup scoring charts with five goals . The second ensured that Uruguay went home unlamented in the lurid wake of Luis Suarez. It also made certain that Master James and the rest of the boys from Bogota dance on Â - some celebration that disco jig of theirs by the way Â - to a quarter final against Brazil. Colombia have put a smile as wide the Copacabana beach on the face of this football spectacular. Long may it last. Although when the pulses stops racing and the cheers die down you are left to examine the reality. The starting point for putting this gem of a team from emerald city into perspective is England. Had Rooney, Gerrard and Co come through to the Maracana on Saturday night instead of Uruguay the high probability is that they would not just have been beaten but horribly embarrassed by Colombiaâs Latin American skills. VIDEOÂ Team Profile: Colombia - highlights . On target: James Rodriguez scores his second goal in the 2-0 defeat of Uruguay . Sunshine boys: Colombia's skills and personality have made them a favourite for neutrals . And although football is not an exact science of comparison, it is just as likely that had Roy Hodgsonâs team been required to face the Chileans who went so agonisingly close to ending the Brazilian dream, then they would have been despatched as readily as Spain. World class: James Rodriguez has scored the best goal of the World Cup so far . The Â logicial analysis Â is that England were the weakest link in an unexpectedly poor group. So while we relish the ball-juggling delights and youthful exuberance of Colombia, their excursion to Fortaleza on Friday may be as far as they go. Brazil are not setting their homeland alight as of yet but they were marginally better than Chile and withstood the enormous pressure of that penalty shoot-out to keep the World Cup alive and the socio-economic protesters on the back burner. Do not expect Colombia to give them quite such a torrid time. As the modern gameâs heirs to the good old-fashioned ball dribblers of yesteryear they are a handful for anyone. But they are not possessed of the slick, angled running without possession which is Â at the crux of that bewildering one-touch inter-passing, the hall-mark of the best teams in this tournament. Colombia are a collection of richly talented individuals, each of whom is eager for the most part to try to win games on his own. They did combine together brilliantly to create Rodriguezâs second goal but such collaboration is not their stock in trade. Of all possible opponents in the last eight, Brazil have to be the most daunting for Colombia. Not only because they the favourites and have home advantage but because they grew up among ball jugglers like these and consequently understand how to cope with them better than any other football nation. Still, it will be fun watching Colombia carry it to them. VIDEO Memorable Matches: Colombia v Chile . Big ask: Colombia face a tough challenge of beating Brazil in their home country . Rodriquez the 22-year-old prodigy is but one of half a dozen players capable of running any defender ragged. Martinez, Gutierrez, Cuadrado and full backs Zuniag and Armero also gave Uruguay fits. But they play a game to which Brazil are long accustomed and onto which Big Phil Scolari has soldered on some contemporary, steel-tipped organisation. Rodriguez has arrived today and is a stellar prospect for a glittering future. Whether or not tomorrow can come as quickly as this Friday, we should all Â enjoy Colombia while we can.

"It was Grigor Dimitrovâs girlfriend, Maria Sharapova, who once joked that her movement on clay resembled âa cow on iceâ. It would be unfair to pin that label on the supremely athletic Bulgarian, but in the course of Fridayâs exhilarating Wimbledon semi-final he may have set an unofficial record for slipping over on the coarsened Centre Court grass. That may prove the most enduring memory of an afternoon of spills and thrills that resulted in Novak Djokovic winning 6-4 3-6 7-6 7-6 to set up a meeting with either Roger Federer or Canadian Milos Raonic. VIDEO Scroll down to watch defeat semi-finalist Grigor Dimitrov's quickfires questions . Relief: Novak Djokovic celebrates after defeating Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon on Thursday . Spent: Dimitrov sinks to his knees after losing against Djokovic on Centre Court . Respect: The duo embrace after fighting it out over four thrilling sets in SW19 . Just as Sharapova eventually found her footing on the clay to the extent that she has won two French Open titles, you suspect that Dimitrov will similarly master the turf and be back one day as a Wimbledon champion. He has proved this week in performances against Andy Murray, and now the 27-year-old Serb, that this is well within his compass, provided he can discover the consistent mental application that will be required. As much as his young millionaireâs backside constantly bumping onto the hallowed lawn was a reason for defeat it was his occasional lapses at inopportune times that proved his undoing against such a magnificent competitor. With Sharapova looking down from his competitorâs box it could so easily have gone into a decider, had Dimitrov mustered a little more composure on the quartet of set points he created in the fourth. Ouch: The Bulgarian grimaces as he does the splits after slipping on the dry grass . Another man down: Djokovic spends some time on his back after another gruelling point ends . As it is Djokovic will contest the thirteenth Grand Slam final of his career and try to arrest a run, beginning here a year ago, which has seen him lose the last three. As if he needs any more incentive, one more win would take him back to the world number one spot. He was quick to give credit to his opponent, saying: 'I played against a future star, he is already a top player with quality shots and a great touch.,' he said. 'Like in my last match (against Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals) I allowed my opponent back in. âItâs a big challenge now for me as I have lost my last few Grand Slam finals when I could have won them all.' He will be battle hardened this time after a tough campaign here and just about avoided his fate of last year, when Juan Martin Del Potro dragged him into a marathon five setter and softened him up for Andy Murray. Nobody will relish the challenge more this time than the man from Kosovan mountains, so driven by national pride. The established stars have been somewhat under siege at this yearâs Wimbledon, but nobody was going to mount more of a stand against them than Djokovic. In previous years he has not enjoyed the dusty expanses that develop around the back of the court late in the championships but, ever the great problem solver, his movement has looked more comfortable this time. The Bulgarian is fine athlete and his falls highlighted that Wimbledon needs to try and come up with a solution to the condition of the baseline as it appears to have deteriorated more in the last two years and someone might get injured. Perhaps the option of clay court footwear is called for in the latter rounds. Gripped: Maria Sharapova, Dimitrov's girlfriend watches on anxiously from the players' box . Dimitrov is of a similar elastic body type to Djokovic and made some incredible âgetsâ while slipping all over the place. Yet it was serving from a static position that often proved a problem with eight double faults. There was one at 2-4 in the first tiebreak and 6-6 in the second, and three consecutive ones in the third game of the fourth set. Against Murray there was also the occasional poor game but Djokovic was able to exact a higher price. In warm but breezy conditions the first set raced by in 27 minutes and brief encounter beckoned when the Serb broke for 3-2 in the end. But Dimitrov then produced four inspired games, featuring his glorious volleying skills, to level the match. Winner: Djokovic hits a forehand as he progressed through to the Wimbledon final . Stretch: Dimitrov reaches for a high ball during his tussle with the No 1 seed from Serbia . Look of despair: The world No 2 sees a ball disappear past his flailing racquet after a shot from Dimitrov . At his best: Djokovic shows off his magnificent defensive skills as he moves into his third SW19 final . Spectator's view: Djokovic and Dimitrov slug it out on Centre Court . His sliced backhand was causing particular problems but Djokovic responded by coming forward more, doubtless urged by coach Boris Becker. He saved a break point at 3-4 and in the ensuing tiebreak benefitted from the double fault and an ill-chosen drop shot, symptomatic of the Bulgarianâs sometimes skittish shot selection. When the three double faults led to him going 2-2 down in the fourth it looked over, only for Dimitrov to respond with a fighting instinct that must have had his girlfriend purring with pride. Tough: Djokovic made hard work of match against Andy Murray's quarter-final conqueror . Djokovic was . so pumped to save a first set point at 4-5 that he led out a blood . curdling yell, and then in the tiebreak had cause to be grateful for his . opponentâs charity when he let slip a lead of 6-3. There . was the lack of a killer punch when he needed it and Djokovic was not . afraid to move further up the court away from the troublesome areas . around the back. He clinched it 9-7 and afterwards expressed the hope that the crowd had enjoyed it, which they surely did. Next: The No 1 seed will play Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final on Sunday .

"A woman who was just 14 when she accompanied her 19-year-old boyfriend on a killing spree is set to ask for a pardon 57 years after she was jailed, insisting she didn't kill anybody and her sentence was unfair. Caril Ann Fugate, now 71, was on a two-month road trip with notorious mass murderer Charles Starkweather from Lincoln, Nebraska, to Wyoming  when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 58. High school dropout Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed for his crimes in September 1959. Fugate, who says she was forced to accompany the killer, was found guilty of being an accessory to first-degree murder in connection with the death of 17-year-old victim Robert Jensen. She was sentenced to life but was released after 17 years. Defense attorney John Stevens Berry, who wrote a book earlier this year suggesting Fugate was unfairly convicted, is backing her plea and is hoping the move will become a campaign issue in the Nebraska gubernatorial race, according to theÂ Omaha World Herald. Scroll down for video . Plea: Caril Ann Fugate (pictured left at 15) was on a road trip with  mass murderer Charles Starkweather (then 19) between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Wyoming when he killed 11 people between 1957 and 1958 . Defiance: Fugate (pictured with her late husband Frederick in 2013) has always maintained her innocence and has the backing of several attorneys who say her sentence was unjust . The killings began with the death of 21-year-old Robert Colvert, who was robbed, abducted and shot in late 1957. His body was later discovered on a country road. Two months later authorities found many other bodies including those of Fugate's stepfather Marion Bartlett, 57 and his 35-year-old wife Velda, in an outbuilding. Their two-year-old daughter, Betty Jean, had been clubbed to death with the butt of a gun and her body stuffed in a cardboard box. Fugate admitted taking $4 from Jensen's wallet just before he and a friend, Carol King, 16, were shot to death. One of the main factors in her conviction was that she was holding a shotgun at the time. She was initially sentenced to life, but the term was later reduced to between 30 and 50 years. This meant she was eligible for parole in 1976 and was released after serving 17 years of her sentence because she had been considered a 'model prisoner'. Killer: Starkweather (pictured in a Converse County jail cell) was arrested following the two-month killing spree which lasted between December 1957 and January 1958. He was given the death penalty . Sentence: After serving 17 months in prison, Starkweather was put to death in the electric chair in 1959 after being found guilty of killing Robert Jenson, the only murder he was tried for . In 1996, she asked for a pardon saying the 'sentence did not fit the crime', also telling the newspaper: 'Everyone knows I never killed anyone.' However the request was turned down. Mr Berry, a Lincoln attorney who published The Twelfth Victim earlier this year, claimsÂ Starkweather told investigators several times that Fugate was not involved in the slayings . But he changed his story just before they went to trial. Starkweather ultimately testified that Fugate was a willing participant in the murder spree. 'His lies convicted Caril,' Berry told the paper. 'We are convinced not only that she was treated illegally and unjustly, but was, in fact, innocent.' He added that he will survey the candidates for governor, attorney general and secretary of state â the three offices that comprise the Pardons Board. This is so he can determine where voters stand on the request. Attempts: Fugate (pictured in 1958) was released in 1976 after serving 17 years in prison. In 1996 she asked for a pardon on the grounds the sentence 'did not fit the crime'. Her plea however was rejected . When Fugate was released, she is believed to have moved to Lansing, Michigan, where she worked as a janitor and medical technician. In 2007, Fugate married Fredrick Clair, a machinist who also worked as a weather observer for the National Weather Service. She now lives in Hillsdale, Michigan. Fugate's stepson states she suffered a series of strokes in her late 60s. In August last year, she was critically injured in a car crash in Stryker, Ohio, that killed her husband. Starkweather's murders are the most notorious in Nebraska's history and have been depicted in films and TV programs. The 1973 film Badlands starring Martin Sheen was based on the killing spree.","Caril Ann Fugate, 71, was with Charles Starkweather during the 1957 killing spree that spanned Nebraska and Wyoming .

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mark Cavendish say the British support has been phenomenal . Warning: Marcel Kittel, of Germany, has warned Yorkshire's roads could be too narrow for the Tour de France . Narrow: The German favourite claimed the winding streets, enclosed by dry stone walls, were 'risky' for competitors. Above, a particularly 'dangerous' part of the course is Buttertubs Pass in the Yorkshire Dales . He said the roads will likely be made even more dangerous as more than four million spectators line the walls, narrowing the path and potentially leading to accidents. 'There will be lots of spectators... where can they go if there are stone walls? Iâm curious as to what is going to happen,' the favourite told Cycling News. 'Itâs a fact weâll be using some very narrow roads. Iâm sure for ridersâ safety it would be better if they were wider.' Kittel, who made his Tour de France debut in 2012, is one of British cyclist Mark Cavendish's main rivals in the opening stage, with both of them vying to win the green jersey as the fastest sprinter.

"Sir Dave Brailsford has risked the wrath of British cycling fans by setting himself the astonishing target of delivering a first FRENCH Tour de France winner in 30 years. After masterminding Great Britainâs Olympic cycling success, Brailsford created a âBritishâ pro team at Team Sky with the sole intention of delivering a first British Tour winner. It was central to his mission statement at the launch of Team Sky in February 2009. But in an interview with the French sports daily LâEquipe, Brailsford said: âWe have won the Tour with a British rider, but when are we going to see a French rider win the Tour? That would be enormous.â VIDEO Scroll down to see Vincenzo Nibali take the yellow jersey after his stage win . Favouring the French: Brailsford says a French Tour winner 'needs to happen' Asked if a French winner would be his next objective, he replied: âYes, I would like to win with a French rider. âI think it needs to happen. For the Tour, for France, for the French, for the sport, having a French winner would be massive. âI think about it often. France deserves a French winner.â It was only a few months ago that Brailsford stepped down as performance director of British cycling, having concluded it was proving too much to combine the role with his job as team principal at Sky. But there is no doubt that Team Sky has benefitted from the relationship that continues with British cycling â and vice versa of course - and the desire to deliver a French champion could be unpalatable to many of those involved. Particularly when there is such a sharing of resources that has even extended to their headquarters in Manchester. Popular: British cycling fans have been happy with Brailsford's impact but may not like his latest comments . Winning formula: Brailsford's work helped make Bradley Wiggins Tour De France winner... Winning formula: ...and then helped Chris Froome to celebrate another British Tour triumph . Brailsford is now looking to establish a permanent HQ in Nice for the pro team. But there is Â£30million of public money invested in the British team building towards the Rio Olympics in 2016 and that will be supporting some of Skyâs riders. When Sky announced their plans to launch a pro cycling team in February 2009, they celebrated âthe creation of a professional British road cycling teamâ to be âmanaged by Great Britain Olympic performance director Dave Brailsford CBEâ. The statement added: âTeam Sky will build on the principles that make British riders a consistent success on the track and will support Skyâs work as Principal Partner of British Cycling, fuelling the sport from grass roots to elite level. âTeam Sky will aim to create the first British winner of the Tour de France, within five years.â In the statement Brailsford said: âThis will be an epic story; building a British team to take on the best in professional cycling, and win.â It added that âTeam Sky will have a core of British ridersâ. Brailsford has delivered, with Chris Froome following Sir Bradley Wiggins in becoming the second British winner of the Tour in two years last time round. Froome is the favourite to win again this year to establish an era of dominance for Sky. Not since Bernard Hinault in 1985 have the French had a winner of their race. Willing public: Interest in cycling is on the rise, topped by Britain's Tour de France hosting . Management: Brailsford is shown here with British favourite Chris Froome but it seems he prefers the French . A fluent French speaker, Brailsford may be guilty of nothing more than trying to please his audience the day before the Tour rolls into France, but with Wiggins and Pete Kennaugh among those omitted from Skyâs nine-man Tour team, there are only two Britons riding in Froome and Geraint Thomas. Many of Team Skyâs rivals select riders predominantly from their country of origin. FDJ has nine French riders, Europcar eight Frenchmen, Belkin seven Dutchmen and Movistar seven Spaniards. In fairness to Brailsford, he has long insisted riders would not be selected based on their passports. From a total squad of 28 at Sky, there are in fact nine British riders. Leading the pack: But unlike other teams, Team Sky don't just boast cyclists from their main country .

"Neymar has potentially cooked up a World Cup storm by sporting a pair of Beats by Dre headphones - even after players were specifically told they were banned from the tournament. Brazil's talisman wore the merchandise at a press conference on Wednesday ahead of their quarter-final against Colombia in two days time. The incident comes after world governing body FIFA struck an agreement with Sony for the rights during the month-long showpiece. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar practice his cocky stutter penalty in Brazil training . Cooking up a storm? Neymar was pictured wearing the banned Beats headphones in Brazil on Wednesday . Did he realise? All players at the World Cup were told they mustn't wear the banned merchandise by FIFA . Neymar was talking at the base for Luiz Felipe Scolari's side in Teresopolis before a clash with the James Rodriguez-inspired Colombians in Fortaleza. The 22-year-old dragged the Selecao kicking and screaming through the group stages, finding the net four times, before smoothly knocking in the decisive penalty against Chile in the last-16. Any lingering fitness worries were quashed by Neymar himself, who declared himself fit. 'I am able to play against Colombia, he said. 'I have no pain. I feel very well trained and rest assured, I'm fine.' Players from all 32 competing countries were told they mustn't wear Beats' product during media briefings and on matchdays. They were all sent free pairs of Sony's gear to wear, but few have been spotted using them. Marketing experts say that only amplifies their appeal. 'When . fans see World Cup athletes wearing Beats in their downtime, by choice, . it has as much impact as seeing them lace their Adidas (boots) or sip a . sponsored beverage,' strategist Ellen Petry Leanse, a former Apple and .

With all the difficulties we reached the semi-finals. We are a hard-working team, we win together and lose together. 'The crash was also the coaching . staff, the fans, it was overall, no one understood, and the team from . Germany, which is good, took the opportunity. 'I cannot explain, I will not justify. An error occurred and this error was fatal. 'If I could explain what happened in those six minutes, I would answer. But I do not know.' 'We can lose by one or two but we lost in a way that we had never done before in the history of Brazilian football.' How the media reacted: Meia Hora's front page says 'Will Not Cover', seeking to ignore any mention of the embarrassment (and says how another goal was scored by Germany while they were editing it), while Lance list a few words of feeling; Pain, Indignation and Revolt and Shame amongst them . No way back: Oscar and Fred stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on Tuesday . Who's at fault? Brazil lost 7-1 in their own back yard, breaking a few unwanted records along the way . 'After the World Cup we will submit a report to the board of the CBF where you will see the good and the bad that we did and then it depends on the direction,' he added. 'This is not going through my head right now. 'I will continue with my life, the players will also continue to be winners and we must continue - you can not end the life of the players for it. 'History will have to record that Brazil, for the first time since 2002, reached the semi-finals.'

"British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha arriving at the annual Conservative Party Black and White Fundraising Ball . A doorstep lender, property magnates and a Ukrainian-born energy tycoon were among guests worth Â£22billion who attended the Tories' biggest fundraising event. The news will add to concerns that the country's richest people enjoy privileged access to David Cameron and his Cabinet ministers. A secret table plan for the 570 guests at the party's Black And White Ball in February reveals many are placed next to ministers whose portfolios are linked to their financial interests. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was seated with directors of CLC Finance, a doorstep-lending company that offers loans at 769.9 per cent annual interest. The Government has been accused of going soft on payday lenders, which charge exorbitant interest rates that leave many customers unable to afford repayments. The analysis of the seating plan at the ball in Old Billingsgate Market in the City of London, was carried out by The Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. There is no suggestion that guests â who pay Â£450 to Â£1,000 each for seats â discussed policy or their business interests with ministers and MPs. The then housing minister Kris Hopkins sat with property executives Bruce Ritchie and Paul Munford who arrange the purchase of trophy homes for multi-millionaire foreigners. Michael Fallon, who was then energy minister, dined with Alexander Temerko, Ukrainian-born owner of Tyneside firm Offshore Group Newcastle, or OGN, which supplies the offshore renewable energy industry and has donated to MPs whose constituencies are earmarked for wind farms. Mr Temerko and OGN have given at least Â£537,655 to the Tories since February 2012. David Cameron shared a table with Lord Chelsea, whose family is worth Â£4.2billion and is among London's most prominent hereditary landowners. Campaigners said last night it was wrong that party political functions such as conferences and fundraisers were exempt from rules obliging ministers to declare all meetings. Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee for Standards in Public Life, said: 'It is worrying that the Conservative Party, the party of government, should continue to hold fundraising events in such a 'hole in the corner' manner. 'The public does not know â and has a right to know â that these events are taking place, together with who is attending, from the industries and the Government, so we can track over the forthcoming months if policy sweeteners have been promised as an incentive to attract donations.' Michael Fallon, who was then energy minister, dined with Alexander Temerko, Ukrainian-born owner of Tyneside firm Offshore Group Newcastle, or OGN, which supplies offshore renewable energy industry . Labour MP Karl Turner said: 'If anybody wanted further proof of how David Cameron and top Tories rub shoulders with tycoons and oligarchs, here it is. There are serious questions of whether Government policy is being dictated by powerful vested interests.' A Tory Party spokesman said: 'All donations are declared and published by the Electoral Commission. Lists of all ministerial meetings with external organisations are published on a quarterly basis. Ministers meet a range of organisations. 'Any suggestion that policy is influenced by donations is malicious and defamatory and will be treated as such.' A spokesman for OGN said: 'Any allegation that there was any attempt by Mr Temerko or OGN or its representatives to influence policy in relation to wind farms is false.'

Mats Hummels and Christoph Kramer are considered to be among those suffering after Hummels missed Germanyâs second round tie against Algeria, while Kramer sat out an entire day of training this week. Hummels, certainly, was hit by more than a sore throat, with Low admitting that the Dortmund star was bed ridden for the Algeria match, his condition having worsened the night before. Thomas Muller is also suspected to be among those affected. His coach admitted that the Bayern forward had shown 'symptoms of the flu' even before Germanyâs last game. As for the reasons for the sudden plague, Low blames the climate in Brazil, and the constant necessity to travel. âWeâre constantly having to travel . between different climate zones,â the Germany boss complained.

Germany have certainly seen some extreme weather during their stay in Brazil. For their opening game against Portugal, they were forced to endure thirty degree heat, while their win over the USA was played out in the flooded city of Recife. It is a particularly sensitive issue for this German team, given that fitness has been one of the major issues surrounding their World Cup campaign. Several of their key players, including Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Miroslav Klose, arrived in Brazil having only just returned from long term injury. With Shkodran Mustafi ruled out of the rest of the tournament, and seven other players gripped by what the Germans call âGrippeâ, Lowâs hopes of having a team at 100 per cent physical fitness are now little more than a pipe dream.

"When junior doctor Ed Holloway took time off sick, colleagues were happy to cover for him. But after he returned to work with a suntan â even though the weather at home had been miserable â they became suspicious. However, it was when one of them recognised his voice on the TV commentary for a show-jumping event in the US that they realised they had fallen for an audacious con. Far from being at home recovering from his illness, the urologist had been moonlighting by making TV appearances at top eventing competitions. Scroll down for video . Moonlighting: Ed Holloway on screen. After he returned to work from sick leave with a suntan â even though the weather at home had been miserable â his colleagues became suspicious . Mr Holloway was sacked and has now been struck off after a disciplinary panel ruled his repeated dishonesty was âfundamentally incompatibleâ with working as a doctor. In an interview for an Australian broadcaster in 2011, in which he claimed he was also a qualified lawyer, Mr Holloway agreed his commentary career was âa labour of loveâ, saying he did television work at Burghley and Badminton as well as in Poland, Sweden and âabout six eventsâ in the US. Asked why with the âenormous amount of commitmentâ to qualifying for medicine he was still commentating, he replied: âI love the commentary â my mother asks the same question regularly.â Mr Holloway also joked the idea of treating patients was âscaryâ compared to commentating. A panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard he continued to moonlight as a commentator in 2012 despite securing a post as a junior urologist at Scunthorpe General Hospital. He took sick leave around weekends and even showed up after one âspell of illnessâ with a suntan in late September, despite the miserable UK weather, the panel heard. He was forced to admit the truth after a colleague recognised his voice from the Horse and Country channel, being shown on Sky. When challenged, the panel heard Mr Holloway told managers he had been âstupidâ but had not been in âa great placeâ, adding that he was âsorry and ashamedâ. Asked why with the âenormous amount of commitmentâ to qualifying for medicine he was still commentating, he replied: âI love the commentary â my mother asks the same question regularly' He was sacked in April last year after a Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust investigation found he had been commentating on events when he had claimed to be off sick between September and November 2012. The University of Leicester graduate took time off to attend an event at Plantation Field, Philadelphia. He also commentated in Boekelo, in the Netherlands and missed work while on a flight from California. He admitted one count of fraud at Scunthorpe Magistrates Court in July 2013, was fined Â£700 and ordered to repay an overpayment of his salary of Â£708.35. Mr Holloway, who has been suspended from practising since June last year, had hoped to convince the Manchester panel to let him resume medicine. The doctor was caught out when a Â colleague recognised his voice on the TV commentary for a show-jumping event. File picture . But chairman Carrie Ryan-Palmer told him his repeated dishonesty was âfundamentally incompatibleâ with working as a doctor and âillustrated a deep seated desire to place your own interests above those of your patients and demonstrated a cavalier attitude to patient safetyâ. âThe panel determined that your behaviour, repeated dishonesty, lack of insight and lack of remediation are fundamentally incompatible with your continuing to practise medicine,â she said. The decision to strike him off the medical register was taken last week but announced yesterday. Mr Holloway has the right to appeal within the next month.

When the skin cells reach -20C, the cells are killed and the blemish eradicated in between five and 90 seconds. IS IT SAFE? There may be some tingling, similar to a nettle sting, while the procedure takes place. In some cases a blister may form in the initial 24 hours after treatment.

"Sleeping too much in middle age can be justÂ  as bad for you as not having enough, it emerged yesterday. A study of almost 9,000 people found those agedÂ  50 to 64 who slept for less than six hours a night or more than eight had worse memories and decision-making abilities. But brain power was only reduced for older adults of 65 to 89 if they slept too long. Get up! Everyone loves a lie-in, but a study suggested doing it regularly when we're older could be bad for us . The dangers of having tooÂ  little sleep are well established, but the latest study, carried out by experts at the University of Warwick, indicates that an excess can create similar problems. Researcher Dr Michelle Miller said the results also suggest that the amount of sleep we need â and its affect on the body and brain â changes with age. Co-author Professor Francesco Cappuccio claimed getting just the right amount of sleep among the elderly could even prevent the age-related mental decline that can result in dementia. He added: âSleep is important for good health and mental wellbeing. Optimising sleep at an older age may help to delay the decline in brain function seen with age, or may slow or prevent the rapid decline that leads to dementia.â Dr Miller said: âSix to eight hours of sleep per night is particularly important for optimum brain function in younger adults. These results are consistent with our previous research, which showed six to eight hours per night was optimal for physical health, including lowest risk of developing obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.â Among the older adults there was a significant relationship between their quality of sleep and cognitive skills. Previous research has shown that getting enough sleep is essential because the brain cleanses itself while the body is asleep, getting rid of harmful toxins accumulated during the day. Most people can't help nodding off early in life, but research suggests we need to less as we age . But it is less clear why too much sleep would be bad. One theory is that sleeping for long periods reduces the quality of sleep â making a restless period of slumber more likely. Disturbed sleep can impair memory, shrink the brain and create stress. Anyone whose body clock is regularly disrupted, such as nursing mothers and shift staff, is vulnerable. Existing research has linked oversleeping to a host of medical problems, including diabetes and heart disease. But researchers say the link might be partly because oversleeping is common among the poor and unemployed and those who suffer from depression â groups who are more likely to have health problems. The findings, published in the journal Plos One, were based on data from 3,968 men and 4,821 women in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. They logged the quality and quantity of their sleep over one month. It comes a month after scientists from Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Manchester and Surrey universities said too many people ignored the importance of sleep, creating health and mental problems. Professor Russell Foster, a neuroscientist at Oxford, said: âWe are the supremely arrogant species. We feel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact that we have evolved under a light-dark cycle. What we do as a species is override the clock. And long-term acting against the clock can lead to serious health problems.â","Scientists examined almost 9,000 English people in long-term study .

"A major hunt is underway to find Britain's most prolific petrol thief who has been driving off without paying for fuel for two years after escaping detectives by donning fake number plates and wigs. Officers have linked the thief to 29 separate incidents in Devon and Cornwall and said the con-artist has made off with thousands of pounds worth of fuel during the spree. However, thanks to an array of disguises including woolly hats, hoodies and wigs, officers have been unable to identify the offender and aren't even certain if they are a man, a woman or a transvestite. Officers have linked the thief to 29 separate incidents in Devon and Cornwall and said the con artist has made off with thousands of pounds worth of fuel during her spree. The thief is pictured here wearing a blonde wig . Police have so far been unable to identify the suspect due to the varying disguises used in each offence. Officers said the offender has regularly used fake number plates and swaps them before and after the crime . Devon and Cornwall Police said witnesses have described the suspect as female in 19 offences, male in seven cases, and 'indistinguishable' in the remaining three. The only firm lead the force has is the silver Vauxhall Zafira that has been picked up repeatedly on CCTV despite the fraudster using a variety of cloned plates. The scammer's spree began in September 2012 when the mystery suspect refuelled at an Esso garage in Plymouth, Devon. Over the following two years, the same offender targeted petrol stations across the South West including at Texaco, Esso and Morrisons and each time made off with between Â£55 and Â£85 of free fuel. Police said the suspect is most likely a woman, but said they can't rule out a male transvestite either. Detective Constable Zara Payne, who is leading the investigation, said: 'The most frequent report is of a woman, sometimes in long blonde wig, or a short bob-cut wig, or wearing a beanie hat or hoody. In some cases the suspect dons a wig, while in others they put on a beanie hat or shield their face with a hoody . Police have released CCTV of the offender in the hope of identifying the thief who started the spree in 2012 . 'But while the same car has been reported at each of the 29 incidents on a few occasions the victim says they think the driver was a man. 'We're keeping an open mind and seeing as this woman appears to go to great lengths to disguise herself, it may well be her impersonating a man. 'What is very clear is over the past two or more years, this woman has stolen thousands of pounds worth of fuel. 'It's quite possible she hasn't paid a penny for her fuel in the last couple of years. 'She's very brazen about it, sometimes returning to the same location two or three times within a few months. Police said 29 incidents have been reported, with 19 witnesses describing the thief as a woman, seven describing them as a man and three suggesting the sex is 'indistinguishable' In each theft, police said the thief takes between Â£55 and Â£85 worth of fuel before driving off without paying . 'These thefts are not spur of the moment. We know she is going prepared, with a set of disguises which she carries with her in the car. 'We also know she is using cloned number plates, which we believe she is changing shortly before and after each of these thefts. Police have now released these CCTV images of the suspect in the hope someone will be able to help police in identifying them. Det. Con Payne added: 'Someone out there knows this woman. She may be boasting about her actions, or they have seen her disguises in a car matching the silver Vauxhall Zafira. 'She clearly has no intention of paying for her fuel, seeing it as something only other people have to do.' Police have managed to link each of the 29 offences due to the car - a Vauxhall Zafira - being used by the thief .

"Germany's Tour de France sprint supremacy continued in Champagne country on Thursday as Andre Greipel triumphed in Reims. The 194-kilometre sixth stage from Arras took place on wet roads, with crashes accounting for a number of riders. VIDEO Scroll down for highlights . Elation: Germany's Andre Greipel crosses the finish line to win the sixth stage of the Tour de France . Dominant: Greipel's victory marked the fourth stage won by a German out of six . Leader: Italy's Vincenzo Nibali (right) will continue wearing the yellow jersey into the sixth stage . VIDEO Griepel claims first win - highlights . The Giant-Shimano team of Marcel Kittel were conspicuous by their absence in the closing stages until it emerged the winner of stages one, three and four had a problem and would not contend the sprint. It was Greipel (Lotto-Belisol), left out of position in the first three sprints of the Tour, who benefited, the German champion finishing arms aloft for the sixth Tour stage win of his career. Alexander Kristoff (Katusha) was second, with Samuel Dumoulin (Ag2r La Mondiale) third, while Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) finished safely in the pack to retain the race leader's yellow jersey he claimed on stage two in Sheffield. After a chaotic and epic day over the cobbles of stage five which accounted for defending champion Chris Froome, there were further victims of crashes on Thursday. Team Sky's problems continued as Spaniard Xabier Zandio joined Froome in exiting the Tour with a suspected broken collarbone. Tricky: The 194-kilometre sixth stage from Arras took place on wet roads . Froome abandoned on Wednesday's fifth stage after the pain caused by three crashes in two days, with Zandio following after being caught up in a crash after 79km. It means Richie Porte, who inherited the leadership of Team Sky from Froome, now has just six team-mates to call upon with the race less than a week old. Egor Silin (Katusha) also quit after the large crash, which also caught up Arnaud Demare (FDJ), while Jesus Hernandez (Tinkoff-Saxo), a key mountain domestique for Alberto Contador, abandoned soon afterwards. Race leader Nibali called a temporary truce as the peloton slowed to allow those riders embroiled in the crash who were able to continue to rejoin the main bunch. The accidents happened as the speed was increasing in preparation for the intermediate sprint. Slog: The pack rides up a slight gradient during the sixth stage to Reims . The feared crosswinds on the route did little to separate the peloton on a stage which was destined to end in a bunch sprint. The day's four-man breakaway of Jerome Pineau (IAM Cycling), Thomas Leezer (Belkin), Luis Mate (Cofidis) and Arnaud Gerard (Bretagne-Seche Environnemen) led by around one minute 30 seconds with 65km to go. Pineau and Mate tried to prolong the breakaway as their fellow escapees were swept up with 19km remaining, but their forlorn effort did not last long. The sprinters' teams were to the fore in the final 10km, with Omega Pharma-QuickStep working on the front for Mark Renshaw in the absence of Mark Cavendish (shoulder). Picturesque: The feared crosswinds on the route did little to separate the peloton . There were nine roundabouts in the final 5km, but the road was drying out after the wet start.Cannondale, Europcar and Katusha were prominent in the finale, with some interlopers, as Kittel dropped back with an apparent problem. Michal Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) broke clear as the peloton passed through the flamme rouge at 1km to go on the uphill finish and stole some metres, but he was swept up with 300m to go as the sprinters took over. Renshaw burst clear, but Greipel accelerated off his wheel to cross the line arms aloft, leaving everyone else in his wake. After finishing a best of sixth in the previous sprints, Greipel was a relieved man who will have another opportunity on Friday's 234.5km seventh stage from Epernay to Nancy, which is expected to end in a sprint. Memorial: The pack in front of a WWI military cemetery during the 6th stage . Urban to country: The pack passesover a bridge with a flooded sidewalk . Greipel told British Eurosport: 'First of all it was a really nervous day. We had to stay all the time in front. I had a good position all the time. 'At the end maybe it was not a leadout train, but with all the roundabouts it was not possible. 'I had a good wheel with Mark Renshaw. With 250 metres to go I just said to myself I go full now. Whatever will happen will happen. 'There was a lot of pressure on us. Finally we have it. 'The confidence was always there. Okay it was not easy. We just said to ourselves we'll stay calm and go for it.' For Team Sky's Porte it was a difficult day. Porte told British Eurosport: 'It was such a stressful day. It was horrible actually. 'We lost Xabi Zandio to the crash, but the rest of us kept out of trouble and we're here to fight now.' 1. Vincenzo Nibali (Italy / Astana) 24:38:25"" 2. Jakob Fuglsang (Denmark / Astana) +2"" 3.

"I'm a bit of a daredevil and I'll do almost anything. But just moments after I agreed to attend the launch of Thorpe Park's Fright Nights, in a very unlike-me fashion, my stomach sank.

As well as spooky horror attractions, five of Thorpe Park's world-class rollercoasters stay open into the night . Deni doesn't like horror films, and is quite reluctant to get on a rollercoaster. What was she thinking? Cara Delevingne at the launch of Thorpe Parks's Fright Night . To celebrate 13 years, horror author Michael Grant has collaborated to curate 13 new  characters . The launch got off to a good - albeit chilly - start on Wednesday night, with stars from TOWIE and Made In Chelsea attending, as well as supermodel-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne - and the Thorpe Park team looked after us with free cheeseburgers, Krispy Kremes and an open bar. The theme park in Surrey has gone all-out for Halloween - including a new experienced called The Extra Cut. It's an overnight challenge that involves being locked up in the park, then gagged and blindfolded. Thrill-seekers are then chased by a sacrificial cannibal cult who feast upon human flesh, and taken on a horrifying backstage tour of the Thorpe Park Movie Studios and horror mazes. It sounds awful! And I was already having second, third and forth thoughts about just attending the launch night. I had roped in a friend - there was no way I was doing this alone. As the night unfolded, there were terrifying actors in horror costume around every corner to scare the wits out of us - something revellers will also be able to enjoy during the park's Fright Night fest until November 2. US horror author Michael Grant has curated 13 new scare characters for this year's event, to celebrate 13 years of Fright Nights. After filling up on some fast food (probably not the best decision) I decided to brave SAW Alive: The Maze, designed by the same twisted people who created the Saw rollercoaster. You go in in groups and by common assumption the person at the front usually gets the biggest scare as they see everything first and, well, they are basically a human shield for everyone else. My companion and I proceeded to queue up behind barbed wire to go inside. When we reached the front we were set to be first in, so we let a group go in front of us. Unlucky for us, there were seven of them, and only seven to eight go in at a time - so were at the front again. We were finally allowed to join on the back of another group, but they were all screaming teenage girls that begged us to go in front. This was quite embarrassing; a twenty-something woman and man wimping out and making a couple of terrified girls lead the way. However, there was no way I was going first! After filling up on some fast food I braved SAW Alive: The Maze, located right next to the rollercoaster . Saw Alive: The Maze: Deni had to queue up behind barbed wire, then was scared out of her wits inside . An intense briefing began - heart problems? No entry. Epilepsy? No entry. Scare easily? Best not go in! We had a photo-op with a model of the bike-riding Billy puppet, before entering the themed multi-room maze inspired by his nightmarish games. The 'extreme live action' attraction is like a walking ghost train, but with real people acting out horror characters instead of mannequins. The first person we met on our journey was a security guy in his office: red flashing lights, screens showing CCTV footage, loud sirens. He told us it was chaos in there and we must absolutely not go in or we might not make it. Obviously, we had to. That famous scene with the large bathroom was the first room we entered. It was bloodied and gruesome; two actors were acting out a panicked scene. In another room, a woman was chained to a wooden structure, and it seemed like she had been that way for a long time. She was tapping the chain on the side of it; a long, depressed look on her face, like a lab monkey. Then suddenly she went mental, and in a fit of rage started smashing the heavy steel all over the room and everyone screamed and ran. It was intense and highly disturbing, but once we made it out alive, it did feel like fun and games. Costumed characters make sure you're NOT sitting comfortably! Before you go in here, and in fact before every attraction, you get a thorough briefing . Behind each door was a nightmarish being, including people hanging from walls and doors and ceilings . New this year is Thorpe Park's own made up horror movie studio maze, called Studio 13, full of similar jump-out-of-your-skin scare tactics. We tried this one out next,Â strobe lights and smoke obscuring our vision as we entered the room. A tall woman with a slick blonde up-do and dressed in a pencil dress lined us up and told us we were auditioning to act in a horror film. Her spiky face spread into a smile, she started eyeing us all up before stopping at me with her head tilted slightly and slowly walked towards me. I panicked and hid behind my laughing friend. The woman was now very close my heart was pounding; then she sharply looked at the person beside me. A very cool move. She then released us and we were set to explore the studio, where our uncomfortable journey saw us climb through makeshift tunnels into bloodied make up booths, deserted motel themed sets and rooms filled with hanging body bags. After Studio 13 I felt it was time for a rollercoaster, so went on my favourite, Nemesis Inferno. It was so not scary compared to the mazes, and actually super fun. That hyped me up for the next attraction. Cabin In The Woods: The Maze is scariest: there is a horrible CLOWN! Next on our list was Cabin In The Woods: The Maze, which actually won Best Halloween Scare Attraction at the ScareCon SCARs Awards 2014. It was certainly the scariest attraction of the night for me. There was a frightening clown character who picked on me. I screamed and screamed but the clown continued. They even removed their wing and chased me down the corridor! My friend found it hilarious. We entered a rustic cabin scene; just one room with lots of doors and no obvious route - we just had to guess the way, which was quite scary in itself. Behind each door was a nightmarish being, including individuals who looked like they were wearing latex masks orÂ dressed in ghoulish attire - such as nightgowns with wigs but all stained and torn up like they'd been in a fight with a zombie . They would pop out from nowhere in a jerky, deranged fashion, getting close to our faces.Â Some were hanging from doors and ceilings, cornering us and scratching and nipping at our calves, making us jump. Some touched the back of my neck in a soft, creepy way, quickly tugging on my hair when I least expected it which made me jump! I had not screamed that much in ages. The 22-year-old model, dressed in aubergine sweatpants and a camouflage jacket, Â clutching her blue wig . There's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy, slightly damp and chilly night . As well as spooky horror attractions, five of Thorpe Park's world-class rollercoasters stay open into the night, including THE SWARM, Stealth (very fast, very tall), Nemesis Inferno (feet-free and my favourite), Colossus (ten-loop tumble) and SAW - The Ride (with that daunting inverted drop). They're all included in the entry price. All the other actor-led horror attractions - mostly mazes - are also based on cult classic horror films. They include The Blair Witch Project and My Bloody Valentine 3D. As we had only half an hour left in the park, we went on THE SWARM which was scary but not stomach-churning. It was great and I wish I had time to go on again. If you're a bit of a scaredy cat like me, the thing to remember and learn from my experience is - you will be fine! And, being brave is good for you - nothing is as bad as you think. And those who like to be scared will love it! And I think it will actually scare you quite a lot, maybe more than you expect. The acting is truly brilliant, and there's something very eerie about riding rollercoasters on a foggy, slightly damp and chilly night. It's quite surreal and starkly different to my memories of theme parks in the summer sunshine. In fact it's so scary that the theme park has opened a Panic Room to calm guests down. The safe warren is filled with Â 25 bunnies, classical music and lavender trees and  makes for a stark contrast to the grotesque ghouls that roam the grounds during Fright Nights.

"Galatasaray have appointed former Italy manager Cesare Prandelli as their new coach, the Turkish club have announced. The Istanbul outfit, who had held an 'exchange of ideas' with former Manchester United manager David Moyes, were looking for a new coach after parting company with Italian tactician Roberto Mancini last month. Prandelli resigned as Italy boss after the national team's 1-0 defeat by Uruguay at the World Cup that saw them exit the competition early. Moving on: Prandelli resigned as Italy boss after overseeing a disappointing World Cup campaign . Outsider: David Moyes held talks with the Turkish club last week but has been overlooked . A statement on Galatasaray's official website read: 'Galatasaray football team's new coach Cesare Prandelli is coming to Istanbul this evening. 'Tomorrow (Tuesday) morning at the Florya Metin Oktay (training) facilities, he will be introduced to the players and staff. 'Galatasaray will sign the deal tomorrow (Tuesday) at 2pm (local time) at the Turk Telekom Arena.' The 56-year-old Prandelli, who had two years left in his contract with the Italian Football Federation, guided Roma and Fiorentina before replacing Marcello Lippi at the helm of the national team in 2010. He led the Azzurri to the final of Euro 2012, where they lost to Spain, and a third-placed finish in last year's Confederations Cup. Mancini led Galatasaray into second place in the Super Lig behind Fenerbahce and also won the Turkish Cup, but left after one season in charge.

"The sister of British journalist John Cantlie, who is being held hostage by Islamic State militants, tonight urged the terror group to 'restart dialogue' with his family. In an emotional appeal, Jessica Cantlie said that the family had  been in contact with the terrorists,  but that recent messages have been ignored. Ms Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that their line of communication had been cut off and 'strongly' challenged the group to return to 'their previously opened channel'. Scroll down for video . 'Frustrating': Tonight Jessica Cantlie urged the Islamic State to 'restart dialogue' with the family . Captive: Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, has featured in several propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists . She added that her family was awaiting a response. In the video that was released on Monday night, Ms Cantlie said that she was speaking 'on behalf of the head of the Cantlie family,' referring to her father Paul who is terminally ill. Her brother, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, was kidnapped in Syria two years ago. In recent weeks the 43-year-old captive has featured in a number of propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists and apparently wrote an article for the group's Dabiq magazine. Referring to her brother's appearance in the videos and article, Ms Cantlie said his 'words are powerful and have huge resonance'. Speaking directly to camera, Ms Cantlie said: 'We, John's family, want to address Islamic State, who are holding him. 'It is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with IS. It is simply not accurate. 'This is frustrating for all parties, including those who are trying to assist us. We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you, but then this stopped for reasons best known to you. Ignored: Ms Cantlie said that recent messages to the terrorist group through a 'previously opened channel' of communication had been ignored . 'Sadly, like the families of David Haines and Alan Henning before they were killed, our efforts at re-opening dialogue continue to be ignored by those holding John. 'We strongly challenge those holding John to return to your previously opened channel, to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone's wishes, we can restart dialogue. 'We implore IS to reinitiate direct contact.' 'Terminally ill': In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him . Earlier this month Mr Cantlie's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his sonâs release. In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him. He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them. Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: âFor the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. âAs a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.â Addressing his sonâs captors, he said: âTo those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.â The parents of the captured American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, formerly known as Peter, also said they were trying to contact IS with messages and videos but did not know if it was working. His mother Paula told CBS News: âI do not know if it is working but I have got to try because I need to know Iâve done everything I can do.â The videos of Mr Cantlie, who is originally from Hampshire, have all followed the same format, with the journalist sitting at a desk against a black backdrop to address the camera. There are no signs of violence in the videos but, in the first, Mr Cantlie made it clear he was speaking as a prisoner whose life was in danger. Appeal: In a statement released tonight, his sister Jessica Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that contact with her family has stopped . The terrorists last night released a fourth propaganda video featuring the British hostage, in which he blamed the UK government for beheadings by jihadis in Syria. In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist told how the terror group 'eagerly awaited' a ground war with America and its allies. He also accuses western governments of spending millions of pounds on 'Hollywood-style' military action instead of paying ransoms to his captors. In the chilling 6min 53sec film, Mr Cantlie said he expected to be executed, adding 'I await my turn.' In a further development, in a long article apparently written by Mr Cantlie for IS's Dabiq magazine, he insists he writes the scripts to the videos in which he appears. In last nightâs professionally-produced video, the captive â wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit â said a battle against the fanatics where no one âgets their hands dirtyâ was impossible. So far, a 40-nation coalition led by the US and including Britain as well as Arab nations have carried out air strikes while ruling out combat troops. Mr Cantlie, who appeared to be delivering the message under duress, added that the beheading videos were a âwin-winâ for the militant group. However, it appears the film was shot before the murder of Alan Henning. Delivering scripted lines, Mr Cantlie said the decapitation of âthree previous cellmatesâ by Islamic State fanatics had shocked the public. But taxi driver Mr Henning was the fourth Western hostage to be executed, after US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines.","Jessica Cantlie has urged the terror group to 'restart dialogue' with family .

"Howard Webb may have thought it was Groundhog Day as he was appointed to the same game at the same stage of the World Cup four years on. Brazil easily beat Chile 3-0 in 2010, but he faced a sterner test this time. The most contentious moment for Webb came in the 54th minute as Hulk appeared to restore Brazil's lead. Handball: Webb indicates why he disallowed Hulk's strike which looked to have given Brazil the lead . Unhappy: Brazil coach Scolari argues with Webb and the fourth official Felix Brych after the decision . Good call: Although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate, Webb rightly spotted Hulk's handball . However, Webb's assistant Mike Mullarkey flagged to indicate that the forward had controlled the ball with his upper arm. Webb disallowed the goal and cautioned the Brazilian forward. Replays were not 100 per cent clear but I thought that the decision was correct as the striker deliberately put his arm out and the ball was controlled from it. Some have suggested that any doubt is supposed to be given to the attacker. That is not correct unless in an offside situation. Brazil were perhaps more unfortunate in the first half when Hulk was tripped when clean through but Webb, with a poor view, waved appeals aside. Protest: The Brazilian forward was convinced his goal should have been allowed to stand . Outrage: Hulk complains to assistant referee Michael Mullarkey but the English officials got it right . 1min: Blows his whistle to kick off the last 16 match between Brazil and Chile in Belo Horizonte. 4min: Fernandinho commits a late challenge on Charles Aranguiz which must risk a booking but decides to just award a free-kick. 5min: Aranguiz responds in kind, bringing down Neymar but again only awards a free-kick. 11min: Chile appeal for a penalty when Eduardo Vargas goes down under David Luiz's challenge but is not impressed. 13min: This time it is Brazil's turn to claim a spot-kick when Hulk tumbles while being chased by Mauricio Isla but again refuses the appeals. 17min: Books Eugenio Mena after a clear handball meaning the Chile full-back would miss his next match. 18min: Opening goal for Brazil - correct decision not to award offside. 23min: Speaks severely to Neymar after the Brazilian is involved in an altercation with Gary Medel. 28min: Brazil are unhappy when two crunching challenges on Neymar by Francisco Silva and Arturo Vidal do not bring yellow cards. 40min: Books Silva for a foul on Neymar - meaning he too would be out of any quarter-final. 55min: Controversy. Disallows a goal by Hulk and books the Brazil forward after assistant flags that he controlled a cross with upper arm. Hulk is furious. 60min: Books Luiz Gustavo for bringing down Vidal - he too would miss quarter-final. 90min: Blows for end of normal time with score 1-1. 91min: Awards a free-kick near the Chile penalty area after Eugenio Mena brings down Hulk. 93min: Books Jo for a high challenge on keeper Claudio Bravo. 95min: Blows up for a foul by Neymar when the Brazilian nearly breaks through. 102min: Books Mauricio Pinilla for cynically bringing down Luiz. 105min: Bizarrely books Dani Alves when it appeared Diaz had run into him. 120min: Blows for the end of extra-time and signals for penalties.","English referee Webb rules out Hulk's 54th minute strike in Brazil .

"Deputy head: Martin Goldberg, 46, was found dead a day after police questioned him over allegations he had purchased child pornography from abroad . A paedophile deputy headmaster who secretly filmed his pupils was left free to continue his abuse for more than two years after police failed to act on information that he could be a danger to children. Martin Goldberg, who had worked at the Â£10,000-a-year private school for more than 20 years, was named to British authorities as a suspect in July 2012. He was among 2,345 individuals suspected of having accessed child pornography whose names were handed to the UKâs Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) following a major inquiry in Canada. But the CEOP failed to act on the information from Toronto Policeâs Operation Spade â and it was only in November last year that Essex Police were told that Goldberg had been buying videos of naked boys from a vendor based in Canada. Even then, Essex Police did nothing about the 46-year-old until three weeks ago â almost a year after being informed. Nor did officers warn Thorpe Hall School in Southend, where Goldberg, an IT expert, regularly took children away on school trips. The blunders were compounded when officers failed in a bid to get a search warrant from a magistrate. So they simply visited the paedophileâs home, just over a mile from the school, and politely asked if they could examine his computer. He refused and the officers left without arresting him. Workplace: Mr Goldberg was employed at Â£10,600-a-year Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering in Essex . 'Well-regarded teacher':Â The school headmaster said governors and staff felt 'shocked, angry and betrayed' Within hours, however, he tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork â and then hanged himself in the garage of his Â£360,000 four-bedroom home. Detectives were still able to recover 75 images taken on a camera that was hidden in a bag in the schoolâs male changing rooms. There were 465 images from a local swimming pool and 38 from two other unknown locations. Detectives said the victims are boys aged from nine to 12 and the images were taken from 2000 onwards. Four boys aged between nine and 12 have been identified as featuring in the images, and their parents informed. But in many other cases, faces are not shown, or are out of focus, making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims. Detectives who searched Mr Goldberg's home after he died discovered hundreds of images they believe came from a camera hidden inside a sports bag . Home: Mr Goldberg was single and lived alone in this Â£360,000 detached house inÂ Shoeburyness, Essex . The case has sparked fresh fears about potentially thousands more paedophiles being left unchecked, despite evidence against them, because UK police are taking so long to act on masses of information from child sex investigations overseas. Another name on the list of 2,345 suspects given to British authorities by Toronto Police was cancer specialist Myles Bradbury, 41. Last month Bradbury pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child, with many of the offences taking place at Addenbrookeâs Hospital in Cambridge. Shocked:Â School headmaster Andrew Hampton said everyone at the school felt 'surprised, angry and betrayed' He was known to the authorities in 2012 â 16 months before he was arrested for abusing ill children â but investigations were âshelvedâ until November 2013. He is expected to be jailed when he returns to court for sentencing. Last night shocked parents at the school where Goldberg taught were struggling to cope with the revelation. A source close to the school told the Daily Mail it was feared that as many as 25 pupils had been covertly caught on film. He had also masterminded his schoolâs computer system, issuing iPads to all pupils. His digital mastery has led to fears of what else he could have done, and concealed. Yesterday Essex Coronersâ Office confirmed an adjourned inquest had been told that Goldberg died by hanging. There were calls for a thorough investigation into the delays in the investigation. Local MP James Duddridge said: âQuestions do need to be asked of Essex Police around how quickly this was dealt with.â Nick Alston, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Essex, said: âI expect the independent watchdog to investigate thoroughly and rigorously. My initial judgement is that it is likely that something has gone badly wrong here.â Police informed Thorpe Hallâs headmaster, Andrew Hampton, that his deputy had killed himself after he had been questioned about buying films of young boys. Initially Mr Hampton planned a remembrance ceremony and paid a glowing tribute, telling a local newspaper: âItâs a cutting edge school and he was a cutting edge guy. He was an ideal deputy and I couldnât have asked for better.â Yesterday, however, Mr Hampton said in a statement: âEveryone at Thorpe Hall School feels surprised, angry and betrayed.â Yesterday an Essex police spokesman said there was no evidence of physical abuse by Goldberg of any children. There had been insufficient evidence to arrest Goldberg, he added. Yesterday, a resident in the cul-de-sac where Goldberg lived said: âIâve heard he hanged himself in the garage and was burning papers in his office before then.â Goldbergâs parents Harvey, 77, and Sheila, 72, live nearby. They were not available for comment. Essex Police only yesterday reported itself to the IPCC for its long delay in investigating Goldberg â weeks after his death. Last night an NSPCC spokesman said: âIt is very concerning there appear to have been considerable delays in these cases before the police have taken action.â Essex Police was alerted to concerns over Mr Goldberg as part of Operation Spade - a Canadian police operation which identified hundreds of suspected paedophiles. This graphic shows where leads were sent to . Essex Police was alerted to concerns over Mr Goldberg as part of Operation Spade - a Canadian police operation which identified hundreds of suspected paedophiles. A total of 35 files were passed to the UK force as part of this operation. All information of criminal offences has now been acted on with two people being charged and 18 people still under investigation. MailOnline reported last November that hundreds of British suspected paedophiles had still not been arrested despite being identified by Canadian police 18 months earlier. Canadian detectives said they sent police âhundreds of namesâ of people who viewed âhorrificâ child abuse videos distributed from Toronto by a crime ring. Globally, as of last November, 348 arrests had been made and 386 children rescued. Last year the Daily Mail revealed only one in 15 people caught viewing such images is arrested. Operation Spade started in 2010 and has worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries. More than 350,000 images and 9,000 videos of child sexual abuse have been found. One case is known to be that of children's doctor Myles Bradbury, who earlier this month admitted a string of sexual offences against cancer sufferers in his care aged as young as 11.","Martin Goldberg taught atÂ Thorpe Hall School in Great Wakering, Essex .

"A new study has found that lowering the hemlines on school uniforms could reduce the risk of skin cancer. The research, which comes from James Cook University in Queensland, found that increasing the average uniform covering to the knees and elbows could increase sun protection by over 9 per cent. The study included 100 schools in northern Queensland, and found that most schools had uniforms that only covered a small portion of the upper leg and arms, reports ABC. A new study has found that lowering the hemlines on school uniforms could reduce the risk of skin cancer in school children . The study included 100 schools in northern Queensland, and found that most schools had uniforms that only covered a small portion of the upper leg and arms . Katie Clift, a spokesperson for Queensland Cancer, said the alterations 'don't require a re-design of the uniform, just small alterations or choosing loose-fitting garments, so it's a big gain for a little effort. The study also found that students from educationally poor schools wore less protecting school uniforms. Queensland currently has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with 3000 melanoma and 133,000 non-melanoma skin cancers diagnosed across the state yearly. One school, Magnetic Island State School, has restyled its uniforms to abide by the study. Ms Clift, is encouraging other schools to follow in the steps of Magnetic Island. 'Children spend most of their week in a school environment during peak UV times, and we need to ensure they have the best protection against skin damage and skin cancer,' Ms Clift told ABC.

"Kevin Jones is the type of dad you really don't want to mess with. The father from Louisville, Kentucky, was shocked to catch his daughter sneaking behind his back. At 5 foot 11 and just 10-years-old, the little girl - who The Mail Online chose not to name - appears much more mature than she is, and had been using that online to pass as someone of around 15. She had secretly set up social media accounts pretending to be a teenager and even had a boyfriend. Learning her lesson: This Louisville girl, who looks much older than her 10 years, was caught sneaking around and lying about her age, so her dad decided to teach her a lesson .

"JEFF POWELL's tribute to the Real Madrid legend who passed away on Monday . Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has labelled Alfredo Di Stefano as one of the greatest players of all time. Di Stefano died on Monday afternoon after suffering a heart attack on Saturday, the day after he turned 88, resulting in him being placed in an induced coma. Among the many tributes, Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo hailed Di Stefano as a 'maestro' while FIFA president Sepp Blatter described the Argentina-born forward as 'the most complete player'. Di Stefano won five successive European Cups at Real Madrid between 1956 and 1960, scoring in all five fixtures - including a hat-trick in-front of a watching Ferguson at Hampden Park in 1960. Greetings: Alfredo Di Stefano and Sir Alex Ferguson at the 1983 Cup Winners Cup final in Gothenburg . Victorious: Ferguson manager Aberdeen to victory over Di Stefano's Real Madrid in the 1983 final . Glory: Aberdeen captain Willie Miller holds aloft the trophy after their 2-1 win over Di Stefano's Real Madrid . He sits second on Real Madrid's all-time goalscoring list behind Raul and was an honorary president at the Bernabeu, with Ferguson ranking him among the very best. 'The great question that always comes up is who are the greatest players,' Ferguson said in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News. 'Obviously there is a list of great ones like (Johan) Cruyff, (Diego) Maradona and Pele and of course (Ferenc) Puskas and of course Di Stefano - I thought he was one of the greatest in my mind. 'He had a fantastic balance and poise. If you look at one of the goals he scored in the final against Eintracht Frankfurt it was completely what we are saying about the balance and poise, unbelievable he was. 'I was very sad to hear the news. Even at 88 it is a bit of a shock. I saw him two years ago before our Real Madrid game and he looked fine and looked full of health so it is disappointing to hear the news.' VIDEO Real Madrid great Di Stefano dies ages 88 . Iconic match: Di Stefano (right) scores the first goal of the 1960 final at Glasgow's Hampden Park. Real destroyed Eintracht Frankfurt 7-3 . Legendary status: Di Stefano, here raising his glass during a tribute for his contribution to sport at the Argentina Embassy in Madrid, is Real Madrid's second highest goalscorer of all time . An abiding memory for Ferguson was being in attendance as Di Stefano put Frankfurt to the sword in a 7-3 drubbing that ensured a fifth straight European Cup. ""The amazing thing about that was, being a Rangers fan, Eintracht Frankfurt had beaten Rangers in the semi-finals 6-3, 6-1 so they were gods,' he said. 'They came to Hampden Park and were annihilated by Real Madrid 7-3. I was there in the schoolboy enclosure, I was playing with Queen's Park at the time, and it was a fantastic experience. 'It was the first time I think that a lap of honour was done after the game, Scottish fans hadn't seen that of course. Ten goals in a final, you won't see that again. It was a golden period for Real Madrid, they won it five times in a row and Di Stefano scored in all five finals.'

'When you mention the great players they had they were household names. Aberdeen were a team on the rise and after the game he was very generous and he said Aberdeen had a team that money can't buy, a soul and a family spirit.

"Only at this World Cup could a goal almost bring down an aircraft. Only here, in Brazil, could a pilot be ordering his passengers to stop celebrating. They have been broadcasting matches live on flights these past few weeks and one English reporter informed us how the aircraft he was aboard on Saturday began to âwobbleâ when David Luiz opened the scoring in this extraordinary encounter. The pilot, said our reporter, was more than a little concerned, barking at them all to sit down.

The . roads empty, even in Sao Paulo. On one journey from this ground to Belo . Horizonteâs airport it was like having a private motorway. For . those inside this marvellous stadium an outstanding game of football . dragged them through a full spectrum of emotions. The ecstasy of Luizâs . goal; the sense of despair when Hulk made the mistake that enabled the . brilliant Alexis Sanchez to equalise; never mind the anger at Webbâs . controversial yet courageous decision to disallow Hulkâs goal and give . him a yellow card for handball.

A side that boasts an . impressive combination of style, sophistication and hard graft. Extra . time simply meant another 30 minutes of agony. The terrifying prospect . of penalties too.

All smiles: A little boy gets a hug from Prince Harry during his visit to the Rede Sarah hospital in Brasilia . During the tour, . the prince stopped to watch a group battling it out on . court as they played wheelchair basketball and true to form, couldn't resist getting involved. After around 10 minutes, play was stopped and the prince sat down for a chat - as well as a photo or two - with patients. Sitting among the group of wheelchair-users, Harry put his arm round one small boy who smiled delightedly at the attention. Later, the prince showed himself to be a dab hand when it comes to charming the ladies, leaving a little girl giggling helplessly during a chat. Fun and games: Harry (centre back) seemed to be enjoying his visit to the hospital - despite the jetlag .

"Tuesday night was the most shocked I have ever been in a football stadium. And I was not alone. All the Brazil fans near our BBC commentary position were stunned, too. There was not much anger â I think that will follow in the coming days â just quiet horror. Everywhere Iâve gone in the past few weeks Iâve felt the localsâ obsession with this World Cup. And as a visitor to the country, Iâve bought into it. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Six minutes of nightmares' - Scolari . Misplaced emotion: Brazil let their tributes to their injured star get in the way of their concentration . Passion: Despite all their commitment during the national anthem David Luiz and his team never started playing . You felt you were on a journey with them and waiting for a coronation. Now it is over. On Tuesday, it seemed that the emotion of winning the World Cup for the people and the furore surrounding Neymarâs injury was all too much for Luiz Felipe Scolariâs side. When you walk around cities in Brazil you are just a couple of blocks from a favela, from seeing people sleeping and living in the streets, some of them missing limbs. The players were acutely aware of that. They felt they were playing for the people and there is so much emotion attached to that. Rudderless: David Luiz was captain on the night but he showed no leadership skills as Brazil collapsed . Off target: Luiz resorted to trying to hurt his opponents as his side's gameplan fell apart in Belo Horizonte . David Luiz really meant it when he said he felt heâd let his country down. But sport is not about raw emotion, it is about being professional, about concentrating on the job in hand. Yes, the crowd can be a 12th man, but, in Brazilâs case, the weight of the 12th man was too much to bear. There was no structure to their system and when you have a bad performance, you need to fall back on your system to avoid disaster. For Brazil, it was like they had pulled the plug out of the bath. Opposites: Germany celebrate but David Luiz is unable to lift his teammates as the scoreline worsens . No way back: Oscar and Fred stand in the centre circle - something they did all too frequently on Tuesday night . As if the emotion surrounding the tournament wasnât enough, the team had whipped themselves up into even more of a frenzy over Neymar and Thiago Silvaâs absence. They wore Neymar hats, left an empty hanger in the dressing room in Silvaâs honour and clung on to a Neymar shirt during the national anthem. But you shouldnât have to work yourself up for big games â if anything, you need to calm yourself down. The Germans are masters of that. Itâs fine to play for an absent player but not to the extent Brazil did. Their focus was in the wrong place. Youâre out there to play football and you must not think about the scale of it all until the game is over. Too little, too late: Oscar scored a consolation for the host nation in the dying minutes but it was pointless . The signs were there against Colombia in the quarter-final. As a kid I remember booting the ball into touch and getting told off: âBrazil would never do that,â my coach told me. Well, they did against Colombia and the crowd were applauding it. They were headless, unable to cope with the mass hysteria. And on top of that, the squad was simply not good enough. They are a million miles off the 2002 squad of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho,Â  Roberto Carlos and Rivaldo. But the fans and media still believed â they turned Luiz into their new hero and it backfired. The fans wanted to win the World Cup so much but I got the feeling they just wanted to be champions without having to endure the matches. Support: Luiz was keen to back his injured teammate but not so ready to do his job on the pitch . They didnât want to go the hard miles and every match just became an emotional ordeal. Scolari must take a lot of the blame, too. Last year, his team beat Spain to win the Confederations Cup. They have gone downhill since. Iâm all for loyalty with your players but why did he keep playing Paulinho after an average season at Tottenham and Fred, when the rest of the world can see he is not good enough? Scolari would have been better off experimenting more last summer so he knew how to handle things when the injuries and suspensions came. And he was wrong to leave Kaka out of the squad. He needed someone to calm the young players, to teach them how to behave. Mentally shot: Brazil were unable to cope with the emotions of the occasion as their World Cup dream died . VIDEO 'Six minutes of nightmares' - Scolari . There werenât many yellow shirts out in Brazil on Wednesday. Football is what Brazil is most proud of. They have more than 800 professional clubs, export their players to the top leagues in Europe and yet they couldnât get an XI together to win the trophy on home soil. They are in a similar boat to England now â they have to rebuild and look at the good things that countries like Germany and Holland are doing. What a sorry end to their World Cup.","Hosts let themselves get swept up in the emotion of the occasion .

"Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has told how Brazil feared the worst when Neymar went down with the back injury that ended the World Cup pin-up's tournament. Scolari revealed team-mate Marcelo asked Neymar how he was feeling after he was kneed by Colombia defender Juan Camilo Zuniga the No 10 said, 'I can't feel my legs'. 'He replied: ""I can't feel my legs."" Scared, Marcelo called on the team doctor, but doctors are not allowed on the pitch,' Scolari is quoted as saying in Marca.

'There was a lot of confusion. That image of Neymar being stretchered off towards the helicopter was a real shock, it was tough hearing his cries.' Neymar left the field on a stretcher in Brazilâs 2-1 win over Colombia that set up a semi-final meeting with Germany. An X-ray soon after showed a fracture in one of his vertebrae which the Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar confirmed would keep Neymar out of action for up to six weeks.

Will he be there? Neymar has been invited to be 'on the bench or in the stands' to show his support . Scolari's revelation shows the World Cup host's camp fear it would be much longer, even career-threatening. The coach hasn't underestimated the cost of losing Neymar for potentially two more games in the tournament, first the Germany match that could see them reach a first World Cup final since 2002. 'Neymar is our star player, because he's the type of match-winner who would make a difference in any team,' Scolari said. 'We've lost the one player we didn't want to lose ahead of the semi-finals and the final,' he said.","Brazil star is out of the World Cup after suffering back injury .

"Having earned a reputation as one of footballâs most charmingly and free-thinking unique individuals, it came as something of a surprise on Monday to hear Jurgen Klinsmann fall in to the tiresome trap of asking questions of the refereeâs impartiality ahead of Tuesday's last 16 clash with Belgium. Asked by an American journalist if he had an issue with the fact that Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi will be able to speak French to the Belgian players at Arena Fonte Nova on Tuesday night, the USA coach remarkably claimed that he had. 'We hope itâs not a concern,' said Klinsmann. 'He did two games already and did them well. I hope he continues to referee in the perfect way he has so far.' Upset: USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann is unhappy at the appointment of Djamel Haimoudi for their Belgium tie . Weary: Klinsmann is concerned that Haimoudi's native French language may sway decisions in Belgium favour .

Focused: Captain Clint Dempsey is expected to start for the USA team at the Arena Fonte Nova . On the ball: Dempsey will be hoping to fire the American's to the quarter-finals on Tuesday . Working up a sweat: Michael Bradley (centre) and his USA team-mates are put through their paces at training . Out of reach? USA are looking to go one better than at the 2010 World Cup when they lost in the last 16 . 'But is it a good feeling? No, because . Algeria came from same group as Belgium and he speaks French like their . players. He will be able to speak to their players and not to us. 'It is also the same country we beat in the last second at the last World Cup, but it is what it is. 'I know itâs tricky for FIFA to select the right referee for the right games. 'We respect the decision and hope that everything goes well. We will give him the benefit of the doubt.' To . suggest that there should be any doubt about Haimoudiâs partiality was a . dubious tactic from Klinsmann. Were he to say such a thing before game . in the Barclays Premier League, for example, the former Tottenham . forward would be charged by the FA. Here . in Brazil, though, it seems that anything goes and it was left to . Belgium coach Marc Wilmotts to defend the integrity of the referee and, . to some extent, the competition.

(Name in yellow = one yellow card from ban) 'I don't think the referee is there to talk, he is there to referee,' said Wilmots. 'Three times we were in the last 16 and decisions didn't go our way. I think it's finding excuses before the game. I . looked at the English referee Howard Webb and he disallowed the goal . for the hosts Brazil. It's up to the referee to make the right . decision.'

The last time Belgium made it past the last 16 at a World Cup they reached the semi-finals - that was at Mexico 86. There . they were beaten 2-0 by Argentina thanks to two goals from Diego . Maradona... and if they make it past the USA they will face Argentina in . the quarters. 'But you have benchmarks and you get judged by the World Cup. This is huge, it only comes along every four years. 'You donâtâ want to wait four more years, you want to do it now. The sky is the limit. You want to clear one hurdle after another, but this is a big hurdle, make no mistake. 'We made it through a difficult group, but we now want more, we are hungry. We have a lot of respect for Belgium, but no fear at all. 'The support back home means a lot to us. We get it communicated from back home. 'The energy that comes from the US, with the thousands of fans in Brazil, you can see where the game is going. You canât stop it anymore, itâs breaking through. Hopes of a nation: Klinsmann has been delighted at the support of the USA national team at the World Cup . 'It . is coming through at every level, there are kids playing it everywhere, . but the recruiting office is the national team, in every country . 'But when the game starts, you have to prove it and get the message through, . 'The enthusiasm is incredible. Our fans in Recife were the loudest, even though we lost to Germany. 'They . will be here and the loudest again in Salvador. In San Francisco, New . York and Jacksonville, we had packed crowds and a great send off.

"No one knew they were expecting a new family member. But on Thursday Ellen Pompeo, 44, announced on her WhoSay account that she and her husband Chris Ivery have gained a daughter.

"And suddenly, itâs all about Zlatan again. Itâs the weekend of Franceâs ClasicoÂ (Le Classique) as the meeting of PSG and Marseille jousts with Real Madrid v Barcelona, Bayern Munich v Dortmund and Juventus v Milan for the title of Europeâs classic Clasico. The French match wonât win that title but this âClasicoâ carries extra spice because Marseille, revitalized by Marcelo Bielsaâs eccentricities, are top of Ligue 1 and PSG, vitalized by their ownersâ billions, lie second. Zlatan Ibrahimovic watches midweek Champions League tie between PSG and APOEL Nicosie . Thus, with all the timing of a thespian âluvvyâ, Ibrahimovic is suddenly ready for curtain up and is vying for centre stage. He has not scored since August, nor played since September and a couple of weeks ago Swedenâs medic was hinting that we are beginning to see Zlatanâs tired body call for surrender. But, as his autobiography declares: âI am Zlatanâ. On Thursday he did light training, on Friday he put in a group session and, suddenly, ahead of Sunday's Parc des Princes grudge match, the buzz is all about âwill he start?â and âwill he win the match with a trademark goal to put PS G within a point of the leaders?â All of which is like a scorpion down the underpants for Senor Edinson Cavani. From the moment they shared a club, the Uruguayan has been Dr Watson to Zlatanâs Sherlock â not so much second fiddle as no fiddle, no music and no groupies. In Laurent Blancâs 4-3-3 formation, Zlatan stomps the central turf and Cavani must play wide. There is no question who is team leader, who must receive the best passes and the most scoreable crosses. He is Zlatan. Ibrahimovic (right) has not played since September because of a heel inury . Yet while the Swede has been out, Cavani has been a brilliant understudy, emphasizing why he, or perhaps Zlatan given his age and injuries, must move on. Cavani scored the only goal in each of PS Gâs Zlatan-less wins over APOEL in the Champions League. Domestically, too, he has filled the Ibra-vacuum but it took him time to hit his most clinical form, given that playing out of position has eroded his confidence. Nor has he enjoyed the best of luck. Celebrating with his ârifleshotâ pose after scoring a penalty at Lens, the referee booked him (even though Cavani has done that every time he has scored for years without punishment). When Cavani questioned the decision, he was sent off, thus missing another Zlatan-free game to firm up his claim to the centre-forward role. Itâs a dilemma â one which will probably be resolved with Cavani starting in the middle on Sunday and Zlatan on the bench. But it has caused much comment among those who know or just appreciate the vastly talented Uruguayan. Former Arsenal midfielder Remi Garde points out: âPrior to Zlatan being out, I think Cavani lost a bit of confidence, which caused flaws in his game. Edinson Cavani has taken the chance to stake his claim for the central striking role . âHe struggled with self-doubt and itâs difficult to be asked to do something extremely difficult â remain in Ibrahimovicâs shadow yet be prepared to replace him from time to time.â Two further parts of the problem are that Cavani was brutally expensive to buy from Napoli â the â¬64m outlay helping to cause PSGâs Financial Fair Play problems. He has also had domestic strife to cope with. Never an aid to a âconfidenceâ player. Former Brazilian World Cup striker Antonio Careca is a huge fan of Cavani but is pessimistic about his future at PSG. âEdinsonâs struggling with the 4-3-3 formation but PS Gâs too big a club to expect them to change to suit him,â he says. âHe has to adapt. Zlatanâs a phenomenon â better than Cavani. If Edinsonâs really miserable, he should leave.â Blanc, architect of the move to 4-3-3, says: âZlatan isnât an easy man to manage but then nobody is. The guy is exceptional and there are others much less able than him who are far more demandingâ. Read between the lines. On Cavani struggling when the Swede takes his favourite position, Blanc says: âItâs bound to be just a passing phase because scoring goals is in this guyâs blood.â From Italy, the chorus of disapproval intensifies. Before hitting the big time at Napoli, Cavani starred at Palermo whose owner Maurizio Zamparini rants: âPS G deserve a coach of the highest level and Iâd give Blanc 6.5 out of 10. If he wasnât French, heâd never have been put in charge. They have to go to 4-4-2.â All music to Bielsaâs ears. âAux armesâ for the French Classico.","Marseille are top of Ligue 1 and rivals PSG lie second in the table .

"Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes that Real Madrid's Raphael Varane would be the ideal recruit as Louis van Gaal looks to reinforce his defence ahead of his first season in charge. United are in urgent need of central defenders after Nemanja Vidic left for Inter Milan and Ferdinand was released by the club at the end of the season. Ferdinand, who won six Premier League titles in his twelve year spell at Old Trafford, believes that Real Madrid's French centre-half Raphael Varane would be the ideal replacement, although he acknowledged that it would be difficult to prise him away from the Spanish capital.

When asked on Twitter which central defenders he would sign for United, Ferdinand replied: 'Varaneâ¦Real Madrid won't sell though.'

He wrote of Keane: '(He) will be a top player one day. Cultured. Eager to learn & be coached. Vital.' Ferdinand, who is closing in on a move to QPR ahead of next season, also urged United to pursue the club's former midfielder Paul Pogba, who quit for Juventus in 2012 and has now emerged as the world's leading young central midfielder.

"Dave Lee Travisâs three-month suspended sentence for indecent assault was âneither wrong in principle nor unduly lenientâ and will not be changed, the Attorney General has said. The disgraced DJ's was found guilty for molesting a researcher and was given a three month suspended sentence, which was referred to the Attorney General after it was criticised for being too lenient. However Jeremy Wright QC, the Attorney General, decided that the 69-year-oldâs sentence for groping a Â 22-year-old TV researcher on the Mrs Merton Show in 1995 would not be referred to the Court of Appeal. Dave Lee Travis pictured speaking outside Southwark Crown Court in London in September, after he had been sentenced to three months in prison suspended for two years for indecently assaulting a TV researcher . The suspended sentence was considered for referral to the Court of Appeal after four members of the public contacted the Attorney Generalâs Office to complain that it was too soft. A spokesman for the Attorney Generalâs Office said: âThe Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has decided not to refer the suspended prison sentence given to David Griffin to the Court of Appeal as he does not believe they would find it to be unduly lenient and increase it. âThe judge marked the seriousness of the offence by imposing a three-month sentence of imprisonment, the maximum under the guidelines being six months. âIt was neither wrong in principle nor unduly lenient to suspend that sentence.â Travis was found guilty of indecently assaulting a TV researcher working on the Mrs Merton show in 1995 . Travis (left) pictured on the last ever Top of the Pops in 2006 with Janice Long and Jimmy Savile, who has since been exposed as a prolific paedophile. Savile sparked the launched of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree . Travis, whose real name is David Griffin, was found guilty at Londonâs Southwark Crown Court and sentenced by Judge Anthony Leonard last month. During his trial the jury heard that the former Top Of The Pops presenter got a âweird sexual thrillâ when he indecently assaulted the victim in 1995. Â She is now a successful TV personality. The trial had heard he cornered her in the corridor of a BBC television studio where she was smoking. The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC . He then commented on her âpoor little lungsâ before squeezing her breasts for 10 to 15 seconds. Travis, who became a household name in the 1970s, was found not guilty on a second indecent assault charge and the jury was discharged after it was unable to agree a verdict on a count of sexual assault. He faced a retrial after jurors failed to reach verdicts on those two charges earlier this year. He was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault at his original trial in February. The 69-year-old had accused the authorities of wasting âmillionsâ on the investigation into a string of allegations against him spanning several decades. He said the single guilty verdict failed to prove he is a âsexual predatorâ and has left him âmortified and disappointedâ. Travis protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as 'fantasists and liars'. Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree. Yewtree was launched by Scotland Yard in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile.","Jeremy Wright QC has refused to refer DJ's sentence to Court of Appeal .

"Robin van Persie was given a pep talk by Holland manager Louis van Gaal after 'stomach problems' forced him to train away from the main squad on Tuesday. After bagging a brace in his first two games, the Holland star striker has failed to find the net since as Van Gaal's side edged out Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout to set up a semi-final showdown with Argentina. The Manchester United striker trained away from the rest of the squad, with Van gaal confirming: 'He has some stomach problems, some intestinal problems, so it's best not to train him.' After missing training, Van Persie is a doubt for Wednesday night's clash in Sao Paolo - but his manager expects him to retain his spot if fit. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Holland supporters give Robin van Persie their full support . United we stand: Louis van Gaal speaks to Robin van Persie ahead of facing Argentina . Talking tactics: van Gaal addresses his players during training on Tuesday . The Old Trafford manager-in-waiting said: 'I will decide (on Wednesday). 'Van Persie is our captain so he is very important to us. 'In principle my captain always plays, but he has to be fit.' Van Gaal took the frontman to one side for a quick pep talk during the session at the Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium in a bid to get him firing again. The 30-year-old started the tournament with a bang, scoring twice against Spain including a diving header which is a candidate for goal of the tournament. He scored against Australia but picked up a second yellow card, ruling him out of the Netherlands' final group game against Chile. Pep talk: van Gaal chats to van Persie during Tuesday's training session in Sao Paulo . VIDEO Van Gaal hopeful on Van Persie fitness .

In . the quarter-final against Costa Rica, Van Persie missed a series of . chances but scored the Netherlands' first penalty in a shootout victory . that sealed their place in the semi-finals. Van Persie should be expecting no favours from Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir after the striker slammed the official's decision to send off Nani in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in 2013. There was some good news for the Holland coach on Tuesday as injury doubts Ron Vlaar and Leroy Fer took part in training. In . an interesting development, midfielder Nigel de Jong was also involved . even though he had been expected to miss the rest of the World Cup after . suffering a groin injury in the group stage win over Mexico. 'If his reaction is good and he can play, then the miracle can come true,' Van Gaal said. Heated discussion: Temperatures appeared to rise between van Persie and former United boss David Moyes last season . Limbering up: van Persie and Daryl Machado stretch it outÃ . But even if De Jong makes a shock return to the XI for the Argentina match, it will mean nothing if Van Persie is ruled out. Holland have relied heavily on the Manchester United striker, and fellow star Arjen Robben, in Brazil.Both players scored in the penalty shoot out win over Costa Rica which sent the Dutch through to their second successive World Cup semi-final. That match was a draining affair as Holland battered the Costa Rica goal, but they could not beat Keylor Navas inside 120 minutes. Van Gaal thinks his players will have recovered their fitness by the time they face Alejandro Sabella's team. 'In general I give the players two days to recover, so if you have one day less it's an issue, a problem,"" Van Gaal said. ""But a top athlete can perform so my players will be in shape.'

Stretching it out: van Gaal and Patrick Kluivert look on as Robben and Wesley Sneijder limber up . Van Gaal's decision to bring on Tim Krul in the 120th minute of the quarter-final was hailed as a master stroke. Krul saved two penalties after replacing Jasper Cillessen, but the Newcastle stopper will not start the semi-final. 'No. I ruled that out straight away,' said Van Gaal when asked if he would start with Krul. 'Jasper is doing a wonderful job, it was just that stopping a penalty is something that the others (Krul and third choice Michel Vorm) are better at.' Although Argentina are yet to hit peak . form in Brazil, they are the bookmakers' favourites for the match at the . Arena Corinthians. Van Gaal believes there is nothing between the two sides though. 'I don't think there is a favourite,' the Manchester United manager in waiting said. 'The countries are at the same level. It's a 50-50 match and we have to be a bit lucky too.' Miracle man: Nigel de Jong returned to training ahead of schedule . No hard feelings: Holland keepers Jasper Cillessen and Tim KrulÃ . Danger man: Holland are well aware of the threat posed by Argentina's  Lionel Messi . Key to Holland's chances of making the final will be how they deal with the threat posed by Lionel Messi, who has finally transferred his domestic form with Barcelona onto the international stage. 'He has been voted the world's best player before and you don't get that for nothing,' Van Gaal added. 'He has always found it hard to show his form at international level.

"'We want everyone to know that a woman is no different to a man when it comes to defending her country.' That is the message from a group of incredibly brave women who have signed up to fight for the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Unit (YPG) against the self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS). The young women, seen practising with AK-47s, said that they were motivated to join the YPG to help repel ISIS advances in their hometowns. Thity-five per cent of the Kurdish army are women as they defend their territory . One female soldier fires an AK-47 as she improves her target practice . The female YPG recruits also train alongside their male counterparts, and are seen taking part in military drills close to Kobane. One of the brave fighters says: 'They (ISIS) fear our weapons and they are shocked by our strength . 'We ask all women all over the world not to underestimate themselves and believe that they are able to accomplish anything.' Some of the young women are taking temporary leave from school to join the fight, with 19-year-old Naline, a new YPG recruit, saying: 'Everytime I went to school I felt fear so I quit to defend my land and country... to protect my friends from the fear that I felt. 'I sacrificed my future to help build others.' The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC) have reported that as up to 35 per cent of Kurdish troops in northern Syria are women.

Rubble: The ISIS militants are seen wandering in and out of badly damaged buildings throughout the video clip . Meanwhile a new video has emerged showing heavily armed Islamic State fighters stalking backstreets in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane while American warplanes circle overhead. The footage, which emerged on social media accounts linked to the terror group, shows jihadists wandering rubble-lined roads and entering destroyed buildings while the sound of intense gun fights is heard nearby. The video emerged as fierce street battles broke out yesterday - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of ISIS' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks. ISIS militants have been largely pushed out of Kobane this week thanks to sustained American airstrikes . Threat: The video begins by showing an American warplane circling overhead while ISIS militants can be heard chanting religious slogans and asking God to keep them safe . The clashes came as desperate ISIS jihadists launched a final assault 'on all fronts' to take the town yesterday, after the militants felt the full force of American air power with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town. Hundreds of ethnic Kurds turned out for the burial of three brave resistance fighters who died battling militants from the Islamic State in Kobane. The funerals of two men and a woman barely out her teens were held in the Turkish village of Suruc, within clear sight of the Kurdish fighters' besieged hometown over the border in Syria. The three Kurdish fighters were members of the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and died in fierce clashes in Kobane, which has been under assault by ISIS extremists since mid-September. The video begins by showing an American warplane circling overhead while ISIS militants can be heard chanting religious slogans and asking God to keep them safe. Masked men are then seen stalking the Kobane backstreets, wandering from building to building as the sound of intense fighting is heard nearby. The militants enter partially-destroyed factories, where makeshift bedding can be seen against the walls - suggesting the rooms are being used to house militants while they besiege the town. Militants, some of them not wearing masks, are then interviewed on camera and describe in Arabic their brutal efforts to seize the town from its largely Kurdish population. The extremists have been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it. As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down earlier this week, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies.","35% of Kurdish troops in Northern Syria are women .

"Covers lay like palls over the rest ofÂ  Wimbledonâs courts. People huddled their strawberries under umbrellas and their dresses under ponchos. But below the roof of Centre Court came a performance from Novak Djokovic as brilliant as a true summerâs day. The scene was perfect. The lights shone down as they might on a boxing ring. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lent his own air of authenticity to the analogy, for he is the Muhammad Ali of tennis, at least in terms of appearance. Roaring success: Novak Djokovic celebrates his victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga . Blown away: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga could not live with Novak Djokovic losing in straights sets on Monday . But he could barely lay a glove, or . racket string, on the Serb, who efficiently and relentlessly put down . his marker as the champion in waiting. So one-sided was the contest . that from early on Tsongaâs every winning point was cheered loudly. Not . only because he is a firm favourite of the crowd for his all-action, . all-heart style, but because he was in grave danger of humiliation, and . the worst sentiment a sportsman can experience â pity â was being . lavished upon him. Those fears were hardly misplaced. The match was over in a trice. The rules allowed play to have gone on until 11pm, but that never looked likely from the moment the first set was concluded in just 25 lopsided minutes, Djokovic having taken a stranglehold on proceedings by breaking Tsonga to go 5-2 ahead. At that point the people in the Royal Box were still reconvening in their seats, having taken a comfort break following Andy Murrayâs similarly brisk victory on the same rectangle of covered grass. The second set followed a similar pattern. Djokovic broke his opponent in the seventh game and went on to close it out with near-immaculate precision. Tsongaâs resistance in saving three set points was merely a stay of execution. VIDEO Wimbledon: Day seven roundup . Eyes on the prize: Novak Djokovic will be looking to go one better this year after losing in last year's final . Flying out: Jo Wilfried-Tsonga spectacularly misses the ball as he struggles against Novak Djokovic . Of course, Tsonga is a battler. His engine is nearly inexhaustible â he played 509 minutes en route to this fourth-round match. And his greatest scalp ever, victory over Roger Federer here in 2011, came from two sets down. Was a repeat even remotely possible? There was a moment in the third when it looked as if it might, just might, be. The crowdâs cheers were at Tsongaâs back in the eighth game. He led 4-3 and had two break points. But Djokovic was calm calculation personified. He held his nerve and his service game before letting out a loud raw of emotion in delight. Tsonga, though, fought back. He won the next game to love to go 5-4 ahead. Emotion was pumping right through him. He was holding nothing back. Every ball was hit with all the power his big, Ali-frame could muster. He went on to lead 6-5. The rallies were short bordering on non-existent. Watching brief: Boris Becker look on as his charge Novak Djokovic storms to victory past Jo-Wilfried Tsonga . With the clock ticking towards 9pm, the set went into a tiebreak, such an arm wrestle of servingÂ  mastery. Finally on match point, Djokovic returned a backhand winner so close to the line it was called out. He celebrated in a star-shaped stance of impregnability, his head nodding in satisfaction. Realising the point had been given against him, he challenged it and was vindicated. Game, set and destruction. All this precision was remarkable considering in what state we last saw Djokovic. He hit his left shoulder on the baseline grass in the previous round, fearing his involvement in the tournament might come to the least satisfactory of early conclusions. Gracious: Tsonga (left) congratulates Djokovic after their fourth round match . But he showed not the least flicker of pain until he clutched it in the tiebreak, but, as last Friday, it did nothing to stop his progression. Perhaps we should have expected such a one-sided encounter.Â  Djokovic was on a 10-match winning streak against the Frenchman, who had not taken a set from him in two years. In another statement ofÂ  consistency, Djokovic was gunning for his 21st straight Grand Slam quarter-final and his sixth consecutively at Wimbledon. But Tsonga played his part. The standard of his game was hardly poor, and at times outstandingly strong. But Djokovic was like a machine, every point devised with computer-like precision and the emotional detachment of a factory machine.

"Louis van Gaal looks increasingly like the man who gets things done. And while that may be good news for Manchester United, it is causing something of a stir in Holland. The new Manchester United manager could not have wished for a better showcase to demonstrate his tactical credentials than this World Cup. This week he has been conducting open training sessions at the Netherlands headquarters in the wealthy Ipanema district of Rio. Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder are using the facilities of Flamengo, a club that is cross between Manchester United, in being the most popular in Brazil, and Chelsea, in attracting the richest and most well-to-do fans. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal present Brazil legend Zico with a signed Holland shirt . Embrace: Louis van Gaal puts an arm around his captain Robin van Persie . Chatty: Van Persie and Kuyt having a discussion in training . Their training ground, on the edge of . the picturesque lake that characterises this part of the city, is . overlooked by some of the most-expensive apartments in Rio â there is no . such thing as a closed training session here â and the mountains and . the iconic statue of Christ the Redeemer provide an extraordinary . backdrop. Ironically this . week they received a visit from Flamengoâs most-famous player, Zico, the . man remembered as one of the principal creative architects of the . glorious, if flawed, Brazil side of 1982. For whilst Van Gaal may be . surrounded by opulence and grandeur, he is developing a reputation as . something of a grafter. And glorious failure is not a theme he is . inclined to embrace. With a . Dutch side that many thought weak, old and deficient in quality, . compared to the great teams of the past, Van Gaal has set about devising . a plan that has brought best out the players and, if they can beat . Mexico in Fortaleza today, looks likely to take them to the semi-finals . at least. There are problems . associated with the unexpected success. Van Persie aside, Manchester . United players will be missing out on his tactical insights. They return . to training on Friday, whilst Van Gaal is likely to be detained at this . tournament until the final weekend, meaning he would only join up with . his new club on the eve of their departure for their US tour in late . July. And Van Gaal, a man . not unused to confrontation, is causing a furore in Holland. His great . crime? Not playing 4-3-3 in the best tradition of the Dutch football. It . seems strange that the country that gave the world the flexibility of . Total Football is now so wedded to that idea they can conceive no other . way to play the game and even the 5-1 victory over Spain, known in . Holland as âthe miracle of Salvador,â has not won Van Gaal any . disciples. For a nation that . prides itself on domination of the ball, the fact that Holland have . only controlled possession in one game so far â and that against . Australia, where they only managed 52 per cent â and, even worse, are . scoring from long balls and counter attacks, is enough to cause an . identity crisis. The great . high priest of Dutch football, Johan Cruyff, the leader of the Total . Football team from the 1970s, has come out against Van Gaalâs playing . style, despite the 10 goals scored. So now famous names are now rallying . to Van Gaalâs cause. Talking tactics: Van Gaal with star forward Arjen Robben . The circle: Van Gaal addresses his players during the session . Ruud Gullit, the 1987 European Footballer of the . Year, is the perhaps the most important, comparing the tactics to those . that won Holland their last trophy, the 1988 European Championships. âI completely support the realistic approach of Louis van Gaal,â wrote Gullit in his newspaper column yesterday. âThe . 70s men, the icons of Dutch football, long for the great football they . played. But they use the fact they were such great teams and had such a . great playing style as a cover for fact they never won anything. Holland . were beaten in every final. âI . remember going into Euro â88 and our first group game against Soviet . Union was one of the best matches Iâve ever played in â but we lost. 'After that we sat down with Rinus Michels and we changed it round to . play a more realistic game. We changed the system and against England in . the group stages, I was played as a left winger. âFrom . then on we were on a high all our way to the final. In the final itself . I even had to do a job on making sure their playmaker, Oleksiy . Mykhaylychenko, didnât get in the game. 'I scored from a header in the . box and though our playing style wasnât the prettiest, we were European . Champions and we got the respect for being champions. âFootball . has evolved, which means that nowadays you have to be cleverer, more . realistic and sly to survive in big international games. In Dutch . football we are often lacking this realistic approach. But Van Gaalâs . Holland has been a massive example of this new awareness in the World . Cup in Brazil. 'Holland have scored 10 goals so far in the first round. Well, if that is achieved with so-called defensive football, I donât . know how people expect us to shake off that label.â Cooling off: The team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of Fortaleza . The . significance of his comments is that the late Michels, who led the . Netherlands in that tournament, was also coach to the great Ajax team of . the early 1970s and the 1974 national team and was mentor to Cruyff. If . even the father of Total Football could be functional and have the . worldâs greatest player, as Gullit was in those days, parked out on the . left wing, then Van Gaal must be allowed to evolve a style that works . for his, less-talented players . But . Dutch football is an earnest business and split along sectarian lines. You are either with Cruyff or with Van Gaal. The pair have no time for . each other even though they both come out of the same tradition of . passing football at Ajax and even though both laid the foundations for . the current playing style of Barcelona, Van Gaal taking over shortly . after Cruyff left the Catalan club. Like a religious split, it is . baffling to outsiders yet those caught up within it are faced with . choosing one man or the other as their mentor and philosophical guide. And . Van Gaal, who made his name with the superb Ajax side of 1995 that . dominated possession and passed the ball beautifully, has shown a . greater capacity to adapt his ideals and hence has proved a better coach . than Cruyff. Even at this World Cup, he has proved flexible, switching . the system at half time against Australia to turn the game around. Despite . the Â£65million spent on Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, and the moves . imminent for Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels, United may need . some of that tactical acumen to coax the best from limited players. Tekkers: Van Persie performs a few flicks and tricks as he prepares for Mexico . Lining one up: Van Gaal getting stuck in with the ball at his feet . Indeed, . Premier League fans might have raised a quizzical eyebrow at Aston . Villaâs Ron Vlaar as the pivotal defender for Holland, or Norwich Cityâs . Leroy Fer as a key substitute, scoring a great goal against Chile. Van . Gaalâs greatest triumph though has been reviving Wesley Sneijder. It . had seemed as though the star of the 2010 team, which reached the World . Cup final before truly betraying their roots by trying to kick Spain off . the pitch, had no chance of making even the squad. Van Gaal had pronounced him unfit and surplus to requirements during qualifying, causing enormous friction between the two. Yet . Sneijder, once in contention to be the best player in the world, hired . Henk van Cate, the former Chelsea coach, to get him fit and has . transformed himself into the teamâs workhorse, statistics showing that . he has run the most miles of anyone in the squad in the first two games. Given the former animosity between manager and player, his willingness . to conform has been remarkable. âIâve . had my moment with the manager,â said Sniejder. âBut I have to say that . in this World Cup heâs getting it right all the time and so far there . hasnât been anything to find fault with. âThe . tactical work is something different to what weâve done before. His . vision and tactics have given confidence to everyone in the squad. Itâs a . joy to work with him and I have no reason to complain.â As . for Van Gaal himself, he is unapologetic. His view is that, having lost . his best midfielder to injury in Kevin Strootman, he is making the best . of what he has. âI lost . Kevin Strootman and I had to think of something different,â he said. âAnd I set up the system with specific players in my possession. I have . come here to win not to entertain the world.â He may end up doing both.","Van Gaal has demonstrated his credentials ahead of Man Utd move .

Widnes, who stay eighth, spurned first-half chances to establish a commanding lead and went in at the break just 4-0 ahead thanks to Tickle, who touched down after a collecting a clever pass from Joe Mellor.

"Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm? FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez after the striker appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 World Cup win. The Liverpool striker looked to have sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Azzurri star Chiellini, who attempted to show referee Marco Rodriguez the mark left by Suarez's teeth. The Mexican official failed to spot the incident but in a statement on their official website, FIFA confirmed that it will investigate the 27-year-old's actions in Natal. The maximum time FIFA are able to ban a player for is two years. Their disciplinary committee will meet at 5pm local time (9pm BST) to discuss the case and video evidence will be used. Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence.

The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.

Furthermore, according to article 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).' Senior FIFA official Michel D'Hooghe told BBC Radio 5 Live that the 'serious' case should be brought to a hearing in front of its disciplinary commission and that 'biting is not compatible with normal football practice.'

Jim Boyce, Britain's FIFA vice-president and head of FIFA's referees committee, expressed concerns about Suarez's actions. He said: 'I have watched the incident several times on television.

"What's the best country to live in the world? well it's no other than Australia, as for the best place to live, that gong goes to the country's capital, Canberra. The OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development hasÂ ranked the 362 regions of its 34 member nations according to nine measures of well-being which include income and education. Each were given a score out of ten. Australia led the world ranking with a tidy 76.5 out of 90, following by Norway at 72.3, Canada, Sweden and then the US. Australia topped the world list for the best country to live, it's scorecard 76.5 out of 90 although education only scored a 6.6 out of 10 . The nation's capital, Canberra, has been voted as the best place to live by OECD beating out Sydney and Melbourne . Despite being known for Sydney Harbour and it's popularity with visitors, Canberra was named the best place to live in the world. While Australia's scorecard was good enough to see it named best country to live . The country that didn't fare so well was Mexico, which ranked the worst country to live with a measley 15.1 out of 90 scoring zero for safety, housing and accessibility to services. Poland, Hungary and Turkey were also judged as some of the hardest places in the world to live. All well-being scores out of 10 . *Education - 6.6 . *Jobs - 8.4 . *Income - 7.3 . *Safety - 9.8 . *Health - 9 . *Environment - 9.5 . *Civic Engagement - 10 . *Accessibility to services - 7.2 . *Housing - 8.7 . An earlier version of the report was released in June but since then it has been updated to include one more measure of well being, which isÂ access to affordable and quality housing. That got a commendable score of 8.7 out of 10, while civic engagement took out the honours with full marks of 10, following closely behind was safety, environment and health. Even the low performing regions in Australia fare better than the OECD average in all of the well-being measures. But surprisingly Australia will have to work on its education which received a 6.6, well behind countries such as Canada, the Czech republic and Israel which recorded a high 9. The share of the workforce with at least a secondary degree in the bottom 20 per cent of regions in Australia is 13 percentage points lower than the OECD average. The OECD has pointed out, large regional disparities in education, health, jobs and key services can Â damage economic growth which in turn will lower well-being outcomes at a national level. Melbourne cricket ground (pictured), one of Australia's most popular venues. Australia topping the world as the best country to live . Australia scored 76.5 out of 90 based on nine well-being measures and reached number one in the world as the best country to live with beautiful places like the Gold Coast (pictured) to visit . Washington's white house (pictured) the US was among the top countries to live in the world with Australia topping the list . While some would argue that Sydney has the best beaches and harbour while Melbourne's pubs and cafes are a talking point, the nation's best place to live and work is our often mocked national capital, Canberra. The territory received three top 10 scores, more than any other region included on the list, for safety, income and civic engagement. Even its lowest score, for the environment, was still a massive 9.1. Of all the nine indicators, Canberra total score was 86.2 out of a possible 90, thrashing the country's well being average. Scroll down for video . Norway (pictured) came in second in the best best countries to live in the world behind Australia . The national Carillion, Aspen island in Canberra. The nation's capital was ranked the best place to live in the world . While living conditions in Canberra might be top class, it has built up a reputation as a boring city with little to do . Canberra is truly the place to visit all-year round. During summer it's dry and desolate while in the winter months it is one of the coldest places in the country . As the political heartland of the country, Canberra, along with six other of our state's and territories received top score of 10 for its civic engagement - meaning Australia is more in tune with its political system than just about anywhere else. The high number of voter engagement, about 95 per cent, was taken from the 2013 Federal Election and largely reflects the fact that voting in Australia is mandatory.Â  Australia had the highest average voter turnout of any other region based on the previous national election. Voter turnout is defined as the ratio between the number of voters to the number of persons with voting rights. The statistics also confirmed the capital has a higher average income than the 360 regions identified, and it terms of its murder rate - that's practically non existent. Canberra has the lowest murder rate across Australia averaging just one in 100,000 people. It's commonly confused that Sydney, and not Canberra, is referred to as Australia's capital city. Despite its knockers, Canberra seems to be making its place on the world stage. A New York Times article recently told its readers that while it does not compare to the 'glitzier city of Sydney' andÂ  'there are no beaches or iconic opera houses' it does have 'big-sky beauty, breezy civic pride and a decidedly hipster underbelly.' The best way to enjoy Canberra, the Times said, is 'with deep intakes of mountain air and an ear tuned to the calls of sulphur-crested cockatoos and crimson rosellas.' Stockholm in Sweden, one of the top countries in the world to live, with Australia coming in at first . Unlike most cities, Canberra was purposefully built as the nation's capital and the road network is built with an incredibly high number of roundabouts . Income 10/10 . Safety 10/10 . Civic Engagement 10/10 . Health 9.9/10 . Accessibility to services 9.6/10 . Jobs 9.6/10 . Environment 9.5/10 . Education 9.1/10 . Housing 8.5/10 . It also recommended going for a bicycle ride which loops one of the capital's premier attractions, it's lake. But it isn't just any lake, it was named after Chicago man, Walter Burley Griffin, who designed the capital built in the centre of Melbourne and Sydney. Tasmania's score for education is 5.6, putting it in the bottom 27 per cent of the OECD regions. The ACT is high on the list, in the top 19 per cent, but when it comes to the country's natural environment, look no further than Tasmania, NSW and QLD which all score a perfect 10 out of 10. The Northern Territory doesn't fare quite as well as its neighbouring state's and territories, scoring just 4.1 for health and 1.4 for safety.Its health score is in the OECD's bottom 29 per cent, while its safety score is in the bottom 13 per cent. Canberra and the ACT can count itself a lucky place to live, with a higher average income, civic engagement and better safety than some of the 300 regions on the OECD list .

"Marry me? Jennifer Williams was overwhelmed to receive marriage proposals from jihadists after revealing that she was a Muslim . A tattooed, blonde woman who grew up a Christian in Texas has been overwhelmed by marriage proposals from ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria after one of her social media posts went viral. Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy researcher, caught the attention of thousands by joining a Twitter trend pointing out the difference between mainstream Islam and the jihadists bringing war and devastation to the Middle East. But she was shocked to find ISIS jihadists appreciating her message - in which revealed herself as an unlikely convert to Islam. The fighters, presumably besotted by her bright blue eyes and platinum blonde hair, were so taken with her that they started to send marriage proposals. Miss Williams was brought up a Baptist in Texas, uses Southern slang such as 'y'all' - and admits nobody would guess she was a Muslim at first sight. She now works for the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. The message which captured the attention - and hearts - of so many was first posted to just 60 people. But within a day it had been reposted more than 11,000 times, gaining her thousands of new followers in the process, many of whose profile pictures showed them posing in front of the black flag of ISIS. The jihadists - many of whom post pictures of the group's atrocities and try to tempt others to join their fight - then started reaching out to Miss Williams, and even proposing. One of her new-found followers poses with a sword in his profile picture, and has tweeted pictures showing ISIS beheading victims, as well as images of Osama bin Laden. And, despite the obvious enthusiasm for Miss Williams's appearance, some of her new fans tried to impose their own interpretations of Islam onto her, saying she would look better with her head veiled. Scroll down for video . Fanbase: ISIS fighters waging jihad in Syria and Iraq flooded to Miss Williams's account, seemingly taken by her Western looks, and began trying to hijack her story . Popular: This tweet by Miss Williams has been reposted more than 11,000 times . The message which grabbed their attention was part of the sarcastic #MuslimApologies hashtag, a reaction from mainstream Muslims to those associating them with ISIS and demanding apologies. In the posts, Muslims apologize for things which either they had nothing to do with - such as the outbreak of the Second World War - or which are not bad, such as scientific or mathematical advances pioneered by Islamic scholars. Fan: This man, who poses on his Twitter profile holding a sword and spreads images of ISIS atrocities, is now among those who follow Miss Williams . But her apology, Miss Williams instead revealed her own conversion story - how she had started to read the Qu'ran for her work on terrorism - and ended up converting. She said: 'Sorry I read the Quran to learn abt terrorist beliefs but ended up converting to Islam b/c of what it said. #MuslimApologies #sorrynotsorry' The response - presumably because of her Western appearance - wasÂ overwhelming, propelling her into the consciousness of ISIS militants on the front lines. Writing about her bizarre rise to fame for the New RepublicÂ magazine, she described how men from Saudi Arabia as well as ISIS-controlled lands started making approaches. She said: 'One guy told me how beautiful I would look in hijab (in other words, how beautiful I would look once I covered myself up and stopped looking like an infidel). Another just straight up asked me to marry him.' Miss Williams also found that her image - which some Muslims blurred to adhere with their modesty rules - was being used to tout her as an ISIS supporter, despite her obvious contempt for the group. She said: 'I, for one, do not appreciate having my conversion story used to attract more people to a repugnant ideology that spawns suicide bombings and beheadings.' However, she said she hopes her messages on Twitter might encourage her newly-acquired fanbase to read the Qu'ran further, which she believes might make them reconsider their jihad. Disgust: Miss Williams expressed her distaste at how her story - and image - are being used to imply that she supports the extremists in the Middle East .","Jennifer Williams is a foreign policy analyst in D.C. - and a Muslim .

"Water  is usually top of the list when it comes to any health kick, with health professionals recommending water as a cure for everything from bad skin to sleeping problems to headaches. This was the case for Gold Coast grandmother Helen Trengove, who embarked on a 14-day detox and cleanse program to kick start her health regime. On her first day of the program, the 61-year-old drank a litre of water every two hours. After ingesting 5 litres of water as part of recommended intake, Mrs Trengove began complaining of feeling woozy and light-headed. Scroll down for video .

After ingesting 5 litres of water as part of recommended intake, Mrs Trengove began complaining of feeling woozy and light-headed . 'I wrote down that I felt cold and nauseous and that I was going to take myself to bed, but I don't have any memory of it,' Mrs Trengove told a Current Affair . 'I wrote down that I felt cold and nauseous and that I was going to take myself to bed, but I don't have any memory of it,' Mrs Trengove told a Current Affair. 'To not have any memory or recollection of any of it is pretty shocking.' After falling asleep, Mrs Trengove fell unconscious and began fitting, crying out and drawing the attention of her husband Pete Trengove, who thought he heard strange noises coming from the bedroom. Helen was on the bed, and was spasming and twitching all over,' Mr Trengove said. 'I tried to wake her up, but she wouldn't wake up. Her eyes were open but there was just nothing there.' Mr Trengrove called an ambulance and his wife was rushed to Gold Coast University hospital. Mrs Tengove slipped into a coma and spent three days in the intensive care unit of the hospital with her husband and son by her side. She was diagnosed with hyponatremia, or water intoxication, a rare condition brought on by ingesting too much water. Nutrients in Mrs Trengove's body became diluted and were unable to perform their functions. âIt was bloody scary. I didnât know whether she was dying,' said Mr Trengove.

'Like most things, if you have too much of it, it can be bad for you- and water in excess can actually kill you,' Dr Pecoraro told A Current Affair. Drinking too much water can lead cells in the brain to swell, impacting on a person's ability to breathe, and potentially leading to unconsciousness and death. 'What you're using to clean out the body can become the toxin that can cause death,' said Dr Pecararo. 'I just can't believe it happened, to be honest. It was just really scary', Mrs Trengove said. 'I just never thought that water could kill you.' While Mrs Trengove didn't suffer from any long-term health complications, Dr Pecoraro said that brain damage can occur as a result of water intoxication and that avoiding drastic detoxes is the best way to avoid such issues. 'Donât force feed yourself water, as it can do harm from a diet point of view. Anything that seems too good, too quick, usually is too good to be true,' he said.","Gold Coast grandmother Helen Trengove drank 5L of water as part of health kick cleanse .

"Aston Villa's summer of upheaval continued on Tuesday with the club confirming Paul Faulkner has stepped down as chief executive. At the end of last season owner Randy Lerner put Villa up for sale as the American decided he had spent enough in attempting to raise the club's profile and fortunes. Several weeks ago the club also sacked assistant manager Ian Culverhouse and head of football operations Gary Karsa following an internal investigation into off-field issues. Boss Paul Lambert has since appointed Roy Keane as his new assistant, but the loss of Faulkner serves as another blow to the midlands outfit.

Under the sun:  Lambert and Keane share a discussion at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training ground . Although Lerner and Faulkner have worked closely together for many years, with the latter involved in a variety of roles in the former's many businesses, the two have now gone their separate ways. It follows a failure to reach an agreement on Faulkner's future as the club claim, via a statement, he had hoped to 're-engage with Lerner's broader business while remaining involved with Villa in a non-operational role'. Faulkner has parted on good terms, and has offered his support to Villa to ensure a smooth transition. Robin Russell, appointed by Lerner in 2006 as chief financial officer, has stepped in as acting chief executive. Faulkner said: 'I would like to thank Randy for the opportunity to become involved with Aston Villa and for the relationship we built over the years, which pre-dated my time at the club. 'To the Villa fans, I am grateful for their support over the years, and for their passionate love for, and loyalty to, this great club which deserves the very best. 'I would like to make particular reference to the wonderful Villa staff both at Bodymoor Heath and Villa Park. 'They are an incredible group of people and it's been a privilege to lead and work with them on a daily basis. 'Villa is best in class in so many ways off the field, and I only hope that success on the pitch follows. 'I feel very humbled to have been able to spend such a long period of time amongst such special people at such a special club and I wish them, Paul Lambert and the squad all the very best for the future as I look to embark on the next stage of my career and a new challenge.'

"A Colombian mayor is asking or a plaque to be removed just a week after it was unveiled by Prince Charles following attacks by locals. Prince Charles unveiled the memorial, which commemorates the lives of British soldiers who died trying to take the city from the Spanish in 1741, in Cartagena on Friday. But the city's mayor,Â Dionisio Velez, is now calling for it to be taken down after 'very negative reactions' from locals. Attacked: The mayor of Cartagena, Colombia, has demanded that a plaque commemorating the lives of British soldiers killed attacking the port be removed less than a week after it was unveiled by Prince Charles . The British Navy attacked the wealthy trading port in 1741 in an attempt to assert dominance over the Caribbean region. The attack ended in a crushing defeat, with 18,000 British troops killed . The city's police force say one man has already been arrested while trying to damage it. The mayor said he did not want to 'hurt the feelings of people' and 'a mayor has to avoid errors, but when itâs clear he has made one, he is obliged to rectify it', according to the BBC. Juan Carlos Gossain, governor of the state which covers Cartagena, added: 'Why isnât there a tribute in London to the Nazi pilots who died while bombing the city during World War Two?' In the 18th century the port at Cartagena was one of the four main Spanish trading posts  in the Caribbean,Â funneling large amounts of gold and silver from South America back to Europe. The British attack, under the command of Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon, ended with the deaths of around 18,000 British soldiers, while only 2,000 Spanish troops lost their lives. The Spanish commander, Don Blas de Lezo, was hailed as a hero and a statue of him was erected at the San Felipe de Barajas castle - close to where the new plaque has been placed. After the attack Admiral Don Blas de Lezo, the Spanish commander, was hailed as a hero by locals. The plaque to British soldiers stands near a statue of him . Hatred: Colombian police say they have already arrested one man who was caught trying to damage it . The plaque was unveiled on Friday by the Prince of Wales and recalls the 'valour and suffering of all those who died in combat whilst seeking to take the city' from the Spanish crown. Charles left Colombia on Sunday for Mexico as part of a Royal tour of South America with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. Camilla was left blushing for all the wrong reasons today when she turned up in a stunning creme ensemble - which was almost identical to her host's outfit. Standing beside Gretta Salinas de Medina, the First Lady of Monterrey, the pair looked the mirror image of one another, as they made their way around the industrial city in northern Mexico. The outfit faux pas took place on the final day of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall's trip. In the mid-18th century, Cartagena was one of four large, heavily defended Spanish ports which dominated the lucrative trade routes through the hotly contested Caribbean. Comprising around 10,000 people, it was founded by the Spanish in 1533 and passed through British and French hands before landing back in Spanish control. In the 1700s, it was one of the main routes which saw hoards of South American gold and silver pass through on its way back to Europe. British and Spanish relations in this period were tense, and a series of trading treaties were established in colonial waters in an attempt to prevent conflict. As part of one such treaty, the 1729 Treaty of Seville, the Spanish were allowed to board Royal Navy ships sailing through Spanish waters. During one boarding, a British captain named Robert Jenkins had his ear cut off by a Spanish officer. He pickled the ear, took it back to in London, and presented it to the House of Commons. That lead to Prime Minister Robert Walpole declaring war on the Spanish in 1738, a conflict which would become known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. The British attack on Cartagena came in 1741 (pictured above). After a series of minor victories around the Caribbean, this assault was aimed at permanently weakening the Spanish dominance over the region. The attack, under the command of Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon, was among the largest ever mounted by the Royal Navy, and ended in a crushing defeat. Vernon lost 37 ships, including transports, and another 17 were heavily damaged. Around 11,000 men lost their lives fighting, with another 7,000 subsequently died of disease. By comparison, the heavily fortified Spanish lost just 800 men, with another 1,200 perishing from infections afterwards. Admiral Don Blas de Lezo was hailed as a hero by locals, and secured the Spanish foothold in the Caribbean for the next century. A statue of de Lezo was erected near the Castillo San Felipe de Bara which had been heavily involved in the fighting.","Prince Charles unveiled plaque to British soldiers in Colombia on Friday .

"With his five goals, his bright yellow jersey and his boyish looks, James Rodriguez has attracted the attention of Brazil. Precocious and virtuoso are just two of the words used to describe the 22-year-old playmaker ahead of Colombiaâs World Cup quarter final against Brazil on Friday. Just 22, he is already Colombiaâs top scorer at a World Cup and is the leading scorer so far at the 2014 tournament. For many, the player who wears the name James (pronounced 'Hamez') on his jersey has been a revelation at the World Cup. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez's silky skills . Star in the making: Colombia's No 10 has taken the World Cup by storm with five goals in four games . Trust: Playmaker James Rodriguez (right) talks to head coach Jose Pekerman . But for those who have followed his football career, there has been no surprise. They knew that he was talented, had a winning mentality and could give Colombians something they have been awaiting for a long time. He has been consolidating himself as the replacement of Carlos 'el Pibe' Valderrama, the leading figure of a national team that played in three World Cups in the 1990s. Faustino Asprilla, an ex-Colombia player from that generation, said that Rodriguez 'can be the best Colombian footballer in history.' His technical abilities have been exceptional and he has shown them off in Brazil. He scores with surprising ease. He has scored in each of Colombiaâs matches, and he has done it with both feet and his head. Focused: Colombia's James Rodriguez shows off his juggling skills during training on Thursday . Wonderstrike: Rodriguez thumps a volley past Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera in the round of 16 . In Colombiaâs 2-0 win over Uruguay, he controlled the ball with his chest and shot from outside the area to score one the most stunning goals of the tournament. 'Football needs players of his characteristics for this spectacle,' Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said. 'For the moment, heâs the best player at this World Cup. Despite his nickname, 'el Nino' arrived in Brazil with the curriculum of a veteran: eight years playing as a professional in Colombia, Argentina, Portugal and France. His professional debut came when he was 15 for Colombian team Envigado. Prepared: Rodriguez stretches during a training session in Fortaleza, Brazil . Rodriguez also became the youngest foreign player to debut, score and become a champion in Argentina, where his performances were a springboard for a move to Europe. In 2010, he moved to Porto, where he shared a dressing room with fellow Colombia team-mates Radamel Falcao, Fredy Guarin and, later on, Jackson Martinez. In Portugal, he won three league titles and the Europa League before signing with Monaco, which paid 45 million euros for his transfer last season. In Portugal, aged just 19, he married Daniela Ospina, the sister of Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina. A devout Christian, Rodriguez goes to church, as does Falcao and other members of the Colombia squad. The faith seems to be a uniting element of the team, which usually gathers in a circle on the pitch and prays before matches. Team spirit: Rodriguez and his team-mates celebrate with a dance after his goal against Ivory Coast . Book mark: Colombia coach Jose Pekerman talks tactics with Carlos Sanchez . Star man: Pekerman has built his exciting Colombian side around Rodriguez . On social media sites, Rodriguez refers to himself in profiles as a 'son of God.' Usually shy and a man of few words, he got over a mild stuttering problem during his childhood. He is the son of an ex-footballer who left the family when Rodriguez was 3. It was his step-father who took Rodriguez to a football school when he was 5 and where he usually played with boys who were advanced. 'That boy played every match as if it were the last one he would play in his life,' said Armando Calderon, coach of the Tolimense Football Academy where Rodriguez played as a youth before turning professional with Envigado. 'James doesnât accept losing, not even in PlayStation,' his mother, Pilar Rubio, said. From Envigado, he went to play for Banfield in Argentina when he was 16.

VIDEO Team Profile: Colombia highlights . At Monaco, the young playmaker was reunited with Falcao, whose serious knee injury in January meant Rodriguez assumed more goal-scoring responsibilities in the final months of the season. He finished the season with 10 goals and 13 assists. Rodriguez soon extinguished any fears that without 'El Tigre,' Colombia wouldnât be able to find its way to goal. 'His growth is permanent, mature,' Colombia coach Jose Pekerman said. 'He has a vision for the game, a good shot.' Rodriguezâs feats are transcending football, and comments about his talent are all over social media. 'Man watching this Colombian game I think I have my fav player in the world cup!' NBA player LeBron James said. 'Obviously his name help that out.' Rodriguez will turn 23 on July 12, the eve of the World Cup final at the Maracana, and all of Colombia hopes that he will help guide the team there.

"He has already created history after the first baby was born following a womb transplant. Now Mats BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m hopes to go one step further â by growing wombs from scratch. The Swedish doctor is working on growing a womb in the lab. While it may sound fantastical, teams elsewhere in the world are âmakingâ livers, kidneys and even hearts. Given to young women who are born without one or have theirs removed due to cancer, the new wombs could allow them to achieve their dream of motherhood. Scroll down for video . Surgeon Mats BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m (pictured third from the right) and his team have already created history by carrying out the world's first successful womb transplant. Now he is working on growing wombs from scratch a lab within a decade . The world's first successful womb transplant saw the birth of  baby Vincent in Gothenberg, Sweden, last month after years of tireless research. He was born weighing 4lbs . The project is still in its infancy, however Professor BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m envisages taking wombs from dead donors and stripping them of their cells, to leave little more than a living framework. This would then be coated with stem cells â âmaster cellsâ â taken from the young womanâs body. It would then be grown in the lab, before being given to her as a new womb. Using the womanâs own cells would mean it would be an exact match for her own body â removing the need for powerful and potentially dangerous immunosuppressant drugs. The Gothenburg University professor has successfully made a ratâs womb, however, it will be decade before he has a womb ready to put into woman. News of the project has emerged just days after Professor BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m announced that a baby had been born after a womb transplant for the first time anywhere in the world. He has been called Vincent - a name derived from the Latin for 'to conquer' - to mark the extraordinary lengths his mother undertook to have him. The breakthrough offers hope to childless women around the world, including some 15,000 in the UK alone who were born without a womb or had it removed due to cancer or other illness. Baby Vincentâs mother carried him in a womb donated to her by a close family friend. He is now a month old and a âperfect baby boyâ. His mother, who is 36, was devastated to be told at 15 that she didnât have a womb. She said: âI have always had this large sorrow because I never thought I would be a mother - and now the impossible has become real.' Vincentâs mother, who has not been named, was one of nine to be given a new womb as part of the pioneering project at Gothenburg University. Seven of the transplants were successful â and two of the women are just weeks away from giving birth. In another world first, the mothers-to-be have been given wombs by their own mothers. In other words, each baby is being nurtured in its grandmotherâs womb. The extraordinary procedure, which doctors have likened in importance to the first successful heart transplant, means each womb will have carried two generations of the same family. Professor Mats BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m, who has spent 15 years perfecting the complex surgical techniques needed for a transplant, says these two pregnancies prove that Vincentâs birth wasnât just âpure luckâ. Mats Brannstrom and his team performing a womb transplant on a woman earlier this year.Â Another six women given new wombs are also said to be pregnant . He predicts that six of the seven women will become mothers. He said: âIf that happens, then itâs a very effective treatment. Itâs a costly treatment but itâs very effective.â News of his success provides a boost for a similar project in the UK in which 60 women are waiting for a new womb. However, close to Â£500,000 is needed if the first British woman is to be operated on next spring or summer. Richard Smith, a consultant gynaecological surgeon and head of charity Womb Transplant UK, described the Swedish women â including Vincentâs mother, as incredibly courageous. Mr Smith said: âIt is a big step, setting yourself up for something that is a big step into the unknown.â Professor BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m said he was more focussed and disciplined than the UK team. However, he believes Mr Smithâs project will be successful and predicts the first British womb transplant baby will be born just three years from now.","Mats BrÃ¤nnstrÃ¶m carried out the world's first successful womb transplant .

"French fries are unarguably America's favorite side, but a new exhibition makes them the main dish, celebrating the humble fried spud in all its various forms. Fries from 100 New York restaurants have gone on display at a pop-up space on the Bowery in Downtown Manhattan. And the examples on display show just how many different forms the fry can take, from the 21 Clubâs pommes souffles to the paprika spiced curly fries at hot dog chain Papaya King. Now that's a real spud: A new exhibit pays tribute to the French fry with specimens from 100 New York restaurants, such as this spiral creation from Queens eatery Twist and Smash'd . The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance is a 'tornado fry,' a spiral creation from Queens burger restaurant Twist and Smash'd. Its creator, Brianna Cano, told MailOnline that the unusual structure was inspired by a dish she tried during a family vacation in Quito, Ecuador. The exhibit was organized by condiment company Sir Kensingtonâs to pay tribute to an unsung hero of America's culinary repertoire. The New York-based firmâs co-founder and CEO, Mark Ramadan, told MailOnline: 'So many chefs all around the city put so much effort and so much work into making the perfect fry, and we didnât feel like they were getting enough attention. Curves ahead: Papaya King's paprika-spiced curly fry (center) is also part of the exhibit, organized by New York-based condiments company Sir Kensington's . Small potato: A handful of tater tots are on display, such as this creation from Root & Bone . Sensing a pattern: Waffle fries from Quality Meats (left) and Max Brenner (right) are featured . 'Food has gone through an amazing revolution in past few years,' he continued. 'Burgers have gotten better, bread's gotten better, cheese has gotten better, and so have French fries. But no one's really talking about that - the burger gets all the attention.' In fact, even he was impressed by the level of effort that went into some of the fries on show. 'There's a restaurant called Colonie and they wrote three paragraphs about how they sent their chef out to a local farm and found this super-unique potato that only they used for their fry, and they fry it three times at very specific temperatures,' he said. Orange is the new golden brown: Bareburger's sweet potato fry is a colorful addition to the exhibit . New York state of mind: The exhibit features fries from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens . Accoutrements: Wall art illustrating fries from the exhibit hangs above a table of condiments, spices, oils and garnishes . 'Whether it's a cheap fry from Papaya King or a really expensive fry from the East Pole, they care and there's thought that went into this.' Each fry on display was immediately preserved with an imperceptible layer of resin as it came out of the fryer, and, like a precious artifact, displayed in an individual glass cloche. In Mr Ramadan's opinion, the most underrated varieties are the waffle fry and curly fry, both of which 'really maximize the surface area of delicious fry.' Underrated: Sir Kensington's owners want to show visitors that fries should be as celebrated as burgers and other restaurant items . Unsung heroes: 'So many chefs all around the city put in so much effort and so much work into making the perfect fry, and we didnât feel like they were getting enough attention,' Sir Kensington's co-founder and CEO Mark Ramadan toldMailOnline . Newfound respect: 'I think if there's one thing people leave this event thinking, it's that fries are incredibly diverse and incredibly unique and chefs think a lot about them,' he added . While he said those were harder to find, the exhibit does include plenty of visually diverse varieties, with waffle fries from Quality Meats and Max Brenner, a curly fry from Papaya King, and a sweet potato fry from Bareburger for viewers to feast their eyes on. Ultimately, Mr Ramadan wants to show visitors that fries should be as celebrated as burgers, and any other menu item. 'I think if there's one thing people leave this event thinking, it's that fries are incredibly diverse and incredibly unique and chefs think a lot about them.'

Liverpool boss Rodgers came under criticism for the team selection, but must now concentrate on Chelsea . Rodgers must make a decision whether to start some of the players who warmed the bench in Madrid . For all that Liverpool looked more organised against Real Madrid, for all that the team worked tirelessly and tried to frustrate the home side, they lost 1-0. Having placed such an emphasis on the showdown with Chelsea, Rodgers cannot afford a similar result. Steve Nicol, a European Cup winner with Liverpool in 1984, said: âWho is agreeing with what Rodgers is saying? Liverpool have won the European Cup five times. To go anywhere, lose 1-0 and stick a reserve team out is not on. âHe said it was a superb performance. The man of the match was (Simon) Mignolet, the keeper, so you couldnât have been doing that well defensively if your keeper was getting shot at all the time. âIn the second half, Real Madrid almost fell asleep. So Iâm thinking, âGo on Brendan. Get Balotelli on. Get someone else on and see if we can nick somethingâ. And what was there? One shot on target. I mean, come on. We are talking about Liverpool here, not some second-rate team happy to lose 1-0.â Others from Liverpoolâs glorious past joined in. John Toshack, a former Real Madrid manager, wondered why Rodgers was worrying about getting into next seasonâs Champions League when their hopes in this yearâs competition are in jeopardy. âLiverpool are going through a dodgy spell and it looked like a damage-limitation job,â said Toshack. âWhen you start a game and pass back to the midfielder, to the defender, to the goalkeeper, who kicks it straight out of play, something is not as it should be. If Liverpool had nicked a goal, Madrid would have got another one. Gerrard (centre) had spoke of his excitement to face Real after the Champions League draw was made, but had to settle for a place in the starting line-up... will he start against Chelsea on Saturday? Over 5000 Liverpool fans made the trip to the Bernabeu expecting Rodgers to field his possible strongest team . âThere is a hangover from what happened at Crystal Palace last season [when Liverpool blew a 3-0 lead to wreck their title bid]. That was a bitter pill to swallow. âLiverpool need to get some silverware on the table pretty quickly. Iâve seen situations like that [at Crystal Palace] before and they can hang around for a while.â That point is key. The selection in Madrid can be debated for ever, because there are those such as Ronnie Whelan - another European Cup winner - who point out Rodgersâ best XI were demolished 3-0 by Madrid at Anfield. But the fact Rodgers gave Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling, Jordan Henderson and Mario Balotelli a night off in Madrid suggests he is on a revenge mission for the 2-0 defeat Chelsea inflicted on April 27. Gerrard will be on a revenge mission after his slip against Chelsea last season. Was Rodgers saving him for that when he left him on the bench in Madrid? Liverpool, and Gerrard, will host Chelsea on Saturday for the first time since their 2-0 defeat in April . That was the day Liverpoolâs title dream truly died. Rodgers said on Monday the Premier League was Liverpoolâs priority. Traditionalists who have grown up on the triumphs in Rome (twice), London, Paris and Istanbul may baulk but that is how the manager sees it. âYou sometimes canât win with a squad rotation policy but that is the only way to go,â argued Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen. âWith the added demands we have, that is definitely going to get us results over the course of the season.â Looking ahead to Chelsea, he added: âSometimes you feel you almost owe them one. It was a big disappointment when they came and took three points off us, so it is a case of wanting to pay them back a bit. But you canât focus too much on last season.â Perhaps, subconsciously, they are. This week has been framed for a grandstand finish against Jose Mourinho and Co. There is no room for error. John W. Henry, Liverpoolâs principal owner, is in Dubai for a series of a meetings aimed at securing new business partnerships for the club. The American watched Al Waslâs match on Wednesday night alongside former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry.","Liverpool lost 1-0 away to Real Madrid in Tuesday's Champions League tie .

"A surge in support for the Green Party has propelled it into fourth place in the polls, ahead of the Liberal Democrats for the first time in a decade. The Greens were at a record 8 per cent in the Ashcroft National Poll, up 3 per cent, pushing Nick Cleggâs party into fifth place on 7 per cent. It is the Green Partyâs highest ever rating in the poll, which is commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory deputy chairman. Record support: The Green Party - whose one MP is Caroline Lucas (pictured) - has overtaken the Lib Dems . Growing support for the Greens is also potentially damaging to Ed Miliband, who could lose votes to the party which positions itself to the Left of Labour. Last week, it emerged Labour has appointed justice spokesman Sadiq Khan to lead the fightback. There are fears within Labour ranks that defections to the Greens could undermine its chances in up to 17 target seats. The Green Party calls for full nationalisation of the railways, an end to nuclear power and fracking, and a cap on bankersâ bonuses. It supports huge increases in the minimum wage and a wealth tax for the top 1 per cent of earners. Party leader: The Greens' Natalie Bennett . The party also proposes scrapping tuition fees and stopping the âprivatisationâ of the NHS. It supports a referendum on membership of the EU, but ideally wants to stay in a âvastly reformedâ union. The Greens have one MP, Caroline Lucas, who won her Brighton seat in 2010. In England and Wales it has 162 councillors and three MEPs. The Ashcroft poll of the voting intentions of 1,000 people, carried out last week, put Labour in first place on 31 per cent, down one point, and three points ahead of the Tories on 28 per cent. Ukip was down one point on 18 per cent, while the Lib Dems were down one on 7 per cent behind the Greens. Eight per cent of voters said they would back smaller parties. The Green Party, whose current leader is Australian-born journalist Natalie Bennett, said it was the first time in a decade it had been ahead of the Lib Dems in a national poll. In the past year the partyâs membership has surged 45 per cent to 22,000. The party has already thumped the Lib Dems once, beating Nick Clegg's party in the European Parliament elections by around 150,000 votes. It is considering legal action over a plan to exclude the partyâs leader, Natalie Bennett, from the proposed TV debates ahead of the general election â particularly as Ukip will be included. The party argues Ukip should not be included when the Greens have had an MP for four years, compared to Ukip having won its first seat at the Clacton by-election this month. The poll also found members of the public were more optimistic about their own economic prospects than those of the whole country. Nearly two thirds said they expected the economy to do well for them over the next year. That compared to 58 per cent who expect things will go well for the whole country.","Party's support put at a record 8 per cent in Ashcroft National Poll .

"Lionel Messi may not have worn his special-edition birthday boots against Nigeria, but the ones he did lace up in Porto Alegre certainly did the job. In the 2006 and 2010 World Cups the left-footed magician scored just once. He has four in three games this time round â a brilliant double against Nigeria taking him on par at the top of the goal-scoring charts with Brazil's prodigal son, Neymar. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the trailer for the documentary-movie 'Messi' First up: Lionel Messi's strike sails past Vincent Enyeama in the Nigeria goal for opening goal . The two did not hit it off in their first season together at Barcelona following the samba star's blockbuster move from Santos last summer, but they have shown their considerable individual ability for their national sides at this World Cup. In Vincent Enyeama, Messi was lining up against one of the few goalkeepers who has come out of a duel with the Argentina star relatively unscathed. At the 2010 World Cup the Nigeria goalkeeper made four world-class saves to keep Messi at bay, as Argentina edged past their African opponents 1-0 courtesy of a sixth-minute goal from Gabriel Heinze. Salute: Lionel Messi celebrates scoring his second goal of the game against Nigeria . Those happy memories were consigned to the past after just three minutes of their rematch at the Estadio Beira-Rio. A divine throughball from Javier Mascherano found Angel di Maria on the left side of the area. The Real Madrid midfielder flicked a shot against the post, which rebounded off Enyeama's head and back on to the post, and there was Messi, running at full pelt but still somehow able to guide a thumping finish into the roof of the net from 10 yards. Within a minute Nigeria were level, Ahmed Musa cutting in from the left and whipping a finish inside the right-hand post. The strike, deservedly, had both Nigeria and Argentina fans on their feet. All smiles: Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama shares a joke with Messi during the World Cup clash . Messi nearly got on the end of a flowing move in the 25th minute to restore his side's lead. After instigating the move himself with a driving run from the right, di Maria's sweeping cross/shot just evaded Argentina's No 10 at the back post. Two minutes before the break Messi forced Enyeama into a fine diving stop with a curling free kick from 35 yards. With his sighters set the recently-turned 27-year-old gave Enyeama no chance from a second set piece less than a minute later. VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Sures hot: Messi curls home a free kick for his second goal against Nigeria in Porto Alegre . Messi won the free kick by gliding past two challenges before being chopped to the ground by Nigeria centre-back Kenneth Omeruo. There were no questions about who would take it, as Messi grabbed and placed the ball down immediately. He then curled the dead-ball sublimely into the top-right corner, Enyeama so bewitched by the flight of the strike that he did not even dive to stop it. Two minutes into the second half Nigeria equalised through that man Musa, though they were not level for long as Marcos Rojo got the final touch at an Argentina corner to deflect Ezequiel Garay's header past Enyeama and make it 3-2. Influence: Messi scored four of Argentina's five goals to help his side reach the knockout stages . With Argentina's place in the last 16 secure, Alejandro Sabella withdrew Messi in the 63rd minute, no doubt wrapping him in cotton wool as soon as he took his place on the bench. Argentina boast some wonderful talents in their squad, including Sergio Aguero and di Maria, but Messi is streets ahead of the pair of them. Their captain has scored four of his team's five goals at the tournament, dragging them into the knock-out rounds. If your team is going to rely on one man at a World Cup, in this kind of form you would want it to be Messi.","Messi and Neymar both scored four goals in group stage .

"Colombia talisman James Rodriguez has emerged as the star player at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and there is sure to be significant interest from Europeâs leading clubs this summer. However, with Premier League clubs facing stiff competition from Real Madrid for his signature, there may be pangs of regret at Old Trafford after it emerged that Manchester United have twice turned down the chance to sign the brilliant Colombian playmaker. United have had an extensive scouting system in place in South America and Rodriguez was firmly on the clubâs radar as an 18-year-old in 2010 when he was starring for Argentine side Club Atletico Banfield. VIDEO Scroll down to hear commentator's hilarious reaction to Rodriguez's volley . World at his feet: Rodriguez has produced some stunning performances in Colombia's opening matches . United were approached by agents around the time that the club bought Javier Hernandez from Guadalajara but senior officials did not respond when Rodriguez would have been available for as little as Â£5million. To rub salt into the wounds, United then bought the unknown Â£7.4m winger Bebe just over a month later but he has started just three games in four years since signing for the club. Flops: United signed Hernandez (left) and Bebe (right) when they could have bought Rodriguez for Â£5m . Rodriguez, meanwhile, went on to sign for Porto for a fee in the region of Â£4m, where he won three league title and the Europa League under the management of Andre Villas-Boas as his development continued apace. Unitedâs interest was then reignited in 2013 but they were put off by an asking price that approached Â£40m, while there were also complications with third-party ownership that made any deal incredibly difficult to pull off. Golden boys: Rodriguez and Neymar have been two of the standout performers at the World Cup . Golden Boot: The Colombia attacker has scored five goals so far and leads the race to be top scorer . French club Monaco made the big money move for Rodriguez, who joined the French club in a joint Â£60m deal for him and Porto team-mate Joao Moutinho last summer. Now, with United boasting a number of players who operate most effectively in the ânumber 10â position, including Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and in the long term, Adnan Januzaj, it would seem very unlikely that Rodriguez will one day surface as a Manchester United player. However, Monaco are braced for for a battle to keep hold of the Colombian this summer, with Napoli and Real Madrid registering an interest in the 22-year-old. A league apart: Rodriguez holds the Portuguese league trophy with Joao Moutinho during their Porto days . Current club: The Colombian plays for Monaco in Ligue 1 but has been linked with a move to Spain . Although the French side will play in the UEFA Champions League next season, it may not be enough to persuade Rodriguez to stay, with his heart seemingly set on a move to Spain. âIt would be a dream to play in Spain, one of the best leagues in the world,â he is reported to have told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope. When pressed whether he would prefer Barcelona, Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid, he replied: âI like Madrid more.â World class: Rodriguez scored the goal of the tournament so far in the first half against Uruguay .","Colombia's No 10 has lit up the World Cup with some superb displays .

"Pro athlete: East Lansing Police say Charlotte Hornets forward Jeffery Taylor has been arrested in Michigan on domestic assault charges . East Lansing Police say Charlotte Hornets forward Jeffery Taylor has been arrested in Michigan on domestic assault charges. The police department said in a release Thursday that the 25-year-old Taylor was charged with one count of domestic assault, one count of assault and one count of malicious destruction of property. His bond was set at $5,000. Police say officers responded to an incident at the East Lansing Marriott at University Place around 1am on Thursday. The Hornets released a statement saying they are aware of the incident involving the third-year forward and are gathering more information. 'The Charlotte Hornets were made aware of the incident involving Jeffery Taylor early this evening,' the team said in a statement. 'The organization is in the process of gathering more information and doing our due diligence. This is a matter that we take very seriously.' The Swedish native, who once played for Vanderbilt, could face over a year in jail on the charges, reports Gannett Michigan. All of the charges are misdemeanors. The arrest comes at a conspicuous time for the NBA, whose commissioner just this past Monday vowed toÂ take a fresh look' at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL's rash of incidents. Adam Silver said during a community service event in Staten Island that the league has been discussing with the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families. 'We learn from other leagues' experiences,' Silver said. 'We're studying everything that's been happening in the NFL. We're working with our players' association. We've been talking for several weeks and we're going to take a fresh look at everything we do.' The NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell have been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in recent domestic violence cases. Goodell said last week the NFL wants to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. The NBA's collective bargaining agreement calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony. 'We have in place the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, although we'll take a fresh look at those as well,' Silver said. 'But most importantly, it's education, and it's not just the players, but it's the players' families. That's what we're learning, too. Three charges: He was charged with one count of domestic assault, one count of assault and one count of malicious destruction of property . 'We have to take these programs directly to the players' spouses, directly to their partners so that they're aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they're anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we're consulting experts. There's a lot to be learned here. It's a societal problem; it's not one that's unique to sports.' Silver spoke at the opening of a refurbished Staten Island playground and basketball court in an area damaged by Hurricane Sandy. He was joined by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Knicks and Nets officials in announcing community efforts throughout New York, which will host the 2015 All-Star weekend. Silver said the goal of the programs is to directly reach 500,000 children. New union executive director Michele Roberts also took part in what was her first official day in her new position. However, Silver said discussions with her started before Monday. 'We do have in place, unlike the NFL, a penalty scale, and to the extent it needs any tweaking, then we'll talk about tweaking it,' Roberts said. 'What I hope we're going to do as well is figure out ways to prevent any occurrence like that on our side. It's one thing to know how to react in the event it happens; it's a lot smarter to try to make sure it doesn't happen in the first instance.' Silver noted that the NBA has had its own difficulties with issues off the court, saying the aftermath of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling's racist remarks means 'everyone understands the high standard that we are living under now in the NBA.' The NFL's issues just accelerated the need to look for improvements. 'It's been going on, but the whole world is focused right now on what's happening around the NFL,' Silver said, 'so it'd be foolish for us not to try to learn from everything that's happening with that league as well.'

"An Apache combat helicopter has crashed during a night-time training mission in Idaho, killing both pilots on board. The Defence Department will investigate the crash after the Idaho Army National Guard helicopter went down only two miles south of its training base near Boise International Airport. It wasn't immediately clear whether the crew was heading to or returning from a mission. Police and military officials discuss how to manage the crash site after the helicopter went down about 7pm . Pilots fly an Idaho National Guard helicopter away from the crash site where two of their colleagues were killed . A coroner's van drives past the police cordon and towards the crash site where two men were killed . Colonel Tim Marsano, a National Guard spokesman, confirmed the two men had been killed in the crash but would not identify them as their relatives had yet to be notified. He told KBOI2: 'It is a very difficult evening for us in the Idaho National Guard. We don't know the reasons why [it crashed]. We can't speculate at this point.' It was confirmed there was no fire or explosion in the crash, which occurred about 7pm, and the two men's bodies were not burnt. Prior to the crash, the Idaho Army National Guard had 16 Apache helicopters at its Gowen Field training base. It has a training area about 20 miles south of Gowen Field, but pilots also train over other areas. Major General Gary Sayler, commander of the Idaho National Guard, released a statement expressing his condolences to the victims' families. 'The men and women of the Idaho National Guard are united in grief at the loss of two of our brothers in arms, who gave their lives while training to defend our nation. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.'

"Police are hoping to cut out shoplifting in a crime-plagued town - by deploying cardboard officers. The flatpack PCs will be propped up in shop windows in St. Austell, Cornwall in the hope that passing crooks will mistake them for real people. Each cut-out will be holding a white board with a tally of how many shoplifters have been caught in the town. Police are installing a cardboard officer in a Co-op store inÂ St. Austell, Cornwall, to deter shoplifters. The cutout will be holding a white sign with the number of thieves caught in the area displayed on it . But locals are unconvinced the two-dimensional recruits will deter seasoned thieves who repeatedly target the town's shops. Cardboard police officers, costing about Â£25 each, have been used by a number of forces but opponents have branded them a gimmick. Some forces claim they have slashed crimes like shoplifting by 50 per cent but in other areas thieves have simply nicked the cut-outs. The deployment, beginning in a Co-op, is part of a drive against anti-social behaviour in the run-up to Christmas. Inspector Tony Joslin said: 'Shoplifting has an impact on all of us. Big retailers factor in the amount they are likely to lose through shoplifting in prices, so every theft adds to your food bill. Officers said the cutouts are designed to cut down on anti-social behaviour in the lead up to Christmas . 'When you are talking about major supermarket chains you are talking about an enormous amount of money. 'There is also the fact that shoplifting covers up a lot of other issues such as social deprivation and alcohol and drug use.' Locals weren't convinced the cardboard coppers would make much difference. Steve Williamson, manager of a nearby food bank, said: 'People who get desperate enough to steal in the first place won't be deterred by a cardboard man if they are not deterred by the security guard.' But Jake Moore, 27, who runs a Spar store which was robbed by a masked robber earlier this year, said: 'I guess I would consider installing one. Any kind of deterrent is better than nothing.'","Officers have installed model in Co-Op and plan to put more in other stores .

"Paul Scholes has slammed England's World Cup campaign and fears the nation are on a continuous downward spiral. Roy Hodgson's men picked up only one point during their three group games in Brazil, arriving back in England on Wednesday. FA chairman Greg Dyke believes changes to the Premier League system, allowing more homegrown players to make the step up to first-team football, could help England win the World Cup in 2022. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England's World Cup flops land back in the UK . End of the road: Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Co crashed out of the World Cup at the first hurdle . But Scholes said: 'From what I'veÂ seen atÂ thisÂ World Cup, we'llÂ be lucky to qualify.Â I fear England areÂ going the way of the Republic of Ireland, Wales and Scotland. 'England can take some positives.Â Raheem Sterling, DanielÂ SturridgeÂ and Ross Barkley, even though he didn't start the first two games, are a sign of the future -Â fast, intelligent footballers.Â But otherwise I'm struggling.' Scholes believes the influx of foreign talent is at the root of the national team's growing problems. 'Compared to LaÂ LigaÂ and the Bundesliga, English players are not getting enough first-team time in the Premier League,' said the Manchester United legend in hisÂ Paddy Power column. Critical: Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has spoken out in his latest Paddy Power column . Bright spark: England can take some positives from Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley, claims Scholes . 'We're going backwards from 1990 and the era of Paul Gascoigne and that conveyor belt of talent.Â Simply, the Premier League is riddled with average foreign players. 'This is having a detrimental effect on the opportunities for young English talent and our international results. 'PlayersÂ as talented asÂ David Silva, Robin vanÂ Persie, Sergio AgueroÂ and Eden Hazard only make the Premier League stronger. But it seems the Premier League isÂ known as aÂ marketÂ for average players (or their agents) to say: ""I'llÂ go to England and they'llÂ pay me stupid money to play"".' Scholes, meanwhile, has questioned United's willingness to pay a high price for Southampton's Luke Shaw. Scholes says: 'The proposedÂ Â£34m transferÂ for Luke Shaw to United is another example of somethingÂ which has a bad long-term impact. Clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options.

The Ballon dâOr winner went home a fortnight ago. Ronaldo was not able to carry a dreadful Portugal through the group stages on his own. Who knows if he will ever be back. Lionel Messi, though, has been moreÂ  successful with his own personal crusade here in Brazil. This is not a great Argentina team - far from it - but Messi has hauled them to Rio, where they will face a Germany side who have been at their ruthless best in punishing opponentsâ mistakes in this tournament. Germany are favourites to triumph, but donât write off Messi seizing the opportunity to claim the final as his own. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lionel Messi show off his impressive keep-up skills . One man band: Lionel Messi must inspire Argentina to World Cup glory against Germany on Sunday . Failure: Cristiano Ronaldo is officially the best player in the world but his Portugal side were eliminated early . How does Lionel Messi compare to the entire Germany squad at the 2014 World Cup? MESSI . Games: 6 . Goals: 4 . Chance conversion: 25.0% . Shooting accuracy: 50.0% . Passing accuracy: 82.0% . Passing acc opp half: 80.0% . Crossing accuracy: 26.3% . Dribbling completion: 60.0% . GERMANY . Games: 6 . Goals: 17 . Chance conversion: 24.6% . Shooting accuracy: 62.3% . Passing accuracy: 86.4% . Passing acc opp half: 81.9% . Crossing accuracy: 26.0% . Dribbling completion: 48.3% . The Argentina captain, Messi has led by example. At times he has found his best and consistent form elusive but his strength of will is equal perhaps to anyone who has ever played this game and, when it has mattered, he has dug as deep as he can go to find the contributions required. Messi has scored four goals in the tournament. His last-minute winner against Iran in Argentinaâs second game is one of the standout moments of this World Cup. Equally important, though, was the run and pass that allowed Angel Di Maria to score against Switzerland in a last-16 game that the South Americans easily could have lost. This is what the really great players do. They make a difference. According to his own father, Messi has been feeling tired as the tournament has progressed. Certainly his influence against Holland in the semi-final was relatively muted and it is worth remembering that Barcelonaâs season in La Liga continued competitively until the very last weekend. Quadruple: Messi has scored four goals for Argentina at this World Cup but all were during the group stages . Deadly duo: Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano (right) have inspired Argentina to the World Cup final . 5 - Lionel Messi has scored five goals at the World Cup, but he has never scored in the knockout stages . âI spoke with him and he said he felt like his legs weighed 100 kgs,â said Jorge Messi to a Brazilian newspaper. Gary Lineker argues that Messi has not been at his best over the last month. He is not alone in that view. Messi, though, is the type of footballer who doesnât have to trample all over a football game in order to definitively influence it. To return to the Ronaldo theme, the Portuguese forward plays like it is an affront for anybody else on either team to actually have the ball. This is not Messiâs way. The Argentina No 10 will drift in and out of games, choosing his moments to contribute. Against Belgium in the quarter-final, for example, he was quiet for long periods but the pass he slid through a needleâs eye to release Di Maria in the first half astonished those who were there to witness it. Certainly, he will present Germany with a unique threat at the Maracana tomorrow. Many are waiting to see if the 27-year-old can personalise a World Cup final as Maradona did when Argentina beat Germany 3-2 in 1986. Maradona didnât score that day in Mexico but, undoubtedly, it was his tournament. Little magician: Diego Maradona single-handedly led Argentina to the World Cup in 1986 and to the final in 1990 . Star: Holland's Arjen Robben (right) has arguably been the World Cup's best player . The 2014 version has not belonged solely to Messi. It has been a better tournament than that, more varied. Arjen Robben has arguably been its star individual but he is destined for a third-place contest against Brazil tonight after Holland fell to Argentina on Wednesday. Germany will certainly present a more consistent and varied threat than Holland. They have also had a considerably more comfortable build-up to the final. Argentina and Messi played 120 minutes against Holland. A day earlier, Germany were able to release their foot from the gas after those remarkable opening 45 minutes against Brazil. It is unlikely that Germany will worry about Messi as others have. Coach Joachim Low may consider moving his most reliable player Philipp Lahm back into midfield from full back in order to âlook afterâ the Argentina captain but, equally, he may feel the tactical intelligence, concentration and physicality of Bastian Schweinsteiger will be enough. The danger of obsessing about Messi is clear. Holland did it to a degree on Wednesday which almost inevitably led to right-sided forward Ezequiel Lavezzi having one of his best games of the World Cup. Adored: Messi can be heralded alongside Maradona if he inspires Argentina to their third World Cup . Race against time: Angel Di Maria is struggling to be fit for Argentina's final with Germany on Sunday . If the expressive and direct Di Maria regains fitness in time for Sunday, Germanyâs rather modest full backs will have something else to do worry about, too. Di Maria is unlikely to make it while it will be interesting to see if Sergio Aguero is fit enough to start. The Manchester City player has not made an impact here yet. He is another player, though, who has an immaculate sense of timing. Germany, perhaps, do not have such striking individuals. It is tempting to label this final as one man against a machine. That would patronise Lowâs team, though. They have scored 17 goals in this World Cup and have spread those across eight different players. Argentina, meanwhile, boast only four goalscorers. Messi has brought his nation to this final admirably. Those from his country who have poured across the border to sleep in cars and on the beach in the Rio rain in recent days have come to see him crowned on the most fitting stage of all. Germany are the team in form, though, and I expect them to win this final. Time to shine? Sergio Aguero has been poor for Argentina so far but could light up the final . Machine: Germany have scored 17 goals so far at this World Cup and should be favourites for the final . Position: Germany's decision to shift Philipp Lahm back to full-back has benefited the side .","Ronaldo is officially the best player on the planet in 2014 but is back home .

"You're 19 years old, at your first senior Wimbledon tournament. The score is 3-3 in the second set against the top seed, a true great of the game. Most would probably ensure they didn't do anything silly against Rafael Nadal on Centre Court. But not Nick Kyrgios. This teenager produced the shot of the tournament at a moment of tension in the match. Nadal's powerful backhand was struck straight at the Australian, who duly opened his legs, clipping an outrageous effort past the disbelieving Spaniard for a winner.

"Raheem Sterling is a player Roy Hodgson saw as a versatile player at the World Cup in Brazil, trying him in a no 10 role and wide on the left as England were knocked out in the group stage. And now the Liverpool playmaker has shown he is just as adaptable off the pitch - posing for photos in entirely different environments with his friends, and then members of his family. Sterling will link up with Brendan Rodger's squad later this month after enjoying some time off after a long season at club level and a short, but tough, campaign with England.

"When Ryan Gauld emerged through the arrivals gate at Edinburgh Airport on Thursday afternoon he looked like any other young kid returning from a trip in the sun. Unassuming, understated in many ways, the 18-year-old is still at an age where a weekâs holiday in Portugal would be grounds for parental concern. He could have easily been ignored by the massed ranks of travellers had it not been for the media scrum that formed his welcoming committee. One can only assume that in the days, months and years ahead this level-headed teenager will cope with being centre of attention. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Teenage Ronaldo scoring a spectacular goal for Sporting . Playing it cool: Ryan Gauld arrives home at Edinburgh airport on Thursday to a media frenzy . Should he deal with it in the same assured manner with which he has his Â£3million move to Sporting Lisbon then his nearest and dearest need have no concerns. âItâs been a bit of a crazy last few days and Iâm glad itâs all sorted now,â Gauld said on his return from Lisbon after signing the deal that has Scottish football aflutter. âTheyâve paid a big price but hopefully I can put in big performances for them and establish myself and do well. âIt will be hard to leave home and learn a new language but Iâm really looking forward to it, itâs going to be a good challenge for myself and Iâm really looking forward to it. âWhen I first heard of the interest, I was kind of overwhelmed by it. âBut the club have been great through it all; theyâve not stood in my way, theyâve let me speak to them and helped the deal go through so Iâm really grateful for that. âThe fans have been absolutely superb ever since I played my first game, they supported me even when I was not playing too well. âI would like to thank them for that and also the coaches at Dundee United, they are the ones that have developed me as a player, and the gaffer has given me a chance to show what I can. Cahnce to shine: Gauld thanked Jackie McNamara for giving him first-team opportunities at Tannadice . VIDEO Gauld inspires Dundee United with four assists . âI would just like to say thanks for everyone at Dundee United for giving me this chance. Since I was young Iâve always wanted to play abroad so hopefully it will live up to what Iâm expecting.â Sporting have famously produced players such as Ronaldo and Luis Figo. In Sportsmail on Thursday, Gauld was posing for photographs in front of pictures of the celebrated pair as Sporting unveiled the playmaker. But the 18-year-old, from the small Aberdeenshire town of Laurencekirk, played down suggestions of following in their footsteps. âIâm not really thinking of that just now, Iâm just thinking of looking forward to playing for the club and trying to make a good show of myself. âTheyâre two very good players but Iâm just concentrating on myself. Everyone knows itâs a great club, a very big club, good at developing younger players. Thatâs played a bit part in my signing. âTheyâre just looking forward to me going over for training and weâll see how it goes from there. âThe deal shows that theyâre not expecting too much, too soon - itâs probably a long-term investment.â In good company: Gauld stands in front of posters of Luis Figo (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo at Sporting . Yet amid all the hoopla which has surrounded Gauldâs transfers there has come a word of caution. Aside from almost 400 goals for clubs and country, Ian Rushâs lasting gift to the game was a quote which will follow him to his grave. âI couldnât settle in Italy,â the striker famously said of his solitary season with Juventus which bisected his 15 years at Liverpool. âIt was like living in a foreign country.â Whether or not the Welshman had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek or not when recalling that dismal term in Turin isnât really the point. Rushâs meagre return of just seven goals in season 1987-88 after the Italians had paid out Â£3m was miles short of what was expected from a marksman who had no equal in the English game at that stage. By the time he shuffled back to Merseyside a year later - to the slight embarrassment of all concerned - his place as the poster boy for British players bombing abroad was forever assured. He has not suffered alone, however. Paul Gascoigne scored just six goals for Lazio in three years. Jonathan Woodgateâs nine appearances for Real Madrid cost approximately Â£1.5m a throw while Stan Collymore lasted just five weeks with Oviedo before announcing his retirement. Mercifully, for Sporting Lisbonâs latest recruit, there are sufficient cases of Brits who have thrived in foreign climes to take no shortage of encouragement. Call Steve McManaman, John Collins or even Joe Jordan to the stand. The kids are all right: Gauld celebrates with Gary Mackay-Steven (left), John Rankin and Jon Souttar (right) Russell Latapy first treaded the foreign boards with Portuguese side Academica before moving to Porto, Boavista and then memorably Hibs. And while the current Inverness assistant manager believes Sportingâs famed development of young players makes it the perfect fit for Gauld, Latapy believes that success on the park can only come if thereâs firstly a degree of contentment off it. âThey are lovely people in Portugal. They remind me a lot of the Scots,â Latapy said. âItâs a lovely culture also. Whoever goes there will have a wonderful time. âItâs like everything else. Wherever you go, people assess the type of person you are, the kind of personality you have and treat you accordingly. Itâs the same with Scottish people. âRyanâs a great kid and heâs going to a fantastic club. Itâs one thatâs produced some of the best young talent in Portugal. Heâs going there at the right age and Iâm sure heâs going to have an opportunity to play. He will have a wonderful time. âWhat I would say is itâs always important you learn the language as it helps you to adapt a lot faster. âIâm sure they will help Ryan adapt and provide things like language teachers to help him learn the language.â Speaking from experience: Former Hibs, Rangers, Dundee United and Falkirk midfielder Russell Latapy . Gauld is a smart kid, however. Not too old for his years but certainly intelligent, mature and not lacking in confidence. His vision for the future â as laid out in an interview earlier this season â made for interesting, prophetic reading. He foresaw himself not in the English Premier League one day but in a more technical league where 5ft 6in players werenât trampled underfoot. Spain was his stated preference and he wasnât far out. Latapy â no stranger himself to the demands of being a creative midfielder â certainly believes both Sporting and the Primeira Liga are good fits for the Dundee United product. âHeâs at a club thatâs always been great with young players,â he added. âIf you talk about some of the young players that have come through there you are looking at Cristiano Ronaldo, Figo, Nani, Joao Moutinho. So many of the best young Portuguese talent has come through Sporting. âThe thing about Portugal is the game is really technical. They like to have the ball on the ground and to play it to feet which will suit Ryan. âIf he is going to continue to progress in the way he did last season then the challenges are the normal ones - keeping fit, adapting and learning as much as he can. âHeâs an exciting young player. Give him the ball and he makes things happen in the offensive third. âThatâs a serious asset in todayâs football.â","Gauld has signed for Sporting Lisbon in a Â£3million deal from Dundee United .

"Frank Lampard captains England against Costa Rica on Tuesday and will then quit international football despite Roy Hodgson suggesting he still has an international future. Lampard thinks it is the appropriate time to bow out and will do so having won 106 caps. He has an offer to play in Major League Soccer with New York City next season and that could lead to him playing in the Premier League on loan. He will finish with just two fewer international caps than his father Frank seniorâs West Ham pal and former England captain Bobby Moore. One last time: Frank Lampard is expected to play his last England game against Costa Rica . History boy: Lampard could become England's second youngest scorer at a World Cup if he nets on Tuesday . Lampardâs record of 29 England goals is impressive, although Charlton hit 49 and remains England's top all-time scorer with Wayne Rooney closing the gap on 40. If Lampard scores on Tuesday he will become the second oldest player to score a goal at World Cup finals for England having turned 36 four days ago. The oldest was Sir Tom Finney, who scored a late penalty in the 2-2 draw against Soviet Union in 1958 at the age of 36 and 64 days. Although . Steven Gerrard has asked for some time to consider his international . future it is unlikely Roy Hodgson will persuade him to change his mind . on calling it a day with England. As it stands Gerrard has 113 caps, two . behind the most capped outfield player David Beckham. Goalkeeper Peter . Shilton remains the most capped on 125. Decision time: Steven Gerrard will consider his international future after the World Cup in Brazil ends . The Luis Suarez 'camp' are now dropping heavy hints that when the World Cup is over he will quit Liverpool with Barcelona and Real Madrid set to battle it out for his services. A 'shoot out' between the two La Liga against would be appropriate. To his Uruguayan team-mates Suarez is known as 'El Pistolero'...'The Gunfighter.' In the last four World Cup finals Germanyâs Miroslav Klose has scored 15 goals compared to total of 17 by England over the same period. Whether or not Didier Drogba starts against Greece on Tuesday, he will no doubt have an impact on the game at some stage. Drogba, who will quit international football at the end of the World Cup, will be determined to make sure that this game is not his last for the Ivory Coast. Perhaps one of the reasons for his longevity is that the 36-year-old didnât start a professional career until he was 21 with Le Mans. High flyer: Didier Drogba may play his last game for the Ivory Coast against Greece on Tuesday . There is a growing feeling that too many young English strikers get burned out because they play far too much at a younger age - take the case of Michael Owen. And there is an argument, endorsed by Paul Scholes, that at 28 Wayne Rooney has already peaked. At the same age Drogba moved into his pomp at Chelsea. And even a bit of racy lifestyle didnât seem to harm Drogba. In his early days his team-mates called him 'Tupac' after the America rap because of his penchant for a wild nightlife. Watch Out for...

I â say :Ahead of an World Cup qualifier against Poland in 1990, Ian Wright once explained with a combination ofÂ  Churchillian rhetoric and 'Sarf London Caribbean slang' that England would win because of 'The bulldog spirit, man'. They did the next night at Wembley when a combination of panache and passion saw England blow Poland apart 3-0. Such virtues seem very much out of fashion now - laughed off as 'old school' - while the appliance of more and more sports science is seen as the way forward. Young tyro: Paul Gascoigne scores for England against Poland at Wembley . Left-field bolt: Stuart Pearce scores for England against Poland at Wembley in 1990 . But a bloated back room staff of medics, spin and head doctors has hardly succeeded. If anything itâs given the players more excuses and made them more mentally fragile . Indeed when you listen to what makes other countries tick many cite national pride and desire the very qualities that are laughed off by football 'hipsters' in this country. Explaining Spainâs demise Xavi Alonso spoke of a lack of 'hunger'. When Harry Redknapp suggested that some Tottenham players made excuses NOT to join up with England it raises questions about the motivation of many when it comes to playing for England. On that front perhaps the FA should find some sort of role for Ian Wright in the camp. On the notion that there are players who duck out of playing for England Wright has said: 'The next young player who says he does not want play for England should be ordered to ring the parents of a soldier who has dies in Afghanistan, and tell him his reasons.' Well said Wrighty. Thatâs the bulldog spirit, man. World Cup Moment: . Belo Horizonte, where England face Costa Rica on Tuesday, is of course the venue of Englandâs most infamous defeat when they were beaten 1-0 by the USA in 1950. Shock: England lost to USA 1-0 in 1950 thanks to a goal from GaetJens (right) At the time England were regarded as the best team in the world with players like Sir Tom Finney and Stan Mortenson - although Stanley Matthews was dropped for the match. England also lost to Spain 1-0 and were eliminated, although, they did beat Chile 2-1. The chastening experience suffered is said to have inspired Englandâs right back at that World CupÂ  to one day make amends and lift the trophy. His name? Alfred Ramsey. World Cup Bet: . The patriotic pound has proved very profitable for the bookies at the World Cup. So itâs difficult to see the attraction of 4/5 on an England winâ¦although Costa Rica are resting players which maybe explains why you can 7/2 on them winning with the draw 11-4. A romantic punt for first goal scorer is Frank Lampard at 10-1; Joel Campbell is 13-2 to open the scoring for Costa Rica. Uruguay are 13-2 to beat Italy.","Lampard expected to retire from international football after the World Cup .

"Neymar is convinced that Brazil can win the World Cup without him. Brazil's World Cup star and poster boy was ruled out of the tournament on Friday night when he fractured a verterbra after being kneed in the back by Colombia's Juan Zuniga. Twenty-four hours after Brazil's quarter-final win, the Barcelona forward released a video in which he spoke about his heart-breaking injury for the first time. Still dreaming: Neymar insists he can still celebrate a World Cup victory with his teammates in Rio . Stunned: The Brazilian superstar looked emotional but tried to remain upbeat during the message . Emotional: David Luiz hugs Neymar as he waits to board an ambulance after Friday's win over Colombia . Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back . The 22-year-old, who scored four goals for the Selecao here in Brazil, was visibly upset when speaking into the camera about missing the rest of the World Cup. But the former Santos player is sure his team-mates will retain their composure and go on to lift the trophy on July 13 at the Maracana. 'My World Cup has not ended, it has been interrupted by a play but the tournament goes on and I told my team-mates to do everything in order to help me achieve my dream to be world champion,' Neymar said. 'My dream was to play at a World Cup final but I'm certain my team-mates will be champions. 'I will be there with them, and all Brazilians will soon be celebrating all of that.' Brazil doctor Jose Luiz Runco guaranteed the injury will not have long-term effects on Neymar's career and said the player could even travel to Belo Horizonte to watch the semi-final against Germany on Tuesday if he is not feeling a lot of pain. Runco said he believes Neymar can return to action in about 45 days, and that Barcelona doctors were informed of the player's conditions from the beginning. 'He was extremely moved when I gave him the news that he was out of the World Cup,' Runco said. 'He cried a lot, which was a natural reaction at that moment. But I told him that although his dream was being cut short, he was still a 22-year-old with a lot in front of him. It was still a `good' type of injury.' Meanwhile, the referee in charge of Brazil's 2-1 win against Colombia, refused to comment on the incident. Carlos Velasco Carballo said: 'Unfortunately I cannot talk about it. I would like to but the rules do not allow it. 'We did a FIFA open day for the referees at the start of the tournament and we were all very open that day. 'I can talk to you about Manchester United, or Chelsea, or Jose Mourinho, or anything you like, but not this, thank you.'

Get well soon: Thiago Silva hugs Neymar as the Brazil team wish their star man well after his injury . Precaution: Neymar is wheeled into hospital and appears to be on a drip as doctors attend to the injured star . Cheerio: Brazil's team members saying goodbye to Neymar before his departure for his home in Guaruya . Hundreds of fans gathered outside the Fortaleza hospital where Neymar was taken straight after the match in the northern city on Friday. He was flown back to Rio on Saturday, where he had a tearful reunion with his team-mates, who returned to their Teresopolis base to begin preparations for their semi-final against Germany. Neymar was then flown from the training ground in Granja Comary by medical helicopter to his home in Guaruya, Sao Paulo to begin his recovery. He waved to the waiting media before taking off along with his father. So strong is Neymar's status as a global icon that leading footballers, sports stars, celebrities and even politicians have wished Neymar a speedy recovery. His name was sung by locals who attended the quarter-final between Holland and Costa Rica in Salvador on Saturday night. 'To Brazil, my team-mates, the coaches and the fans, this is a difficult time for me and I don't have the words to describe what is going through my mind and my heart,' said Neymar, who is expected to be out for three to six weeks. 'I want to thank everyone for all the support and affection they have shown me and for all the messages that I have received.'

Ready to go: Neymar is prepared for take off and gives a wave as he leaves for Sao Paulo . Here we go: Neymar's father waves as he prepares to take his son home to Sao Paulo . Zuniga, who has received a flurry of abuse from Brazil football fans on Twitter for injuring Neymar, sent the injured star a message of support on Saturday. Zuniga defended his challenge immediately after the match and on Saturday emphasised he had meant Neymar no harm. 'I feel burdened by this situation,' Zuniga said in an Instagram message. 'It resulted from a normal play and there was no bad intention, evil or recklessness from my part. 'I want to send a special salute to Neymar. 'I admire you, I respect you and I consider you one of the best players in the world. 'I hope you recover soon in order to continue to show us that in football there is a sport full of virtue and qualities, which I have put into practice since I was 12 years old and as a professional player.' Former Brazil striker Ronaldo claims Zuniga did intend to hurt the striker. Broken: The x-ray showing Neymar's injured back, highlighting the broken bone . He told a news conference in Rio de .

"A real life Breaking Bad father of three started a cannabis factory to support his family after losing his home and livelihood following a tumour operation. Shane Cousins, a 40-year-old father of three, was hoping to copy US crime drama chemistry teacher Walter White, who builds a Class A drug crystal meth empire after he is diagnosed with cancer. However Cousins, who had been forced to leave the car-valeting business he part-owned when an operation to remove a golf-ball sized lump in his neck left him unable to work, didn't have a clue about cannabis. The former glass factory worker, who lives in the small former coal-mining town of Ystradgynlais in South Wales with children Kyla, six, Keira, 11, Ethan, 16, and wife Julia, didn't even know how he was going to sell his crop. Scroll down for video . Shane Cousins (pictured), said his debt had spiralled to Â£50,000 when he started the drugs venture . 'I didn't even know whether it was ready,' he said. 'It was not something I had ever done before. I was going on the net to see when it was ready and I was just playing it by ear.' He added: 'I don't like the stuff. I've never smoked. I don't smoke fags or anything. Apparently that went against me in court. If I smoked it I could have said it was for personal use.' He pleaded guilty in Brecon Magistrates' Court last week - and faces sentence on October 10 after police found 23 plants in the property. Cousins was caught when a friend rang police in front of him after an argument. Â 'I don't why he did it,' he said. 'It was spur of the moment and he was sorry after.' At the time, his debt had spiralled to Â£50,000 and he was hoping to make thousands from the drugs venture. His life had fallen apart after his operation, which left him unable to work. 'The lump turned out to be benign,' he said. 'But I had to have an operation that lasted seven or eight hours to have it removed. I still cannot feel part of my neck because it went so deep. 'I never went back to work because I was recovering from that. At the time I had a mortgage and everything was great.' By 2008 he had lost his home in Seven Sisters, Neath Port Talbot - which was valued at about Â£80,000 - and later moved to Abercraf, near Ystradgynlais. He had only initially been to the doctors to get medication for his sinuses. A police photo shows the cannabis plants that were confiscated from Cousins' property in the drug raid . 'The doctor said to me: ""What is that lump on your neck?'' Cousins said. 'It was by my ear, on the side of my neck by my ear. On the side of my cheek basically. 'I said I had been there twice and had been told there was nothing wrong with it. But it had grown in size.' He then began growing his cannabis from seeds he bought over the internet. 'I paid Â£50 for the tents and the lights were about Â£50 each. It cost me about Â£250 in total. I borrowed that off a mate. It must have been going on for about three or four months. 'There must have been about three or four weeks (to go) until they were ready.' The former glass factory worker was inspired by Channel 5 cop show Police Interceptors and whenÂ officers raided his home, they were overwhelmed by the smell. The cannabis plants pictured as they were growing in Cousins' attic. Officers said the smell was overpowering . 'I managed to get five or six in the car,' he said. 'As I walked downstairs the police were there at the front and the back. I went back in the bedroom and didn't answer the door. 'They found the plants in the bedroom and the attic and the six in the car. They could have seized the car. I had to get everything out and put it all in the police vans. 'There were 23 in total. Fifteen in the attic, two in the bedroom and six in the car.' His wife was terrified after hearing what had happened. He said: 'We have been together for 16 years. She was in bits because she was in work at the time it happened. She said, ""Oh my God, we could lose the kids!"" 'The solicitor said they will not jail me under the circumstances because I've no previous at all for anything. He thought it would be a suspended sentence for a year or community service or a fine or whatever. 'Not seeing my kids and the rest of the family - I don't know how I would cope. It would be difficult.' Cousins now insisted his criminal career was over. 'I would never do this again,' he said. 'Never, never. No way in the whole wide world. The thing is, how many other people are out there in my position, with no money and on the edge of doing something like this? 'Or if they have got to take two or three jobs to survive and they have got debt collectors on the door,' Shane said. 'How many people are doing this and have not been caught?'","Father of three Shane Cousins caught with cannabisÂ growing operation .

"Holland have under Louis van Gaal developed a style more like ""Power Football"" than the fabled ""Total Football"" - which came to the fore in the seventies with Johan Cruyff the inspiration. Itâs highly effective, with Holland having won all their group games and scored 10 goals. But Cruyff is critical and wants to see the Dutch turn on the style against Mexico and, ironically, be more German by turning their old power game into a more attractive style . 'The Oranje has qualified but the football isn't that good,' the Dutch legend said. High spirits: Holland manager Louis van Gaal (right) and striker Robin van Persie seem happy with their approach and tactics as the team prepare to face Mexico in the last-16 of the World Cup . Not impressed: But Dutch legend Johan Cruyff says the team should be playing more like Germany . 'I liked the way that Germany kept playing in their own style â even during the moments when things weren't going well against Ghana. 'That's the way Netherlands should be playing as well. The results are good, now we have to start playing good football.' Mexico will test just how good Hollandâs counter-attacking is, given that they have proved to have one of the toughest defences so far. Along with Belgium and Costa Rica, Mexico are the only team to have conceded just one goal. Solid as a rock: Mexico have conceded just one goal in the tournament so far and will offer stern opposition to Holland . Cult hero: Mexico coach Miguel Herrera is one of the most popular bosses at the World Cup in Brazil . They have made 42 tackles compared to a tournament average of 36.7 and have achieved 121 recovered balls compared to 88.8. Also, there have been nine offsides given in their favour against an average of 4.9. He is hardly the best known but Mexico coach Miguel Herrera has become a cult hero. His impassioned touchline antics, plus the generous was he treats fans, has seen him gather nearly 800,000 twitter followers; easily the most of any coach at the World Cup. Colombian Jorge Luis Pinto is Costa Ricaâs coach, but just after World War Two they had an Englishman in charge. Randolph Galloway, a pre-War striker for Derby and Nottingham Forest, managed several clubs in Europe â including Valencia and Racing Santander â and briefly took charge of Costa Rica in 1946 . Oh and the last time they made the round of 16 on their World Cup debut in 1990, memorably beating Scotland 1-0 on their way to qualifying behind Brazil in their group. But they were then beat 4-1 by Czechoslovakia. Fine job: Costa Rica's Colombian coach Jorge Luis Pinto exceeded all expectations by guiding them through the group stage . Georgios Samaras is a familiar face after spending two years at Manchester City then six at Celtic. He will be the focal point of the Greece attack on Sunday night and is the player Costa Rica need to stop having ended a goal drought that lasted 1,478 minutes with his last minute penalty winner against the Ivory Coast. Now 29m his contract has expired with Celtic and he could move back to the Premier League. Everton have expressed interested. Sevilla are also looking at him. Centre of attention: Georgios Samaras, seen here celebrating his winning penalty for Greece against Ivory Coast, is wanted by a number of Premier League clubs after leaving Celtic . I-say . Brazil are still favourites to win the World Cup but I say they are there for the taking when they face Colombia in the quarter finals on Friday. It was not a surprise they were taken all the way by Chile and only scrambled over the line on penalties on Saturday. With the exception of Neymar they have been distinctly lacking in Samba skills upfront and ironically for them have been indebted to a pretty tough defence. No mistake: Neymar handled the pressure of the penalty shoot-out and sent Brazil into the last eight at the expense of Chile . Off beat: Fred (left) has struggled to find his best form in the tournament so far as was again pretty ineffectual against Chile . Hulk and Fred donât seem up to it and Oscar hasnât clicked. Itâs as if they have been carried through on the wave of emotion and support that surrounds. It could still see them through but Colombia, familiar opponents in the Copa America, wonât be fazed and with James Rodriguez up front could well deny Brazilâs dream of winning the World Cup on home soil as Uruguay did in 1950. One to Watch . Giorgos Karagounis is a modern-day Greek god. He was an inspiration when Greece won the 2004 Euros and is still going strong at the age of 37. He will retire from international football after the tournament and is out of contract at Fulham. But in what is dubbed the clash of the underdogs he has still has the energy and passion to drive Greece who, like Costa Rica, are seeking to reach the quarter-finals for the first time. Greek soldier: Giorgios Karagounis will retire from international football at the end of the World Cup and is out of contract after leaving Fulham . World Cup moment . Itâs argued that Hollandâs 1974 were the best side never to win a World Cup. They couldnât have go off to a better start when English referee Jack Taylor awarded them a penalty in the first minute, which was converted, but Germany, led by Franz Beckenbauer, bounced back to win 2-1. The Dutch lost the 1978 final too but have so far showed they can at last be champions. World Cup Bet . Holland to win and both teams to score is 4-1. The Dutch to beat Mexico 3-1 is 18-1 . Costa Rica v Greece could be a slog so a draw at 90 minutes at 2-1 is prudentâ¦ 1-1 is is 11-2 and 2-2 is 20-1.","Holland legend claims van Gaal's side should play more like the Germans .

"Germany are strong favourites although it's always dangerous to write off Argentina... but who's got the better players? Sportsmail expert Martin Keown has watched both teams several times during the tournament. Here is his indispensable man-for-man analysis. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm talk ahead of the final . Making history? Germany could become the first European side to lift the World Cup in South America . One man band? Argentina may have to rely on the sublime talents of Lionel Messi (L) to win the tournament . GERMANYÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ARGENTINA . Such an imposing presence between the posts with a huge wingspan. he perfect physique for a goalkeeper and the game to go with it. Easily the worldâs best goalkeeper . With . goalkeepers itâs all in the mind, and though he didnât play much for . Monaco last season he has looked solid. A hero in the shootout and will . be full of confidence. Glove affair: Sergio Romero was a penalty shootout hero but Germany's keeper sweeper has the edge . You talk about strikers staying calm to score, but Lahm has a calmness in his defending. He trusts he can make challenges and his tackle on Marcelo was the best-timed challenge Iâve seen in the tournament. Has . taken his Premier League form to Brazil and done well. Struggled . slightly against Nigeriaâs Ahmed Musa but showed his tough side to carry . on after taking a bad blow to the face against Holland. Evenly matched: There is not much to choose between Philipp Lahm (L) and Pablo Zabaleta at right back . No airs and graces about Hummels. Heâs brilliant in the air and, with two goals, is a threat from setpieces. Has arrogance and confidence, too, which I like. He . gets better protection than he does at Man City but he looks quicker . and slicker than he did last season and thoroughly justifies his spot. See you soon? Mats Hummels (L) and Martin Demichelis could face each other in Manchester next season . Jerome BoatengÂ Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  7/10 . Has played at right back but makes a far better centre half. Adds genuine pace in the middle alongside Hummels, is strong and also good with his distribution. Solid . centre back and with his extra speed he can help cover Demichelis so . his partner doesnât get isolated. Has just moved to Zenit St Petersburg . for six million Euros, which seems a bargain. Need for speed: Both Ezeuqiel Garay and Jerome Boateng have pace to support their defensive partners . Benedikt HoewedesÂ Â Â  6/10 . Typifies his teamâs ethic. Not a high-profile name but a no-frills defender.Â  Iâve barely seen him put a foot wrong. Efficient, intelligent and rarely beaten down his flank. Bit . of a mixed bag. Very quick and obviously likes to get forward but he . still looks a little raw. Tenacious, though, and it takes a lot to get . past him. No frills: Neither Marcelo Rojo (L) or Benedikt Hoewedes are outstanding but they are rarely beaten . Bastian SchweinsteigerÂ Â Â  8/10 . With niggling injuries, he is almost forced to sit deeper rather than bomb forward. That improves the team shape. He is the heartbeat of the side with his range of passing and makes the side secure. Does . what Schweinsteiger does for the Germans. Happy to sit deep and has . played a lot of football at centre half so has those defensive skills. Made a fantastic tackle on Robben and is key for Argentina. Men in the middle: Javier Mascherano (L) and Bastian Schweinsteiger provide their side's midfield spine . A very interesting player. Can play a defensive role but likes to play clever passes and through balls. A real team player in the final third - if there is a team-mate better placed, he will find them. Another . hard worker who likes to sit alongside Mascherano. Has a big . responsibility in there but is a tidy and bullish player. Gets through a . lot of work andpasses well. Water carriers: Sami Khedira (L) and Lucas Biglia take care of the less glamorous sides of work . My player of the tournament. Has been playing two roles - he can join Miroslav Klose in the middle or if his midfielders stay central he drifts wide to the right. An exceptional young forward. Had . a decent game against Holland, is a good runner with the ball and happy . to sling crosses in if he canât go for goal. Has plenty of energy and . helped ease the loss of Angel di Maria. No contest: Thomas Muller (R) is shooting for the Golden Boot while Enzo Perez is second choice . Good passing and even better vision. Can switch the game from simple five-yard passes to sweeping switches of play if things are tight. And give him space on either foot and heâll smash one in. A . very probing player who always tests defenders. Isnât happy unless heâs . taking on people. Hollandâs Bruno Martins Indi had to come off because . he couldnât deal with his pace. Different strokes: Toni Kroos (R) is Germany's pass master while Ezequiel Lavezzi has pace to burn . Has had a relatively quiet tournament but by not doing much he keeps a good shape for the team. Invariably parks himself on the left to occupy defenders and helps the structure of the side. Fitting . stage for the worldâs best player. Finally has the chance to lead his . country out and be the match winner. One of the gameâs best players up . against the tournamentâs best team. String pullers: Lionel Messi and Arsenal's Mesut Ozil will orchestrate play from the midfield . He gives the team a better balance with the positions he takes up. He, Ozil and Schweinsteiger stay fixed while the rest of the midfield flows around them. Took . him a while to come to the party but that vital goal gave him a lift. Has improved his play and, with him up top, it helps Argentina to get . the best out of Messi. Forward thinking: Gonzalo Higuain and record breaker Miroslav Klose will lead their respective lines in Brazil . Comes on to good effect and really adds to the team with his running and finishing. Plagued by injury so not quite the Aguero of old but what a player to have on your bench. Will be disappointed not to feature more, but heâs a quality player. I . have a feeling he might play some part. So important for Argentina with . his direct approach. May try to time his fitness for the final like one . of his runs. An outstanding sub to call upon if needed. Super sub? Sergio Aguero could make an impact from the bench after recovering from injury . Bench mark: Bayern Munich schemer Mario Gotze will be disappointed not to start . Not impressed with his hair but he has been useful coming off the bench. Found it tough in some games but still provides excellent defensive cover. Another fighter who gives them some tactical flexibility in midfield. A talented youngster and his appearance against Brazil almost felt like a reward. Lost his place to Demichelis, but gives good cover at the back. In reserve: Per Mertesacker (R) and Andre Schurlle provide superb options for Joachim Low's germany . Has grown through the tournament and not been afraid to tweak things in the search for answers. Moved Lahm from midfield to full back, changed his centre half pairing and has used Klose well. After that semi-final performance you canât expect many changes because they seem to have found the best balance and are peaking at the right time. Can . be a bit of a drama queen on the sideliness but heâs been tactically . astute. His team virtually picks itself but he has made tweaks to . improve it. He might have catered to Messiâs needs, but credit to him . for getting the best out of his star man in an Argentina shirt. Gaffers: Germany boss Joachim Low (L) has more experience on the big stage than Alejandro Sabella . Best of both worlds: Only three Argentina players make it into Martin Keown's composite XI . Itâs a tough task picking from these squads but the Germans clearly have the superior back five. Iâd pick Mascherano ahead of Schweinsteiger because heâs had the edge in this tournament. If Di Maria were fit, Iâd certainly put him in for Ozil, though Lavezzi could work there too. Iâd put Messi at the top of the pitch where he can do the most damage. All three Argentines would have to keep their shape, though, because thatâs what Schweinsteiger, Ozil and Klose do so well for their team.","Germany face Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final on Sunday .

Crabzilla has been dismissed as a hoax by experts who say the existence of such a crustacean is impossible, and it is possibly the work of camera trickery or some well placed sandbanks on the shore. But the images, the first of which emerged last week as an aerial photo, have still attracted worldwide attention. Scroll down for video . A new photo has emerged of Crabzilla, apparently lurking beneath Whitstable pier where two boys are fishing . Experts and sceptics have said it would be impossible for Crabzilla to have grown to such a size. The photo is the second image to appear of the impossibly large crustacean, which would measure 50ft wide and be 10 times as big as Britain's largest crab. It appeared on the Weird Whitstable website which said in a statement: 'This shocking image of a giant crab under a popular crabbing spot in Whitstable was taken in July. 'The boys were unaware of the danger, but as several passers-by shouted to them, the crab slipped silently away under the water into the dark, sideways.' Crabzilla is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches (12cm) . Quinton Winter, who first shared the image and curates the Weird Whitstable site, said it had been a bit of fun and he did not expect anyone to believe there was such a large crustacean in British waters. The original aerial photo appears to show Crabzilla lurking off Whitstable harbour, its huge size dwarfing boats . The new image appears to show the crab emerging from the waters, but it has been dismissed as a hoax . Sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, has previously said Crabzilla is impossible. She said while there were species of giant crustacean in Britain, these tend to lurk in deeper waters. The largest in Britain is the spider crab, which grows to 1.5 metres and tends to stay in water around 1,000m deep. Crabzilla appears to be about ten times this size. It would be even larger than the biggest crab in the world - the Japanese Spider crab, which grows to around 3.7 metres. Dr Nye,Â an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton,Â said: 'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.' Some have blamed the latest pictures of Crabzilla on Photoshop trickery. The image (left) appears to show Crabzilla as 10 times bigger than Britain's largest crab. Dr Verity Nye (right) said the existence of the giant crustacean is impossible and the photo is more than likely to be a hoax . The Japanese Spider Crab is the world's largest crab and grows to around 3.7 metres - the size of a small car . However some appear to have been taken in or just going along with the series of comic photos, with people posting messages on Twitter. Comedian Frank Skinner, 57, also revealed he had abandoned plans to move there are being 'put off' by the giant crab, according to the Daily Star. Mr Winter, an artist and curator of the Weird Whitstable site, has said he understands most people do not believe the image is real. He told Kent Messenger: I don't think anyone seriously believes there actually is a 50ft crab in Whitstable. What would it feast on? Fat, juicy Londoners?'","Photo of hoax giant crustacean appears to show it emerging from water .

"Click here for all the best stats, analysis and heat maps from the quarter-final clash . France are out of the World Cup â did anyone notice? For Les Bleus were Les Miserables as they bid a meek au revoir to the tournament; there was certainly no va va voom. At least those who fell at the last-16 stage went down fighting. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany fans celebrate their side's win over France . World's end: France went down without a fight as they were beaten 1-0 by Germany . Winner: Mats Hummels' first-half header proved enough to book Germany's semi-final spot . The French, however, could not even summon the gusto to emerge with such honour. They had promised so much during a group stage in which they scored eight times, adding two more in their second-round disposal of Nigeria. But in Rio, against Germany, they surrendered, Mats Hummels' 12th-minute header proving enough to settle a largely staid affair. In the subsequent 82 minutes - including injury-time - France found the target just five times. Didier Deschamps was under pressure to drop Olivier Giroud and restore Karim Benzema to a central role, and that he duly did. Benzema, though, failed to repay his managerâs faith. He . completed just 12 passes in 90 minutes and, although he managed seven attempts on . goal, a meagre two troubled Manuel Neuer. His . first-half performance - in which his eight touches was the least of . all 22 players â was particularly subdued and he lacked conviction when a . pair of chances did come his way, one header rebounding off a defender a shot side-footed tamely at Neuer. But Benzemaâs supporting cast did little to aid the attacking cause either. Not-so-perfect 10: Karim Benzema was disappointing and headed this early chance straight into Hummels . Down and out: Benzema and Co barely threatened to reply and went out with a whimper . Too little, too late: Benzema came closest to levelling with a late strike which was saved by Manuel Neuer . Quiet: Benzema's first-half heat map shows his subdued effort . Not enough: Benzema was a little more involved after the break but still couldn't find a breakthrough . Yohan Cabaye, the playmaker, created just one chance for a team-mate, while his passing accuracy in the opposition half dipped to 61 per cent compared to 81 in the comfort of defensive territory. The disappointing PSG midfielder was withdrawn when his team should have been chasing a leveller 17 minutes from time. No French connection: Yohan Cabaye did not exert his influence in the right areas . Easy option: Cabaye was involved, but it was all inside the comfort of his own half . No impact: The playmaker's numbers in the final third make for poor reading . Antoine Griezmann was Giroud's replacement in the starting line-up but the 23-year-old did little to enhance his reputation. The winger's involvement was sporadic and just over half of his 22 passes found a colleague. Paul Pogba, like Cabaye, failed to impact in the final third, while Mathieu Valbuena's crossing was woefully wayward and just one of his six deliveries located a comrade. Blaise Matuidi, meanwhile, was unable to carve a single opening despite completing the full game. Of those introduced in an attempt to snap France from their slumber, Giroud and Loic Remy did not muster one shot on goal between them. Benzema was denied by Neuer's strong arm in stoppage-time, but it was too little, too late.","Didier Deschamps' France side lost 1-0 to Germany in the World Cup 2014 quarter-finals .

"The son of a London taxi driver is on his bike. James Ward became the first British man to exit Wimbledon, stumbling in straight sets to Mikhail Youzhny. In credit to the British No 3, he initially put up a respectable fight against the 17th seed, but ultimately the quality of the Russianâs groundstrokes proved too significant and he fell 6-2, 6-2, 6-1. In each of the first two sets Ward set a trend of dragging points into long rallies, but lacked the guile to finish points. Frustrated: British No 3 James Ward was outclassed by his Russian opponent . Stroll: Mikhail Youzhny crushed James Ward in straight sets on the opening day of Wimbledon . Youzhny suffered no such issue and, . having forced break points in Wardâs opening service game, broke twice . in the first set. His backhand, either sliced or with power, was . brilliant. Ward was still in . the fight in the second, imploring the crowd to offer some assistance, . but he was again broken twice, the first at 2-3 down coming via a double . fault. He gave away another break, and with it the set, with a long . forehand from the middle of the court. Youzhny proceeded to run away . with the third. The . disappointment for Ward, quite aside from exiting in the first round for . the fourth time in five attempts, will have been his failure to . significantly threaten the Russianâs serve. He forced only three break . points and converted none, despite hitting the same number of winners . (24) as the man ranked 137 places higher. By contrast, Youzhny took six of his 14 chances and wrapped up the match in one hour and 45 minutes. Out: Ward had no answer to his opponent as he went down without a fuss . Ward said: 'I thought he played very well, executed his game. I obviously didn't play as well as I'd hoped. I have to go away and look at the tape and see what happened. It's not enjoyable watching matches that you lose. But it's all part of the process. It needs to be done. 'As I say, he played very well. At different times in the match where I had a few half chances, he came up with the goods. That was the difference.' Ward pocketed Â£27,000 for his first-round exit - up from Â£23,500 for first-round losers in 2013 - and said the money is vital to his continued status as a tour player. He added: 'There's 150, 200 guys out there who are all playing the same tournaments week in, week out. If you have a coach or a trainer around you, obviously it becomes expensive to travel the world, different country every week. 'But, it's a massive help. I'm very grateful for the help I've always received from the All England Club and the LTA.Â  Without that I wouldn't be able to carry on playing probably.'

"Diego Maradona has agreed that Lionel Messi is now his heir. Former Tottenham legend and Argentine World Cup winner Ossie Ardiels believes Messi is now better than Maradona and even Pele. 'For some time I have thought that Diego could never be surpassed, and nor could Pele, but no longer. I would now say that Lionel Messi will go down in history as the No.1 player of all time, the best that there ever was,' said Ardiles. Right path: Lionel Messi has inspired Argentina to two victories in Brazil . Top of the world: Diego Maradona led Argentina to World Cup glory in Mexico in 1986 . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . 'Yes, I would now say that Lionel is the very best, but of course you would wonder just how much better Maradona or Pele would have been if they had the advantage of such advancements in the game.' But for many it will only be if Messi can lead Argentina to victory at a World Cup that he will be regarded in such esteem as Maradona. After flopping at the last World Cup, Messi is on the right path having scored two superb individual goals to seal successive victories and could well further stamp his personality on this tournament against Nigeria. In that respect, Messi has started better in terms of goals than Maradona did in 1986, who only scored one goal at the group stage in a draw against Italy. He then struck his two 'beast and beauty' goals against England in the quarter final and then two more in the 2-0 semi final win over Belgium, although he didnât score in the 3-2 final win over West Germany. Karim Benzema will he hoping to fill his boots in the race for the golden boot. The Real Madrid striker, who could be up for grabs this summer, currently trails Brazil's Neymar, who is now on four, by one goal. But if France stay in free-scoring mode against Ecuador then Benzama would expect to be on the score sheet. Free-scoring: France, and three-goal striker Karim Benzema, have impressed in Brazil . If he does strike he will become only the second Frenchman to score four goals at a single World Cup. But he will have a long way to go to catch the last French striker to pass that mark. He was Just Fontaine who in the 1958 finals hit a staggering 13 goals which remains the record. Nigeria need a point against Argentina to guarantee a place in the knockout stage. If defensive resolve is required then Nigeria have shown it thus far. Their goalkeeper Vincent Enyema of Lille in France is so far the top graded keeper in the tournament according to FIFA stats which give a 100 per cent record with two clean sheets and eight saves. Iran need to beat Bosnia Herzegovina and hope Nigeria slip up to progress. The Iranians, managed by former Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz, certainly have the mentality and tactical nous to take it to the wire. Their midfield general Javad Nekounam will be key, not least given his vast experience. This will be his 143rd cap which puts him 21st in the all time list. Experience: Iran's Javad Nekounam will win his 143rd cap against Bosnia on Wednesday . The most capped player of all time is Ahmed Hassan of Egypt with 184. Spain keeper Iker Cassillas is Europeâs most cappedÂ  player with 156, Germanyâs Lothar Mattheus, who played in five World Cups, is Europeâs most capped outfield players with 150. The notion that Premier League referees are more lenient than their continental counterparts and turn a blind eye to certain types of robust challenges does not appear to stand upÂ  judging on how games have been officiated far. A perception that in the main refs at the World Cup have, where possible, let games flow and have not been rushed into issuing cards is backed up by statistics. Last season in the PL the ratio of yellow cards was one per 6.8 fouls. Thus far in Brazil it has been one booking per 10.8 fouls. One to watch: Switzerland need to beat Honduras and hope that France remain focused and donât lose to Ecuador. Watch out for left footed striker Xherdan Shaqiri who can fire Switzerland into the next phase. The Bayern Munich player has long been admired by several PL clubs and could be up for grabsÂ  following the arrival this summer of Polandâs Robert Lewansowski. I say: There are many reasons why England flopped at this World Cup. But one of the most obvious but least debated is the simple fact England didnât score enough goals. There can be endless debates about tactics, pass completions, defensive frailties, sport psychology and so on but if the you donât stick the ball in the old onion bag â¦and there were ample chancesÂ  against Italy Uruguay and Costa Rica â¦you are not going to win. And so England come home with just one point. Two goals - equalisers by Daniel Sturridge v Italy and Wayne Rooney v Uruguay - was never going to be enough. Cameroon return home with the worst record just one, while Ecuador and Bosnia are both on one goal but can add to their total. Itâs enhances the argument that Roy Hodgson should have taken at least one more strikerâ¦Jermain Defoe or Andy Carrollâ¦ especially as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was never going to be fit. Grounded: Andy Carroll was not included in England's squad for the finals . World Cup Moment: France have so far surprised given the downbeat attitude of manager Didier Deschamps ahead of the tournament. They might not be quite the elegant side of 1998 but they have been full of attacking menace and goals. For me the most memorable moment of their 3-0 final win over Brazil was Zinedine Zidaneâs 27th minute bullet header. VIDEO Team Profile: France . World Cup Bet: Kairm Benzama and Lionel Messi are both 5-1 to score on Wednesday night. Nigeria, Argentina, Ecuador and France all to score is 12-1. A draw between Bosnia andÂ  Iran is 23/10.

"The BBC today faced calls to apologise for a Top Gear 'stunt' from Argentina's ambassador in London. Alicia Castro has lodged a formal complaint to the Corporation over Jeremy Clarkson's 'provocative behaviour and offensive remarks' after filming in Argentina. Top Gear's crew had to leave the country after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some people suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982. Scroll down for video . Argentine ambassador Alicia Castro has demanded a public apology from the BBC following the row over a Top Gear special filmed in the South American country. Top Gear presenters James May, Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond had to flee Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some people suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982. Hammond's comments came as Argentina's UK ambassador  accused Clarkson of 'fabricating' claims that  crew members were in danger from an angry mob during filming. Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman has denied the number plate was a 'stunt'. Clarkson was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming. The Argentina embassy in London said in a statement today: 'Argentine Ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, made a formal complaint to the BBC regarding Jeremy Clarkson's provocative behaviour and offensive remarks towards the Government and the Argentine people, following Top Gear's recent filming in Argentina, calling for the BBC to make a public apology. 'Ambassador Castro was received by the BBC's TV Director, Danny Cohen, at the BBC's New Broadcasting House in Portland Place yesterday at 4:30 pm.' The complaint referred to 'serious accusations' Clarkson had made against the Buenos Aires government which he said had made 'political capital' out of the issue. The embassy statement went on: 'Furthermore, the Argentine ambassador deeply regretted Jeremy Clarkson's entirely false accusations of alleged resentment against British citizens in Argentina.' A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The BBC has received a complaint and will apply its usual processes.' The team has claimed Top Gear bought the Porsche - complete with the number plate - in the UK because it was the best available vehicle of its type . Error: The team had first realised the plate could prove to be a problem on the third night of filming, September 19, when Clarkson was on Twitter and spotted a comment on one of the auto fan sites . Anger: James May's red Lotus (right) after Top Gear crew members were allegedly pelted with rocks . Top Gear host Richard Hammond last week claimed the programme team felt 'a real chill' when it dawned on them their number plate could cause offence in Argentina. Clarkson has maintained the number plate scandal was not deliberate, and said that if it had been, the BBC would have fired him. Recalling how the number plate controversy came about, Clarkson said when he asked the office to find a Porsche 928GT, only two were available. One was grey and the other black. He said because black 'doesn't work on television' he chose the grey one, and 'didn't even see it' until he arrived in Argentina. Clarkson went on to say no one in the Top Gear crew realised the potential offence the plate would cause until three days later while they were filming in Chile. Its significance was pointed out to the crew on the internet, the show's executive producer has said. September 16: Top Gear crew starts filming in Argentina for this year's Christmas special. Among the cars being used is a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL. September 19: Three days into filming, Jeremy Clarkson learns via Twitter that offence has been taken at the number plate. The crew spoke to authorities in Ushuaia, where the war issue is most senstive, and agree to remove the plates before entering the town two weeks later. The crew continued with the number plate and drove around areas of Argentina including Calafate and Tierra del Fuego. September 30: The plate was changed as the team entered Ushuaia. By then animosity had reached boiling point and the crew were forced to flee a baying mob. October 2: News of the anger over the plate reaches the UK.Â BBC bosses insist the choice of number plate was pure coincidence. The presenters had fled their hotel after the lobby was invaded by angry ex-military personnel who told them to leave 'or face the consequences'. Staff told how the demonstrators shouted insults until they were removed by officers, forcing the crew to leave so hurriedly they forgot a computer. The crew leave for Buenos Aires, where they catch another plane to Chile having been denied permission to film. Juan Manuel Romano, secretary of social development for Ushuaia says the program's crew and its host Jeremy Clarkson were escorted to the airport. Other members of the BBC2 motoring show's crew were pelted with stones by a jeering mob as they made their way to the border by road, escorted by officials. All the cars used by the presenters had windows broken, and a number of vehicles were abandoned, including the Porsche with the controversial plate. October 4:Â Clarkson takes to Twitter this morning to confirm that all of the crew had made it safely out of the country and that he was back in the UK. He said: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it. 'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths. 'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed. 'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong. 'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.' October 8: Blur's Damon Albarn wades into the row,Â describing the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole'. Speaking to fans ahead of a concert in Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, the singer apologised for Clarkson's behaviour, telling them that he thought the stunt was 'not cool'. October 10: Both presenter James May and executive producer Andy Wilman defend the Top Gear team and insist the use of the number plate was entirely coincidental. October 13: Argentina's UK ambassador Alicia Castro accuses Jeremy Clarkson of 'fabricating' claims that  crew members were in danger from an angry mob. He is yet to respond. The BBC show has a history of upsetting foreign countries. In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond. May described Mexican food as ''like sick with cheese on it'' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because ''at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won't complain, it's fine.' In fact, the Mexican ambassador His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza wrote to the corporation to complain about the ''outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults'' and the BBC had to say sorry.","BBC crew had to leave Argentina after trouble over H982 FKL number plate .

Robin van Persie (Holland)Arjen Robben (Holland)Karim Benzema (France)Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)Enner Valencia (Ecuador)James Rodriguez (Colombia) The race for the Golden Boot is hotting up as the World Cup heads into the knockout stages, with Thomas Mullerâs stunning finish against USA taking him to four goals for the tournament and on level pegging with Neymar and Lionel Messi. After Messiâs brace against Nigeria on Wednesday, it looked as though the battle to be this tournamentâs top scorer would be a Barcelona affair â Neymar having struck twice for Brazil the day before versus Cameroon. But Mullerâs clinical strike for Germany means he joins the pair at the top of the leaderboard, and there is a growing group of players on three who will also have their eyes on the individual prize. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Golden Boot contender Neymar thrill Brazil fans with keep-ups . Decisive: Thomas Muller curls home the only goal in Germany's 1-0 win against USA in Recife . Top form: Lionel Messi struck twice in Argentina's 3-2 win over Nigeria to take his tournament tally to four . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Going for gold: Neymar already has four goals from group games against Croatia and Cameroon . Xherdan Shaqiri vaulted into contention by scoring a hat-trick as Switzerland beat Honduras 3-0 on to qualify second in Group F. He joined Karim Benzema and Enner Valencia, who could not add to their three tournament goals each as France played out a 0-0 draw against 10-man Ecuador that ensured the French won Group E. Demolition job: Xherdan Shaqiri's walks away with the match ball after his hat-trick versus Honduras . Focused: Karim Benzema thumps his chest following France's fourth goal in their 5-2 win against Switzerland . Kiss the lucky ball: Enner Valencia's unique celebration after scoring his second goal against Honduras .

Jumping for joy: Robin van Persie leaps into the air after scoring Holland's fourth in their 4-0 rout of Spain . Fist-pump: Arjen Robben looks ecstatic after scoring for Holland during their win against Chile . A dark horse to win this yearâs Golden Boot is Colombia forward James Rodriguez.

"They've broken up and reunited more times than anyone can count. And according to insiders, while Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's latest separation was hardly unexpected, with their undeniable pull to one another, it's only a matter of time before they kiss and make up once again. So what was it this time that drove a wedge between the pair? According to various reports doing the rounds, Justin's cosy friendship with Selena's frenemy Kendall Jenner was the catalyst, the singer and actress flipping her lid after discovering that the pair had been hanging out in secret behind her back. Scroll down for video . 'Selena was absolutely livid when she found out Justin had dinner with Kendall': Selena Gomez is said to have split with Justin Bieber after he lied to her about getting together with her frenemy, Kendall Jenner . Of course, the popstar was photographed not in the company of his girlfriend, but with up-and-coming model Kendall, enjoying a bite to eat at Ferdi in Paris, France on September 30. Though he was in the City Of Love with his girlfriend, he reportedly told her he was having dinner with his security team and would meet up with her afterwards to attend the star-studded CR Fashion Book party together. However, when Selena learned that her beau had blatantly lied to her face, an insider tellsÂ In Touch Weekly: 'She went crazy.' 'Selena was absolutely livid when she found out Justin had dinner with Kendall. He lied to her about it,' they continue. 'She was so angry that she changed her flight to come back to LA two days early and told him their relationship was over - again.' Indeed, while Justin spent the evening chatting and taking photos with not only Kendall but her mom, Kris Jenner, and half-sister Kim Kardashian, as well as best pal Gigi Hadid, at the soiree, he and Selena kept their distance and weren't photographed together. Putting on a brave face: While the actress looked a million dollars in her gorgeous red satin Dior frock at Tuesday night's LA premiere of Rudderless, inside she's quietly seething that the 18-year-old has come between her and Justin . 'Kendall just loves that she got something over on Selena. It's ugly behaviour': Up-and-coming model Kendall Jenner looked like the cat that got the cream as she cosied up to Justin at the CR Fashion Book party in Paris on September 30 after their intimate meal . As Us Weekly reports, the 22-year-old Come & Get It hitmaker 'doesn't trust Kendall's motives'. While on holiday with Justin in St Martin in late September, Selena is said to have seen text messages on her boyfriend's phone from the leggy brunette suggesting that the pair hang out. It was the same trust issues that saw Selena dump both Kendall, 18, and her 17-year-old sister Kylie as friends following their trip to the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in April. Reports suggest that the former Disney darling was none too happy at finding out her on-off boyfriend had hooked up with Kylie during their weekend of partying. 'She told Justin she wanted to have nothing to do with them,' an insider tells In Touch, adding: 'That meant he had to cut them off, too.' Of course, the 20-year-old Canadian singer did no such thing, which has continued to cause plenty of tension in his relationship. 'It turns out Justin has been texting Kendall the whole time and Paris wasn't the first time they secretly had dinner together,' the source divulges. In his element! The 20-year-old popstar spent the night chatting and taking photos not only with Kendall but her mom, Kris Jenner, and bestie Gigi Hadid, even holding court with her half-sister Kim Kardashian as he and Selena kept their distance . 'She was so angry that she changed her flight to come back to LA two days early': Earlier that evening, Justin enjoyed a dinner date with Kendall at Ferdi - telling his girlfriend that he was grabbing a bite with his security team and they would meet up later . 'Justin admitted it and insists they're just friends, but Selena doesn't believe him': Justin's feeble excuses didn't sit well with the 22-year-old, who got into a 'screaming match' with her beau before breaking things off, the star reportedly 'feeling completely humiliated' 'Justin admitted it and insists they're just friends, but Selena doesn't believe him, and they had a screaming match over it. She feels completely humiliated.' Meanwhile, a source close to the Jenners reveals that Kendall is not-so-secretly loving coming between the couple. 'Kendall just loves that she got something over on Selena,' they explain. 'It's ugly behaviour.' With Selena having packed her bags and fled home to LA on October 1 minus Justin, he seemingly wasted no time mourning the end of their relationship. On October 2, he was seen cosying up to a mystery woman at a Paris nightclub as Selena publicly unfollowed him on Instagram and posted several telling tweets about their break-up. 'Sometimes we think we aren't good enough. But then I realize when I think I'm alone I have God,' she posted on October 1. Not-so discreet: The pair even headed off together in a Rolls-Royce, seemingly making no attempt to keep their rendezvous secret for long . Flying solo: The star looked decidedly forlorn as she jetted out of France on October 1,  tweeting,Â 'Sometimes we think we aren't good enough. But then I realize when I think I'm alone I have God' 'She is completely weak when it comes to him': On October 5, the singer posted this intimate black and white shot with his ex before taking it down, with insiders saying,Â 'No-one would be surprised if she went back. It's like an addiction' She also wrote, 'We have to learn the hard way sometimes,' though she swiftly deleted the comment. While Selena is back in California, fuming over the couple's latest break-up, Justin is living it up in Europe with dad Jeremy, the pair currently vacationing in Rome. However, according to E! Online, Selena isn't keen to wait around for him to come to his senses this time, with the star apparently considering starting afresh in New York City. 'I'd love to spend time in New York,' she told the website ahead of the Hollywood premiere of her new movie, Rudderless, on Tuesday. 'I've always said that I want to have a love affair and live there.' And she has a cheerleader in bestie Taylor Swift, who made the move herself earlier this year and is encouraging her pal to take the plunge, too. The way they were: Selena attended the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival with sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner in April, the trio thick as thieves, albeit for a very brief time . The calm before the storm: According to reports, Selena ditched the siblings  after learning that Kylie had hooked up with Justin during their wild weekend of partying and expected him to do the same, though he secretly remained in contact with them both . 'Taylor has been begging me to live there,' she revealed. 'She's like, ""It's the best decision I've ever made."" Everyone always says I'm more New York when they meet me so maybe it would be good for me. I don't spend enough time there.' Of course, Justin is hardly going to sit back and let the love of his life leave, with those close to the star already saying that he 'wants her back'. On October 5, he shared an intimate black and white snap of the stunning beauty kissing his shoulder tenderly as he held out his camera phone to capture the moment, before seemingly thinking better of it and taking it down. Insiders believe the gesture could well have done the trick though, commenting that Justin 'has this amazing way of working his way back into her life'. 'She is completely weak when it comes to him,' they add. 'No-one would be surprised if she went back. It's like an addiction. She deserves better.' 'Justin has this amazing way of working his way back into her life': After getting their relationship back on track in recent months and even enjoying a romantic trip to Bieber's native Canada, they were the picture of contentment as they celebrated a pal's birthday on September 17 . 'We have to learn the hard way sometimes': On August 27, he shared this photo as the couple spent time with his family on Ontario, Canada .","The 22-year-old 'completely humiliated' that her boyfriend was seeing her frenemy behind her back .

"A 23-year-old mother admitted to being high on marijuana the day her 4-year-old son was killed in a house fire in Keizer, Oregon. At a Monday court hearing, prosecutors also revealed that Niya Sosa-Martinez was previously convicted of child neglect in 2012, involving her son Andre and 6-year-old daughter who was at school when their home caught fire on Friday. Sosa-Martinez remained expressionless in court, though she did tear up when she was formally charged with second-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. Scroll down for video .

"A  hedge fund boss is facing a legal bill of up to Â£19million - thought to be one of the largest of its kind - after losing a fierce High Court battle against his former wife. Dr Martin Coward has been landed with the bill after the latest in a string of disputes with 55-year-old fellow tycoon Elena Ambrosiadou, with whom he founded the Ikos investment firm. The 56-year-old Cambridge mathematics graduate had insisted software which was the 'bedrock' of the company, which at its height handled funds worth a reported Â£2.3billion, belonged to him. Dispute: Multi-millionaire Martin Coward (left) faces a legal bill of up to Â£19million after losing a High Court battle against the hedge fund he founded with his estranged wifeÂ Elena Ambrosiadou (right), which she still runs . But in May last year London's High Court ruled the software belonged to Ikos, which is now controlled by his wife after they split. He was ordered to pay huge legal bills in the case, which were made up of Â£13million racked up by Ikos for his wife's side and another Â£6million incurred by Dr Coward personally, the court heard. Having launched divorce proceedings in Greece, then Monaco, then refiled in Greece and in London, Ms Ambrosiadou was described by friends of her former husband as having employed 'an army' of PR and legal experts to endure their acrimonious divorce and court battles. Though a judge has ruled Mr Coward must settle the Â£19million bill for a recent dispute over software which, it was ruled, belongs to her company, if she cannot sufficiently explain why her legal costs were so much higher, the bill could be reduced. He appealed against the costs order but lost yesterday, despite Court of Appeal judges saying it was one of the largest they had ever seen. In a written ruling Mr Justice David Richards, sitting with Lord Justice Moore-Bick and Lord Justice Ryder, said the huge bills 'dwarf the great majority of civil claims, including most claims in the High Court.' The case was so complicated that it needed a three-week civil trial before a High Court judge. Mr Justice Richards said Dr Coward was liable for the costs in his ruling, but did not specify the exact amount to be paid. He added: 'The costs seem very large'. Although it currently stands at Â£19million, the bill could be reduced at a later hearing if Ikos cannot sufficiently explain why its lawyers cost more than double Mr Coward's. The judge said the onus was on the firm 'to establish that its costs were both reasonable and proportionate'. Solicitor Liz Francis, a senior partner at Hanne & Co who has dealt with similar disputes over large family firms, told MailOnline: 'Â£19million is a huge sum and I've never heard of costs that high in a case like this. Costly: The bitter dispute led to a highly complicated three-week trial at the High Court in London, pictured . 'Their lawyers could easily be charging Â£500 an hour and they can put in hundreds of hours of work with assistants, experts and QCs. It all mounts up. 1970s: Martin Coward and Elena Ambrosiadou met while both were studying at Cambridge in the. 1980s: After completing a PhD in Mathematics, British Coward was began work at Goldman Sachs in New York as a foreign exchange strategist. Ambrosiadou, meanwhile, who had obtained an MBA herself, became an executive for BP at the age of 27. 1992:Â The couple launch Ikos, which means home in Greek, as one of the first hedge funds set up in London. Ambrosiadou was just 32. 1993: The couple marry in Greece. 2004:Â Ambrosiadou is named the best paid woman in Britain after taking home a pay check of Â£15.9million. 2009: Coward resigns from Ikos with Ambrosiadou launching divorce proceedings within months in her native Greece. A sleuth of legal battles ensued, with as many as 48 reported at one time. The couple accused one another of spying on the other to get ahead in court. 2013: After an acrimonious divorce, Ambrosiadou is allowed to keep Ikos software. A High Court judge rules Coward must pay Â£1,000 in damages. 2014: Coward is ordered to settle the Â£19million bill for years of bitter battling in court. 'I think it's very sad because cases like these consume people. You have to do a cost versus benefits analysis - if you go to court and go for the jugular, you might win but you have to consider what it will cost'. The  couple met at Cambridge University in the 1970s when Ms Ambrosiadou was studying chemical engineering and Dr Coward was obtaining a doctorate in mathematics. They married in 1993, a year after they set up Ikos together  as a family business in London. In 2004, Ms Ambrosiadou was reported as Britain's highest-paid woman after giving herself Â£15.9million. The same year, she moved Ikos to Cyprus - a known tax haven. Mr Justice Richards said the marriage and business relationship between them then broke up 'acrimoniously' in 2009, sparking a string of court fights. The couple now have legal disputes in Britain, Cyprus and Monaco. Ms Ambrosiadou is the chief executive of Ikos, while her estranged husband has set up his own hedge fund called Dormouse. During the bitter three week trial last year, Mrs Justice Asplin said the evidence from both parties 'was tainted by their obvious and deep animosity, and the extremely close correlation between their business and their personal affairs.' She said they were both 'highly intelligent and astute individuals,' but neither were satisfactory witnesses. But taking all the evidence into account she found it was 'all the more likely that the essential bedrock of the business, the software,' would be owned by the company.","Dr Martin Coward split 'acrimoniously' from wife Elena Ambrosiadou in 2009 .

'We've reached a point where we need to clean up the image . of tourism in the province including beach parties that can get . out of control and lead to violence,' Chatpong told Reuters. 'This is aimed at tourists' safety. Sometimes these parties . are held at secluded locations that are difficult to reach and . where we cannot offer adequate protection.'

Chatpong . said authorities on the islands were taking down posters . advertising parties. 'Some people who come to the islands want peace and quiet . but there are all sorts of parties,' he said. Police said the arrested men (pictured) had confessed to the crime - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves . Scotland Yard murder detectives have travelled in secret to a Thai island where two British backpackers were brutally murdered amid concerns two Burmese bar workers may have been wrongly arrested in connection with their deaths . 'This is also because of the killings on Koh Tao ... It's . time to put things in order.' Police say Witheridge and Miller had been out drinking and . went to a secluded stretch of beach where they were killed. Their murders have dented Thailand's tourism industry, which . accounts for nearly 10 percent of gross domestic product, at a . time when the sector is struggling to recover from months of . political unrest and a May 22 coup.

"Seventy years after helping recover stolen art from the Nazis, Harry Ettlinger gets to see his story on the big screen . In the searing heat, some 700 feet deep in the bowels of the Kochendorf salt mine in Germany, Harry Ettlinger prised open one of the 40,000 mud-crusted crates stacked by the shaft. Inside, piled high, were scores of paintings. Haltingly, he unwrapped the first. Inside the packing paper, its vibrant colours glancing off the flickering light of his pit lamp, the distinctive features of Rembrandt gazed back. Harry recognised it at once. Six years before, in 1938, as a 13 year old art lover in his native Karlsruhe in Germany, he had yearned to see the Dutch artistâs iconic self-portrait that hung in the townâs museum. But as a German Jew, ostracised and under threat, he wasnât allowed inside the building. Now, in 1944 with war raging around him as the Allies routed the Nazis troops, Harry, who had fled Germany and was now an American GI, knew his discovery of the precious icon - one of five million art works looted by Hitlerâs troops - would be saved for posterity. In all, that one cache of stolen paintings contained 900 stolen works, among them the precious Stuppach Madonna, a medieval panel painting of the baby Jesus and Mary by German artist Grunewald. All had been stashed by Hitlerâs troops after their rampage across Europe. Their value was incalculable - one, alone, a self-portrait by Italian artist Raphael, is worth Â£60m today. All had been destined for Adolf Hitler, but even now with the Reich teetering, the fanatical Nazi leader had ordered the irreplaceable iconic works should all be destroyed. In a few weeks time Harry, 88, who now lives in New Jersey and is one of the few remaining members of the Anglo-American Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives section, will finally be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his bravery. The highest award to a civilian for an act of heroism that contributed to Americaâs history, the medal will seal forever the brave and unflinching sacrifices he and his 350 colleagues made to ensure Hitlerâs plan to destroy the majority of Europeâs priceless art works was foiled. But it isnât the only honour that Harry has received. George Clooneyâs iconic film The Monuments Men, depicting the menâs heroic story, has now been released on DVD and Blue-ray. Directed by and starring Clooney, as well as a star-studded cast including Matt Damon, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchette, it paints a vivid account of the heroism of the 400 or so art historians, museum directors and art curators - all more familiar with a Michaelangelo than a machine gun - who became entangled in a dramatic race against time in their bid to save some 1,000 years of culture. Harry Ettlinger pictured with his late wife Mimi, who died 10 years ago. Ettlinger is portrayed in the film by English actor Dimitri Leonidas, but his character is renamed Sam Epstein . Although he fled Germany just prior to WWII, he said it was not hard to take up arms against his home country . âWatching the film was such a humbling experience,â says Harry, a widower who has lived alone since his beloved wife Mimi died 10 years ago. âIt brought the powerful message that, not only did Hitler want to annihilate an entire race, but he wanted its culture wiped from the face of the earth too. âI went back to the Kockendorf two years ago and memories came flooding back. It wasnât hard for me to take arms against my home country. The day I left Germany I was no longer German. 'I have been an American citizen since I was 19 and I am an American patriot. I will never forget the bravery of the Men. Those British men, such as the Cambridge historian Ronald Balfour (played in The Monuments Men by Hugh Bonneville) who was killed by a shell burst while trying to rescue a medieval altar from a church in Cleves in Germany in March 1945. 'And American architect Walter Hutchthausen who was gunned down trying to rescue an altar piece near Aachen.â An art lover from an early age, Ettlinger is pictured with a Rembrandt self portrait he helped recover . The Monuments Men film, featuring Matt Damon, left, and actor and director George Clooney, right, is based loosely on the exploits of Ettlinger who helped reclaim about 900 boxes of art stolen by the Nazis . The Monuments Men is based on Robert Edselâs book charting the Menâs success. As a young man in Florence in 1996 Edsel began to wonder how many great masterpieces had survived WWII. His research into the Menâs unit became a labour of love. When Clooney read his work he, too, became passionate about turning the incredible story into a film. These men, Clooney realised, had been air brushed from history. âGeorge helped me to lobby for the medal to be awarded to the few remaining Men, such as Harry,â Edsel says. âI had the honour of breaking the news of the award to Harry. He looked just like a child who had seen Santa Claus. He so deserves it.â Harry Ettlinger, pictured left with British actor Dimitri Leonidas and Clooney, and right, with the wider film crew . Harry and . his parents and siblings were among the last German Jews who managed to . escape Nazi Germany. His father, who helped run a womenâs fashion store . realised that soon the persecution would go far beyond merely his shop . being boycotted. The Monuments Men was released in February this year and features a star studded cast that includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. The film is based on the book 'The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History' by Robert M. Edsel and grossed almost Â£91 million at the box office. It follows the team tasked with finding and saving thousand of important pieces of art and culture before the Nazis could destroy them at the end of the war. Although it was called the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Program, George Clooney's character assembles a team to enter Europe in the hope to identifying, finding and saving the valuable artwork which is nicknamed 'The Monuments Men'. Harry Ettlinger is played by British actor Dimitri Leonidas in the film, although the character is only loosely based on him and is renamed Sam Epstein. Increasingly . the family was ostracised and when neigbouring Germans made it clear . the Ettlinger family was not wanted he moved swiftly. Harry . joined the American army at 19, becoming an infantry man. But his . fluency in his native tongue meant he was asked to join the Monuments . Men. In the film his story inspired the character of Sam Epstein, played . by ex-Grange Hill actor, Dimitri Leonidis. After the war Harry travelled back to Germany, hoping to find some of his own familyâs art treasures which had been stored in a warehouse in Baden Baden. He travelled with a Holocaust survivor and recalls: âWhen we found the warehouse, my grandfatherâs art was there. But our jeep broke down and we had to stay the night. We ended up in the top suite of the best hotel in town. There we were, a Jewish soldier and a Holocaust survivor. Sleeping in a bed meant for the German kaiser. Iâm proud of that.â He had the family heirlooms shipped back to America and, today, one piece he saved is still displayed on the wall of his apartment: a print of that Rembrandt self portrait. âIt reminds me of what we achieved and the sacrifices that people like my buddies made. âSothebys offered me Â£500,000. But because of the proud memories it brings back it is beyond price to me.â","Harry Ettlinger fled the Nazis then returned to help recover stolen art work .

"Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic is on the verge of joining Atletico Madrid from Bayern Munich, the German club have announced. Bayern sporting director Matthias Sammer revealed during a press conference held on Wednesday that a deal had been reached between the two clubs and the player, with an official announcement believed to be imminent. 'There is a verbal agreement between Bayern, Atletico Madrid and Mario Mandzukic,' said Sammer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mario Mandzukic's horror tackle in training on Schweinsteiger . Moving on: Mario Mandzukic has left Bayern Munich for Atletico Madrid . Finisher: The forward scored 48 times in 88 games for the club . 'We wish to thank Mario for his performances at Bayern and wish him all the best in the future.' Reports emerged in the German press on Wednesday that the Bundesliga and Primera Division champions had reached a deal for the 28-year-old which is believed to be worth 22 million euros (Â£18.5m). Mandzukic scored 33 league goals for Bayern in the two seasons that followed his transfer to the Bavarian giants from Wolfsburg in 2012. Although his goals helped the club win an unprecedented European and domestic treble in 2013 and a double last season, the Croatian has been deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last term, is set to lead the attack next season after joining from Borussia Dortmund. Celebrations: Mandzukic won a host of trophies during his two seasons at the club . Differences: But he felt that manager Pep Guardiola's tactics did not suit his style of play . Mandzukic would be Atletico's most expensive signing since Radamel Falcao moved to the club from Porto in 2011 and his task will be filling the void left by Diego Costa - Atletico's top scorer last season - who is joining Chelsea. Atletico are expected to make another move for a striker in the summer to replace New York City FC-bound David Villa, and are believed to be interested in taking Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku on loan. However, their signing of Mandzukic means that they are expected to end their pursuit of Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who is valued at over Â£25m.","Mandzukic on verge of Â£18.5m move to Atletico Madrid .

"Brazil's win over Colombia was an ill-tempered affair and was notable for both teams trying to stop the other sideâs No 10. Neymar and James Rodriguez were both targeted. You could see the teams almost using a ârotational foulingâ tactic. Players would put in a tackle on the star man and then let somebody else make the next one. By taking it in turns, it becomes less obvious to the referee when players accumulate fouls. Attacked: Neymar (left) and James Rodriguez were consistently fouled by opposition players . Tough: Rodriguez is tackled by Fernandinho, who marshaled him for the entire game on Friday . Out of action: Brazil's team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said Neymar will be out for four-to-six weeks . VIDEO We'll cope with Neymar loss - Bernard . Brazil's game against Colombia set the tournament record for fouls with 54, with Neymar and James Rodriguez coming in for rough treatment. Neymar in particular was the victims of ârotational foulingâ - where players take it in turns to foul the opposition. It worked a treat too, none of the culprits were booked. And Colombia werenât the only ones to target Neymar - Chile shared tackling duties over 90 minutes in their last 16 tie.

Itâs not a common tactic, but it would not be unusual for teams to have that in their locker. With somebody like Neymar, it becomes easier to get away with cumulative fouls because he pops up all over the pitch. A defender can be more physical, knowing itâs unlikely that they will come into contact with Neymar again soon. In that quarter-final the referee seemed to have left his cards at home. Because of that leniency, we have been denied the chance to watch the brilliance of Neymar. Rodriguez came in for similar treatment and took more evasive action than Neymar, who looked to stay on his feet. I wondered how long it would take for Fernandinho to get booked, but the card never came. Instead it was Rodriguez himself who was cautioned after just one foul. Referees have a duty to protect players. They seem to be more lenient in this tournament and so it has become possible to stop the stars with clever tactical fouling.

"This shocking footage shows a woman being kneed in the face and pulled around a room by her hair by a shopping centre security guard after she protested at being detained in a holding room. Amazingly, the woman - who was banned from the mall in Sydney for shoplifting - was charged with assault after the video was viewed by police. It is also used by the security company to 'entertain' staff as part of a gag reel video of CCTV mishaps, according to Seven News. Scroll down for video . Merrill Bates (wearing blue) has been charged with assaulting a security officer, despite CCTV footage indicating she was the apparent victim in the violent attack . The female security stormed into the room and pinned Ms Bates back, appear to slam her against the wall .

"For a man whose team began this tournament by putting five past the World Champions, Louis van Gaal is becoming adept at lowering expectations. 'We are not a fantastic team,' said the Holland manager on Friday night. 'We just a team thatâs difficult to beat.' This is very much Van Gaalâs way these days. So tired of criticism of his team in the run-up to this World Cup, the veteran coach has decided to play along. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis Van Gaal say Holland are not a fantastic team . Marshalling the troops: Van Gaal (right) talks to his players in training on Friday . Playing down: Van Gaal has been managing expectations . Quiet confidence: The Holland boss said that he will be manager of his country for three more matches . Deep down, though, Van Gaal thinks Holland can win this tournament and he finally offered a fleeting glimpse of his feelings when asked about a bracelet he has been seen wearing on the touchline at his teamâs previous games. 'The children from the head of our sponsors made it,' said Van Gaal. 'I was given it because her children made it and I promised to wear it. I will wear it again. I will always wear it when I'm coach of Holland. That's another three matches, as you know.' If the incoming manager of Manchester United is to leave his current post in the most memorable way possible then there is likely to be some excitement along the way. This Dutch team is not one that does things quietly. Super start: Holland began the tournament brilliantly by routing World Champions Spain 5-1 . Close control: Robin van Persie brings the ball down during a training session. The striker has overcome fitness doubts to be ready for the Costa Rica encounter . Talking tactics: Van Persie in conversation with Daryl Janmaat as the Dutch team prepare for the quarter-final clash . Eyes on the ball: Dirk Kuyt (left), Bruno Martins Indi (centre) and Jeremain Lens (right) watch a cross during the training session . Alive and kicking: Arjen Robben warms up with some high kicks . Van Gaal spoke yesterday of the sense of togetherness and unity that he believes characterises this squad but Holland have still had to come from behind three times already to reach the last eight. 'One of the things we can is turn a match round,' said Van Gaal. 'Sometimes itâs down to luck but also due to considering your chances and opportunities. 'We haven't played as well in ball possession as we can at times but when the opposition have the ball we're one of the best teams, if not the best. 'That's why we've progressed so far.' Race is on: Arjen Robben and Dirk Kuyt race each other on the pitch at the stadium in Salvador . Practice makes perfect: Louis van Gaal watches intently as Robben tries to curl home a free-kick . Blaster and the Master: Van Gaal analyses the technique of Wesley Sneijder as he prepares to take a shot . On target: Holland's Wesley Sneijder fires the ball through a crowd of bodies to equalise against Mexico . Back from the dead: van Gaal's team were in trouble against Mexico in the last 16 before a late turn-around . Van Gaalâs insistence of playing on the counter has caused much debate at home. Certainly it almost failed them against Mexico in Fortaleza last week when only two goals at the death saved them. However, it says much for his playersâ faith in Van Gaalâs philosophy that they adhere slavishly to his instructions, even if we may see them adopt a slightly more proactive approach at Arena Fonte Nova today. 'Of course in Holland we're used to playing 4-3-3, attacking football with two wingers,' said winger Arjen Robben. 'But I think you also have to look at the quality of the squad. That's what we did, and what the manager did. Eyes on the prize: Arjen Robben insists Holland need to go in for the kill for the remained of the World Cup . Undivided attention: Holland's squad are all ears as Van Gaal talks them through his plans . The stage is set: Holland take on Costa Rica at the Estadio Roberto Santos on Saturday . Talking tactics: Van Gaal acknowledges that his team have not always been fluent, but they are getting results . 'We spoke about it a lot with him and decided to play a slightly different system. 'I think it's very functional, maybe not as dominant as we are used to playing, but still very good. And we've played four games and scored 12 goals, so that's pretty positive. 'I think we are on a mission together. We are here to win matches and to go as far as possible.

The . official statements from his sponsors were anodyne, but Sportsmail . understands the striker could be jettisoned. An adidas spokesperson . said: âadidas is aware of the issue involving Luis Suarez. We await . FIFAâs full investigation into this matter and will respond . accordingly.â Gambling company 888poker have Suarez as a brand . ambassador and said: âFollowing recent allegations made against Luis . Suarez, we are reviewing our relationship with him. We will not tolerate . unsporting behaviour.â The investigation was ongoing, but . video evidence appeared to be damning. The independent disciplinary . panel, chaired by Swiss lawyer Claudio Sulser, had a range of sanctions . available up to a 24-match ban or a two-year suspension from all . football. A worldwide ban would impact on his career at Liverpool, but . there is no precedent for such a sanction. It is unclear whether . Suarezâs previous bans â 10 games for biting Chelseaâs Branislav . Ivanovic and seven matches for biting PSV Eindhovenâs Otman Bakkal â . would be taken into consideration, but the panel do have that power.

"A woman was shot dead by her estranged boyfriend on Monday before the man then turned the gun on himself. Jacinda Miller, of Sadsbury, Pennsylvania, was leaving her car and heading into her job as a fitness instructor at the YMCA when Dennis Cassel murdered her. He then told a bystander to call 911 and stood by her body until police arrived on the scene, putting the gun to his head and firing one shot when the first officer began to approach him. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jacinda Miller (above) was killed by her estranged boyfriend Dennis Cassel as she left her car to go into work Monday evening . Scene of the crime: It all happened at the Brandywine Valley YMCA in Pennsylvania (above) where Miller worked as a fitness instructor . Miller and Cassel were rushed to Brandywine Hospital where they were both pronounced dead. Officials told Daily Local NewsÂ that it was clear that Cassel's plan was premeditated. This all happened just days after Miller wrote on her Facebook page on October 28, 'New beginnings!!! Getting excited.' On October 21 however, Miler did not seem as happy, telling her followers she was 'pissed off.' She elaborated on that in her comments section, telling one of her friends, she would 'always have an emptiness.' Miller, 41, had two sons and was described by all who knew her as one of the nicest and kindest people they had ever met. 'She was always laughing and just happy. Playing air guitar and head banging along with the music while teaching combat. Her biggest joy was her two boys though. She was Miss Football Mom!' said Sara Davidge, one of Miller's coworkers. 'Sheâs going to be missed by so many. I donât think she knew just exactly how many peopleâs lives she touched. We all loved her.' Work it out: Miller (second from left) was a popular fitness instructor and mother to two young sons . Jim Schnaitman, Miller's neighbor of four years, said, 'She's a great person, she's got two great kids, and I couldn't believe anybody would do something like that to her. He also told ABC 6 that Cassel seemed like a completely normal guy, saying he had recently been having beers and enjoying a bonfire with the 42-year-old. Cassel did not have a criminal record, and there are no recorded incidents of domestic violence between the couple. Chester County District Attorney Hogan stated, 'This crime is another tragedy of domestic violence. Two children have been left without a mother. There is no excuse and no good explanation for this sort of violence.' The boys are currently in the custody of their father, Miller's ex-husband.","Jacinda Miller was gunned down by estranged boyfriend Dennis Cassel as she was heading in to work at the Brandywine Valley YMCA in Pennsylvania .

"Philadelphia sports fans have become infamous for their bad behavior, and it looks like it paid off for once. After much public outrage from Philadelphia Flyers fans when their beloved Ice Girls cleaning crew were replaced by a group of men cleaning the rink between periods during home games earlier this year, the team brought back the ladies during tonight's home opener. Sadly, the team still didn't manage to win, going down 6 - 4 to the New Jersey Devils, to bring their season record to 0 - 2. Scroll down for videos . Coming back: After being absent so far this season, the Philadelphia Flyers brought back the Ice Girls cleaning crew (above) tonight - but in leggings instead of hot pants . Old look: The girls previously wore less clothing while cleaning . Fan unfavorites: Many were upset when they learned the Ice Girls had been replaced with an all-male cleaning squad (above) earlier this year . Also making fans upset was the fact that there are now only four Ice Girls, they get to wear sensible leggings rather than hot pants, and there are a lot more men cleaning the ice with them between periods. Fans learned the Ice Girls were no longer when the Flyers took on the Toronto Maple Leafs at the Wells Fargo Center in their first pre-season game of the year, and a group of men, and not women, hit the ice to do some cleaning. Temporary leave: It is uncertain why the girls were not back for pre-season games earlier this year . The boos and jeers inside the stadium were deafening as these gentlemen, who, unlike their predecessors, got to wear pants and a fleece, went to work on the ice. There is still no word yet on just why the Ice Girls were replaced, but one of the group's members, Erika Choi Smith, did break the news on herÂ Twitter this August that they would not return to the rink. 'No #FlyersIceGirls this year, but just wanted to say thanks to one of our biggest fans @FlyersNation & to all #Flyers Fans for being AWESOME,' she wrote. Working hard: The four girls on the squad can be seen above, along with a few of the men . The girls are back now though, taking to the ice every game wearing nothing but a midriff-baring top, those warm new leggings and their skates, still not the best outfit for a place where the temperature is around 50 degrees but better than those hot pants. The Philadelphia Flyers also play an outdoor classic every year, where the temperature is about 20 degrees, so maybe they will get jackets at some point too. Strict rules: The girls used to wear hot pants when they worked on the ice . Mother Jones Â wrote an article about the Ice Girls last year, and the all-female cleaning crew for another hockey team, the Los Angeles Kings, highlighting how little the girls were paid and the many strict rules they had to adhere too. Among other things, the girls were not allowed to eat in public while wearing their costume and could not fraternize with any of the athletes, being told they should leave a bar or restaurant if they were out and one of the players came in. This negative coverage could be why the Ice Girls were temporarily replaced by the new all-male cleaning crew.","Philadelphia Flyers fans welcomed back the team's Ice Girls cleaning crew during the team's home opener tonight .

We all know about Neymarâs skill but I have been surprised by his work ethic. I have never seen a footballer walk about the pitch as much as Messi but he gets away with it because of his genius.

"Ron Vlaar's penalty came within inches of crossing the line during Holland's heartbreaking shootout defeat against Argentina on Wednesday night. The Aston Villa defender and Wesley Sneijder were both denied by Sergio Romero as the Dutch lost 4-2 on spot-kicks after the World Cup semi-final ended goalless.

Fortunately for the Argentina keeper, the ball stopped just short as his country went on to book a final showdown with Germany on Sunday and consign Holland to a third-place play-off. FIFA's rules on penalty shootouts clear the matter up, stating: 'A kick is successful if, having been touched once by the kicker, the ball crosses the goal line between the goal posts and under the crossbar, without touching any player, official, or outside agent other than the defending goalkeeper. 'The ball may touch the goalkeeper, goal posts, or crossbar any number of times before going into the goal as long as the referee believes the ball's motion is the result of the initial kick.' This was clarified after an incident in the 1986 World Cup shootout between Brazil and France.

"Manchester United believe that Nicky Butt will remain with the club as the Louis van Gaal era dawns at Old Trafford.

"A Spanish artist has reinvented the traditional pointe shoe in order to capture a ballerina's movements and turn them into unique works of art. Using new technology, developed in collaboration with Lilypad Arduino, Lesia Trubat was able to turn a pair of ballet shoes into a digital paintbrush by fitting them with a device that allows her to track the dancer's every pliÃ©, point and arabesque. The device, which is fitted directly to the shoes, then translates the ballerina's movements into a beautiful series of abstract digital images, using a specially-designed smartphone app. Scroll down for video . Emotional expression: Artist Lesia Trubat wanted to capture the emotions involved in ballet and translate them into a physical image . Tradition meets technology: The artist used an innovative new concept in order to turn a ballet shoe into a digital paintbrush . 'Graphs created with motion': The project uses a specially-designed app in order to translate the dancer's movement into a visual representation . 'Dancers can interpret their own movements and correct them or compare them with the movements of other dancers,' Lesia said of her 'E-Traces' project. 'Graphs created with motion may be the same or different depending on the type of movements executed and the correction of the steps and body position. 'The concept of Electronic Traces is based on capturing dance movements and transforming them into visual sensations through the use of new technologies. 'To do this we focused on the ballet shoes themselves, which through the contact with the ground, and thanks to Lilypad Arduino technology, record the pressure and movement of the dancer's feet and send a signal to an electronic device.' Although the artist has thus far only experimented with the movements of a ballerina, she is confident that the technology can be used with any any form of expressive motion. 'This is a project that can be extrapolated to other dance disciplines and the applications are multiple, from self- learning or dance classes to the graphical representation of live performance,' she explains on her website. Grace and beauty: Lesia admits that she has always been 'captivated' by dance . Tactile sensations: The artist hopes that anyone who buys one of her pieces will be able to feel the dancer's movement for themselves . 'Dance is an art that disappears': The project allows dancers to keep a long-lasting memory of their movement . It is not the first time that Lesia, who confesses that she has always been 'captivated' by dance, has used ballet as a means of creating art. Last year, the artist worked on a similar project, entitled 'Traces, memories of dance', which mapped the movements of a group of ballet dancers using a number of different mediums including ink and salt. 'Dance is an art that disappears at the same time that is created, is an ephemeral art which only retain the memory,' she said at the time. 'TRACES captures these moments and turn them into haptics, visual and tactile sensations to those who buy the product.' The resulting artworks were used as part of Lesia's final degree project at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Movement is art: Before testing out the new technology, Lesia also used a variety of physical mediums, including salt and ink, in order to capture a ballerina's motion .

"A Health Department employee of 38 years has been suspended for answering customer calls in a voice that sounds so much 'like a robot' he's confused customers into thinking he's an automated recording. Ronald Dillon is accused of talking in a 'deliberately robotic fashion' at least five times between February and April of 2013, representatives for the Health Department said during a disciplinary hearing. He's now been suspended  for 20 days. Department of robots?: Ronald Dillon was suspended from working at the Department of Health because he 'spoke like a robot' on customer service calls and even convinced them he was an automated recording . Dillon's boss at the agency's IT help desk apparently repeatedly told Dillon to stop using the robot voice after fielding complaints from callers, Administrative Law Judge Kara Miller was told. One customer hung up on Dillon then spoke with another employee and told her there was a new automated answering system. She said she had hung up when she heard 'the robot' answer the phone because she needed to speak to a human about her registration issues. At the hearing, the Heath Department played the recording of Dillon's robotic sounding and extremely enunciated reading. 'You have reached the Help Desk. This is Mr. Dillon. How may I help you?' said the recording. Dillon was originally sentenced to 34 days suspension but his penalty was lowered to 20 days after he gave the judge his reasoning. Dillon defended his voice saying he was merely trying to enunciate clearly because he has a thick Brooklyn accent, reports DNA info. Ronald didn't admit to trying to sound like a robot but he did say he isn't much of a people person and that working in customer service is a glitch in the department's employment system. He added that his boss, Barry Novack, picked on him and that he was simply trying to please him by eliminating his accent over the phone. 'They objected to the tone of my voice so I made it atonal,' he said. Judge Miller lowered his suspension after his explanation but said Dillon is a 'disgruntled' employee who doesn't like his boss. Boss' orders!: Ronald Dillon argued he wasn't speaking like a robot but that he was trying to speak slowly because he has a Brooklyn accent and can be difficult to understand . 'There is a difference between speaking slowly and distinctly and speaking so robotically that callers did not believe that they were speaking to a person,' she wrote in her decision. Dillon has worked for the Health Department since 1976 and has never had any prior disciplinary problems. Dillon's job at the department has dwindled over the years and he wasn't so pleased with his new responsibility answering tech questions from the public about NYCMED, a web portal allowing healthcare providers to register with the Health Department. 'He appears to be [a] disgruntled employee who is acting out because of the restructuring that has occurred within the department over the last few years,' she wrote. Dillon served as a project manager and a supervisor for many years before being drafted to the customer service desk. Dillon told the judge he didn't have any background in customer service. 'It's a bullying-in-the-workplace issue,' he said. He asked his supervisors to transfer to another agency unit but they said no. 'It's an experience. Not one that I would want people to go through, but it's an experience,' he said of working the phone line.","US DepartmentÂ of Heath employee of 38 years, Ronald Dillon, is accused of talking in a 'deliberately robotic fashion' at least five times .

"HTC may be better known for its smartphones, but the Taiwanese company today revealed it plans to enter the camera market. In what has been described as a direct challenger to the likes of action camera GoPro and Polaroid's latest cubed device, HTC has launched its first standalone camera, dubbed RE. The 16MP device, which also records videos in 1080p HD, features a unique cylindrical design and remote viewfinder. The 16 megapixel RE camera, which has a CMOS sensor and 1080p HD video recording, features a unique cylindrical design . A built-in grip sensor instantly activates the camera when its picked up, and its single shutter button allows one tap to capture photos, with a longer press being used for video recording. The design also has a 146-degree wide-angle lens, as well as slow-motion and time-lapse recording, with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles. An app, available for both iOS and Android, will automatically back everything stored on the camera to the userâs phone or the cloud to free up space on the camera. In the future, RE will offer real-time video streaming to YouTube, allowing anyone to share events in their lives as they happen. A built-in grip sensor instantly activates the camera on pick up. Its single shutter button allows one tap to capture photos and a longer press for video recording. Pictured is the camera with its stand . The periscope camera, called Re, is curious-looking. It stands around four inches tall and the cylinder design means itâs easy to grip and a hidden sensor means that as soon as you touch it, itâs ready to go. The colour finishes look good and the Re feels solid and classy, much more so that just looking at it might suggest. Holding it is a strange experience at first, especially as you donât look at the back of it as you would a regular camera. In fact, itâs more akin to the way Victorian photographers would hold a flash aloft. Because it has a wide-angle lens you donât need to have it in front of your face and it easily includes all that youâre looking at, so there are no worries about framing your shot. The lens does mean thereâs a slight fish-eye lens effect. The trigger button, a large chrome button on the rear of the device, means thereâs no shutter lag and the simple way of shifting between stills and video (short press for images, long press for video) works well. Still, itâs light and small enough to hide in a pocket or bag easily. You can also trigger the shutter remotely from an Android or Apple smartphone, which is handy. The four times slo-mo looks pristine, though the resolution is 720P, not full HD. The Re is a different product even from the lens-style cameras Sony has launched. The initial results looked promising and it feels good in the hand. Though whether the public is ready to embrace a hand-held periscope is anybodyâs guess . David Phelan . Alongside its new camera, HTC also unveiled its latest HTC Desire model, the HTC Desire Eye.Â The smartphone has 13MP front and rear-facing cameras, and three microphones to increase sound quality . Alongside its new camera, HTC also unveiled its latest HTC Desire model, the HTC Desire Eye. Size: 3.8-inch (96.7mm) x 1-inch (26.5 mm) Weight: 65.5g . Memory:Â 8GB microSD included . Connectivity: BLE (Bluetooth 4.0), Wi-Fi, micro-USB, 1/4-inch tripod connection . Camera: 16mp, CMOS sensor,Â 146Â° lens,Â 1080p, 30fps FHD video,Â 720p, 4x slow motion video, time-lapse video recording . Battery: 820 mAh rechargeable battery (1,200 16MP photos; 1 hour 40 min of continuous FHD video recording) The smartphone has 13MP front and rear-facing cameras, and three microphones to increase sound quality. Back-illuminated sensors capture crisp photos, even in low-light conditions, and dual-LED flash on both cameras means selfies are illuminated. HTC Desire Eye has a 5.2-inch full HD display, waterproof casing, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 4G connectivity. As well as hardware, the HTC Eye has face-tracking capabilities that can follow four people in a room at the same time when using services such as Skype. In direct competition with the RE camera, Polaroid recently launched its Cube device, a tiny action camera with a distinctive square design. It measures 1.5 inches (3.8cm) on all sides and can capture high definition video at 1080 or 720p. In a similar format to RE, still images can also be taken at a resolution of 6MP with its one-button operation. Three is the only UK operator to offer the HTC Desire Eye and RE Camera. The camera will also be available from EE from November for Â£169.99. The HTC Desire Eye is a big phone (thanks to its 5.2-inch screen) but feels comfortable enough in the hand. Snapping selfies is straightforward and the front-facing camera was fast and responsive, even in lower light. The first thing you notice is a much bigger lens on the front of this phone than on any other, matched by the twin flash. Video looked and sounded good thanks to Full HD resolution recording on both front and back cameras, and three microphones to pick up all the sound â this also promises better background noise cancellation for audio and video calls. The phone has HTCâs trademark BoomSound twin speakers at top and bottom of the screen to enhance sound whether youâre video-calling or playing back footage youâve shot. Commenting on the news,Â Ben Wood, Chief of Research at CCS Insight said:'The RE Cameraâs quirky design is certainly distinctive, but HTC is going to have to provide some compelling reasons to buy one given most people are already carrying a smartphone with a great camera. 'HTC has doubtless had its head turned by the 3.8 million action cameras that GoPro sold in 2013 but it is going to be a stretch to expect consumers to embrace the RE camera as a compelling alternative for everyday action photography. The RE camera has a 146-degree wide-angle lens, as well as slow-motion and time-lapse recording, with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles . In regards the HTC Desire Eye,Â Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'HTC has  unleashed what can only be described as the ultimate selfie phone on the market right now. 'No other mobile maker has yet added a whopping 13MP camera to the front of a mass-market phone, so this handset could well feature under a few trees this year. 'If priced right, the launch of the Desire Eye could be HTC's smartest move yet - an affordable phone, with flagship features, targeted at a younger market - just as we head towards the present buying time of year.'

"For Manchester Unitedâs executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, the summer months of 2013 amounted to a quite brutal induction into the highly-charged arena of transfer dealings at the highest level. On a damp Monday evening in September, as the lights went out on Manchester Unitedâs frantic attempts to recruit stars of elite standing, Woodward, red-faced and racked by self-recrimination, privately vowed that never again would United leave things so late. A hap-hazard, scattergun approach had been shown up and within the corridors of power at Old Trafford, there was a recognition that United had come up short, signing only the lamentable Marouane Fellaini. VIDEOÂ Scroll down to watchÂ Ander Herrera signs for Â£28m . Sign him up: Herrera was a key part of the Bilbao team that outplayed Manchester United in March 2012 . Alternative: United considered signing Herrera last summer but settled on Marouane Fellaini instead . Development: After a slow start to last season Herrera has continued to develop into an all-round star . Indeed, it was only ten minutes before the 11pm deadline on September 2 that a bid for Fellaini was finally accepted by the Everton board. As the outlook at home appeared increasingly bleak, the chain of events that developed on the Iberian peninsula entered the realm of the bizarre, descending into embarrassing acrimony, amid reports that three suited men, carrying leather briefcases, had emerged at the headquarters of the Spanish league, apparently with the authorisation to seal a â¬36 million move for the Basque midfielder Ander Herrera. The alleged âimpostersâ, as they were branded by the Spanish Press â in reality, they were three highly reputable lawyers from the firm Laffer Abogados â had been involved in pushing through Bayern Munichâs signing of Javi Martinez the previous summer, possessing a an expertise in the legal issues that can complicate deals involving buyout clauses. United, for their part, denied any association with Rodrigo Garcia Lucas, Alvaro Reig Gurrea and Francisco Salinas Mezquita â and the affable receptionist at Laffer Abogados seemed more than a little perturbed when they received phone calls from Sportsmail the following morning. United, who have their own lawyers in Spain, also bristled at suggestions they would need to call in experts to navigate their way through the Basque countryâs complex tax rules, rather offended by the notion that a club of their size and reputation would be unable to confront relatively straightforward financial regulations. VIDEOÂ Manchester United sign Ander Herrera for Â£28m . Learning: Ed Woodward (left) has learned from his mistakes of last summer, when United left it too late . Options: David Moyes considered signing Herrera in January, but brought in Juan Mata to join Fellaini instead . In truth, United did not require the services of any legal experts that day, for they had no intention of matching Athletic Bilbaoâs buyout clause last summer, with the two clubsâ valuations for the player set at around Â£10million apart. Unitedâs bid approached Â£25million but David Moyes and Woodward resolved to push that bid no further, believing that they could not justify the extra expense at that stage. Now taking in the reigns of three Manchester United managers,Â  Herrera has been a long-standing target at Old Trafford, monitored consistently and closely since he played a starring role in Bilbaoâs mesmeric performance in a 3-2 victory at Old Trafford in the Europa League in 2012. He is one of several that United have continued to keep an eye on, along with midfielder Ander Iturraspe and forward Iker Muniain. On a spring Thursday evening, United could have been hit for six, as Marcelo Bielsaâs side utterly outplayed Sir Alex Fergusonâs team. One that got away: United are set to confirm Herrera's signing after making sure to get their man this time . In the summer that followed, Ferguson and United scouts pondered long and hard but eventually felt that Herrera should be allowed to develop a little longer in Spain. Ideally, they wanted him to score more goals, becoming the heir to Paul Scholes but there was also a concern that both Barcelona and Manchester City would provide competition for his signature. The decision was taken to wait until the next summer and the managerâs brother, Martin Ferguson, continued to monitor his developments. By then, of course, Ferguson had stepped aside, having laid the foundations for a move for Thiago Alcantara from Barcelona while Moyes had assumed the hot-seat. It would be an exaggeration to say that Herrera was the midfielder at the top of his wish-list, with Cesc Fabregas assuming that place, while plans to sign Thiago were shelved, as Moyes decided he required more extensive research into the player, who joined Bayern Munich instead. Herrera, however, remained on the radar, with Moyes recognising the urgent need for a player of style and substance in the central acres and he emerged as a serious target as the days counted down towards the end of the transfer window. Fiasco: United were left embarrassed after lawyers claiming to be acting for the club got involved last summer . Joy: United decided not to buy Herrera (left) in 2012, hoping that he would improve if left in Spain . Unfortunately, Herrera could barely have been at a more unaccommodating club from Unitedâs perspective. Bilbao, who stand as a beacon of Basque national identity, maintain a long-standing philosophy to only utilise players from that region. Such a small pool dictates that Bilbao demand the highest prices, often the buy-out clause, for their assets and Herrera was no exception. There would be no short-cuts on this deal. Unitedâs early faith â a wage package is understood to have been agreed in principle last summer and there were even suggestions that a squad number had been set aside for Herrera â diminished as the clock ticked down. Moyes resolved to return for his man in January but United grew increasingly disturbed by Herreraâs disappointing start to the season. The speculation appeared to affect his form, Herrera losing his place in the Bilbao starting line-up. As winter came, though, Herrera rediscovered his touch, as his side struck 15 goals in three games in January and Moyes came close to resurrecting a deal in the mid-season window. Ultimately, he decided to settle for the signing of Juan Mata alone. Unitedâs interest, however, had been rekindled and dialogue was maintained between the clubs. Officials were aware that Herrera, despite his stock waning somewhat over the last eighteen months, has remained in the thoughts of Barcelona and they recognise a midfield player with the strength and power to adapt to the rigour of the Barclays Premier League and the graceful quality that has often eluded United. Pricey: Herrera is thought to cost in the region of Â£28m, but his release clause increases in July . This summer, Woodward is leaving little to chance and having clumsily paid in excess of Fellainiâs exit clause last summer, United were determined not to fritter away cash so easily once more. At the beginning of July, Herreraâs buyout clause at Bilbao is due to rise by several million pounds and it is this that has compelled United to act swiftly and pay a little more than they may previously have liked â the fee will be in the region of Â£28.4 million, including add-ons â to ensure they finally get their man. With Louis van Gaal determined to reinforce the United midfield with energy and dynamism, United have returned decisively, believing that under the right manager, at the right club, they have a player that will live up to the potential that the 6 foot tall, 24-year-old demonstrated on that March evening at Old Trafford two and a half years ago.","Herrera impressed at Old Trafford for Athletic Bilbao in 2012 .

"Helena Costa, football's first female professional coach, has remained tight-lipped over why she decided to step down as coach of Clermont Foot, but stressed that it was her decision. Costa became the first female coach of a professional men's club in the top two tiers of any European league when she was appointed last month. Costa, 36, said that she had gone through her reasons with club president Claude Michy and that she would not disclose them publicly. Game changer: It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Helena Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a sport traditionally dominated by men upon being appointed coach of Clermont Foot . 'I had a lot of points that I discussed personally with the president and after that discussion I took my decision,' she said. 'The president knows exactly what it is and he's the only person that I have to discuss (it with).' Despite her resignation, Costa is targeting future opportunities to continue her managerial career. 'I thought over my holidays so of course I would appreciate if I could continue but it was my decision so I have no reasons to be sad,' she added. 'I hope in the future other opportunities will come. Only the president knows the reason for my decision. 'I hope this wonât cause prejudice towards women in the sport. I want to be viewed as a coach.' Career: Helena Costa has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women's national teams of Qatar and Iran (pictured), as well as scouting for Celtic . Costa suggested that she had least broken a glass ceiling, by becoming the first female football manager ever - albeit without actually taking charge of a training session, let alone a game.

"Honey Boo Booâs mom June Shannon is facing intense scrutiny over her supposed rekindled relationship with child molester Mark McDaniel, but he isn't the first sex offender she has dated. Michael Anthony Ford, 37, also dated Mama June and is the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon. After the pair split he served over two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry. Scroll down for video . Honey Boo Booâs mom June Shannon is facing intense scrutiny over her supposed rekindled relationship with child molester Mark McDaniel after they were spotted house hunting in Hampton, Georgia, last month . Sex offender Michael Anthony Ford, right, dated Mama June just a few months before she became pregnant with Jessica, left, now 17 . According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge. The fathers of Shannonâs other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary. Alanaâs father, David Michael âSugar Bearâ Thompson, was sentenced to five years in 1998 for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to another. Annaâs father, David Dunn, did time in 1995 for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing a carton of cigarettes. The father of Laury is said to be unknown, even by Mama June. Ford, pictured above, served over two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains behind bars on a separate charge of child abandonment . Rouges gallery:Â David Michael âSugar Bearâ Thompson, left, was sentenced to five years in 1998 for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to another, whileÂ David Dunn, right, did time in 1995 for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing a carton of cigarettes . A police report has revealed the sickening sexual assaults Mama June's eldest daughter allegedly suffered at the hands of her boyfriend when she was just eight. The March 2003 report, seen byÂ RadarOnline, reveals how Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon told authorities in Spalding County, Georgia that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel. She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not. Anna, who appeared on 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' with her mother and siblings, has since revealed that when she first told her mother about the abuse, Mama June refused to believe her. McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. Attacked:Â Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon, pictured with her husband Michael in 2013, was repeatedly abused by her mother's boyfriend between April and October 2002, a police report has shown . The abuse came to light after Anna told her elementary school teacher that her stepfather had assaulted her. She was able to describe the assaults in graphic detail, the report notes. The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002, according to the report. It took Anna months to speak out about the abuse because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnlineÂ reported. 'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' Beach continued. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.' Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend said: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, heâd kill them and her.' Sickening: Mark McDaniel, pictured, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child molestation . Should Mama June lose custody of her kids? In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. Grand jurors accused McDaniel of showing Anna sexually graphic videos, fondling and sexually assaulting the girl, RadarOnline reported. As part of a plea deal, McDaniel only plead guilty to aggravated child molestation and was sentenced to 10 years. Anna, who is now 20 and married with a two-year-old daughter, revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her. 'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, ""I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?""' she remembered. Ignoring the scandal: Honey Boo Boo, left, and her sister are seen on Tuesday as they head out with their parents, Mama June and Sugar Bear . Day together: Sugar Bear and Mama June, both pictured today, split up earlier this year amid reports he had cheated on her - but reports this week suggest she actually cheated on him with McDaniel . 'And I was like, ""Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work"".' After the assault, she moved to her grandmother's house and she only returned to live with her mother shortly beforeÂ Here Comes Honey Boo Boo began, People reported. 'Me and Mama realized we needed to put this behind us and get our relationship back on track and that's what we did and that's what we have been doing,' she said. She said she doesn't know whether to believe reports that her mother is back together with McDaniel but, if it is true, 'I'm hurt'. Mama June has denied that she is dating the child molester. 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said in a video posted at the weekend. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child . But photographs show June and McDaniel looking for houses in Griffin last month, while another image shows him touching her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Shannon, who is just nine. Despite her protests, TLC has announced that they were cancelling the series because of Shannon's relationship with McDaniel. A friend of Alana's father, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, told MailOnline that he is gearing up for a custody battle after learning that Mama June has allowed McDaniel to come into contact with her. On Monday, RadarOnline reported that Child Protective Services in Georgia have opened an investigation into whether any crimes have been committed involving Mama June's three minor children - Alana, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 and Jessica 'Chubbs', 17.","Child molester Mark McDaniel isn't the first sex offender that June Shannon has dated .

Luis Suarez found himself an outcast from world football on Thursday after being handed a four-month ban from the game. The Liverpool and Uruguay striker, who bit Italyâs Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during his countryâs World Cup victory on Tuesday, flew back to Montevideo in disgrace last night after being told his World Cup was over following an unprecedented FIFA punishment. Suarez was evicted from Uruguayâs team hotel on Thursday as part of his immediate four-month ban, which will see him miss the opening 13 games for Liverpool next season as well as the next nine competitiveÂ  Uruguayan internationals.

Sulser . said: âSuch behaviour cannot be tolerated and in particular not at a . World Cup when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field. The . disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and . the degree of Mr Suarezâs guilt in accordance with the relevant . provisions of the code.â The . Uruguayan media claimed that Sulserâs committee had come under pressure . from South American football chiefs, including the English-hating .

"Cyclists across Australia are being urged to arm themselves with cameras so that they have evidence against motorists in court after a truckie was convicted of getting too close to one man on a bicycle. In the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, a truck driver was handed a conviction for breaking a new rule, introduced in April, that means drivers must keep a 1.5m gap limit from cyclists at all times. Safe Cycling Australia director Dave Sharp told Daily Mail Australia: âThere are lots of people who take umbrage to our presence on the roads and a camera covers the cyclist if anything goes wrong.' Scroll down for video . A cyclist filmed the moment truck driverÂ Warwick Fribance, 67, got too close to him on the road . Warwick Fribance, 67, was spared a $341 fine because his lawyer argued he didnât actually cause any harm by breaking the rule. Mr Fribance was filmed overtaking too close to a cyclist who was wearing a camera while cycling along a two-lane road at 7.55am on July 4 this year . Outside court Mr Fribance told the Courier Mail the cyclist had âa camera on his helmet and a big chip on his shoulderâ. Mr Sharp, who is campaigning for the new Split Rule to be introduced across Australia and not just Queensland and the ACT, said: âMore cyclists are buying cameras to help enforce the law.â Safe Cycling Australia director Dave Sharp (left) has urged cyclists to equip themselves with cameras such as the Fly 6 (right) which gives them evidence that they can use in court . The minimum passing distance for motorists in Queensland is now a minimum of 1 metre when passing cyclists in a 60km/h or less speed zone and at least 1.5 metres where the speed limit is over 60km/h. Motorists are allowed to cross centre lines, including double unbroken centre lines, straddle lane-lines or drive on painted islands to pass cyclists provided the driver has a clear view of any approaching traffic and it is safe to do so. The minimum passing distance will be trialled in the state for two years and will help make drivers more aware of cyclists. On 7 September 2011, cyclist Sean Harrison filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute . Mr Harrison had a front and back camera on his bike which showed the horrific incident that broke his back . âWe always hear the argument that sticking to this rule would force drivers to overtake on the other side of the road but if there isnât room they should wait â¦ there is a brake pedal and we are more than ready to see them to use it,â Mr Sharp said. Recent research by Canstar Blue showed nearly half of drivers wish they didn't have to share the road with their two-wheeled nemesis. âWe certainly encourage cyclists to use cameras if they are road riders or sporting cyclists, they normally have the most issues on the road traffic.' A lawyer told Daily Mail Australia that using footage filmed on a cyclistâs camera is no different than using CCTV footage in court. Without footage cyclists are often told it's just their word against the motorist, Mr Sharp said. âPolice in Queensland have stated they are supportive of cyclists using the cameras if drivers are breaking the Split Rule,â Mr Sharp added. âThere is a small majority of drivers who seem intent on doing the wrong thing and then there are those that donât pay attention to cyclists,â he claimed. The ACT followed Queenslandâs lead and also introduced the Split Rule in April. The rule will be trialled for 12 months as the government attempts to make cycling safer by keeping cars and bikes apart. In NSW recently, aÂ cyclist captured the frightening moment he was chucked over the windscreen of a car in Sydney. Paul Ludlow said the footage convinced police that he had not broken the law. Mr Ludlow was cycling home from work when a driver allegedly pulled out in front of him at the intersection of West and Falcon streets in Crows Nest on Sydney's lower north shore. And on 7 September 2011, cyclist Sean Harrison filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute. He broke his back in the accident and has been left with chronic back pain. Some of the most popular cameras used by cyclists are the Fly 6 device and the Go-Pro, which can cost hundreds of dollars but are deemed worth it.","Warwick Fribance, 67, was filmed overtaking too close to a cyclist .

"The net has barely stopped bustling after Brazil were written in the record books for all the wrong reasons, and it has only gotten worse as the media turn on their so-called World Cup heroes. Some newspapers say they 'learned what real shame is', others tell manager Luiz Felipe Scolari to 'go to hell', and another tells their readers to write their own front page. And their damning analyses of Brazil's performance are reaching the people, too, after every copy of every newspaper sold out at Belo Horizonte airport. Here, Sportsmail dissects how Brazil's media have reacted to the 7-1 humiliation on Tuesday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch an angry Brazil fan smash his TV after humiliating defeat . O Globo . O Globo felt Brazil played so bad that they rated each player zero out of 10. Their one-word analysis of Fred? 'Tragic.' Oscar? 'Weak.' Ramires? 'Irrelevant.' And they aren't holding back on their front page, either. They opt for a picture of Brazil captain David . Luiz, looking devastated. 'Shame. Grievance. Humiliation,' reads the . dominating headline. Correio Braziliense . 'Embarrassment for eternity,' according to Correio Brazilense, . who go on to give a large explanation of the downfall. The text is . surrounded by glum photos of Luiz, Scolari and devastated supporters. No score: O Globo rated each Brazilian player zero out of 10 and gave the Germans glowing reviews .

To the runners-up of 1950, who had always been accused of heaping the biggest shame on Brazilian football. Yesterday, we learned what real shame is.' O DIA . The appropriately-named O Dia go in hard on Brazil manager Scolari, saying: 'Go to hell, Felipe!' Scolari won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil, but 12 years on, that's not enough to save the 65-year-old from scrutiny. The boss reminds the readers how many Germany scored, too. Harsh or reality? Informacao Extra and O Dia go in hard on their Brazil team after the 7-1 humiliation . Meia Hora . A black and white Meia Hora refuse to design their cover, saying 'THERE IS NO FRONT PAGE' in block capitals. It continues: 'Today there won't be any fun, the people feel ashamed. Tomorrow, we'll go back to normal.' The newspaper also compliments Germany's attack and ridicules Brazil's defence, adding: 'While you're reading this, Germany have scored another goal.' Lance! A blank canvas, Lance allows its readers to design their own front page. 'Indignation, revolt, pain, frustration, irritation, shame, pity, disillusion,' it reads. 'Say what you're feeling and write it on this front page of Lance!' For some fans, there wouldn't be enough space. No cover: Meia Hora and Lance thought no pictures could do justice to the loss and chose radical fronts . Agora .

"The humble egg is getting a makeover courtesy of Neil Rankin, executive chef at the UKâs only real wood barbecue restaurant, The Smokehouse in Islington, London. A self-confessed 'egg pervert', Mr Rankin is set to change the way people think about the perfect protein with his newest venture Bad Egg, an all-day diner specialising in egg dishes. The restaurant, on the ground floor of CityPoint in Moorgate will open its doors in late November. Smoking hot: Neil Rankin, executive chef of The Smokehouse is all set to open his newest venture, Bad Egg in Moorgate . Bad Egg burger: The self-confessed 'egg pervert' feels that eggs are the ideal way to 'lift a dish' Bad Egg will feature an international menu of dishes like North African baked eggs, Malaysian egg sambal (with galangal, dried shrimp and chilli) as well as a reworked full English. âThe main egg categories are baked - as in North African style - and hashes, which uses many different regional interpretations,â Mr Rankin told MailOnline Food. As well as eggs baked in sambal, the menu will offer chaat masala hash - spicy and crunchy with sweet tamarind and chilli; Chilaquiles - Mexican fried tortilla, with green salsa and peppers; huevos rancheros, and fried chicken and gravy hash, which Mr Rankin says is âlike a roast dinner.â âIn an industry where we sinfully over complicate things, eggs are an ideal way to lift a dish. They are also the most versatile ingredient in any kitchen.' The physics graduate, who previously trained exclusively in French food, left the world of fine dining behind to work under famous barbecue chef Adam Perry Lang. The mentorship led the Edinburgh-born chef to eventually open The Smokehouse, via a stint as head chef at Pitt Cue Co in London. But eggs have always had a special place in his heart. 'I suppose I am a bit of an egg pervert,' he told the Standard. 'My chefs get annoyed with me and say whenever I change a dish I always just put an egg on it.' Baked eggs in a Malaysian sambal: The Southeast Asian dish features galangal, dried shrimp and lots of chilli . Chaat masala hash, a spicy, crunchy dish made with sweet tamarind and chilli. As well as eggs the menu features burgers, chicken fried ribs, tacos and fresh Asian slaws and sides . The egg fan told MailOnline Food that he is steering clear of classics like Eggs Benedict and soft-boiled eggs. He said: âNone of that tosh. We have a tomato, mozzarella and basil baked egg dish, and a plain burger. Thatâs about as simple as it gets.â Head chef Daniel Merry will helm the restaurant but Mr Rankin says he will be very much involved in the beginning stages. âWe have a head chef with a better cooking CV than I have by a long shot. I will be cooking there a lot initially but long-term, developing the menu and the service is with Dan,âhe said. The Smokehouse is the UKâs only real wood BBQ restaurant . Mr Rankin will not be using quail or ostrich eggs in his dishes, preferring instead to feature free-range chicken eggs. âMaybe some duck eggs but mostly chicken,â he said. âThat's not really the point, it's not an egg gimmick restaurant; it's about dishes that have a huge culinary history throughout every world cuisine but don't have a platform. âMost people set out to do a cuisine whereas here I want to champion dishes that I think can stand out by themselves.â As well as eggs, the menu will feature four burgers, four chicken fried ribs, four tacos and some fresh Asian slaws and sides.","Executive chef of The Smokehouse Neil Rankin is launching Bad Egg .

"The group stage is over, and it's as good a time as any to take a breather and reflect on what we have seen so far at the World Cup. 16 of the 32 teams that began in Brazil just over two weeks ago have exited stage left, with world champions Spain, Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and perennially underwhelming England those to have already fallen. And for every shock knockout, there's been an even more surprising progression. Costa Rica managed to make it through a group featuring Italy, England and Uruguay, Greece snuck through with just two goals in the 'for' column and Algeria made it past Fabio Capello's Russia to qualify from the group stage for the first time in their history.. So time to assess, who have been the best players so far? Here, Sportsmail - with a little help from Opta - take a look at the 11 men who have stood head and shoulders above the rest during the first 48 games... VIDEO Scroll down to see Neymar watch Fred do a 'Suarez' on Marcelo in training . Vincent Enyeama - Nigeria . Has done superbly in goal as Nigeria made it through Group F in second place behind Argentina - keeping clean sheets in their opening two games against Iran and Bosnia & Herzegovina. It took the magic of Lionel Messi to beat him. Opta verdict: Has made 18 saves, more than any other goalkeeper in the tournament. Stopper: Vincent Enyeama has been a rock in goal . Gary Medel - Chile . The little general has been a rock in the heart of Chile's defence. His towering display during Chile's 2-0 victory over Spain was simply marvellous. Opta verdict: 28 clearances and a 93% pass completion for the diminutive Chilean defender (from 207 passes). Little general: Gary Medel has been superb at the back for Chile so far . Daniel van Buyten - Belgium . The veteran defender has been masterful at the back as Belgium won all three of their Group H games. Tough defending was required with all their victories coming by just a single goal. Opta verdict: No player made more blocks than van Buyten in the group stage (5). Nutter: Daniel Van Buyten goes up for a header against South Korea forward Kim Shin-Wook . Rafael Marquez - Mexico . Captaining your country at four World Cups should be enough, but it also helped that Marquez was superb in his role at the heart of defence in all three games. Mexico conceded just the one goal in three games, and managed to keep Neymar and Brazil at bay. Opta verdict: Veteran Rafael MÃ¡rquez has netted a goal for Mexico in each of the last three World Cups. Captain Marvel: Rafael Marquez is captaining Mexico at his fourth World Cup . Per Mertesacker - Germany . To think that at Euro 2012 two years ago Mertesacker wasn't even in the Germany side. A superb presence in defence alongside Mats Hummels. Opta verdict: Of all defenders to feature in the group stages, only Gary Medel (207) attempted more passes than Per Mertesacker (202). BFG: Per Mertesacker has been excellent has Germany qualified from Group G . James Rodriguez - Colombia . Quite possibly the standout player of the tournament so far. Has been at the heart of everything good Colombia have done during their 100% group stage record, scoring three times in the process. Opta verdict: Has scored or assisted a goal every 45 minutes on average, the best rate of any player to play more than 100 minutes at this tournament. Spark: James Rodriguez has been superb in a central role for Colombia . Juan Guillermo Cuadrado - Colombia . Freed on the wing by Jose Pekerman's decision to start the World Cup with just a single striker, Cuadrado has been an electric creative presence so far as Colombia dominated Group C. Opta verdict: Has already provided three assists, the joint-most with Holland's Daley Blind. Electric: Juan Cuadrado pace has been a virtue for Colombia . Arjen Robben - Holland . The new fastest man in the world - or at least in the football world - Robben's performance against Spain in their opening game will be remembered for a long time. Opta verdict: After scoring once in 2006 and twice in 2010, has already netted three goals in the 2014 tournament (plus one assist) Sprinter: Arjen Robben scored three times as Holland topped Group B . Karim Benzema - France . Benzema has led the line superbly for France, keeping Olivier Giroud out out of the team for two of their games and scoring three goals. How it is still only three, mind, only he will know. Opta verdict: Created 12 goalscoring chances (including assists), the joint-most with Miralem Pjanic, plus he has netted three times. Finisher: Karim Benzema led the line as France dominated Group E . Lionel Messi - Argentina . It's hard to say anything about Messi that hasn't already been said. So best to keep it simple: four goals so far, all of them superb, all of them vital. Opta verdict: Has scored three goals from outside the box, two more than any other player. Maestro: Lionel Messi has scored four times in three games as Argentina cruised through to the second phase . Neymar - Brazil . The poster boy of Brazil and the man with the weight of a nation on his shoulders. Neymar could so easily have crumbled, but he hasn't even come close yet. Four goals so far, and you'd imagine there are plenty more to come. Opta verdict: Four goal hero Neymar has the best conversion rate of any player to have attempted at least eight shots (44.44%). Poster boy: Brazil's golden boy has rised to the plate, scoring four times during the group stage . Substitutes . Alexander Dominguez - Ecuador . Opta verdict: His saves to shots rate of 85% is second only to Nigeria's Enyeama. Sergei Ignashevich - Russia . Opta verdict: Made more headed clearances than any other player in the group stage (30). Xherdan Shaqiri - Switzerland . Opta verdict: Scored the first entirely left-footed hat-trick at a World Cup (1966-2014). Thomas Muller - Germany . Opta verdict: Has scored nine goals in his first nine World Cup games, matching Pele's achievement.","Sportsmail analyses the best 11 players at the World Cup so far .

"Mesut Ozil has brushed aside any suggestions that Germany would be involved in another âbiscottoâ affair and manufacture a convenient draw against the United States in Recife on Thursday. The two countries would both progress to the last 16 with a point each, and to make matters more enticing for conspiracy theorists the two coaches are close friends and former colleagues. Furthermore the USA team is coached by a German, Jurgen Klinsmann, and contains five German-American players, GI babies who are a legacy of the US armyâs presence in the old West Germany. VIDEO Scroll down to hear what Mesut Ozil had to say about England . One direction: Germany's Mesut Ozil (left) says his side will have maximum points on their mind against the USA . Not friends: Ozil said any connections between the USA and Germany sides will be forgotten on the pitch . Biscotto is an Italian word meaning âcookiesâ which has become a term for games where both teams connive at obtaining a mutually-beneficial result. West Germany, infamously, beat Austria 1-0 at the 1982 World Cup in such a game which saw both teams qualify at the expense of Algeria. For Arsenal playmaker Ozil and Germany coach Joachim Low, there is not even a temptation to settle for a draw against the USA. Ozil said: 'I believe that as a player we do not play for a draw. We play 90 minutes to score. Our purpose is to do our utmost to win, and that is what we will do. We want to finish top of the group.' The infamous West Germany-Austria match will be 32 years ago to the day but Low dismissed its relevance. He said: 'Nowadays it does not mean anything to this squad. Most of the players had not been born then. They would not have an opinion about that, they never watched it. Old news: Germany head coach Joachim Low says historical connections mean nothing to his players . Bounceback: Low addresses his players as they look to return to winning ways at Pernambuco Arena in Recife . 'It is difficult to understand nowadays, we do not know how it happened. It is not a topic for Jurgen or myself, we go to the pitch to win, not for a draw. If you want a draw, it never works.' Ozil said he was satisfied with his form in the win over Portugal and 2-2 draw with Ghana, but admitted he would prefer to be in the playmaker role rather than on the right of an attacking trio. He added: 'In terms of football I know I can still get better but I am happy with the two games, and I think the level of my football was very good. At the moment I still need to score but I am very happy with my performance. 'Everyone knows I am a playmaker, that is my favourite position, but the coach decides. Now I am playing on the right, and have I played there a lot on the right as well. I donât have all the freedom I did but that is not an excuse.

Crowds of Brazilian fans swelled outside . the Sao Carlos Hospital in Fortaleza as news filtered through that their . hero had been taken there. Zuniga said: 'It was a normal move.

"Xabi Alonso has denied that he is set to retire from international football and says he is still deciding on his future with World Cup flops Spain. The Real Madrid midfielder grabbed the headlines after Spain's 2-0 defeat to Chile by declaring that the world champions lacked 'hunger' and 'ambition'. Reports later emerged that the 32-year-old was to call time on an illustrious 11-year international career with Spain, in which he has won two European Championships and one World Cup, but Alonso insisted he had not made any decision. Not giving in - yet: Alonso has not decided on his Spain future despite a dreadful World Cup campaign . He told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: 'I'm still not at that moment, I want all this to end as soon as possible, go on holiday, disconnect a little and then decide things with time. Right now is not the time.' The former Liverpool midfielder refused to be drawn on suggestions that his team-mates were irked by his comments that the team lacked hunger, and insisted the atmosphere among the squad in Brazil was similar to during the glorious Euro 2012 campaign. 'I'm not going to say what's happening in the dressing room, for me that should stay there,' he said.

It's all very natural, there isn't the tension that you (the media) imagine there is.' And Alonso appeared to backtrack on his earlier scathing comments about the team's attitude during the World Cup. 'We know that we lacked intensity, but our enthusiasm has been the same as always. The hardest thing was (to repeat) what we have already done, which is to win three competitions in four years.' After the Chile defeat Alonso had said that Spain were not mentally ready for the tournament and hinted that the old 'era' - which was thought to include himself - was 'over'. 'Things are going to change. Eras end with defeats... and this was a painful defeat,' he said. 'Mentally we weren't ready. Physically we were maybe the same but putting that all together we weren't in the best shape. 'Then we have played against teams that were well-prepared and at their peak. We didn't know how to control situations well. 'We've not been able to keep the same levels of ambition and hunger, perhaps the real conviction to go for the championship.'

"Sir Dave Brailsford likened it to the âinitial jabs of a boxing matchâ; a moment when the main contenders in this yearâs Tour de France flexed their muscles for the first time. That moment arrived on the steepest gradient the riders will encounter during this entire three-week race.

Rising out . of the saddle and dancing on the pedals in that distinctive rocking . style, the Spaniard glanced over one shoulder and then the other as if . to say to Froome âWhere are you? How you finding the pace?â Froomeâs . response was to deliver one of those trademark bursts he uses to . greatest effect on the slopes of the Alps and the Pyrenees. A sudden acceleration that propels him off the front of the peloton and crushes those left in his wake. Only . Froome was not trying to put any time on his rivals, or win this stage.
