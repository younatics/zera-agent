The U.S. government used taxpayers' money to buy semi-automatic weapons, then sold them to criminals and allowed the guns to disappear, a leaked document reveals. The bombshell disclosure undermines the Department of Justice's defence that Operation Fast and Furious, under which the arms-dealing was sanctioned, was a 'botched' operation where agents merely 'lost track' of weapons. In the document, obtained by Fox News, Federal Agent John Dodson was given signed approval by a supervisor at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to purchase six semi-automatic Draco pistols. Gunrunners: A document reveals a federal bureau authorised the purchase of guns and then sold them to criminals. This picture shows a cache of seized weapons as part of the operation . Mr Dodson then sold the pistols to known illegal buyers, while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby, and ultimately allowed the weapons to vanish into the underworld, Fox News reported. Begun in October 2009 as part of Project Gunrunner, which aimed to deprive Mexican drugs cartels of guns, Operation Fast and Furious gave agents the go-ahead to sell firearms to smugglers in a bid to gather intelligence and see where the guns ended up. In total, U.S. officials allowed the sale of more than 2,000 guns to the Sinaloa cartel, worth $1.25million. The leaked document reveals that in June 2010, the ATF allowed the U.S. government to become the actual 'seller' of guns. In a letter dated June 1, 2010, then Phoenix ATF Group VII supervisor David Voth instructed a Federal Firearms Licensee in Arizona to allow for the purchase of ‘four (4) CAI, Model Draco, 7.62x39 mm pistols, by Special Agent John Dodson.’ Whistleblower: Agent John Dodson was given a signed letter to use when buying the weapons. He has since turned whistleblower . It read: 'These aforementioned pistols will be used by Special Agent Dodson in furtherance of the performance of his official duties.' In the lower left-hand margin of the one-page letter is the hand-written note: 'Picked guns up 6/10/10 Paid Cash'. Mr Dodson then sold the weapons to known illegal buyers, while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby. This was not a sting operation, where police sell to a buyer and then arrest them immediately afterwards, Fox News reported. In this case, agents were 'ordered' to let the sale go through and follow the weapons to a stash house. Sources told Fox News that Mr Dodson felt strongly that the weapons should not be abandoned and the stash house should remain under 24-hour surveillance. However, Mr Voth disagreed and ordered the surveillance team to return to the office. Mr Dodson refused, and for six days in the desert heat kept the house under watch, defying direct orders. A week later, a second vehicle showed up to transfer the weapons, Fox New reported. Mr Dodson called for an interdiction team to move in, make the arrest and seize the weapons, but Mr Voth reportedly refused and the guns disappeared with no surveillance. On the defence: The ATF is under fire after two of the weapons allowed to 'walk' as part of Fast and Furious were were found at the fatal shooting of an U.S. Border Patrol agent . According to a story posted on a website dedicated to covering Fast and Furious, Mr Voth gave Mr Dodson the assignment to 'dirty him up,’ since Mr Dodson was a vocal critic of the operation. 'I think Dodson demanded the letter from Voth to cover both himself and the FFL (Federal Firearm Licensee). He didn't want to be hung out to dry by Voth,' a source told the website Sipsey Street Irregulars. Mr Dodson has turned whistleblower on the Fast and Furious Operation, giving interviews with CBS News which detail how guns were allowed to 'walk' across the border into Mexico. The practice erupted into the public consciousness in December last year when 40 year-old Brian Terry, a member of an elite U.S. Border Patrol tactical team, was shot and killed during a violent gun battle in a remote Arizona canyon just north of the U.S. border with Mexico. Two guns 'walked' by ATF were found at Mr Terry’s murder scene, just south of Tucson.",New revelation in Fast and Furious arms scandal .
"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 8:52 AM on 4th October 2011 . Tuvalu, the fourth smallest country in the world, has called a state of emergency . The tiny Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, located midway between Australia and Hawaii, has declared a state of emergency due to a severe shortage of fresh water. Officials said today that some parts of the country - the fourth smallest in the world with a population of 11,000 - may only have a two-day supply. New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully said his country was working with the Red Cross to deliver aid workers and supplies as quickly as possible. He said Tuvalu first declared the emergency last week and the situation had deteriorated since then. Meteorologists have warned that it is unlikely to rain until December, and workers for the Red Cross said that it has not rained properly in the country for at least six months. Usually the 10 square mile country has between 200mm to 400mm of rainfall per month. Water was scarce in the capital, Funafuti, and a number of outlying islands, McCully said, adding that he had received reports saying some places would run out of fresh water within days. And the secretary general of the Tuvalu Red Cross, Tataua Pefe, said water supplies in some parts of the country could run out as early as today. He said: 'It's not safe for consumption. Some animals have died recently and we think it's because of subterranean water.' A New Zealand defence service C-130 plane arrived today carrying two desalination units and a number of water containers, McCully said. The Queen takes a picture while the Duke of Edinburgh looks on during a visit to Tuvalu in 1982 . Tuvalu, which gained independence from Great Britain in 1978 but was visited by the Queen and Prince Philip in 1982, isn't the only Pacific island running out of fresh water after six months of low rainfall. Officials from Australia and New Zealand have said they are worried about other islands in the region, including Tokelau. McCully said his government would work with aid agencies to try and figure out a long-term response to the situation. Today is a national holiday in Tuvalu and government officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Tuvalu, formerly known as the Ellice Islands, is a Polynesian island nation located in the Pacific Ocean, midway between Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbours are Kiribati, Nauru, Samoa and Fiji. It comprises four reef islands and five true atolls. Its population of 10,472 makes it the third-least populous sovereign state in the world, with only Vatican City and Nauru having fewer inhabitants. In terms of physical land size, at just 26 square kilometres (10 square miles). Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world, larger only than the Vatican City, Monaco and Nauru. The country gained independence from Great Britain on October 1, 1978.","Emergency supplies flown in from New Zealand .

An NHS trust paid two temporary members of staff a combined salary of half a million pounds after they were hired for £1,000 a day. Luton Primary Care Trust paid Keith Edmunds £265,000 during his 12 months as ‘interim director of commissioning’. Colleague Chris White received up to £235,000 as ‘interim chief operations’ officer for just over a year. Criticised: Luton Primary Care Trust, based at Nightingale House in Luton (above), says the £500,000 payments to two temporary members of staff were justified despite claims it paid 'over the odds' They each received nearly double the £142,500 salary commanded by Prime Minister David Cameron. Robert Oxley, campaign manager for Taxpayers’ Alliance, said it was a waste of money. He said: ‘It’s unbelievable that . taxpayers are paying such a premium for staff who are supposed to be . interim, yet have been in post for an extended period. ‘It’s a waste of money and a management failure to be paying over the odds by so much for senior staff. ‘Reliance on temporary staff is a . clear sign the NHS has not got to grips with the problem of costly . executive pay. Cutting down on fat cats should be a priority.’ A permanent member of staff has been . hired as director of commissioning while the chief operations officer . role has been transferred to Cambridgeshire Community Services Trust. The £500,000 payments follow that of an NHS chief . executive who was paid £3,163 a day to work on a temporary basis at . cash-strapped Dorset County Hospital - nearly twice as much as a nurse takes home in a month. Derek Smith received £387,220 for the 141 days he worked. Over the odds: Derek Smith (left) was paid £3,163 a day by Dorset County Hospital. His salary and those of the Luton PCT bosses far exceed David Cameron's . When . he was hired, the hospital was £5.1million in the red and has since . reduced staff levels through natural wastage to cut costs. A spokesman for Luton Primary Care . Trust, based at Nightingale House in Inkerman Street, Luton, said the . salaries, revealed in an annual report, were justified. He said: ‘We paid the going daily rates to the interim agency for the levels of responsibility required.’ It has emerged that health trusts are . spending nearly £16million a year paying recruitment firms to hire . highly paid senior executives and bureaucrats. Last year, primary care trusts and . strategic health authorities spent an estimated £15.9million paying . recruitment firms to hire managers, Freedom of Information figures . revealed. Over the past three years they spent . nearly £50million – the equivalent of hiring 2,040 extra nurses, 650 . consultants or 1,300 midwives.

"By . Paul Harris . Last updated at 12:59 AM on 4th October 2011 . They assembled their legions like Russian generals on a battlefield: Roman Abramovich, one of the wealthiest men in the world, versus Boris Berezovsky, once regarded as the Soviet Union’s most powerful oligarch. Among their armouries were some of the nation’s finest and most expensive legal brains, a battalion of personal bodyguards, mountains of paperwork and evidence… not to mention a couple of classy looking redheads. Against a backdrop of the High Court in London, this was day one of what looks set to become Britain’s most epic legal wrangle. Accused: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich arrives at the High Court with his entourage for the start of the case against Boris Berezovsky . Mr Abramovich is being sued by Mr Berezovsky for alleged breach of trust and breach of contract over the Sibneft share deal . And at a cost of something like £50 a second when it opened yesterday, probably among its most expensive. At stake is not just the question of a £3.2billion damages claim against the celebrated Chelsea Football Club owner, but the reputations and credibility of both men, once said to have been friends and business partners. Berezovsky accuses Abramovich of having ‘betrayed and blackmailed’ him over the sale of oil shares, ‘intimidating’ him into getting rid of them at a fraction of their true value. The 65-year-old, who fled to Britain from Russia 11 years ago after falling out with those in power, alleges breach of trust and breach of contract over the deal, struck after the collapse of communism during the 1990s. Yesterday Laurence Rabinowitz QC, for Berezovsky, told Mrs Justice Gloster the two men had worked together to acquire Russian oil company Sibneft. ‘This is a case about two men who worked together to acquire an asset that would make them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of most people,’ he said. 'Felt intimidated': Mr Berezovsky (centre) leaves the court after claiming Mr Abramovich 'betrayed and blackmailed' him over £3.2billion of oil shares . Support: Mr Berezovsky was joined in the High Court by girlfriend Yelena Gorbunova (centre) and security guards . They were ‘good friends’ until Berezovsky became an enemy of the Kremlin through his increasingly political profile and his ownership of influential media outlets. The oligarch says he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft and in the Russian aluminium giant Rusal before leaving the country, for fear they would fall into the hands of Russian authorities. Abramovich, said the QC, ‘was in effect required to make a choice – to remain loyal to Mr Berezovsky ... or instead, as we submit, to betray Mr Berezovsky and to seek to profit from his difficulties. ‘It is our case that Mr Abramovich at that point demonstrated that he was a man to whom wealth and influence mattered more than friendship and loyalty.’ Turning point: It is alleged Mr Abramovich betrayed Mr Berezovsky after the latter fell out of favour with political leaders at the Kremlin, then led by President Vladimir Putin (above) Six years ago the Chelsea owner, currently said to be worth £10.3billion, sold Sibneft to Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly in a multi-billion dollar deal . Now he denies Berezovsky’s claims and insists the two men were never friends or partners. He says he had simply hired Berezovsky to protect him from Chechen criminal gangs as the initial deal went through. His lawyers have yet to outline their case in court, but in written arguments before the judge they said Berezovsky’s accusations were ‘devoid of merit’ and his evidence had ‘an overtly political purpose’. Mr Abramovich, pictured with girlfriend Daria Zhukova in 2009 and watching Chelsea in action (right), bought the football club in 2003 . The complex story of everyday Russian billionaires unfolded as the two men sat 20 yards apart. Both are expected to give evidence and . each packed the court with some of the country’s top lawyers. Abramovich alone had three QCs and a clutch of juniors and solicitors. Team Berezovsky, whose security men include ex-Foreign Legionnaires, . filled his side of the court. Legal fees are thought to have topped . £1million for the five hours the court sat. The case is expected to last up to three months.","Boris Berezovsky claims he was 'intimidated' into selling shares at fraction of value .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 1:25 PM on 4th October 2011 . For years, the more energy-conscious among us have habitually switched off lights in empty rooms and made sure televisions are never left on stand-by. But it appears these daily efforts to cut ever-rising bills could be in vain as our increasing reliance on electronic gadgets means we are consuming more electricity than five years ago. As a result, Britain will miss its 2020 domestic appliance carbon reduction target by seven million tons, a report by the Energy Saving Trust warned today. Hi-tech home: Large plasma-screen TVs, tumble dryers and fridge-freezers, particularly those with an ice-maker, are the worst energy-usage offenders . Study author Dr Paula Owen said: 'Our love affair with domestic gadgets and gizmos has to change. 'Just because you have bought an efficient appliance, doesn’t mean you can use it carelessly and never switch it off.' Households now own three-and-a-half times as many electricity-powered gadgets as they did 20 years ago. Among the worst offenders in eating up energy are large plasma-screen TVs, tumble dryers and fridge-freezers, particularly those with an ice-maker. The rise is also the result of a marked decrease in the number of appliances that run off disposable batteries. The government had set a target of reducing 1990 carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020. Almost a third of the Britain's carbon dioxide emissions come from the home. In 2009, the average British household contained three-and-a-half times as many gadgets and appliances as it did in 1990. If every household in Britain replaced their old fridge freezer, washing machine and dishwasher with the most efficient, they could collectively save £585million on fuel bills, the report claims. Changes: Electricity use and projected demand between 1990 and 2020 . Such a widespread switch would also . prevent two million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the . atmosphere, the equivalent of filling Wembley Stadium with gas 257 . times. Dr Owen said: 'Our domestic choices and behaviour in our homes can make a bigger impact than people think. 'We . need to ask ourselves is that ice-maker in the fridge a necessity? Do I . need to leave those chargers on the whole time? Do I need a 50+ inch TV . screen? 'There’s more . to this issue than using energy efficient light bulbs. Not only can . people cut their carbon footprint, but they can also bring down their . electricity bills considerably.' Designer Wayne Hemingway, who has worked on award-winning eco-friendly housing projects, insists it is not too late to act. He said: 'This report is clearly a kick . up the backside to all of us who imagine that we are taking big steps to . a more sustainable future. 'Clearly we are not going to reverse, nor do we want to reverse the tremendous technological strides that mankind is making. 'But we must harness all this creativity to ensure that we are not storing up an environmental time bomb that will lead future generations to regret our technological advances.' The report - called Elephant In The Living Room - found there has been good progress since 2006 in improving standards and legislation such as banning patio heaters and incandescent light bulbs. But the findings also picked up worrying trends in consumer energy usage. Experts point to the popularity of home computers and all the extra gadgets that go with them - in 1985 only 13 per cent of the population owned a computer, but by 2009 ownership levels had topped 75 per cent. Leaving your printer turned on permanently, even though you only use it for a few minutes a day, vastly increase your electricity bill. Although many household appliances such as fridges are now more energy efficient than in 1990 this is being undermined by our preference for larger US-style products. Similarly, our move towards larger washing machines has the potential to reduce energy use if this means fewer washes - but often no change in washing behaviour makes them a bigger burden on household bills. The Energy Saving Trust is an independent body set up to help householders reduce their energy bills and combat climate change.","Computers, plasma TVs, fridge-freezers and tumble dryers to blame .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 1:21 PM on 5th September 2011 . Graffiti artist Banksy has demanded a top-level investigation at Channel 4 after he claimed a documentary suggests he left a rival in a coma in a row about his work. He has been involved in a tit-for-tat battle with veteran King Robbo after painting over one of his designs. The rival suffered a mysterious head injury which has left him in a coma for the past five months. Original: The Robbo artwork on Regents' Canal which Banksy painted over. He said the piece was badly damaged . Banksy claims a controversial Channel 4 documentary about his long-running feud with King Robbo implies he was responsible and has made a formal complaint. Graffiti Wars, screened last month, revealed how the pair had been involved in a remarkable battle for supremacy. Banksy has admitted painting over one of King Robbo's last-surviving pieces of art on Regent's Canal in 2009 - but claims that the work was already damaged. He stencilled an image of a man wallpapering over the 1980s' piece, striking the first blow in the feud. Last year King Robbo hit back and painted his name over the image. Painted over: Banksy stenciilled a man wallpapering over the design on top of the graffiti artwork. He said he did not realise it was by Robbo . King Robbo was found with a serious wound to his head in April - but nobody knows how it happened. It is believed the 6ft 8in artist may have tumbled over in a freak accident. He has been in an artificially-induced coma since April. The artist's true identity is a closely guarded secret but he is believed to have an 18-month old daughter and lives in Holloway, north London. However, Banksy claims that the original artwork was in such a poor state of disrepair that the signature was no longer visible. The Channel 4 documentary showed Robbo disappearing off to paint over another piece of his rival's work - but said shortly after the clip was filmed he suffered a mystery head injury. The narrator said: 'But Robbo would never get his chance to retaliate against Banksy. 'Just days after this filming took place, he was found unconscious in the street with life-threatening head injuries and he's been in a coma ever since.' Channel 4 fiercely deny claims that the programme suggested Banksy put his rival in a coma - and they said he was not unfairly portrayed. It is believed that Robbo may have fallen down the stairs and banged his head - although the incident was never investigated by police. Banksy told The Observer in a statement: 'Graffiti Wars contained some inaccuracies that I've asked to be investigated and some facts that need to be corrected. Revenge: Robbo reclaims the spot by painting his signature over Banksy's stencil. He has since suffered a serious head injury . 'They alleged I painted over a piece by Robbo and led viewers to believe I had something to do with him being in a coma. 'I wish Robbo a full and speedy recovery.' In the show, King Robbo claimed he slapped Banksy when he first met him for showing a lack of respect. A spokesman for Channel 4 denied Banksy's claims. He said: 'Graffiti wars in no way suggests that Banksy was responsible for the injuries sustained by King Robbo. 'The documentary clearly states that Banksy did not realise he was painting over Robbo's work and includes a picture of the deteriorated work.'","Banksy admitted painting over King Robbo's artwork .

Fake air fresheners containing chemicals that can cause headaches, nausea and even loss of consciousness have been seized from markets in Manchester and North Wales. Trading Standards officers from Denbighshire County Council discovered 162 counterfeit refills for the battery-powered auto-spray Air Wick Freshmatic Max on sale at markets in Mold and Prestatyn in north Wales. Shoppers are now being warned to beware of buying the 250ml  counterfeit canisters of air freshener that were found to contain 'excessive amounts of methanol' - enough to cause loss of consciousness when too much is inhaled over a period of time. The fake air freshener, left, was designed to look like the authentic one on the right. Council officers say the way to recognise a counterfeit is by the label, which does not fit around the tin and exposes a silver strip down the side . The chemical is a non-drinking and flammable form of alcohol that is often used as an antifreeze, solvent or fuel. Genuine Air Wick auto-spray refills contain around five per cent methanol and are entirely safe for use. There is no connection to genuine Air Wick products, which have not been recalled or been linked to any toxins. A Denbighshire County Council spokeswoman said investigations were ongoing into where the canisters originated and that it was not yet known whether criminal charges will be brought against the sellers. Phil Richards, Trading Standards senior . investigations officer said: 'We would urge anyone who has bought a . counterfeit refill to stop using them immediately and get in touch with . their local Trading Standards office, giving information about where . they got them from and when. 'It is very easy to tell if they are . counterfeit by the seal that goes around the can - that's how officers . have been able to identify them straight away.' Some of the counterfeit air fresheners were seized from Mold market in Flintshire, north Wales . The alarm was first raised when 219 replica air freshener refills seized from a wholesaler in Cheetham Hill, Manchester were found to have been causing people headaches. Tests commissioned by the manufacturer of genuine Air Wick refills identified excessive amounts of methanol in some. Councillor Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for environment, said: 'I would warn Manchester residents to be on their guard when buying Air Wick refills, ensuring they buy genuine products from reputable retailers.' The counterfeit containers can be easily identified. Unlike genuine Air Wick refills, the label does not go all the way around the can, leaving a silver strip down one side.","100 canisters seized in Mold and 62 in Prestatyn in north Wales .

"Clare Cartwright worked at Little Nippers in Halifax . 32-year-old claimed children 'pushed her buttons' By . Chris Brooke . Last updated at 2:17 AM on 21st June 2011 . Clare Cartwright, 32, had admitted four counts of child cruelty at her Little Nippers nursery in Halifax . A bullying childminder was jailed for ten months yesterday for force-feeding and mistreating  toddlers in her care. Clare Cartwright, 32, lost patience with the youngsters, aged between one and three, and stuffed food into their mouths until some were physically sick. The registered childminder – herself a mother – also held a three-year-old girl under a cold tap when she refused to eat. She ran the Little Nippers nursery from her home in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Her teenage staff described her as a ‘bully’ and she regularly swore in front of the children. She pleaded guilty to four counts of child cruelty which took place over seven months in 2009. Cartwright would hold children’s heads against a wall, force food into their mouths and clamp them shut, Bradford Crown Court was told. Prosecutor Sharon Beattie said one mother arrived to pick her one-year-old son up to find ‘he had so much food in his mouth he was starting to choke’. The boy spat the food out and was told by Cartwright: ‘You silly boy, you should have swallowed it.’ When another toddler wasn’t eating his sandwich she ripped it in half and shoved it into his mouth, saying: ‘You have got to eat when you are here.’ She even found the situation ‘amusing,’ the court was told. When a grandmother arrived to pick up her little girl and asked why her hair was wet Cartwright lied by saying she had spilt orange juice. Mrs Beattie said: ‘She picked the child up by her leg and arm, then carried her to the sink where she held her face under running water. The child was hysterical.’ Cartwright said later she had ‘lost it’ with the child who had ‘pushed every one of my buttons’. On another occasion a young girl broke her leg in an accident at the nursery, but Cartwright dropped older children off at school before taking the girl, who was in agony, to hospital. The married mother-of-three looked after 40 children in total between November 2007 and October 2009. Clare Cartwright was working at Little Nippers Nursery in Siddal, Halifax, West Yorkshire . The business was closed when Cartwright was arrested after staff and parents spoke to police. As well as jailing Cartwright, Judge James Goss QC banned her from working with children again. He added that her breach of trust of the parents who left their children in her care was an aggravating feature of the case. Dapinder Singh, defending, said Cartwright was unable to cope with the success of the nursery and the only explanation for her actions was ‘stupidity’. Outside court one of the children’s mothers, who cannot be named, said her two-year-old boy now had trouble eating and sleeping. ‘He was distressed every time he came home and would get upset every time we walked past the nursery.’ Detective Inspector Gail Lawrie of West Yorkshire Police said: ‘Any parent can only imagine the upset and trauma caused to these families.’","Clare Cartwright worked at Little Nippers in Halifax .

Paul McBride, 39, is believed to have smothered six-month-old Ollie before hanging himself. McBride’s body was found at his mother’s house in Preston by his sister Michelle shortly after 6pm on Wednesday evening. Tragic: Six-month-old Ollie McBride was taken to hospital in Lancashire, Preston, where he was later pronounced dead .

"By . Gavin Allen . Last updated at 1:59 PM on 3rd October 2011 . A U.S. military hardware company has revealed the latest prototype for a robotic battlefield 'pack mule'. Alphadog is the next generation of the Big Dog project, which is in development at Boston Dynamics with funding from Darpa and the Marine Corps. The mechanical quadruped - which bears a passing resemblance to the At-At walkers from the Star Wars films - has a series of improvements on its predecessor which will leave the Big Dog cowering in its kennel. See Alphadog in action below... Alphadog: The robot horse prototype, made by Boston Dynamics, is designed to carry military equipment in battle to make soldiers lighter and more mobile . Do push me: The Alphadog is able to stand up to the pressure of two men pushing it over, or even kicking it, which would help it resist nearby bomb blasts too . Though headless, it resembles a horse more than a dog in both size and strength, with increased endurance and distance capabilities that allow it to carry 400lbs of payload and trek for 20 miles. It is also now virtually silent. The Big Dog was saddled with a whining noise that was akin to a low powered motorcycle engine, but the Alphadog seemingly makes no sound other than those of its 'hooves' on the ground. And where the Big Dog looked like 'Bambi on ice' when it was unsteadied by undulating ground due to its long thin legs, the AlphaDog's thicker legs make it more powerful and stable. The prototype is formally known as the L3, which stands for Legged Squad Support System. Steady as she goes: Alphadog's state of the art hydraulics enables it to walk over uneven ground . Self-righting: Alphadog is able to flip itself back onto its 'feet' if it is knocked onto its side . It is designed to carry equipment for troops and is capable of navigating uneven ground such as steps, hills, rubble and logs thanks to its GPS, computer vision and the eerily realistic leg movement offered by state-of-the-art hydraulics. Star Wars: The Alphadog bears a resemblance to the At-At walking machines features in the sci-fi films . Alphadog is set to be officially unveiled next year but the video below shows the latest developments. It is now able to steady itself when pushed and kicked powerfully by two men, but most impressively if it does fall onto its side, Alphadog has a full self-righting mechanism that will return it to its 'feet'. As technological advances improve the range of weapons and equipment at soldiers' disposal, so their loads become heavier. British commanders in Afghanistan have previously warned that today's troops are simply too weighed down by kit when on foot patrol as they lug up to 150lb - in summer temperatures that push 50 degrees centigrade. 'If LS3 can offload 50 pounds from the back of each soldier in a squad, it will reduce warfighter injuries and fatigue and increase the combat effectiveness of our troops,' Marc Raibert, the president of Boston Dynamics, told PhysOrg.com.","New version of the Big Dog project is ten times quieter than previous prototype .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 2:37 PM on 2nd October 2011 . A convicted murderer given the lethal injection despite emotional pleas worldwide for his life is being remembered this weekend as a gentle man who faced his execution with grace and dignity. Sent to death row 20 years ago, Troy Davis was celebrated as 'martyr and foot soldier' by more than 1,000 people who packed the pews at his funeral on Saturday and pledged to fight the death penalty. Davis, 42, was executed last month in Georgia for the slaying of off-duty police officer Mark MacPhail in 1989, insisting his innocence and asking forgiveness for his accusers and executioners. After: Pallbearers carry the casket of Troy Davis followed by family and supporters after his funeral today . Still angry: Friends and supporters chant in the street and block traffic outside Jonesville Baptist Church following the funeral of Troy Davis in Savannah, Georgia, on Saturday . 'Troy's last words that night were he told us to keep fighting until his name is cleared in Georgia,' Mr Jealous said at the funeral on Saturday at Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia. 'But most important, keep fighting until the death penalty is abolished and this can never be done to anyone else.' Davis's closed casket was piled with a . spray of blue and white flowers - a colour scheme decoded by a close . friend who mentioned his love of NFL team the Dallas Cowboys. Attendees each got a glossy, 22-page . programme filled with a scrapbook's worth of photos, many of Davis in . his white prison garb posing with family members during weekend visits. Last night more than 250 people, . including civil rights activists Benjamin Jealous and Dick Gregory, . jammed the New Life Apostolic Temple in Davis’s hometown of Savannah. Unhappy: Davis died by injection for the 1989 slaying of off-duty Savannah police officer Mark MacPhail . This church memorial served as a prelude to a much larger service for Davis's funeral today, where a line of people waited outside the Jonesville Baptist Church before it started this morning. Dead: Troy Davis, 42, was executed in Georgia . On Friday, friends, pastors, anti-death penalty activists and Davis' lawyer all took turns at a podium behind his closed casket, decorated with a spray of white and purple flowers. Longtime friend Earl Redman, who said he had known Davis since the age of eight, told the crowd on Friday that during prison visits Davis would often say that he expected to die in the death chamber. ‘He looked me in the eye and he told me: “Don't let me die in vain. Don't let my name die in vain”,’ Mr Redman said as a church usher tore paper towels off a roll for teary attendees to dry their eyes. The Reverend Randy Loney, a Macon pastor who often visited Davis in prison, said he was always struck by Davis's gentle nature despite the death sentence looming over him. Referring to the catchphrase adopted by his supporters - ‘I am Troy Davis’ - Reverend Loney said he came to realise that ‘in a lot of ways, we are not Troy Davis’. ‘We did not wake up every morning and go to sleep every evening with the spectre of the executioner in our eyes,’ Reverend Loney said. Jason Ewart, a lawyer who spent seven years handling Davis's appeals, fought back tears as he recalled sitting with execution witnesses and watching the life drain from his client's eyes. Mr Ewart recalled many long phone conversations with Davis, never shorter than an hour, in which the men spent twice as much time talking about their families as they did legal strategy.

Mr Ewart said his own grandmother had just died, and he pictured her and Davis together at ‘heaven orientation’. ‘She would say: “Jesus died on the cross not because he was guilty, but because we all were”,’ Mr Ewart said. Davis's family opted to open the funeral on Saturday to his supporters and the general public, holding the service at a church that organisers say can seat 2,000 people. The pastor delivering the eulogy said he hopes the funeral will serve as wake-up call on the death penalty much like the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till shocked Americans to the brutality of Jim Crow.

A Lowry painting of London's bustling Piccadilly Circus could fetch up to £6million when it goes under the hammer for the first time. The artwork, which dates back to 1960, was part of hotel Tycoon Lord Forte's collection for almost three decades, and has never before been auctioned. It depicts the junction's famous fountain, topped by the iconic statue of Eros, in a different spot to its present location, amid a throng of red buses and scurrying figures. High expectations: This JS Lowry painting of London's bustling Piccadilly Circus is estimated to reach between £4million to £6million at auction .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 6:38 AM on 7th September 2011 . Hurricane Katia, a Category 2 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, is expected to pass between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States over the next day or two, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a report late Tuesday. At 11:00pm EDT, Katia was located about 325 miles south-southwest of Bermuda and was packing maximum winds of 105 miles per hour, the NHC said. 'Katia is moving toward the northwest near 9mph and this general motion is expected to continue through Wednesday, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest and north Wednesday night and Thursday,' the NHC said. Incoming: Hurricane Katia is currently around 450 miles from Bermuda with gusts of 160 mph, but could sweep inland . Upgraded: The storm, which could come inland next week, has now become a category 4 hurricane, the second-highest level of intensity . A tropical storm watch is in effect for Bermuda, the NHC said. The core of Katia is expected to move between the east coast of the . United States and Bermuda on Wednesday and Thursday, the NHC added. Although . experts believe Katia may veer away from the East Coast later this . week, large swells from the hurricane could still cause life-threatening . coastal surf and rip currents. Katia has already left impact along the Central Florida coastline, as lifeguards on Labor Day warned beachgoers of dangerous rip currents and jellyfish, reports ClickOrlando.com. Beach patrol officers said jellyfish stung nearly 300 swimmers on Monday. Meanwhile, waves in Daytona Beach have doubled in size since Sunday and dangerous rip currents prompted about 20 rescues throughout Volusia County.

Wading: Bill Provensal carries his shoes while walking through flood waters caused by Tropical Storm Lee in New Orleans on Saturday . The storm has weakened since Monday from a Category 4 storm as it continued its route across the Atlantic. Still, insurers are also bracing . themselves incase Katia does increase in strength and come inland, just . days after the extensive flooding of Hurricane Irene and torrential rain . of Tropical Storm Lee. Global insurers and reinsurers have already suffered catastrophe losses of more than $70billion this year, by industry estimates, including up to $6billion in the United States from Irene. NHC hurricane specialist Robbie Berg told Reuters the greatest threat from Katia for the U.S. eastern seaboard was likely to be the large swells and resulting dangerous coastal surf and currents the storm generated on its path. Mr Berg said: 'Even though these storms . may stay offshore, they still can be a deadly threat, especially to . people going to the beach.

There is still thought to be around a one in ten chance that parts of the East Coast could experience tropical storm-force winds when Katia passed well offshore later this week. Jutting coastal areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks and Cape Codd in Massachusetts could be particularly at risk.

The reality TV star was covered from top to toe, with just her legs visible as she visited the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, California. Taylor, 40, wore a black hood, sunglasses and held a fur lined coat over her head in an attempt to avoid the glare of waiting photographers. Mourning: Taylor Armstrong hid under a shawl, sunglasses and a fur blanket as she went to Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Los Angeles, California . Her appearance came as his mother's lawyer confirmed Russell's ashes would be split between Taylor in Los Angeles and his family in Texas. And Bravo, the U.S. network behind the show, is said to be hastily re-editing the footage in light of Russell's death, according to TMZ, although the website says an executive who spoke to them said no decision had been made about a premiere date. It had been previously scheduled to start on September 5. Russell was in a state of panic over how he would be . portrayed in the upcoming season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills . before his suicide on Monday. Speaking . out for the first time since he was found hanged on Monday, Russell's . mother said he was deeply concerned about the candid footage Bravo had . obtained, charting his marriage breakdown and money woes. While . producers are now weighing how to proceed with the second season, John Ann Hotchkiss says her son . feared TV makers were going to 'crucify' him. Tragedy: The reality star's husband is believed to have hung himself earlier this week . She told Headline News: 'Before the . new season even started, before he took his life, he said, ""Mom, they’re . just going to crucify me this season"".' 'He said, ""I don’t . know what to do. I’ll never survive it"".' In . another interview with CNN HLN’s Jane Velez-Mitchell, Russell's mother . also cautioned Bravo about airing any footage involving her son. She said that the TV station: 'Better not air one frame of my son... or else!' Troubled: Taylor Armstrong's husband was fearful over the candid TV footage Bravo producers were planning to air in the upcoming season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills . Her statement comes after members of the family have previously said that the reality show and Bravo is to 'blame' for Russell's suicide. During an exclusive interview with . RadarOnline.com, Russell's stepbrother Wade Jackson revealed that the . family might sue the network. 'Bravo is at fault and somebody needs to pay,' he said. 'Russell’s whole family was very close and they’re considering suing Bravo.

TMZ have alleged today Russell sent a 'very threatening' email to Real Housewives co-star Camille Grammer after Taylor admitted that she had confided in Camille about  Russell's alleged physical abuse. 'Chilling': Sources claim Russell sent co-star Camille Grammer a 'threatening' email after Taylor confided in her about alleged domestic abuse . According to the website, multiple show insiders have claimed that Rusell beat Taylor so savagely at the start of season two that she required hospitalisation and surgery. Her alleged injuries were so severe that Taylor couldn't show her face for weeks, but feared she would be fired from the reality series for being 'uncooperative and flaky.' TMZ claim that Taylor confided in her co-stars Camille Grammer and Kyle Richards, who both urged her to tell Bravo the truth. When Russell found out, he allegedly sent Camille a 'chilling' email that read like 'the rantings of a lunatic,' sources told the website. Russell's lawyer Ronald Richards told ABC News that his former client was also in debt to the tune of $1.5m. He added that the reality show's celebration of outrageous excess plunged him into debt as he tried to keep his family's lavish lifestyle afloat. 'These couples join these shows, and then they keep trying to outdo each other and they end up spending all their money trying to sustain a lifestyle that’s unrealistic and wasn’t there prior to the show,' Richards said. 'The weekly social events, the dinners and all the bulls***, trying to pretend you have unlimited resources in Beverly Hills is tough. Estranged: Despite being embroiled in a bitter divorce before Russell's suicide, the reality star is making preparations for the service . 'When every night is a potential sound bite or posting on a website, you end up getting addicted to it, you go out all the time.' Taylor is still said to be 'devastated' over the news and is grieving behind closed doors. A source told People.com: 'Taylor is behind closed doors, surrounded by her family. She's with Kennedy.' The news comes after U.S. TV . network Bravo, which makes the Real Housewives reality show, reportedly held crisis talks yesterday. According to RadarOnline, executives spoke to Taylor's castmates at fellow star Adrienne Maloof's Beverly Hills mansion. Worry: Russell Armstrong was said to be fearful about his appearances in the forthcoming season of Real Housewives .

A source revealed: 'The people at . Bravo just want to do the appropriate thing. Their first priority is . being respectful to Russell, Taylor . and their families.' The website reports that producers asked the housewives not to talk to the Press about Russell, who was found dead on Monday. Going ahead: Bravo executives are deciding whether season two of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills will air next month on schedule . Today it was revealed that the network were going to delay the premiere of the show for 'at least one week'. The premiere party for the Bravo show, which was scheduled for August 24, has now been cancelled.

Taylor could now be left footing the bill for the debts they got into during their marriage, RadarOnline reports. Troubled: Friends claim the wound over her eye was inflicted during a football game, but new reports claim she was hospitalised in June after Russell assaulted her . It may force the former surgical sales representative to go back to work in order to be able to provide for their five-year-old daughter. There are also fresh reports today, stating that Russell and Taylor were living in a rental house in the Bel Air Crest area of Los Angeles when the second season of the show started filming. Having moved out of their Beverly Hills mansion, they down-sized to a $9,000-a-month home, their lawyer told RadarOnline. The location not as upscale as Bel Air or indeed Beverly Hills, where her co-stars live in huge mansions. In the months leading up to his suicide, Russell was accused of physical assault by Taylor. It emerged today that she had to have re-constructive on her face after Russell allegedly assaulted her during a heated row back in June.

"Police battled for ten years to have Wahid extradited . 'You are an intelligent but devious man' says judge . By . Nick Enoch . Last updated at 5:04 PM on 3rd October 2011 . A killer who stabbed his flatmate to death and then dumped her body in a suitcase at Heathrow before fleeing the country was jailed for at least 24 years today. Youseff Ahmed Wahid, 42, fled to Lebanon to escape justice after he slit the throat of 28-year-old Fatima Kama and stabbed her repeatedly more than 12 years ago. He finally faced trial at the Old Bailey after a decade-long battle by British police to return him to the UK. Airline steward Youseff Wahid is caught on CCTV at Heathrow preparing to dump the butchered body of his flatmate - which he had stuffed inside the large suitcase . Youseff Wahid (left), 42, fled the country . after slashing aspiring singer Fatima Kama's throat following sex with . her in their central London flat in 1999 . Wahid, of no fixed address, denied murder. Judge . Paul Worsley QC sentenced Wahid to life imprisonment and ordered he . serve at least 24 years before he can be considered for parole. Judge Paul Worsley told Wahid: 'You are an intelligent but devious and manipulative man. 'There is indication of significant physical suffering before her death. You callously concealed her body in a suitcase. 'I am entirely satisfied that your intention was to kill. There has been no flicker of remorse shown by you. 'You have refused to participate in proceedings and have refused to come into the court, believing mistakenly that you could abort the trial thereby. 'Justice is not so easily thwarted. You have done your utmost to avoid conviction for her murder. You have failed.' Miss Kama's body was found at 10.30pm on September 17, 1999, the same night she was set to fly home to Montreal. Wahid was captured on CCTV lugging a . heavy suitcase through Paddington station and heading on a Heathrow . Express train. Two women discovered the suitcase at Heathrow Airport and a security guard opened it to Miss Kama's body curled up in a foetal position. She had been robbed of expensive jewellery and more than £40,000 she had been carrying. Within hours of the grisly discovery, Wahid fled to his native Lebanon after paying £457 cash for a one-way ticket at the same airport the next morning. Miss Kama, a petite and attractive Moroccan-born Canadian national, was only identified on Monday September 19, once friends in London and family in Canada had reported her missing. By the time officers visited the small flat in Marylebone, she had shared with Wahid, a former airline steward, he had already fled. The tidy flat initially bore 'no sign of a struggle, let alone the sign of murder', but careful examination revealed blood-soaked carpet and smears on walls behind furniture. Detectives travelled to Lebanon but quickly discovered there was no prospect of being able to extradite him back to the UK. He settled with his family in the town of Ramadiyeh, but police continued to build their case against him. With new information provided by Scotland Yard he faced trial at a Lebanese court and was eventually sentenced to death. Before the case began Wahid fled the country and set up a new life in Bahrain. Police traced Wahid to the Gulf State in November 2009, where he had settled believing he would be safe from the British authorities. Detectives began the first ever extradition bid from Bahrain in British history and in August last year Wahid was arrested there. He remained 'indignant' and insisted he had never travelled to London in his life, but was trapped when officers produced matching fingerprints taken from the Marylebone flat. He told a Scotland Yard officer 'you are going to have to give me a big apology'. He was returned to the UK on September 8 last year, where he was arrested at the same airport where Miss Kama's body had been dumped. Legally aided Wahid, who has . had three firms of solicitors representing him, then sacked his . barrister as the trial got underway and refused to attend court so the . jury, unusually, did not hear prosecution or defence closing speeches. But Wahid, who has since . married and had two children, was in the dock as the Old Bailey jury . found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after just under . two-and-a-half-hours. Prosecutor Adrian Darbishire said: 'The long arm of Scotland Yard did not rest and leave matters there. 'Although years went by discreet efforts were made to keep tabs on Wahid because it was hoped that somehow, at some point, the opportunity might present itself where by he could be brought to a court in England to face the charge of murder committed in England.' Scientists were able to link Wahid's DNA to semen found inside the dead woman's body. Miss Kama, an aspiring cabaret singer and dancer, was described as a 'Holly-go-lightly' character who had come to London to launch a career in showbusiness. Mr Darbishire said: 'It is clear Fatima was a vivacious, attractive young woman, who had a number of admirers. 'She was a dancer and something of a night-owl. Some of her admirers were extremely rich and generous to her.' Miss Kama had rented the small flat from Wahid's younger brother. She spent much of her time in the company of wealthy Arab men at some the city's finest hotels, restaurants and clubs  but Wahid was 'neither . rich nor seemed attractive to Fatima Kama'. In a victim impact statement, Hasna . Ould, Miss Kama's mother, said that 'nothing has changed - it is as . though she died yesterday'. She said: 'At birthdays and other celebrations we are weeping. I have no more tears to shed. 'I do not even know why the murderer did this or how he manages to sleep at night without feeling sorry. 'You must impose the maximum sentence you can.'","Police battled for ten years to have Wahid extradited .

US banks have been engulfed by the meltdown in the eurozone, with the cost of insuring debt for Wall Street titans Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs rising to levels not seen since the height of the credit crisis in October 2008. 'Right now fear is trumping fundamentals and people are buying on nothing more than rumours,' said Mark Lamkin, head of Lamkin Wealth Management. 'It's not business risk that the market is concerned with, it's systemic risk. If there truly is a solution to Europe's problems, then we'll set the stage for a nice rally.' 'Europe is the centre point of all of this,' said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management. 'The big fear in the market is that company earnings are not sustainable and that Europe's problems are going to spread into the US banking system.' The recent levels of volatility provoked Morgan Stanley’s chief executive James Gorman into emailing staff on Monday morning to reassure them that ‘an enormous amount of confusion and misinformation’ was circulating about the bank and its possible vulnerability to the eurozone. Deutsche Bank, once seen as an impregnable bulwark of financial stability in Europe, yesterday issued a profit warning, blaming turbulent markets and bigger charges on Greek sovereign debt. It said it will write down another €250m of Greek debt in the third quarter of this year, on top of €155m in the second quarter, sending its shares down more than 6 per cent in early trading. The bank, which still expects to make a profit albeit lower than its original €10bn target, is to cut around 500 jobs at its corporate banking and securities division, with some staff to be shed in the City of London. Brussels-based Dexia was in perilous danger as it has around €4.8bn of loans to Greece.

Moody’s cut Italy’s status by three notches from Aa2 to A2 and warned further downgrades could follow. The ratings agency blamed a ‘material increase’ in borrowing costs for eurozone countries with high levels of debt. Silvio . Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, pictured, tried to brush off . the downgrade and said his country would hit its budget targets. Borrowing . costs in Italy have soared on doubts that Mr Berlusconi will be able to . push through harsh austerity measures to tackle the country’s debts. Further problems were also caused yesterday by the ongoing problems in Greece, which caused fear to tear through financial markets worldwide as European politicians again failed to agree a deal to prop up Greece’s bankrupt economy. The slump came as George Osborne joined other EU finance ministers for crisis talks in Luxembourg. In a highly unusual move, European ministers had sent their officials out of the room while they had a frank discussion on the deal. But they still failed to thrash out a deal that will satisfy the markets. A decision on whether or not to give Athens the next £7billion tranche of emergency funds, agreed under the first Greek bailout, was delayed until next month. Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the 17-nation group of Euro members, said that Greece can survive until mid-November before it receives the next tranche. The funds were initially expected to be released this month. But Mr Juncker indicated that the EU finance ministers are trying to revise the terms of the bailout deal they reached in July so that private banks now take a greater hit on Greek debt. This has been made worse as Greek civil servants were today staging a 24-hour strike, paralysing the public sector in a protest against deeper austerity measures as the government struggles to avoid a catastrophic default. Air traffic controllers joined the industrial action, grounding all flights to and from Greek airports. Strike: Civil servants across Greece are taking industrial action today, causing more problems for the country after its bailout was delayed last night . State hospitals were operating with emergency staff, while lawyers, school teachers and tax officers also joined the walkout. Public transport workers were holding work stoppages in the morning and evening, and demonstrations were planned later in the day. Civil servants are protesting over plans to suspend about 30,000 staff on partial pay, part of new cutbacks that come on top of salary and pension cuts. Greece is relying on international bailout loans to prevent default.","Major European markets are up today after Dow Jones dramatically rises following frantic final hour last night .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 1:07 PM on 4th October 2011 . A man who destroyed a cemetery with a JCB in a £15,000 wrecking spree while escaping from police has been jailed for four and a half years. Nottingham Crown Court was shown police helicopter footage of Steven Regan, 34, driving a JCB digger he had stolen from a Barratt Homes building site on July 2 this year. He was first spotted on CCTV driving the vehicle on the A60 in Church Warsop, near Mansfield, at a speed of between 15mph and 20mph, which prosecutor Jon Fountain said was fast for that type of machinery. Scroll down to see the video of the JCB rampage . Trail of destruction: Steven Regan drove the JCB through a cemetery, destroying several headstones . In a bid to avoid police officers he ploughed through hedges and fields into a park area and then into a cemetery. He lost control as he was driving on the main footpath through the cemetery and smashed into a number of headstones, destroying them in the process. The court heard he rammed the 100-year-old stone and wrought-iron cemetery gates three times in the digger in a bid to get out the other side. Regan, of Colenso Terrace in Leeds, was detained by officers on the road not far from the cemetery after the JCB came to a halt because of a deflated tyre. Mr Fountain said an estimated £15,000 of damage was caused in the cemetery. Catalogue of crime: Regan was paid to steal the vehicles for a criminal gang . Sentencing him today Judge Tony Mitchell described the JCB he was driving as a ‘ram rod’ and said he was behaving like a ‘man possessed’ as he tried to get away from police, actions which would have terrified people in the area. The judge said little defence could be offered for Regan's actions, which were part of a larger operation in which he was paid to steal the vehicles and deliver them to others. He told Regan: ‘You were but a pawn. You were part and parcel of what was quite clearly a sophisticated act of criminality by others and you know who those persons were. ‘You know who was paying you. You may not know everyone but about that aspect you said not a word.’ In a previous hearing at Nottingham Crown Court, Regan indicated he would plead guilty to the charges against him in relation to the JCB incident. Desperate: Regan smashed through hedgerows in a bid to evade the police . Today he formally entered guilty pleas to theft, dangerous driving, damaging property, driving without insurance and having no licence. He also pleaded guilty to burglary after he stole a Volvo mini digger and a JCB from a unit in Leeds in June. Regan asked the judge to take into consideration another 16 offences of similar thefts which he said he committed on various dates throughout 2010 and this year. Regan was jailed for a total of 54 months for all of the offences, half of which would be served in prison before he would be released on licence. For the driving offences he was disqualified for five years, after which he would have to pass an extended driving test before getting his licence back. Judith Walker, chief crown prosecutor at the East Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said Regan's case was unusual and indicated a degree of organisation and sophistication in relation to the theft of commercial plant machinery. She added: ‘A further aggravating feature of this case was the reckless behaviour of the defendant who sought to escape arrest in a very large JCB, causing extensive damage to the historic gates on the local cemetery and to gravestones, which caused anguish and distress to families. ‘It is extremely fortunate that no-one was injured during this incident and the lengthy prison sentence reflects the seriousness of this defendant's actions.’",Steven Regan destroyed swathes of village as he avoided arrest .

First lady Michelle Obama displayed her skills in New York on Friday as she played doubles against Serena Williams, clocked a 55-mph serve and did some hula-hooping in her first visit to the U.S. Open. Dressed in a fitted white jacket and black workout pants, she also spoke to a group of local youngsters as part of her Let's Move campaign against childhood obesity. 'I'm not really good or anything like that. That's the beauty of tennis,' she said. First Lady Michelle Obama downplayed her tennis skills as she hit balls at the U.S. Open, but it was clear she takes the recreational game seriously . Mrs Obama was in New York to promote her Let's Move campaign, which encourages physical activity . 'You don't have to be good to enjoy it. I love the game, and my skills are very questionable.' Obama then joined the kids in a tennis video game, table tennis and other activities at an indoor facility at Flushing Meadows designed to get young players excited about the sport. Obama and a pint-sized partner played doubles against seven-time Grand Slam winner John McEnroe, who gave her some volley pointers. Mrs Obama was joined by Malivai Washington, Billie Jean King, James Blake, Serena Williams and Katrina Adams for the Let's Move event . The First Lady showed off a lighter side as she goofed around for the youngsters and showed off her hula hooping skills for the crowd . Williams, a 13-time major champ who advanced to the Open semifinals Thursday, rolled in after about 45 minutes and took over as Obama's doubles opponent. 'I've been trying to get to the U.S. Open my entire life,' Obama said. Joined by former and current players Billie Jean King, James Blake and Katrina Adams, Obama recalled that she didn't get into tennis until after law school because there were few courts where she grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Obama praised the U.S. Tennis . Association's efforts to build kid-sized courts around the country and . recruit more youngsters to the game. After changing out of her tennis gear, Mrs Obama was briefly joined by daughter Malia, right, as she watched John Isner of the US play Andy Murray of Great Britain . She was later joined by Sasha, who sat her mother's lap after finding a seat in the shade . Now she hopes she and her daughters will still be playing when they're in their 90s. 'That's one of the reasons why I introduced the sport to my kids early on, because it's great for kids because it gets you moving,' she said. 'I know people in their 90s that are still playing tennis, and I want to be one of those people. 'It's a sport you can do forever,' Obama said. Mrs Obama was very into the first sets, which American John Isner lost . She and daughter Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10, along with some of the children she's spoken to, then took in the Andy Murray-John Isner quarterfinal match at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The American Isner lost to Brit Murray. Malia, a middle school student at Sidwell Friends in Washington DC, didn't stay with her mother throughout the match, however, staying away from public view. But younger daughter Sasha, 10, took a comfortable seat in her mother's lap partway through.

Citibank made sure to draw attention last week to its lack of fees for using debit cards after news broke that its biggest competitor would start charging them. But at the same time, the bank was letting its customers know they'll soon have to meet stricter requirements to avoid monthly checking account charges. The main changes will be seen by customers with mid-tier checking accounts, which offer the potential for earning interest and a few other perks. Starting in December, Citi will charge $20 a month on these accounts, unless the customer has combined balances of $15,000 or more in checking, savings and investment accounts or loan balances. New fees: Starting in December, Citi will charge $20 a month on mid-tier checking accounts . The fee was previously waived for . combined balances of $6,000 for that level of account, which offers . perks such as interest-bearing checking. Customers also pay $2 fees for using non-Citi ATMs if they don't meet the balance requirement. For Citi customers who used a product . called 'EZ Checking,' which is being phased out, the change is more . dramatic. For the past year EZ accountholders were able to avoid fees if . they had combined balances of $1,500. If they didn't have that much, . the fee was $7.50 or $9.50 a month, depending on their state. Before . that, those customers were able to avoid fees with a combination of . direct deposit and online bill paying. Customers who can't meet the . requirements may find it necessary to switch to Citi's basic checking . account. The bank last month raised the monthly fee on that account to . $10 from $8, unless customers maintain $1,500 in combined balances, or . use both direct deposit and online bill payment at least once per month. Customers have two months to decide how . to respond to the changes. The fees will start being charged in December . and will appear on January statements. In some cases, avoiding fees may be as simple as linking accounts together. Way out: Customers can avoid the fees by having combined balances of $15,000 or more in checking, savings and investment accounts or loan balances . That's because the combined balance . requirement includes not just deposit accounts, such as savings, . certificates of deposit and IRAs, but also credit cards and loans - . where the amount owed is counted as the balance. 'If you just have your . mortgage with Citibank you're pretty much there,' said Steve Troutner, . Citi's head of U.S. consumer banking products. That reflects a broader effort in the banking industry to try to get more customers to open multiple accounts at one bank. Citi's move comes a few days after Bank . of America Corp said it will be charging $5 per month for using debit . cards starting next year. Other banks have also been testing such fees. Citi is highlighting the fact that it's not charging monthly debit fees . or fees for using online bill pay. However, it did cut back on its debit . rewards program. Last month Citi said it will no longer give rewards . points for debit card transactions. That stemmed, in part, from changes . in federal regulations that cut roughly in half the amount banks could . charge retailers for processing purchases made on debit cards, a rule . that's cutting sharply into bank revenue. Citi's latest changes to its program . include tweaks for how many points customers are awarded for direct . deposits and other banking activity.","Mid-tier checking accounts will see main changes .

Kim Han-sol appears just like any other teenager. He enjoys experimenting with his hair, making friends with girls and even has a fondness for romantic comedies. We know this because, the grandson of North Korea's Dear Leader has joined Facebook. So while the oppressed regime he left is denied even a telephone exchange - let alone the internet - he is enjoying the trappings of the world's most popular social network.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:06 PM on 3rd October 2011 . Veteran broadcaster and America's leading grumpy old man Andy Rooney delivered his final weekly essay on Sunday after 33 years of appearances on the CBS show 60 Minutes. He began his weekly show 'A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney' in 1978 at the age of 59 after years working behind the scenes as a writer for TV and radio. In his 1097th and final essay he described himself not as a 'television personality,' but as 'a writer who reads what he's written.' Scroll down for video . Signing off: Veteran broadcaster Andy Rooney delivers his final essay for CBS's 60 Minutes at the age of 92 . He said: 'This is a moment I have dreaded. 'I wish I could do this forever. But I can't. But I'm not retiring. Writers don't retire, and I'll always be a writer. 'A writer's job is to tell the truth. I . know I've been terribly wrong sometimes, but I think I've been right . more than I've been wrong.' Rooney said he has lived a lucky life, luckier than most. But befitting his trademark crotchety nature, he voiced one parting complaint: He doesn't like being famous, nor does he like being bothered by fans. 'I spent my first 50 years trying to become well known as a writer, and the next 30 trying to avoid being famous,' he said. 'I walk down the street now or go to a football game and people shout, ""Hey, Andy!"" And I hate that.' So if you see him in a restaurant, Rooney said as he signed off, 'please, just let me eat my dinner.' CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager paid tribute to his long career saying: 'There's nobody like Andy, and there never will be. He'll hate hearing this, but he's an American original.' Rooney had been a contributor to 60 Minutes since the show's debut. During its first season in 1968 he appeared a few times in silhouette with Palmer Williams, 60 Minutes senior producer, in a short-lived segment called Ipso and Facto. He joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts, a hit show of that day and also wrote for The Garry Moore Show (1959-65), a popular variety show. Impressive: Rooney's career as a writer for CBS began in 1949 . At the same time, he was writing for CBS News public-affairs broadcasts such as The Twentieth Century and Calendar. His skills as a writer and producer, not as the talking head he famously became later in life, were the roles he said he always valued most. 'I obviously have a knack for getting . on paper what a lot of people have thought and didn't realize they . thought,' he reflected during an interview in 1998. 'And they say, ""Hey, . yeah!"" And they like that.' Before . Rooney delivered his final essay, Morley Safer - himself an 89-year-old . journalist and a 60 Minutes staple since 1970 - interviewed Rooney . about his personal and professional life. Rooney . admitted that he doesn't sign autographs and rarely responds to fan . mail, telling Safer he didn't 'want to answer an idiot who would have . the bad sense to write me a letter.' Rooney has also engendered controversy, such as his weeks-long suspension in 1990 for remarks that offended some gay viewers. Long time coming: Rooney delivered his first essay on 60 Minutes in 1978 at the age of 59 . But he's better known for his sharp commentaries and public persona as someone fed up with everything from desk clutter to chocolate chip cookies to door knobs. In his time at 60 Minutes, Rooney has also contributed many deeper pieces in the wake of events like the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the shock and awe campaign to start the 2003 Iraq war -- a phrase he scathingly said 'makes us look like foolish braggarts'. Safer described his longtime colleague as 'America's favorite grouch-in-chief', saying Rooney used his 'loud whiny voice ... speaking up for citizens fed up with everything'. 'There have been many curmudgeons on television over its long history,' Safer said affectionately. 'None has been so long serving in that role as Mr. Rooney.'",Broadcaster has delivered weekly essays on CBS for 33 years .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 1:59 PM on 16th September 2011 . Down to work: Helle Thorning-Schmidt arrives at the Danish parliament this morning . Neil Kinnock is finally getting a taste of leading a country - after his daughter-in-law swept to victory to become Denmark's first female Prime Minister. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, dubbed a 'Gucci diva' for her penchant for designer clothes, led a 'Red bloc' of parties to oust centre-right Lars Loekke Rasmussen from office. It came despite allegations, published days before the election, that saw her forced to dismiss rumours she had separated from her husband and that he was gay. She now begins the tricky task of . piecing together a centre-Left government - to deal with the country's . growing economic crisis. Celebrating with supporters in the early hours of this morning, the 44-year-old, who married the former Labour leader's son Stephen in 1996, said: 'We did it. Today is a day of change. 'Make no mistake: We have written history. Today there's a change of guards in Denmark.' It followed a speech from Ramussen, who said: 'There is no parliamentary support for our government. 'So tonight I hand over the keys to the prime minister's office to Helle Thorning-Schmidt. And dear Helle, take good care of them. You're only borrowing them.' Her father-in-law famously lost to John Major's Conservatives in the 1992 general election after leading the polls for months. While . he blamed sustained personal attacks on him by the press, critics said . voters were turned off by Labour’s tax plans and his premature triumphalism at a Sheffield party rally. There had been fears that his son's wife could suffer from the same 'Kinnock curse' in the lead-up to polling day. But Social Democrat Thorning-Schmidt's 'Red bloc' won a slim majority of five seats in Denmark's 179-seat parliament. Turnout was a high 87.7 per cent. The Social Democrat leader is embraced by a supporter after claiming victory in the parliamentary election . Victorious: Thorning-Schmidt waves to supporters, alongside her husband Stephen Kinnock, after winning the election. Allegations had been published earlier in the week about his sexuality . She said she would start government . formation talks today with the Social Liberals, the left-wing Socialist . People's Party and the far-left party, the Red-Green Alliance. She is not likely to make any major changes, but has promised to overhaul a system of beefed-up customs controls at borders with Germany and Sweden. Critics have said they violate the spirit of EU agreements on the free movement of people and goods. She is also expected to roll back some of the austerity measures introduced amid Europe's debt crisis, campaigning on a platform of tax rises and increased public spending. She has also advocated making everyone work 12 minutes more per day to boost the country's productivity, Reuters news agency reports. An extra hour of productivity each week, the Social Democrats argue, would help kick-start growth. The economic crisis has turned Denmark's healthy surpluses into deficits, estimated to climb to 4.6 per cent of GDP next year. Local banks have also been struggling, with nine taken over by the state since the start of the crisis in 2008. Ms Thorning-Schmidt has accused Mr Rasmussen of failing to spur growth and allowing the deficit to grow. The victory comes four years after her party slumped to their worst result in a century, with just 25.5 per cent of the votes. Outgoing prime minister was set to tender his formal resignation today, opening the way for Social Democrat Ms Thorning-Schmidt to try to form a government . Supporters of the Social Democrats celebrate the end of a decade in opposition . As leader, she said: 'Danes need more time before they hand over responsibility to us.' Thorning-Schmidt gained a master's . degree in political science from Copenhagen University in 1994. Two . years later, she married Stephen Kinnock, whom she met in Belgium. She lives with their two daughters, Johanna, 14, and Camilla, 11, in northern Copenhagen, while Kinnock is based in Switzerland as a director of the World Economic Forum. The couple hit the headlines last week after two Danish newspapers published, in the days before the election, details of alleged problems with her marriage. A Swedish newspaper, Expressen, also questioned Mr Kinnock’s sexuality. Her relationship with Mr Kinnock had . been a subject of speculation for some time, with whispers fuelled by . the fact he spends most of the year living and working in another . country. But . Thorning-Schmidt responded by saying: 'I can only say it is not true. It . is very unpleasant that newspapers print such rumours and I am also . sorry that generally there are these rumours about politicians. 'It’s really uncomfortable, also for my family and my children. It’s so grotesque.' The couple also faced criticism last August when they were accused of trying to avoid paying the country’s high taxes. Mr . Kinnock, a director of the World Economic Fund, pays income tax on his . £110,000 salary in Switzerland, where tax rates are much lower than in . Denmark.

A mentally disturbed man on the run since apparently killing his elderly grandmother two days ago has been caught, the FBI has said. Sheldon Bernard Chase, 22, was arrested in Spokane, Washington, following the shootings at the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana, in which two others were also killed. Chase is suspected of opening fire with a rifle on Tuesday afternoon to kill his grandmother, Gloria Sarah Goes Ahead Cummins, 80, his cousin, 21-year-old Levon Driftwood, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Rueben Jefferson. The arrest follows a day-long search in which police, game wardens and tribal authorities combed county roads looking for Chase. Schools on reservations in southeastern Montana and western North Dakota were closed and residents stayed indoors for safety during the search. Eric Barnhart, FBI supervisor in Billings, said that investigators are attempting to piece together what led to the shooting. 'At this point, we still don't know,' he said, declining to release any details about the arrest. 'With some history of mental illness, that's an X factor.' The shootings happened at Cummins's home about 10 miles outside Lodge Grass, a town of 500 people near the Wyoming border. Tragic: Police remove a body from the house where three Indian people were shot dead in Lodge Grass, Montana . Officers remove another body from the property after the shooting on Tuesday . It is a few miles south of the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument - the . site which marks the spot where Lieutenant Colonel George . Armstrong Custer and his cavalry unit died fighting Indian forces in . 1876. Chase lives with his uncle in a mobile home about 30 metres from the modest log house, city clerk Cody Not Afraid said. Police tape stretched across Cummins's property yesterday and Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officers kept onlookers from approaching. It was unclear what led to the shootings or how Chase was identified as a suspect. Earlier yesterday, Barnhart had said that authorities considered Chase to be armed and extremely dangerous. People in Lodge Grass described the victims and the suspect as coming from a prominent, well-respected family in the community. Chase moved there about a year ago from North Dakota, where he had grown up, and was attending Little Bighorn College about 20 miles away in Crow Agency, said Reverend Jim Antoine, the priest at Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church. Crow Tribal Chairman Black Eagle said: 'I don't know him. He is not a tribal member, but his mother is a tribal member. His father is from North Dakota. That's all I know. 'We are doing as well as we can trying to comprehend what happened today. 'We have been deeply affected and have asked Indian Health Services to provide grief counselling for this tragedy.' Chairman Black Eagle added in a . statement on his Facebook page on Tuesday: 'In the coming days we need . to pull together even tighter as a community and support these families . in every way possible.'",22-year-old allegedly gunned down victims just miles from site of Custer's last stand .
"By . Chris Slack . Last updated at 8:12 AM on 6th October 2011 . Former England cricket star Graham Dilley has died at the age of 52 after a short battle with cancer. Dilley, who played 41 tests and took 138 wickets, will always be remembered for his heroics alongside Ian Botham and Bob Willis in the 1981 Ashes Test at Headingley. The fast bowler helped Botham add 117 runs for the eighth-wicket as England turned around a seemingly impossible position to win the match by 18 runs. Finest hour: Graham Dilley flees the pitch after England win the 1981 Ashes test at Headingley. Dilley, who has died aged 52, played a vital part in the victory . Today Botham, who scored 149not out in the innings, was one of a host of stars to pay tribute to the former Kent and Worcestershire player. Sir Ian told Sky Sports News of his shock at hearing of his friend's death. He said: 'We only heard a few days ago how ill Graham was. 'They were saying it was very serious and they were talking maybe two weeks and he's gone in less than two days. 'We're all shocked that this can happen to someone who's 52. Very shocked.' 'I've got so many fond memories of him. He ran in to bowl in the Caribbean, first ball, and the heel fell off his boot. 'Typical . Graham he's only brought one pair with him on an England tour so there . was panic there, but he was a fantastic cricketer who had a lot of . talent. 'He was plagued with injuries, his neck and knees, which . probably stopped him playing a lot more for England, but on his day he . was the best. Great friends: Graham Dilley, right, holds a beer alongside John Emburey, left, and Ian Botham following England's victory in the first test of the 1986/7 Ashes series . 'I had a lot of great times with him. He had a great sense of humour, he always wanted to be part of the party and join in. 'He . was a good bloke to be around. He was quite quiet and reserved until . you got to know him, he wasn't a great social person until you got to . know him, but then he was the life and soul of the party. 'It's a very sad day.' At his best: Dilley bowls in a test match in Australia. Tributes have been paid to him by current and former England stars following his passing . Following his retirement from cricket, Dilley, who played international cricket for ten years and also won the Ashes Down Under in 1986-87 became an assistant coach to the England team. Two of England's current side paid . tribute, with paceman Stuart Broad writing on Twitter: 'Very sad to hear . about Graham Dilley. Wonderful fast bowler and lovely man. 52 is too . young. RIP' Kevin Pietersen added on the site: . 'What an amazing guy Graham Dilley was.. Always smiling & always . helping spread his knowledge about our great game. RIP Dill!!! Sad day.' Senior figures at the England and Wales Cricket Board also paid tribute. ECB chief executive David Collier said: 'Graham made a lifelong contribution . to the game of cricket at all levels, and we are deeply saddened by the . sad news this morning. 'He will be fondly remembered for his contributions, both as a player and a coach. 'Few will forget his contribution . during the historic Ashes win at Headingley in 1981 and the part he . played in two Ashes series victories. 'Graham will be sadly missed by all his friends throughout cricket, and ECB send our deepest condolences to Graham's family. Huge impact: Tributes were also paid to Dilley's methods as a coach, which helped bring through stars such as Monty Panesar . ECB managing director Hugh Morris added: 'This is very sad news for Graham's many friends and colleagues in cricket, both in this country and overseas. 'As well as being a bowler of the highest class, Graham made an immense contribution to our game as a coach - and his ability to impart his knowledge and wisdom to future generations of young cricketers will be sorely missed.' As well as his stints on the England staff, Dilley was a Loughborough MCC Universities coach and helped the likes of Monty Panesar emerge as international class. MCC head of cricket John Stephenson, was also appreciative of Dilley's work as a coach . He said: 'I'm extremely sad to hear of Graham's death. 'He was a world-class bowler who I played against many times and he became a very good friend. 'As a coach, he made a huge impact as part of the MCC Universities programme; he was central to the progress made at Loughborough over the last decade and he will be much missed by all of us at the club.'",Sir Ian Botham leads tributes to fast bowler .
"By . Chris Slack . Last updated at 8:01 PM on 4th October 2011 . A pharmacist who bludgeoned a defenceless pensioner to death with a crucifix in a violent and drunken attack has been jailed for life. Karen Walsh, 45, from Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland launched the attack on her elderly 81-year-old neighbour Maire Rankin on Christmas Day 2008. She tore clumps of hair from her head and inflicted head injuries and . broken ribs on her victim, while a crown of thorns left a distinctive bruise on her chin. Guilty: Karen Walsh, left, has been jailed for life after being convicted of the murder and sexual assault of Maire Rankin, 81, on Christmas Day 2008 . Following the sustained assault Walsh then sexually assaulted Mrs Maire Rankin, 81, before fleeing to her home at the house next door. A jury at Belfast Crown Court found her guilty with a unanimous verdict after retiring for just under two hours at the end of the trial. Following the verdict, Mr Justice Anthony Hart warned Walsh she would serve a lengthy sentence. 'Whatever happened on that night, this was a brutal attack on an elderly and defenceless woman,' he said. As Walsh was led away ashen-faced she turned and told the judge: 'I am totally innocent.' Weapon: Walsh used this crucifix to attack Mrs Rankin, with DNA evidence found on it helping to convict the killer . Broken: Walsh's attack was so frenzied that the body of Jesus on the crucifix snapped . Speaking outside court, the victim's daughter, Emily Rankin, said her mother was a kind and caring person who spent her life helping people. 'She had the right to feel secure in her own home but because of . her trusting nature and kindness, she was subjected to a frenzied . assault and a horrific murder. 'She died alone - and frightened.' Earlier the court had heard that Walsh had admitted visiting her neighbour's home on Christmas Eve to take her a bottle of vodka as a present but she claimed that when she left she was still alive. A detective told the trial she spoke to Walsh on Christmas morning when she discovered she had been with the victim the previous evening. Tribute: Mrs Rankin's daughter Emily said outside the court that her mother was a kind and caring person who spent her life helping people . She said Walsh asked whether Ms Rankin had been beaten and whether the door of her house had been open. Another police officer told the court that when she was arrested on December 27 2008, the accused had replied: 'I can't believe this. It is bizarre.' A DNA expert also told the murder trial that the chances of DNA on the victim's chin coming from someone other than the killer was one in a billion. DNA which could have come from the accused was also found on the pensioner's breasts and on the bottom of the crucifix. According to Northern Ireland's state pathologist, Ms Rankin had bruising on her chin consistent with a crown of thorns, like that on Jesus' head. Professor Jack Crane said considerable force had been used to cause extensive bruising to the face and scalp and that Ms Rankin had been subjected to a series of punches or blows with a blunt instrument. The pensioner also suffered 15 broken ribs, which Prof Crane said may have been caused after death and said there was evidence of injuries indicating a sexual assault. Praise: Detective Inspector John Caldwell paid tribute to the victim's family outside court after the verdict . Following the verdict, Police Service of Northern Ireland Detective Inspector John Caldwell paid tribute to the victim's family. 'They have lost Maire's company because of the terrible and depraved action of someone they trusted as a neighbour,' he said. He added that she deserved to live in safety. 'For the last three years Karen Walsh has told lies. Today the jury saw through the lies and convicted her of murder,' he added.","Judge tells Karen Walsh she will receive a 'lengthy sentence'

"By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 3:43 PM on 3rd October 2011 . A blind man was twice banned from buying goods in a sports store because his disability meant he was unable to use the chip and pin pad. Peter Cotterill, who has been blind since he was 10, has vowed to take action against retailer Sports Direct after he was prevented from using his debit card to shop there. On two occasions the 44-year-old factory worker asked to make his payment by giving his signature, as allowed by his bank. But he was refused and told he must enter his pin because of 'company policy'. Refused: Peter Cotterill, who is registered blind and cannot use chip and pin was not allowed to sign for purchases in Sports Direct in the Merseyway shopping centre, Stockport . Mr Cotterill, from New Mills, Derbyshire, initially went to a branch in Stockport to buy a T-shirt for £7. Despite never experiencing any problems signing for his card before, staff refused to accept it and he was told to pay with cash instead. Mr Cotterill complained to the company and got a letter of apology which assured him they would re-train their staff accordingly. But when he went back to buy a T-shirt and a vest for £12, staff again refused to accept his signature - with the manager telling him they 'couldn't accept' his form of payment. Mr Cotterill who is seeking damages from the company said: 'What they are doing is pure disability discrimination against the blind, . 'I have an arrangement with my bank to give my signature on a debit card payment and I never have a problem anywhere else. 'But these people said it was company policy that signatures were not allowed and they needed me to put in my pin number. 'Their attitude made me feel really stupid because there were loads of people behind me in the queue at the shop and they probably thought I don't have any money in the bank. Mr Cotterill who suffers from a genetic . condition, said that he has never encountered problems with signing . against a card payment before. He said: 'In my whole adult life this has never happened in any other shop, but it's happened twice in Sports Direct, . 'The . first time they wouldn't accept my card payment, this was in May of . last year. It was the same thing, they said they couldn't accept my . signature. 'Sports Direct said they were going to address the matter and give the staff more training, and that it wouldn't happen again.' No change: Despite receiving a letter of apology from Sports Direct which said staff would receive extra training the incident happened again . In a letter from Sports Direct in September 2010, a manager said: 'Like all other UK retailers we stopped generally accepting sign for cards over two years ago with the introduction of chip and pin. 'We do understand however that there are always going to be some exceptions. 'Following your letter we have instigated further training in the store in respect to till procedures and I'm sure when you return to the store they will be happy to assist.' However earlier this month Mr Cotterill was again shopping for sports equipment in the Sports Direct and was again refused his standard method of payment. When he asked to speak to a manager he was told it was company policy and was handed a customer complaints form . Glynis Howard rehabilitation services manager at blind persons charity Henshaws said: 'The issue with a keypad is they are all slightly different because of that it means learning a hundred different keypads. 'I would say Sports Direct is definitely being discriminator. Under the Disability Discrimination Act it should look at ways of making things more accessible.' A spokesman for RNIB said: 'RNIB believes it is a reasonable adjustment under the Equality Act that stores allow their blind and partially sighted customers the option of using chip and signature.' Sports Direct, who made a profit of £89.2m last year, were unavailable for comment.","Store twice turned away Peter Cotterill, 44, when he tried to sign for his goods .

"Northumbria Police chief constable Sue Sim says jibes would not have been made if she was a ‘short fat man' She was compared to Margaret Beckett and to Wallace and Gromit character Lady Tottington . By . Anna Edwards . Last updated at 6:34 PM on 14th September 2011 . Under attack: Sue Sim's hair and makeup were mocked . The police officer who was taunted for looking like Margaret Beckett and a Wallace and Gromit character has hit back at the sexist jokes made at her expense as she led the Raoul Moat manhunt. Northumbria Police chief constable Sue Sim said she found the comments about her hair and makeup hurtful and doubted they would have been made if she was a 'short, fat man'. Speaking yesterday at the North East Women Leaders' conference in Newcastle she said the hurtful jibes had tarnished the most important moment of her career, while she sought to track down the killer. 'It was quite hurtful to read what . the media said about my hair and make-up, and them making comparisons . with Margaret Beckett,' she said. 'I can't imagine that they would have done the same if I was a short fat man.' While Ms Sim was holding public appeals . and interviews during the gunman's rampage, she was showered with cruel . jokes, frequently appearing on the front pages of national newspapers . alongside snide remarks about her appearance. She . was compared to Labour MP and former foreign secretary Margaret . Beckett, and Lady Totting from the Wallace and Gromit film Curse of the . Were-Rabbit. Ms Sim told the audience of local . female sixth-form students how, despite the barrage of sexist comment, she . knew she just had to 'get on with it'. At six foot tall, the chief constable towers over a number of her male colleagues and is used to standing her ground. She . said: 'I work in a male dominated environment, so there have been . obstacles simply because I'm a woman, but it also helps that I'm a six . foot woman, so that makes it easier to stand my ground. 'But I had an important job to and I had to get on with it.' The event at Newcastle Business . School brought together successful women from industry, the arts and the . community to inspire female sixth formers from around the region. Ms Sim said comments that compared her to Lady Tottington (right) and Margaret Beckett were hurtful . While Ms Sim led the manhunt for Raoul Moat, the officer leading the operation was mocked about her make up . The . police chief led the manhunt which ended in violent Moat shooting . himself after a standoff with police officers who tried to negotiate . with him in July last year. During the operation, which began on . July 3 after Moat killed the boyfriend of his former girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, people went online to mock the chief constable's wavy hair . and features. But Ms Sim told the young women that she had to shake off the ridicule and focus on her job, rather than the hurtful criticism. She said: 'It is your responsibility and your choice to make sure you do what you want to do. 'You have to be able to promote yourself, be confident in your own abilities and you have to be prepared to say ""yes"".' 500 sixth formers from schools across the North East were invited to attend the event. Lauren Timmins, 16, from Burnside Business and Enterprise College in Wallsend, said: 'I feel more confident about my future after listening to the women speak here. 'It's been really interesting and very inspiring.'","Northumbria Police chief constable Sue Sim says jibes would not have been made if she was a ‘short fat man'

A nurse swindled £40,000 from the taxpayer by claiming to be a homeless mother-of-nine to get a second council house. Mary Otim already had a family sized home in Wolverhampton when she applied for and was given a £300,000 property in Harrow, north London. She then moved into the home in Harrow and rented her second Wolverhampton address to her adult children for four years before being caught out. The deception only came to light after . data from the two councils' was cross referenced by the National Fraud . Initiative. Today the 53-year-old was given a . nine month . suspended sentence for obtaining services by deception after Harrow . Crown Court heard her youngest daughter was just 16 years old. Judge Vivian Rose said: . 'Although I am sure your offence is . sufficiently serious to warrant a custodial sentence, I am prepared to . suspend the sentence in this case because of your personal . circumstances. The court heard Otim, who only . has three of her nine children living with her, dodged £40,000 in rent . when she was handed a £300,000 three-bedroom property in Chandos . Crescent, Harrow, a year after she secretly signed the lease on a . family-sized home in Wolverhampton. Otim, who pleaded guilty at an earlier . hearing, gave the Wolverhampton home to her adult children, who were . all working, at a vastly subsidized rate. She then continued to visit Wolverhampton to fool housing officers that she was living there. Judge Rose said: 'I have no doubt that you knew that what you were doing was wrong and dishonest. Suspended sentence: Nurse Mary Otim escaped jail for falsely claiming £40,000 at Harrow Crown Court . 'You allowed Harrow Council to keep treating you as homeless and considering you a priority for a large house in Harrow. 'This carried on for a period of almost four years and there were several occasions when you could have put the matters right but you failed on each occasion to do so. 'Benefit fraud is never a victimless crime and by your actions you have prevented another family who were genuinely entitled to a property from being housed.' The court heard Otim was first assessed to be homeless by Harrow Council in 1997 when she was placed on the housing waiting list and housed in temporary accommodation at a cost of £80,000 per year. She then went behind Harrow Council's back to register as homeless in Wolverhampton in 2005, claiming she was a single mother with nine dependents. She was offered a property in Guy Avenue, Wolverhampton, in September 2005 - meaning she should have been removed from her temporary accommodation in Harrow and taken off the housing list. Instead she was offered a three-bedroom property in Chandos Crescent in 2006, where she still lives with three of her children, the youngest of which is 16. Prosecutor Dickon Edwards said: 'Housing is extremely scarce and is at a premium. Especially scarce are those large houses such as that given to Mrs Otim. They are intended for those at their lowest ebb and particularly vulnerable. 'Added to the cost of the benefit there is also the cost of housing Mrs Otim in temporary accommodation while she had a secure property - estimated at £80,000 a year.' Defence barrister Claire Robinson said Otim was extremely devastated to have been suspended from her job and risk losing her home. She added that she had been put under pressure to apply for the second home by her older children, who wanted the benefit of cheaper rent. Otim, who has been suspended from her job at West London Mental Health hospital in Ealing, where she is being sponsored to study for a degree, is waiting to hear whether she will be allowed to keep her home in Harrow. Speaking outside court, the 53-year-old said: 'I have to accept what the judge has said. It has been a very stressful time and I have been worried about the outcome.","Mary Otim, 53, handed a suspended sentence for obtaining services by deception ."
"By . Tom Kelly . Last updated at 11:39 AM on 5th October 2011 . Roman Abramovich believed it was his ‘moral obligation’ to hand fellow Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky £1.3billion to fund his lavish lifestyle, a court heard today. The Chelsea owner gave his former friend the cash because he felt it was part of the ‘code of honour’ that had replaced the rule of law in Russia after the collapse of communism, it was alleged. Mr Abramovich had used the well-connected Mr Berezovsky as his ‘political godfather’ to help him conduct business deals in a country where police were ‘corrupt’ and courts ‘open to manipulation, the High Court was told. Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, left, arrives at the High Court in London followed by Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, right . The money he paid Mr Berezovsky . funded the 65-year-old’s exuberant expenses which included ‘palaces in . France, private aircraft, jewels for his girlfriends, valuable painting . at Sotheby's,’ it was claimed. The allegations were made at the . second day of the extraordinary legal battle between the two Russian . oligarchs which is costing an estimated £50 per second. Mr Berezovsky is suing his former . friend Mr Abramovich for £3.2billion claiming he ‘betrayed and . blackmailed’ him over the sale of shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft . and intimidated him into getting rid of them at a fraction of their . value. Jonathan Sumption QC for Mr . Abramovich today told the court that the claims of bullying were ‘wholly . unfounded’ and that Mr Berezovsky had never been had never been the . registered owner of shares in Sibneft. Abramovich, center, arrives at court with his legal team and entourage ahead of day two of the hearing . Reporters crowd round Boris Berezovsky who is claiming Mr Abramovich 'intimidated' him into selling shares in Russian oil company Sibneft at a fraction of their value . But he said that Mr Abramovich . accepted he owed Mr Berezovsky ‘a debt of honour’ for using his . political influence to allow him to get control of the oil company, . which is why he gave him the money. Mr Abramovich required a ‘political . godfather’ because of the ‘quite extraordinary conditions’ in Russia . following the fall of the communist regime in 1992, the QC said. He chose Mr Berezovsky because he had . a ‘close relationship’ with people in the ‘immediate circle’ of then . Russian president Boris Yeltsin. ‘Mr Berezovsky was a power broker, he . turned from business to political purely because of the difficulties of . running a business without power,’ Mr Sumption said. ‘For substantial cash payments, Mr Abramovich and Sibneft would enjoy Mr Berezovsky's political patronage.’ He said  Mr Yeltsin agreed to the ‘corrupt deal’ in return for the backing of Mr Berezovksy's powerful media empire. Turning point: It is alleged Mr Abramovich betrayed Mr Berezovsky after the latter fell out of favour with political leaders at the Kremlin, then led by President Vladimir Putin (above) Mr Sumption said that, without Mr Berezovsky's ‘considerable influence’, Mr Abramovich ’would have got nowhere’. But the QC said that Mr Berezovsky . kept demanding more after brokering the deal and by the end of the 1990s . expected all his personal expenses to be met by Mr Abramovich's . companies. ‘He sought what he could get . As Sibneft prospered Mr Berezovsky demanded more.’ Laurence Rabinowitz QC, for Mr . Berezovsky, earlier told the court that his client had been ‘betrayed’ by Mr Abramovich after falling out with Russian political leaders and . leaving Russia in 2000 when Vladimir Putin became president. Accused: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich arrives at the High Court with his entourage for the start of the case against Boris Berezovsky yesterday . But Mr Sumption said Mr Berezovsky . had made ‘scurrilous... and unjustified allegations of criminal and . improper conduct on the part of Mr Abramovich’. Mr Abramovich, who is currently said . to be worth £10.3billion, sold Sibneft to Russia’s state-owned gas . monopoly six years ago in a multi-billion pound deal. His lawyer denied he was ever a close friend of Mr Berezovsky but said there had been an ‘emotional bond’ between the pair. The hearing continues..

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 8:19 AM on 6th October 2011 . Conscience: Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, who conducted the Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, says the jailing of Knox was political . The judge who cleared Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito has spoken of how he and the jury reached their verdict by 'following their conscience.' In an unusual move judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, 68, gave an interview to a local newspaper in which he explained why Knox, 24, and Sollecito, 27, were declared not guilty after more than ten hours of deliberations. Judge Hellmann, who has been a judge for more than 40 years, also added that he felt their was a 'political background' as to why the American - who has returned home amid amazing scenes - had been kept in jail. Speaking to La Nazione at the end of the ten month appeal in Perugia he said:'I'm a little bit tired but I managed to survive and that's one important thing. 'I had an optimum jury and a optimum assistant judge (Massimo Zanetti) and we reached the verdict by following our conscience. 'This was a difficult case, controversial but we did what was in our conscience.' When asked about bitter criticism of the verdict from prosecutors Giuliano Mignini and Manuela Comodi, who called it a 'massive mistake' judge Hellman replied:'I don't know about that. 'They will read the sentence and they can make their valuations.' Not guilty: Amanda Knox reacts as she is set free after four years in jail . Judge Hellmann will release his 'motivations for sentence' within three months and this will explain in detail why he and the jury decided to release Knox and Sollecito from their 26 and 25 years jail sentences. It will be examined closely by the prosecution in Perugia who have already said they plan to appeal and take the case to the Supreme Court in Rome and they have 45 days from when judge Hellmann releases his report to file a request. Any potential hearing would not take place until late next year and Knox and Sollecito do not have to attend - the decision will be based solely on documentation from the case to see if procedure was correctly followed. Judge Hellmann added:'I went to bed serene, that's for sure but I didn't sleep very much as I was so tired, it was a late night.' Then speaking of the booing and jeering that accompanied the verdict by a crowd who had gathered outside the court he said:'There was too much tension. Decision: Judge Hellmann reads out the verdict, which will be released in full in three months . 'There was too much attention on this case and that was because of the excessive media interest. People got fired up. That's why I said what I did (before retiring) that it was not a football match and I didn't want cheering. 'Instead well...too much was made out if it. Then there is the political background, many wanted Amanda in prison because she was American.' Meanwhile it also emerged today that police and prosecutors had no intention of reopening the investigation with prosecutor Comodi saying: 'There is no question of a fresh investigation because as far as we are concerned Meredith was murdered by Amanda, Raffaele and Rudy (Guede).' Ivory Coast drifter Guede, 24, was sentenced to 30 years in 2008 after a fast track trial found him guilty of murdering and sexually assaulting Meredith but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal. However in his sentence report the judge ruled that Guede committed the murder 'with others' and he claimed in a hearing his accomplices were Knox and Sollecito although they always denied this. Home: A tearful Amanda Knox talks to reporters as her father, Curt Knox, right, stands behind her after arriving in Seattle . As a result of the appeal verdict Guede himself could now ask for a retrial although and his lawyer Valter Biscotti said it was a possibility he was looking into although if he was again found guilty he could get life. Meredith, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was murdered in 2007, just two months after she arrived in Perugia as part of her Leeds University degree. Her family have been left wondering just who killed her and for months there have been rumours swirling Perugia that Guede was involved in the murder with others. During the original trial Carlo Dalla Vedova said that fingerprints from other people had been found at the murder scene and never identified.","Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann says the jailing of Knox was 'political'

A worker who is being hunted by SWAT teams after opening fire at a meeting in a quarry - killing three people and injuring six more - was reportedly disgruntled at having been switched from day shifts to night shifts. Loader operator Shareff Allman, 47, allegedly opened fire after walking into a safety meeting at a California quarry with a handgun and rifle. He was angered at the rota switch which stopped him from spending more time with his teenage daughter, neighbours said. Allman fled the scene at Permanente Quarry in Cupertino this morning and several SWAT teams have been dispatched to find him - searching door-to-door with guns drawn, authorities said.

Holding on: Police search a neighbourhood in Cupertino on Wednesday, looking for the shooting suspect . Shocked: Police interview a resident in a neighbourhood in Cupertino as they search for the suspect . Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith confirmed the fatalities as Manual Pinon, 51, of Newman, California, John Vallejos, 51, of San Jose and Mark Munoz, 59, of San Jose. Police said Allman walked into a routine safety meeting this morning at 4.15am. When he left the meeting he began . walking around the grounds of the quarry owned by Lehigh Southwest . Cement Company, authorities said. He returned with a handgun and an assault rifle, and opened fire, according to Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies. Inside that meeting room, nine people of the 15 people in the meeting were shot. One of the victims, now in critical condition, was shot in the face outside of the meeting room, according to a sheriff's deputy at the scene who declined to be named, NBC reported. The sheriff said the suspect left the scene of that workplace shooting in his car. Three hours later and five miles away, police said the suspect ditched his car near Homestead and Wolfe Road and attempted a carjacking in a nearby Hewlett-Packard parking lot. The sheriff said he shot the female driver in the leg there and took off on foot to a nearby neighbourhood in Sunnyvale. At 7pm Sheriff Smith said the search of a Sunnyvale neighbourhood would finish soon. She said SWAT officers had searched extensively but could not find the man they were looking for after a 12-hour effort, NBC reported.

Potential reductions in employee . hours at the quarry were cited as a possible reason for the shooting, . but one of Allman's neighbours told the San Jose Mercury News that he . had been upset after being moved from the day shift to the night shift. The rota switch interfered with his plans to spend more time with his teenage daughter, Rose Douglas said. Cupertino schools were on lockdown or closed as the search continued on Wednesday. Sheriff Smith said two people were pronounced dead at Permanente Quarry in Cupertino, and a third person died later at the hospital. Six others at the quarry were wounded and taken to area hospitals, Sheriff Smith said. Some of them remained in critical condition. About 15 workers were evacuated and being kept at a safe location. The carjacking victim is expected to fully recover. No-go area: Authorities block a road to the Lehigh Southwest Cement Company in Cupertino, California .

'The only reports we have right now is that he was disgruntled and he was unhappy. Whether it was work-related or home-related, we don't know at this point'Santa Clara County Sheriff's spokesman . Allman allegedly used a weapon similar to the gun used in the quarry shooting. Permanente Quarry is a limestone and aggregate mining operation . and cement plant located in the foothills above Cupertino, near San Jose. The shootings rattled those who know Allman. 'He's always had a smile on his face,' said Paulette Conner, 57, a neighbour at Allman's San Jose apartment complex who said she's known him for five years. 'I've never known him to have any violent tendencies. Never. Ever.' Conner said Allman occasionally griped to her and others over the years about his job, including his various shift changes and some co-workers. Allman is known as a local fixture long involved in San Jose's black community. Before a news conference where community leaders urged him to turn himself in, friends described Allman as a non-violent person not known to own guns. 'He used to do so much for the community. Something must have happened to make him flip out like this,' said Pastor Oscar Dace of Bible Way Christian Center. 'Everybody just can't believe that this has happened.' In addition to working at the quarry, Allman has produced and hosted a public access television show for CreaTV in San Jose. NBC showed him on a YouTube video . interviewing civil rights campaigner Reverend Jesse Jackson at a Walter . Hawkins Memorial Celebration. But the video has since been taken down. Allman was one of 130 series producers who came in once a month and provided the public access station with content, CreaTV executive director Suzanne St. John-Crane said. 'Based on what we know now, we're shocked and devastated and feel for the families of the victims,' Ms St. John-Crane said. 'But he didn't work here. I want to make that clear.

Michael Jackson's doctor was talking on the phone and texting in the hour before he found the King of Pop in cardiac arrest, the court heard today in Dr Conrad Murray's trial for involuntary manslaughter. According to records shown to jurors, Murray was on the phone for 46 minutes of the hour before Jackson stopped breathing. The calls included a social call with a Houston waitress and a half-hour conversation with his office. Scroll down for video . Emergency: Dr Richelle Cooper told the court today that she believed Jackson had been dead for an hour when he arrived at hospital . Hysterical: Paris, left, Prince Michael and Blanket Jackson, cried as they were told their father had died an emergency room doctor told court . The records detailing the use of . Murray's two mobile phones were presented by the prosecution in a bid to . show the doctor was diverted during the time he was supposed to be . tending to his patient. Two executives from U.S. phone companies gave evidence that Murray was busy on his phone on the morning of June 25, 2009. Houston physician Dr Joanne . Prashad said she spoke to Murray that fateful morning to get advice on . one of his heart patients who was about to undergo surgery in Texas. Prosecutors showed records of . Murray's phone calls from the hours before Jackson's death . to show that the singer had other things on his mind - getting his . $150,000 a month deal to serve as Jackson's personal physician approved, . running his medical practices and fielding calls from mistresses. One of Murray's former patients, Las Vegas salesman Robert Russell, detailed one of the calls Murray took in the hour before Jackson's death last week. Mr . Russell praised Murray in testimony, crediting the doctor with saving . his life, but said he had grown distant after going to work for Jackson . Show: The family of late singer Michael Jackson, including his children Prince Michael, far left, Paris, second left, and Blanket, left front, attended the premiere of Michael Jackson THE IMMORTAL World Tour show by Cirque du Soleil in Montreal last night . Meanwhile, hospital doctors told the court today they never stood a chance of saving Jackson on the day he died. Emergency staff tried for one hour . and thirteen minutes to revive the King of Pop in hospital after he was . already diagnosed as being clinically dead. Hospital staff tried CPR, pumping . oxygen into the performer's lungs and used three different . heart-starting drugs, but all to no avail. 'Mr Jackson died long before he became a patient,' said casualty Dr Richelle Cooper. Dr Cooper testified that she first . pronounced Jackson as being dead at 12:57pm based on information . paramedics relayed from the scene of Jackson's collapse at his rented . Los Angeles mansion on June 25, 2009. 'At that time, I felt confident clinically pronouncing him dead,' Dr Cooper told the court. But Jackson's personal doctor . insisted that life-saving efforts should carry on even though the star . wasn't breathing and he was rushed to hospital where he wasn't . officially pronounced dead until 2:26pm. Pronounced dead: The trauma room at UCLA Medical Center is shown in this evidence photo projection in the courtroom . On trial: Dr Conrad Murray listens to testimony seated near his attorney today . In all the time she was trying to . revive Jackson, Dr Cooper said she never detected a pulse. 'I have never . previously given a time of death in the field and then had a patient . brought to me for more treatment before it happened on June 25, 2009,' she added. Giving evidence on the fifth day . of the trial at Los Angeles Superior Court, Dr Cooper denied the lengths . hospital staff took to try and resuscitate Jackson had anything to do . with him being a celebrity. The emergency physician at the . University of California Los Angeles Hospital said Murray never . mentioned giving Jackson the powerful hospital anaesthetic Propofol. She added that she hadn't heard of the strong sedative being used anywhere outside a  surgery ward. Dr Cooper said Jackson appeared to be clinically dead when he was brought into the casualty ward. 'He didn't have a pulse. His pupils were fixed and dilated,' she said. Dr Cooper testified she never asked Murray . to sign a death certificate because, by the time he was brought to . Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Jackson became her patient. 'Mr Jackson was my patient and I didn't really have an explanation for why he was dead,' she said. Defendant: Conrad Murray, pictured in court today, is charged with involuntary manslaughter . Testifying: Cardiologist Dr Thao Nguyen told the court that Murray 'sounded desperate' and 'looked devastated' On the stand: Murray's phone records were discussed by AT&T employee Edward Dixon, left, and Sprint employee Jeff Strohm . Dr Cooper said Murray only . admitted giving Jackson two small amounts of the sedative lorazepam, but . didn't mention giving him any other drugs, including Propofol. Murray added that Jackson did not have any medical problems. At one point, Dr Cooper said she went to check on Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, in an adjoining room. 'They were crying and they were fairly hysterical. They were being comforted by their nurse,' she told the court. A cardiologist who was working at the emergency room repeated the claim that Murray had not mentioned propofol. Hospital cardiologist Dr Thao . Nguyen also told the court that Murray made no mention of the fact he . administered Propofol to Jackson, even though she quizzed him several . times. She also said Murray couldn't remember what time Jackson stopped breathing or how long he took to call 911. In court: Janet Jackson looks toward oncoming protesters as she steps out of a vehicle on arrival at the courthouse today . Siblings: Janet Jackson and Randy Jackson arrive at the courthouse this morning . Final days: Michael Jackson died two days after this photograph was taken during a rehearsal . 'He said he didn't have any concept of time,' she said. 'He said he didn't have a watch.' Dr Nguyen said Murray 'sounded desperate and he looked devastated.' But, she said, without knowing how much time had passed since he stopped breathing, resuscitation was a remote hope. 'Dr Murray asked that we not give . up early and try to save Michael Jackson's life. But it was not too . little, too late - it was just too late. We were running too late,' added Dr Nguyen. Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering a fatal dose of Propofol to Jackson. His defence . lawyers claim Jackson gave himself a fatal dose of sedatives and Propofol, which is normally administered in hospital settings. Authorities say he administered the fatal dose and acted recklessly by providing Jackson the drug as a sleep aid. The prosecution is continuing to call witnesses as the high-profile case enters its second week. Three of Dr Murray's girlfriends are . expected to be called to the stand this week, including a woman who he . was on the phone to as he realised Jackson was unwell. Jackson's children are reported to have chosen no to attend the trial as it is too painful, but are still willing to testify. Their grandmother, Katherine Jackson, is relieved that they have chosen not to watch the trial, a source told TMZ. The case continues.

"By . Emily Andrews . Last updated at 7:20 AM on 4th October 2011 . Tragic: Hildegard Mikalansky died after after going four days without proper food at Stoke Mandeville Hospital . Hospital staff have been accused of starving a grandmother to death after failing to feed her for four days. Hildegard Mikalansky, 67, was admitted after a fall and designated as ‘nil by mouth’ by medics due to a risk of choking. However, it took four days before she was given a feeding tube to supply her with much-needed nutrients. By then, the mother of two’s condition had worsened and she died the following day. Her son Mike Stringer, a company director, said: ‘I saw a vulnerable but vivacious and warm lady deteriorate rapidly and die in that hospital.’ At her inquest, the coroner criticised Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire for the delay and for allowing her care to ‘drift’ after a bank holiday weekend. Mr Stringer said: ‘Although my mother had some underlying problems such as multiple sclerosis, she was essentially starved to death. ‘She just slipped through the cracks. Everyone kept saying she needed food and that she was malnourished but nothing was done.’ Mrs Mikalansky, who was divorced from her husband John, was admitted to hospital late on May 29 last year, a bank holiday weekend. Mr Stringer and his sister Kim, a philosophy academic, had gone to visit their mother and found her in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs. Doctors had initially focused on a head injury and fractured ribs, but Mr Stringer, 41, said he raised concerns about his mother’s nutrition from the outset. ‘She was naturally slim, and prior to her admission had not really been eating enough due to tiredness from her MS. We constantly prompted staff with regard to feeding and eating because mum was thin and ate little. We were concerned it may well get ignored as catering staff tend to just leave food and collect it later. ‘We could see the situation was getting more serious each day.’ Starved: Hildegard Mikalansky was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital with a head injury but she later died of malnourishment even though staff knew she was at a 'high risk' of malnourishment, an inquest heard . The inquest heard Mrs Mikalansky ate some supper on May 30, the day after her admission, but was then sick several times. The following morning she had some breakfast, but was designated ‘nil by mouth’ due to a risk of choking on her food at some point on Tuesday, June 1. By Thursday she had developed ketoacidosis – a serious condition caused through malnutrition when acid levels in the blood become dangerously high. When eventually a feeding tube was fitted on the Friday evening, it took a further 16 hours for it to be activated because an X-ray to check the position of the tube had not been done. Mr Stringer said: ‘When I arrived on the Saturday morning and asked why it hadn’t been done, we were told the X-ray department was busy and didn’t deem her urgent. She was dead in 24 hours.’ Doctors at the inquest described Mrs Mikalansky, of Hazlemere, Buckinghamshire, as ‘gaunt’ and suggested she had a history of alcoholism and malnutrition – all of which Mr Stringer disputes. Coroner Richard Hulett recorded a narrative verdict and raised concerns that it took four days for Mrs Mikalansky to receive food direct to her stomach through the tube. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said in a statement: ‘Mrs Mikalansky was admitted to hospital with a head injury and chronic malnourishment. Staff were concerned about her very low weight and specialist feeding assessments were arranged. ‘However, Mrs Mikalansky quickly developed serious complications  and sadly, despite treatment, she later died.’",Hildegard Mikalansky was in hospital for four days before she was fed .

In a preview blurb for this morning's . episode of The Wright Stuff, the Channel 5 website said: 'So if you were . a guy who'd met her in a bar and she invited you back to hers, would . you go? Crass and insensitive: Viewers of The Wright Stuff were stunned when presenter Matthew Wright asked them to vote on whether they would 'take home' Amanda Knox in light of her acquittal for murder . The discussion was conducted between Matthew Wright and a panel of Kelly Hoppen, Christopher Biggins and Liz McClaron . 'I'm being quite serious. Or would something in your brain make . you think twice?' Wright began the segment by pointing out that Amanda Knox had been cleared of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, before insisting that she is 'foxy as hell'. But he defended his actions after the discussion was branded crass and abysmal by bloggers. He said: 'I thought it would be interesting to . find out if mud sticks, or whether an innocent young woman could now go . out and behave in a perfectly normal way.' But viewers . of the show, aired at 9.15am just . 12 hours after the 24-year-old American was freed, slammed the . discussion and bombarded the Channel's official message board with . complaints.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 1:35 PM on 4th October 2011 . A Texas man who served 25 years in jail for the killing of his wife is set to walk free, after new DNA evidence linked another man to the crime. Michael Morton was sentenced to life in jail for beating his wife Christine to death in 1986, but has always maintained his innocence. But prosecutors said Mr Morton is expected to have his conviction sensationally overturned after a quarter of a century, and is set for release on Tuesday afternoon. Freed: Michael Morton, pictured here with Christine Morton and the couple's then three-year-old son, is set to have his conviction for killing her overturned after new evidence linked the crime to another man . Mr Morton was jailed in 1987 after being convicted of murder despite no evidence linking him directly to the crime and having no history of violence. His wife was found dead at their home in Williamson County, Texas, having been beaten with a blunt wooden object which was never found. Prosecutors at Morton's original murder trial claimed he had beaten his wife to death after becoming enraged when she wouldn't have sex with him following a dinner celebrating his 32nd birthday. But tests performed this summer on a blood-stained, blue bandana found shortly after the crime near Morton's home revealed DNA from his wife and an unidentified man convicted in multiple states. Authorities have withheld his identity amid ongoing investigations. Nina Morrison, a senior staff attorney with the Innocence Project, which is representing Morton, said: 'We are relieved that his conviction is finally on the path to be overturned and hopeful that as of tomorrow night he will be out of custody and able to finally start rebuilding his life. Appeal: Morton's legal team, from left John Raley, Nina Morrison, Gerald Goldstein and Barry Scheck, celebrate the judgement of having the conviction overturned . 'This is a case that really should humble all of us about the fallibility of our justice system.' For years, Morton's defense attorneys had tried to get DNA tests on the bloody bandana found near the scene, but the Innocence Project said Williamson County district attorney John Bradley had resisted turning it over until an appeals court ordered him to do so last year. Bradley said tests in June revealed DNA from two people on the bandana: The victim and a man who was not her husband. The DNA instead matched a man who had been in prison in California in 2010, and who was living in Central Texas but was not in custody on Monday afternoon, Bradley said. Authorities were not naming the man, referring to him only as 'John Doe.' Bradley said he had also been linked to the 1988 beating death of another woman killed after Christine Morton was found dead in her bed in Round Rock, just north of Austin. He said that man had been tied to a hair found in the bed of the second woman in neighboring Travis County who died after Michael Morton had already begun to serve his sentence. Attorneys for Morton said he may struggle to adapt to the modern world when he is released soon after 25 years in jail. John Raley, Morton's Houston-based attorney, said: 'He's kind of going to be Rip Van Winkle. 'He's never held a cell phone. Reagan was president when he went in, so there's going to be a long adjustment.'","DNA evidence links killing to different man quarter of a century on .

Watching: Traders stand together as they work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday . The Dow Jones today finished its worst week since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, as hundreds of ‘Occupy Wall Street’ demonstrators continue an Egyptian-style protest in New York. All three U.S. stock markets finished . slightly up on Friday - but it hasn't erased a torrid week in which the . Dow plunged 6.4 per cent, the S&P 500 dropped 6.6 per cent and the Nasdaq fell 5.3 per cent. The further falls this morning - before a . small recovery later on - were despite finance ministers from the . world's leading economies pledging to take whatever steps are necessary . to calm the markets. Film-maker Michael Moore is backing the 'Occupy Wall Street' protest and said it is best to sort out economic problems without riots. 'The smart rich know they can only build the gate so high,' he told Current TV. 'Sooner or later history proves that people when they have had enough are not going to take it anymore. 'Much better to deal with it non-violently now, through the political system, than what could possibly happen in the future, which nobody wants to see.' The Dow Jones finished up 38 points, . or 0.35 per cent, at 10,771.48. The S&P was up 6.84 points, or 0.61 . per cent, at 1,136.40, and the Nasdaq was up 27.56 points, or 1.12 per . cent, at 2,483.23. 'I'd have been happier to see the market up 100 points or so,' said Doreen Mogavero, of Mogavero, Lee & Co. 'However, in these rather cautious times people are a little hesitant to commit in a big way.' The primary trigger for the rebound came from policymakers suggesting additional steps will be taken to support Europe's financial system - such as the European Central Bank adding more liquidity. But billionaire investor George Soros . claims the U.S. is already into a double-dip recession and this is down . to political squabbling and GOP opposition to President Obama’s stimulus . proposals. ‘There was a deal in the making which . would have balanced the budget over the long term, but would have . allowed short-term fiscal stimulus, which would have been the right . policy,’ Mr Soros told CNBC.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:01 PM on 3rd October 2011 . Under-fire England captain Mike Tindall was all smiles today as he  shrugged off the trials and tribulations of his team's World Cup campaign. Following the narrow weekend defeat of Scotland, Tindall and Co. are now looking forward to taking on France in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final. And sensibly, the boys were pictured with just glasses of water in front of them at their team hotel in Auckland this morning. Martin Johnson's men have faced intense criticism during their campaign so far following a series of poor performances and controversial off-field antics. Relaxing: Mike Tindall, rear, watches on as England's Toby Flood, left, and Steve Thompson, right, enjoy a glass of water next to the team hotel in Auckland. Tindall, who is married to the Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, has come in for the biggest battering. CCTV pictures of him flirting with a blonde on a night out with other players in Queenstown last month were released to the press causing a storm of outrage. Fun: England's Toby Flood, left, Tom Croft, and Steve Thompson, right, enjoy chatting to Mike Tindall . It has emerged today that the blonde may be an old flame whom he became close to during her time at Leeds University. Tindall was forced to admit yesterday that he had lied about the amount of time he had spent with the woman on the night the footage was filmed. While giving 100 per cent support for his captain and friend, Johnson did hold a team meeting to make the players 'fully aware of . their responsibilities' and issued warnings about the need to take care . with their conduct. New friends: Mike Tindall, right, speaks with Scotland's Simon Danielli, left, next to the England team hotel . But it appears these warnings may have fallen on deaf ears after it emerged that three players had been forced to apologise to a Dunedin hotel worker. England manager Martin Johnson said yesterday that he was 'angry' at James Haskell, Dylan Hartley and Chris Ashton for teasing a female hotel employee with lewd comments. According to the Sunday Mirror, . Annabel Newton, 23, said the three England players 'treated me with no . respect' after she was called into a hotel room to retrieve her . walkie-talkie. Johnson said: 'I was angry with them. It is just the sort of thing we have talked about. On camera: CCTV footage of Mike Tindall, husband of royal Zara Phillips, flirting with a woman in The Altitude Bar in Queenstown, New Zealand . 'What they thought was humour and a light-hearted exchange has clearly not been taken that way by Annabel, the girl involved. Mystery blonde: An image of the woman who was seen flirting with Mike Tindall on a drunken night out . 'At the time they apologised when they realised they had stepped over the mark.' The management realise the  punishing length of the tour necessitates a need to let off steam, there is now a clearly concerted move by the players to appear on good behaviour. To that end, Tindall laughed and joked with team-mats Toby Flood, Tom Croft and Steve Thompson with water all round the order of the day. Images of the team relaxing  emerged as a bouncer accused of illegally accessing the CCTV footage of Tindall on the controversial night out pleaded not guilty. Jonathan Dixon, 40, appeared before Queenstown District Court in New Zealand today. A plea of not guilty was entered and Dixon was remanded on continuing bail until October 17, a spokeswoman for the court said. Dixon is charged with accessing a computer for dishonest purpose after footage showing the England centre flirting with the blonde at the Altitude bar were leaked to the press. In a reversal of previous statements, Tindall yesterday admitted that he had lied about what happened next on the night the CCTV footage was filmed. Reports emerged last week that he had then gone on to a second bar called Cowboys, where he was allegedly spotted with a blonde woman. Together: Mike Tindall and Zara Phillips hold hands as they leave Bacchus restaurant in Dunedin, New Zealand, last month . The claims were denied on September 24 . by media lawyer Julian Pike, of Farrer & Co, speaking on behalf of . Tindall and his wife. But . yesterday public relations company Juniper Sport, which represents the . player, said it could no longer stand by that denial and issued an . apology on the player's behalf. In . a statement given to the Mail On Sunday, the PR firm said: 'Mike . Tindall gave his PR consultants and the Rugby Football Union his . assurance that he had not attended the Cowboys bar, having left the . Altitude bar. 'In good . faith, his PR consultants, the RFU and the RFU's solicitors relied upon . that assurance when dealing with last week's story. 'However, Mike now accepts that his recollection was incorrect and he apologises unreservedly for this misjudgment.' The . weekend's revelations follow last week's 'ballgate' scandal, when .

"By . Stephen Wright . Last updated at 8:34 AM on 28th September 2011 . Scandals: The Duke of York has flown to the Far East with two aides . It is two months since a string of scandals forced Prince Andrew officially to step down as the UK’s global trade ambassador. Yet it seems little has changed in practice for the royal, dubbed ‘Airmiles Andy’ because of his love of luxury air travel. Just three days after returning from an expensive ‘trade mission’ to Saudi Arabia, the Duke of York is on his taxpayer-funded travels again – this time to promote British business in Singapore. He and two aides have flown nearly 7,000 miles to the Far  East, where he aims to boost ‘high-level bilateral relations between the UK and Singapore, in particular in relation to trade and investment’. Only last week, Andrew was accused of wasting public  money after spending up to £150,000 to charter a private jet to fly him to the Middle East, where he met Saudi businessmen and politicians. The prince was forced to relinquish his official trade title in July following criticism over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, as well as claims of boorish behaviour towards foreign dignitaries. He then created a new job for himself – as a ‘senior working royal’ with a particular interest in British business – which critics claimed was a ploy to enable him to continue his trips abroad. Andrew flew out to Singapore on a scheduled flight from Heathrow on Monday night and is not due to return to the UK until Saturday. Taxpayers will pick up his travel costs to Singapore, while UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) will pay the bill for his ‘accommodation and expenses and any in-country travel’. Bright lights, big city: Taxpayers will pick up his travel costs to Singapore, while UK Trade and Investment will pay for his 'accommodation and expenses' UKTI officials at last night defended the trip, pointing out that Singapore is the UK’s 19th largest market in terms of UK goods exports. But cynics pointed out that with its tropical climate, fantastic array of golf courses and first-class hotels and restaurants, there may be other incentives for making the twelve-and-a-half hour flight. Records show that Prince Andrew has visited Singapore every year since at least 2007, making it one of his most popular destinations. The Court Circular said he was accompanied on his latest trip by Deputy Private Secretary Amanda Thirsk and an Assistant Private Secretary, Richard Sykes. As is custom, it did not mention whether any domestic staff or protection officers were in his entourage. Going back for more: Prince Andrew shaking hands with the then Singaporean President Sellapan Ramanathan Nathan on a previous visit in 2001 . Dai Davies, former head of Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad – and one of Prince Andrew’s fiercest critics – said last night: ‘Trips like these, which involve first-class travel and five-star hotels, as well as the presence of protection officers and various aides, are very expensive. ‘There needs to be a proper evaluation of whether they provide value for money. I am not convinced they provide any real benefit. At a time when people are trying to cut back, Prince Andrew – despite the scandals which have engulfed him – is carrying on as if nothing has changed.’ The prince’s spokesman said: ‘The visit to Singapore was agreed before the Duke relinquished the role of Special Representative in July. The Foreign Office agreed that it should continue and it has been approved by the Royal Visits Committee.’","Duke of York to promote British business .

London, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh and Belfast were all in the bottom half of a 13-strong ease-of-travel city table released today. Stockholm was judged to be the best European city to get around without a car, followed by Helsinki, Prague, Paris and Berlin. Congested: London was in the bottom half of a list measuring ease of public transport use . But in the table compiled by the Campaign for Better Transport, London ranked eighth, Cardiff ninth, while Dublin, Edinburgh and Belfast were 10, 11, and 12 in the list respectively. Only Rome, in 13th and last place, was deemed to be less 'green' and public transport-friendly than the UK's main cities. The cities were judged on 16 categories, including ease of access to public transport, public attitudes to car use, congestion levels and the side effects from cars. Busy: Edinburgh was second only to London for congestion . London had the worst air quality and congestion of all the cities examined in the study. Londoners are also subjected to the highest fares. Public transport in Cardiff was cheaper than in the other UK capitals, but the city had the second lowest number of public transport trips per day and the lowest number of people commuting by public transport.

Protesters calling themselves 'the 99 per . cent' continued to gather momentum in several cities across the country today, with groups descending on on Washington . D.C., Jersey and Texas. The marchers - campaigning against America's richest 'one per cent' with . perceived tax breaks and other perks - have swelled their ranks since mid September, leading President Barack Obama to call the demonstrators a 'movement'. The protests come after an NYPD officer was caught bragging about using his nightstick on Wall Street protesters just hours before violence broke out between demonstrators and police last night. In the video, which appears to have been shot just hours before last night's clashes, the officer can be heard saying 'my little night stick's going to get a work out tonight' as he saunters past a police barricade. Scroll down for video . Stand: About one thousand people gather and form a large ""99%"" in the middle of Freedom Plaza.

March: Protesters march in front of the Federal Reserve Building in Dallas today . The protests have slowly grown in size and attention over more than two weeks, with the president's acknowledgement at a news conference a sign they might be jelling into a political movement. Local protests against corporate America are planned in New Jersey on Thursday as a show of solidarity with demonstrations that started last month outside the New York Stock Exchange. Rallies met at the Statehouse in Trenton and in Jersey City. Protesters are expected to call for an end of corporate control of government. The movement has surged in less than three weeks from a ragged group in downtown Manhattan to protesters of all ages demonstrating from Seattle to Tampa. 'I am a mother. I want a better world for my children,' said Lisa Clapier, 46, a producer who lives in Venice, California, who joined protesters in Los Angeles. In Seattle, where protesters had set up an encampment in a city park, about two dozen people were arrested for defying police orders to dismantle their tents. 'The cops are doing their job, and we're going to let them do their job. Then we'll come back and occupy the park again,' said Michael Trimarco, 39, an unemployed carpenter.

Swinging: Police can be seen laying into protesters around Wall Street . Last night unions lent their muscle to the . long-running protest against Wall Street and economic inequality, . fuelling speculation about how long the camp-out in lower Manhattan - . and related demonstrations around the country - will continue. As around 5,000 protesters marched toward the New York Stock Exchange last night, demonstrators tried to storm the barricades but were stopped by police . about two blocks away. There were multiple reports of police using pepper spray to try to ward off the marchers. A video posted on Youtube shows officers swinging their nightsticks at protesters and has sparked a furious reaction among demonstrators. Police said about 28 arrests were made, mostly . for disorderly conduct. One person was arrested for assaulting an . officer; police said the officer was pushed off his scooter. Thousands of protesters, including many in union T-shirts, filled lower Manhattan's Foley Square on yesterday and then marched to Zuccotti Park, where the protesters have been camping since September 17.

Cuffed: The protests have gathered momentum and gained participants in recent days as news of mass arrests and a coordinated media campaign seeded protests around the country . Earlier Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain told protesters in a Wall Street Journal interview: 'Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself.' But labor leaders say they will continue to support the protests, both with manpower and donations of goods and services. 'The great thing about Occupy Wall Street is that they have brought the focus of the entire country on the middle class majority,' said George Aldro, 62, a member of Local 2325 of the United Auto Workers, as he carried the union's blue flag over his shoulder through lower Manhattan. 'We're in it together, and we're in it for the long haul.' The protesters have varied causes but have spoken largely about unemployment and economic inequality, reserving most of their criticism for Wall Street. 'We are the 99 percent,' they chanted, contrasting themselves with the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Ed Figueroa, a janitor in a public school in the Bronx and a shop steward with Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, said the march was 'the first time in these weeks that unions have shown their face.' 'But it won't be the last time,' he said. 'We'll be back.' Force: People watch from the steps of Federal Court (L) as members of trade unions join ""Occupy Wall Street"" protesters . Bragging: This NYPD oficer was recorded saying his night stick was 'going to get a workout' just hours before violence broke out last night . The unions were donating food, blankets and office space to the protesters, said Dan Cantor, head of the Working Families Party. But he said the young protesters would continue to head their own efforts. The movement lacks an identified leader and decisions are made during group meetings. 'They're giving more to us than we're giving to them. They're a shot in the arm to everybody,' Cantor said. 'The labor movement is following the youth of America today and that's a good thing.' Victor Rivera, a vice-president for the powerful 1199 Service Employees International Union, which represents health care workers, said the union had donated 'all the food they need for this entire week' to the Zuccotti Park campers. Union leaders had also assigned liaisons from their political action committee to work with demonstrators. 'We are here to support this movement against Wall Street's greed,' he said. 'We support the idea that the rich should pay their fair share.'

The Occupy Wall Street protests started Sept. 17 with a few dozen demonstrators who tried to pitch tents in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Since then, hundreds have set up camp nearby in Zuccotti Park and have become increasingly organized, lining up medical aid and legal help and printing their own newspaper. On Saturday, about 700 people were arrested and given disorderly conduct summonses for spilling into the roadway of the Brooklyn Bridge despite warnings from police. A group of those arrested filed a lawsuit Tuesday, saying officers lured them into a trap before arresting them. Several Democratic lawmakers have expressed support for the protesters, but some Republican presidential candidates have rebuked them. Herman Cain called the activists 'un-American' Wednesday at a book signing in St. Petersburg, Florida. Mass: Yesterday at new York's Zuccotti Park and Foley Square, Occupy Wall Street protesters were joined by local students and unions . 'They're basically saying that somehow the government is supposed to take from those that have succeeded and give to those who want to protest,' the former pizza-company executive said. 'That's not the way America was built.' On Tuesday, CBS reported that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney called the protest ""class warfare"" at an appearance at a Florida retirement community. Activists have been showing solidarity with the movement in many cities: Occupy Providence. Occupy Los Angeles. Occupy Boise. More protests and sit-ins are planned across the country in the days ahead. Ride: A participant in the ""Occupy Wall Street"" demonstration displays a ""pink unicorn"" ride during a march to join teacher's unions near Wall Street yesterday .

Multitude: Thousands of protesters including union members and college students from an organized walkout joined the rally . On Wednesday, more than 100 people withstood an afternoon downpour in Idaho's capital to protest, including Judy Taylor, a retired property manager. 'I want change. I'm tired of things being taken away from those that need help,' she said. In Seattle, demonstrators tussled with police officers and clung to tents as they defied orders to leave a park. Police said they made 25 arrests. The reception was warmer in Los Angeles, where the City Council approved a resolution of support and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's office distributed 100 rain ponchos to activists at another days-long demonstration, according to City News Service. In Boston, hundreds of nurses and Northeastern University students rallied together to condemn what they called corporate control of government and the spiralling costs of education. The students banged on drums made of water jugs and chanted, 'Banks got bailed out, and we got sold out.' 'This is an organic process. This is a process of grassroots people coming together. It's a beautiful thing,' said David Schildmeier, spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses Association. Many of those protesting are college students. Hundreds walked out of classes in New York, some in a show of solidarity for the Wall Street movement but many more concerned with worries closer to home. Protests were scheduled at State University of New York campuses including Albany, Buffalo, Binghamton, New Paltz and Purchase. Danielle Kingsbury, a 21-year-old senior from New Paltz, said she walked out of an American literature class to show support for some of her professors who she said have had their workloads increased because of budget cuts. 'The state of education in our country is ridiculous,' said Kingsbury, who plans to teach. 'The state doesn't care about it and we need to fight back about that.'","28 arrested after another night of violence on the streets of New York .

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 11:08 AM on 28th September 2011 . Slow zone: Conservative MEPs rubbished the suggestion that all EU states should agree to the 20mph limit in residential areas . European Union plans to enforce a mandatory 20mph speed limit in residential zones and replace the Highway Code with European law has sparked outrage from British politicians. Conservative Members of the European Parliament last night slammed the suggestion to decrease the limit as 'silly'. Dozens of road safety suggestions were endorsed thanks to a show of hands by MEPs. They voted on a report drawn up by centre-right MEP Dieter-Lebrecht Koch, whose resolution on behalf of the Parliament's Transport Committee includes the introduction of a 30km speed limit in residential areas. This would include single lane roads in urban areas which have no separate cycle lane, 'with a view to protecting vulnerable road users more effectively'. The proposed limit equates to 18.6mph and is just one of a raft of recommendations which also include harmonised road traffic rules, road signs, road worthiness tests and blood alcohol limits. Ironically, Mr Koch is from Germany, the European country which decades ago warned it would never tolerate interference in its right to have motorways with no speed limits. And although today's proposal is only an 'own initiative' report and unlikely to see the light of legislative day, Tory MEP for the North West and transport spokesman Jacqueline Foster said it was 'another example of Europe trying to dictate to Britain on issues that should be decided locally'. Tory MEP Jacqueline Foster (left) attacked the proposals as 'plain silly'. German MEP Dieter-Lebrecht Koch (right), who put forward the report, believes that his recommendations will halve road deaths by 2020 . She said: 'Of course speed limits as . low as 20mph or so can be right in some very specific areas, especially . near schools or nurseries, but every location is different and these . decisions need to be made case by case. 'Not by a Europe-wide edict.' A British road sign declaring 'Speed limit - 18.64mph' would be 'plain silly' she said. Other ideas among more than 100 from Mr Koch include standardised road signs across the EU, harmonised road worthiness standards for cars, a common drink-driving limit and a standard 'highway code' for all member states. Mr Koch, whose report is a response to a European Commission discussion paper last year on road safety, says his combined measures could halve road accident deaths by 2020 - and help towards his ultimate target of a 'zero death toll' on Europe's roads. 'The choice of measures and their assessment should be a scientific process, based on comparable, high-quality data, definitions and statistics,' said Mr Koch during the debate on his report. 'We expect a harmonised analysis of the causes of accidents and injuries and an EU-wide exchange of data which respects a high standard of data privacy.'",German MEP says his proposals will halve road accident deaths by 2020 .

Shaun Russell, whose daughter survived a frenzied attack in which her sister and mother were killed in 1996, believes his phone was hacked by reporters at the News of the World. He was one of a number of possible victims who have issued legal writs against the group that owned the former Sunday tabloid. Fresh claim: Shaun Russell, pictured with daughter Josie, who survived a hammer attack, plans to sue News International over phone hacking . Others include Sara Payne - the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah - a prominent campaigner who worked closely with the newspaper for many years. Together they successfully lobbied for what became known as Sarah’s Law - legislation that enables people to check if those living close to their children are paedophiles. Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell, pop star Dannii Minogue, and July 7 suicide bomb attacks hero Paul Dadge are also suing Rupert Murdoch’s media company. Politicians Denis MacShane, Simon Hughes, Mark Oaten, Tessa Jowell, Chris Bryant and George Galloway are also taking legal action. Changing sides: Sara Payne, right, mother of murdered Sarah, left,  has ditched her connections with the now closed News of the World to sue them . Kylie Minogue has said her phone could have been hacked while she was suffering from breast cancer. As she picked up an honorary doctorate, the star spoke of the challenges of fighting the disease while in the spotlight. She said being in the public eye had been a 'blessing' because of the support she received but a 'curse' because of occasional media intrusion. Asked if her phone had been hacked, she added: 'It may have been.' There was no suggestion that she was targeted by any particular media company. The singer was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and underwent surgery and chemotherapy to beat the disease. She was given the all-clear the following year. Another claimant is Sheila Henry, the mother of London bombing victim Christian Small, who died in the July 2005 blasts. The new names will join other well-known figures and celebrities claiming damages that could exceed the £20million compensation fund. Among the first to lead the charge against the newspaper were former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott, actor Jude Law and comedian Steve Coogan. The total number is believed to have soared in recent weeks after High Court judge Mr Justice Vos set a time limit on when applications for damages could be made. He is due to hear evidence from a group of ‘lead claimants’, representing a broad range of victims, at a hearing in January. He . will then rule on what compensation they should expect, creating a . blueprint for other claims in the future, in the hope of reducing legal . costs. The fresh claims are the latest development in a saga that began with the . jailing of private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and News of the World . royal editor Clive Goodman in January 2007. Hacked off: Comedian Steve Coogan and pop star Dannii Minogue are just two of the other claimants suing the now-defunct newspaper . The two men admitted plotting to hack into the messages of Royal aides but the scandal lay dormant until January, when News International handed Scotland Yard evidence that others were also targeted. The move sparked a massive outcry that led to the News of the World being shut down in July, a series of criminal investigations and a judicial inquiry into the methods and ethics of the media. A News International spokesman said: ‘News International is committed to reaching fair and where possible swift settlements with victims of illegal voicemail interception and has unreservedly apologised to those affected.’","He joins ex-News of World campaigner Sara Payne .

Their reputation suggests they may be reluctant to, but Yorkshiremen can well afford to stand their round in the pub, research suggests. Along with those in the North West and North East they enjoy the cheapest pints in the country, a study has shown. And they have the advantage of supping their pints while tucking into some of the best pub food in the most pleasant surroundings in the UK, according to the Good Pub guide. The guide found that pies are the most popular food item in pubs . A pint of your favourite bitter would . cost you £2.87 on average in the North West, North East and Yorkshire, . compared with £3.15 in London and the South East, the guide found. But cost is not the only reason to head up north - the guide also states that city pubs lack the 'character' and 'charm' to be found in country inns. It described town and city drinking holes as 'pleasant enough', with 'okay' levels of service, . but said it appeared that furnishings often came from a vast warehouse hidden away in an anonymous . 'off-motorway wasteland'. Pubs brewing their own ale charge just under £2.50 a pint, with scarcely any increase over the past year, compared with a seven per cent rise every where else, said the guide. North West, North East and Yorkshire  £2.87 . Heart of England £2.88 . Wales £2.90 . South West £2.95 . East Midlands £2.99 . East of England £3.04 . Scotland £3.11 . London  £3.15 . Pie and ale is what most people want as the annual guide also discovered that . the most popular food pub goers went for was steak and ale . pie, closely followed by fish and chips, often given a boozy spin by . being 'beer-battered'. Lasagne scored zero in a list of top food choices, with curry, sausage and mash and ham and egg also slipping well down the popularity stakes. Good quality coffee was said to be available in nearly all good pubs, although the guide said it was a 'shame' that almost half of pubs in the UK did not open until noon. Fiona Stapley, editor of the Good Pub Guide, said: 'Today's number one food choice for pub-goers is steak in ale pie, in all it glorious variations: steak in ale-Guinness-stout-red wine, with mushrooms, stilton, kidneys, oysters. 'Other pies follow, like all types of . fish, chicken, pork, lamb, rabbit, shepherd's, venison, wild boar, . duckling, goose. And they love suet puddings too.' Charm: Country pubs like The Fountaine Inn in Linton near the Yorkshire Dales have more 'character' than their city counterparts . Pricey: Customers are expected to part with more cash for food and drink at venues like The Hemingway gastro pub in London's Victoria . The guide, launched 30 years ago, lists pubs, landlords and dining pubs of the year. Paul Nuttall, UKIP's deputy leader, said: 'It comes as no surprise that in these challenging economic times that folk are plumping for pub comfort food with dishes such as steak and ale pie and fish and chips. It is the kind of food that Britain does best. Thrifty: The Good Pub Guide has found it is cheaper to enjoy your favourite tipple in northern parts of the UK . 'However, the Government could do . more to make the pint of a pub-goer cheaper by not increasing excise . duty by two per cent above the rate of inflation every year. 'Such a move is destroying Britain's pub trade and stunting growth.' Paul Maloney, national officer of the . GMB said: 'Since the Good Pub Guide was first published the Beer Orders . were introduced in 1989. 'The aim was to foster competition . to increase consumer choice and bring down prices. 'The opposite of this aim has been achieved. The average price for a pint of lager in Britain has risen by 80p higher than justified by inflation and changes in taxes in pubs, as property companies replaced brewers as owners. 'Local pubs owned by property companies have been priced out of the market and widespread pub closures have resulted particularly in working class areas in Britain. He added that the average price of a pint of lager increased by 46 per cent between 1991 and 2000 compared to a 27 per cent rise in inflation. Between 2000 and 2010 the average price of a pint of lager increased by 47 per cent compared to a 31 per cent increase in inflation, said Mr Maloney.",Average price of a pint is 30p less than in London .
"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 6th October 2011 . A cricket agent boasted seven players in Pakistan's national side were fixing matches for him in a hugely lucrative betting scam, a court heard today. Mazhar Majeed, 36, spoke of the advantages of 'grooming' younger cricketers to work with him as they would be 'around for years', Southwark Crown Court was told. Prosecutors alleged that he also discussed deliberately losing a Test match against England last summer for a million dollars and plotted to fix games at last year's Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies. At court: Mr Butt, centre, arrives at Southwark Crown Court in London yesterday, today the court heard a transcript of the conversation between the captain and his agent . The alleged conversation, which was recorded by reporter Mr Mahmood, was read to the jury: . Majeed allegedly said: ‘You know the maiden we were doing in the first over?’ Butt allegedly replied: ‘Yeah.’ Majeed: ‘You know the third over you face? Do one more maiden.’ Butt: ‘No, leave it, OK.’ Majeed: ‘You don’t want to do the third over?’ Butt: ‘Nai, yaar.’ (‘No, mate.’) Majeed allegedly told undercover reporter, Mazher Mahmood, of the News of the World, who was posing as a rich businessman he had seven Pakistan cricketers working for him. Majeed . named ‘his’ players as Butt, fast bowlers Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Amir . and Wahab Riaz, wicket keeper Kamran Akmal, and batsmen Omar Akmal and . Imran Farhat, although prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee said the agent explained that there . was a ‘little question mark’ about Farhat. Southwark Crown Court also heard Butt, 26, was allegedly taped . confirming that he would deliberately bat a ‘maiden over’ on the final . day of last summer’s Oval Test match, which was a chance for his side to . win their first game of the series. Majeed discussed the arrangement . with the cricketer by phone while agreeing a deal with an undercover . journalist posing as a rich Indian businessman who had paid £10,000 to . fix part of the match, jurors heard . Majeed assured Mr Mahmood, also known as the fake sheikh for his undercover reporting work, Butt would score no runs in his first full over at the Oval the next day, on August 21 last year. Accused: Salman Butt, left, and Mohammad Asif deny conspiracy to cheat . and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments in relation to a allegation . they agreed to fix a Test at Lords Cricket Ground . No Ball: Pakistan's Mohammed Asif bowled this no ball during day one of the npower Fourth Test at Lord's Cricket Ground . When the journalist pointed out that a . maiden over could happen ordinarily, the agent rang the cricketer on . speaker phone to prove he was involved in the fixing scam, the court . heard. Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC said: ‘If not party to this corrupt agreement, you might expect Butt to say something to the effect of ‘What are you talking about?’’ When Mr Mahmood pointed out that the cricketer sounded asleep during the phone call, Majeed is said to have said: ‘Believe me, he’s done this many times.’ The journalist asked whether Butt . could be trusted, to which the agent allegedly replied: ‘Salman is one . million per cent trustworthy.’ But . on August 21 Butt did not play the maiden over as planned at the Oval . after he ended up batting earlier than expected, the court heard. Captain: The court heard Salman Butt betrayed his team and his country by his alleged involvement in the cricket scandal . Allegations: The group is accused of trying to fix parts of a test match at Lord's Cricket Ground last year . Mr Jafferjee said: ‘As events were to transpire at the Oval, matters were somewhat out of Butt’s control. To bat a maiden over requires very considerable control, which he is talented enough to manage, but not when he faces a hard, solid new ball at the beginning of the innings.’ The jury was also read earlier texts sent between Majeed and Butt in May last year in which they allegedly discussed fixing games at the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies. In one message the agent allegedly wrote: ‘This will only work if you score in the first two overs and no wickets.’ The undercover reporter complained to Majeed after Butt failed to bat the promised maiden over at the Oval Test, the court heard. Mr Jafferjee said: ‘The journalist asked ‘What went wrong?’. Majeed explained that Butt had come in much too early with the ball new and hard, and he was forced to take the run.’ As . Mr Mahmood pressed for results, the agent became indignant that his . credentials were being questioned and claimed that his Indian . ‘customers’ would pay £400,000 without the kind of proof provided to the . reporter, the prosecutor said. Bowler Mohammad Amir, left, and agent . Mazhar Majeed . Majeed told the journalist that the cricketers he worked with had agreed to fix parts of their next game for him during two ‘brackets’ - a set period on which to bet - in return for £150,000, the court heard. The agent allegedly said: ‘They’re not willing to give you anything, until you give a large, substantial amount. Ten grand is peanuts.’ On August 25, the day before the final Test match of the series between England and Pakistan at Lord’s, the journalist met Majeed in a room at the Copthorne Tara hotel off Kensington High Street in central London. The jury was shown a covertly-filmed video of Mr Mahmood handing £140,000 in £50 notes to the agent, who counted out the money on a table in front of him. The agent said in the film: ‘I’m telling you, if you play this right, you’re going to make a lot of money.’Majeed . promised the reporter that Pakistan fast bowlers Amir, 19, and Asif, . 28, would deliver three no-balls at specific points in the Lord’s Test, . the court heard. ‘To show we are serious I’m going to give you three no-balls. No-balls are the easiest and the clearest,’ he allegedly said. Under the spotlight: Mohammad Amir, left, Salman Butt, right, and Mohammad Asif, centre, pictured after the New of the World published its story in September last year . In the video the agent told the journalist that the no-balls would be delivered by Amir as the first ball of the third over, by Asif as the last ball of the 10th over and by Amir as the last ball of his first over to a right-handed England batsman. Majeed allegedly said the no-balls would be ‘well over the mark’ to ensure that they were noted by the match officials. Mr Jafferjee commented: ‘No umpire could possibly miss it. Asif, with his tact and greater experience would bowl a no-ball which could not fail to be called, but only inches over the popping-crease. ‘The relatively hapless Amir would end up bowling no-balls that, as a seasoned cricket statistician will tell you, were the biggest no-balls he’s ever seen.’ Sky Sports footage of the Lord’s match was played in court, and the prosecutor noted that Amir’s first invalid delivery was ‘an enormous no-ball’. Yesterday Mr Jafferjee told the court the cricketers were deeply involved in ‘rampant corruption’ at the heart of the sport. In . his opening speech to the jury he said the men betrayed millions of . fans to cash in on a betting industry worth up to £33billion a year on . the Asian sub-continent alone. Mr . Jafferjee told Southwark Crown Court that the sums gambled overseas . were ‘breathtaking’ and the men were motivated purely by greed. He . said: ‘This case reveals a depressing tale of rampant corruption at the . heart of international cricket, with the key players being members of . the Pakistan cricket team. ‘There . are vast amounts of money to be made in any betting activity if the . results are known in advance, and all of that was at the expense of the . integrity of the game.’ Allegations of match-fixing shook the sport to the core when the now defunct Sunday newspaper published the revelations in August last year. Butt, 26, is accused of orchestrating the conspiracy with good friend and agent Majeed, 36, who then owned Croydon Athletic Football Club. Star bowlers Asif, 29, and Amir, 19, were told to bowl three no-balls at pre-arranged stages of the final Test at Lords -the court heard. The men face up to seven years in prison if they are convicted of corruption and cheating. The trial continues.","Court hears Mazah Majeed and Salman Butt 'discussed fixing games at the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies'

"Last updated at 5:51 PM on 6th October 2011 . Britain's crazy weather took another nutty turn today as snow fell in the Highlands while farmers in the south picked strawberries - and all just days after the country baked in the hottest October on record. Cairgorm in the Highlands was the first place in the UK to experience the chill of winter as the ski slopes on the Scottish resort experienced the first dump of snow. The mountain range south of Inverness saw temperatures plunge overnight turning the hillside white. Weather shock: The first snow of winter fell overnight in Cairngorm in the Highlands of Scotland just days after thousands enjoyed a heatwave in the South East of England . Deep and crisp and even: Walkers at Cairngorm in the Highlands are among the first to enjoy the frosty delights of winter . The Mountaineering Council of Scotland (MCofS) said the snow had fallen where snow patches from last winter had survived through the summer months. While the south of country baked last weekend, small patches of snow remained on the hillside from one of Scotland's hardest winters on record. With snow falling overnight in the north, there were hailstorms in the Thames Valley in the south, which baked in 85F heat just days ago. Hilly areas and country lanes around Hungerford in Berkshire were briefly turned white when hailstones the size of frozen peas pelted the area. Forecasters are predicting chilly times ahead with frost expected across England at the weekend. Strawberry picking in OCTOBER! Jill Ivens at Hill Farm, Chesterton, with the unseasonable crop . And yet as parts of Britain shivered under wintery conditions, some farmers have been reporting extremely unseasonable events. With farmers in Cambridgeshire picking their second crop of strawberries this year and in north Devon, 'spring' lambs have been born four months early. Farmer Paddy . Ivens is normally turning his attention to pumpkins but this year he is . still picking strawberries. THIS EVENING . Showers will ease, become less widespread and largely confined to . western parts of the UK overnight. Clear spells will develop elsewhere. It will stay windy though, and fall quite chilly in a few sheltered . rural locations. FRIDAY . Blustery at first, although northwest winds . generally easing through the day. There will be sunny spells for most, . although with some showers, mainly in western parts of the UK. SATURDAY . Generally cloudy, with periods of rain and brisk westerly winds for . many. Some drier and brighter spells are likely though, mainly in . southern England. Temperatures a little above normal. Mr Ivens, 48, who runs the family farm with his mother Jill, in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, was shocked to see an . incredible two acres of his strawberry plants suddenly bearing fruit . again this week. He has . now seen a rush from pick-your-own customers to harvest the late . strawberries, which have made an autumn comeback for the first time ever . at his Hill Farm in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Mr Ivens said: 'It is bizarre, we've . been doing pick your own strawberries here for 30 years and this has . never happened before. 'The . hot autumn weather has tricked the strawberry plants into thinking it . is late spring and they are throwing out lots of fruit. 'It's . very strange to see people picking strawberries in October, we're . normally sizing up for the pumpkin market at this time, but the weather . is so good no one is interested in them.' And he is not alone in finding his farm turned upside down by the unpredictable weather. Farmer Edward Gay from North Devon believes the weather has been responsible for 'tricking' his flock into thinking it was time to mate. Sheep usually go to ram during warmer weather in August or September and give birth 20 to 21 weeks later in February and March. Strawberry picking in October: Alexa Grant, two, at Hill Farm, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire . But Mr Gay believes the unusually hot spell in April fooled his flock in Riddlecombe, north Devon, into thinking summer had arrived - and they mated five months early. An unseasonably cold summer followed and the perfect warm spring weather for lambing arrived in the last week. He said he was stunned when the five spring lambs arrived because he had no idea they were even pregnant. It was the second time their mothers had given birth this year - which experts say it virtually unheard of. Un-ewe-usal: A 'spring' lamb was born on September 28, four months early. An warm and dry April, followed by a cold summer washout, fooled the sheep into thinking autumn had already arrived prompting them to mate . Second coming: 'Spring' lambs have been born early in Riddlecombe, Devon, after the weather tricked the flock into breeding out of season . He said: 'It took me completely by surprise. I went down early in the morning to feed the sheep and count them as I usually do. 'I noticed one was missing and found her under a hedge scraping at the floor and creating a bed. It was a hell of a shock. She'd already had lambs once this year. 'Then, when I went around the rest of the flock I saw two others had dropped udders too and I ended up with two sets of twins and one single. 'The only explanation I can think of . is that because we had such a wonderful April they thought it was summer . and had mated again. I've never seen anything like it and it has to be down to the odd seasons we seem to have had this year.' The suddenly wintery conditions sweeping the country is in sharp contrast to the weekend's weather, when three-quarters of a million sun-worshippers . visited beaches in Brighton and Bournemouth as Britain basked in . the third hottest day of 2011, at 30c (86f). Bournemouth council had to pull its . deckchairs and sun-loungers out of storage and shopkeepers across the . South-East reported shortages of ice creams due to the out-of-season . demand. At RAF Finningley in South Yorkshire . on Saturday, forecasters MeteoGroup recorded the 30c high, with . Gravesend in Kent reaching an exceptional 29.6c (85.3f). Both temperatures beat the record for . October – 29.4c (85f) in Cambridgeshire in 1985 – and ensured the UK . boasted better weather than almost all of Europe, the Caribbean, the . Middle East and the Sahara. Laghouat, the Algerian city on the northern . edge of the desert, managed only 22c (72f).

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 11:52 AM on 29th June 2011 . Republican presidential candidate . Michele Bachmann is probably already growing tired with the Tea Party . comparisons to Sarah Palin. But . it seems she is already following in Mrs Palin’s footsteps of making . unfortunate public gaffes after pulling a clanger in a television . interview. Mrs Bachmann, . 55, said she would work in the 'spirit of John Wayne from Waterloo' - . who is not the actor, but the serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Oops: Michelle Bachmann, 55, said she would work in the spirit of John Wayne - but the John Wayne from her home town is the serial killer John Wayne Gacy . She used her home town of Waterloo, . Iowa, to launch her official campaign to become the Republican . presidential candidate in the 2012 election. ‘Well . what I want them to know is just like, John Wayne was from Waterloo, . Iowa. That's the kind of spirit that I have too,’ she told Fox News. The . actor John Wayne, born Marion Morrison, was from Winterset, which is . still in Iowa - but around 150 miles away from Waterloo. John . Wayne Gacy, also known as the 'Killer Clown', was executed in 1994 for . raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men. Mixed up: John Wayne, left, was an actor born in Winterset, Iowa, but John Wayne Gacy, right, was a serial killer who came to Waterloo, Iowa, from Chicago, Illinois . Gacy was born in Chicago, Illinois, . before moving to Waterloo, where he lived for a short time and also had . his first criminal conviction. It was for an attempted homosexual assault and it landed him in prison for 18 months, reported The Washington Times. He . then moved back to Iliinois and began his six-year killing spree . between 1972 and 1978 before being later convicted and sentenced to . death. 'We cannot afford four more years of Barack Obama. Make no mistake about it, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. Mr President, your policies haven't worked (and) spending our way out of the recession hasn't worked' Michele BachmannRepublican 2012 presidential candidate . Mrs Bachmann's team . have since tried to clear up what she meant, saying that John Wayne's . parents lived in Waterloo, although their son did not. They moved to Winterset before he was born, reported ABC. The outspoken Tea Party favourite also tore into President Obama as she sought to capitalise on . soaring poll ratings and cast herself as the 'bold choice' for a . Republican President. After a week of winning right-wing praise for hardline opinions on subjects from energy-saving light bulbs to gay marriage, the Minnesota congresswoman told supporters: 'We can't afford four more years of . Barack Obama'. The . 55-year-old was in her native Iowa to launch an official bid, with . surprise polls predicting her as a force in the state that opens the GOP . nomination contest, putting her well ahead with Mitt Romney. Outside . a historic mansion in Waterloo, Mrs Bachmann said she is waging her . campaign 'not for vanity', but because voters 'must make a bold choice . if we are to secure the promise of the future'. 'We can't afford four more years of . Barack Obama,' she said. '(He) will be a one-term president. Mr . President, your policies haven't worked (and) spending our way out of . the recession hasn't worked. Great setting: Mrs Bachmann speaks to supporters during her announcement outside a historic mansion . Waving: Mrs Bachmann and her husband Marcus stood together after she addressed supporters . 'We cannot afford four more years of . millions of Americans who are out of work and are not making enough in . wages to support a family. 'We can't afford the unconstitutional health care law that costs so much and delivers so little. 'The . liberals, and to be clear I am not one of those, want you to believe . the Tea Party movement is just the right wing of the Republican Party. Nothing could be further from the truth. 'Our . problems don't have an identity of party, they are problems that were . created by both parties. Americans aren't interested in affiliation, . they're interested in solutions.' Meanwhile, . her amped-up looks and wardrobe choices are causing a stir in the . fashion world, with a carefully-considered pale grey dress and matching . jacket outfit seen as tasteful and understated. After the formal Iowa kick-off, she . plans to shift her focus to New Hampshire and South Carolina - other . states with traditions of separating the viable contenders from the . political also-rans. Mrs Bachmann’s . hardline approach to issues such as gay marriage has already seen her . declare she would issue a constitutional amendment to make marriage . between a man and a woman only. Her ideologies have earned her a loyal . following but also plenty of guff from those who see her as a fringe . politician - and many analysts say she has a me-against-the-world view . of politics. ‘Her trick is going to be to maintain that boldness and to somehow reign it in and discipline it so it works for her and not against her,’ GOP pollster Mike McKenna said. ‘She's a hell of a lot closer to where the party is right now than where (the other candidates are).’ So to shore up her campaign she has recruited aides in Iowa and New Hampshire who worked on the campaigns of previous presidential hopefuls Mike Huckabee and John McCain. She insists her combative style will . give her something different to her measured rivals such as governors . Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman and former House Speaker Newt . Gingrich. Audience: Bachmann, who was born in Waterloo, Iowa, will continue her announcement tour this week with stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina . Applause: Michele Bachmann, pictured right with her husband Marcus, enjoyed a rapturous reception . ‘I've been consistent, nothing but . consistent,’ Mrs Bachmann said. ‘I don't say things for political value. I'm authentic in what I say.’ Other candidates are ex-Senator Rick . Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and businessman Herman Cain. Texas . Governor Rick Perry and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin could . also join. Mrs Bachmann . has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal . President Obama's healthcare law - as well as saying GOP House leaders . are too timid on federal spending cuts. She . also believes in more abortion restrictions and constitutional . amendments to ban gay marriage, as well as having a strong belief in . family values after raising five children and 23 foster kids. However . she can be fierce, accusing President Barack Obama of pushing the . country towards socialism - and is known by her opponents to be . unwilling to budge on her views, even in tough races. ‘She's not a manoeuverer. At the end of . the day she is going to distinguish herself by going out there and . trying to draw people to her,’ said David Strom, a Republican involved . in Minnesota politics. Iowa strength: Polls are predicting Mrs Bachmann, left, to be a force in the state that opens the GOP nomination contest and putting her well ahead of the chasing pack with Mitt Romney, right . Opinions: Mrs Bachmann has a hardline approach to issues such as energy-saving lightbulbs and gay marriage . Democrat Elwyn Tinklenberg, who lost to . her in a 2008 congressional race, said he was frustrated that the more . controversial Mrs Bachmann came off, the stronger she seemed to get. ‘She can say something that's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat' Former competitor Elwyn Tinklenberg . Her comments often fuel a fundraising machine that netted her $13.5 million for her last election. ‘She can say something that's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat,’ Mr Tinklenberg said. Tea Party members are seeking purity from the GOP candidates and have reacted sceptically to those largely linked to the party power brokers, particularly Mr Romney. But she has already provoked the fury of green campaigners after joining with senior Republicans in vowing to repeal a law on energy-saving light bulbs because they believe it breaches human rights. The 2007 law, which is set from January to introduce energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, is being contested by more than a dozen right-wing politicians, including Mrs Bachmann. Tender moment: Mrs Bachmann has been married to Marcus for 33 years and they have five children . Big support: Mrs Bachmann has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal President Obama's healthcare law - as well as saying GOP House leaders are too timid on federal spending cuts . 'The government has no business telling an individual what kind of light bulb to buy,' Mrs Bachmann said while introducing her 'Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act' earlier this year. Mrs Bachmann hit back after Chris Wallace asked her on Fox News if she is a 'flake'. 'I think that would be insulting to say something like that because I'm a serious person,' she said. 'I'm 55 years old. 'I've been married 33 years. I'm not only a lawyer, I have a post-doctorate degree in federal tax law from William and Mary. 'I've worked in serious scholarship, my husband and I have raised five kids, we've raised 23 foster children. 'We've applied ourselves to education reform. We started a charter school for at-risk kids. I've also been a state senator and member of the United States Congress for five years.' Mr Wallace has since admitted he 'messed up' with the question and 'didn't mean any disrespect'. She added at a party gathering in June: 'President Bachmann will allow you to buy any light bulb you want in the United States of America.' Mrs Bachmann has also come out against gay marriage as a new same-sex law was approved in New York, but also said it was up to individual states to decide whether they allowed it. 'Every time it's going on the ballot, the people have decided to keep the traditional definition,' she said. 'After all, the family is the fundamental unit of government.' Mrs Bachmann has also said 'scare tactics' are being used by those warning of an economic calamity unless Congress raises the government's borrowing limit by an August deadline. She claimed the U.S. could avoid a default by paying only the interest on U.S. obligations while lawmakers work on a deal to cut spending dramatically as part of a new debt ceiling. In an Iowa poll of GOP candidates conducted for The Des Moines Register, former Massachusetts governor Romney is ahead with support from 23 per cent - but Mrs Bachmann is close on 22 per cent.","Actor John Wayne, born Marion Morrison, was from Winterset .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:00 PM on 15th July 2011 . Meteoric rise, and ignominious fall: Former chief executive of News International Rebekah Brooks . As a young reporter, at the beginning of her career, Rebekah Brooks was described by her editor as 'the most ambitious person I have ever met'. Mystic Meg, an early friend and colleague, couldn’t have forecast it better. It took 20 years for the Cheshire-born redhead to rise from researcher on the News of the World’s Sunday magazine to the head of News International, the UK arm of Rupert Murdoch’s global empire. At each stage of her meteoric rise her ability to survive in the cut-throat world of newspapers, dominated by middle-aged male executives, was questioned. 'It won’t last,' was a favourite comment said behind her back. They were right. But it was her determination, hard work and total focus on her career that got her noticed, and promoted. Early critics harped at her lack of a traditional hard-news apprenticeship, she hadn’t served her time on local papers. But her secret weapon was that most traditional of journalistic tools, the ability to target and foster important contacts. And her skill was to remain friendly with them after the stories had run. During her first job at News International, as feature writer on the News of the World’s Sunday magazine, she was sent to interview footballer Paul Gascoigne, who had moved to Rome to play for Lazio, and his wife Sheryl. Rebekah turned up at the airport to travel out with the couple to discover that she was being joined on the trip by a very experienced reporter from a rival newspaper. Most young journalists would have buckled and come back empty-handed. Rebekah unleashed the charm that would shape her career to befriend Paul, and more importantly, Sheryl. She came back with her first splash for the News of the World and the first of many strong contacts that would help shape her future career. Patsy Chapman, the then editor of the News of The World, was impressed and within days Rebekah was yanked 'upstairs' to join the paper. On her way to the top: News of the World editor Phillip Hall (centre) was succeeded in 2000 by Rebekah Wade, as she then was. The appointment came just days before her 32nd birthday . Arm in arm with Rupert Murdoch, Rebekah leaves Christopher's restaurant in London six years ago. The News Corp chairman is the most important person she has charmed in her career. In 2009 he appointed her chief executive of News International . 'It’ll never last,' was muttered around El Vinos. But times were changing for newspapers, and their staff. The . market was becoming more competitive and the pressure to be sharper . than the rest was growing. Long liquid lunches were on the way . out. Rebekah put in the hours, always going the extra yard to give herself an edge in her quest to move up. For . instance when fellow colleagues moaned that they didn’t have a clue . what was going on in TV soaps, as they were never home in time to see . them, Rebekah had them taped for her. As . she waited for the first edition of the paper to print she used her one . bit of down time to watch the tapes and catch up on the storylines, . making sure she could answer Piers Morgan’s quickfire questions he fired . at his staff during his editorial conferences as editor of The News of . The World. And so she impressed and moved up through the ranks of the features desk to become features editor and then deputy editor. She summed up her early struggles up the newspapers career ladder with this recollection from her 2009 Hugh Cudlipp lecture to aspiring journalists at the London College of Communications. 'When at the age of 27, I was made deputy editor of the News of the World, some struggled with the concept. 'At a corporate event, a senior male executive lost the buttons off his shirt. 'The editor and I were busy meeting and greeting our high profile guests when suddenly a shirt and some buttons were thrust into my hand. ""When you’ve got a minute darling‘ – sew ‘em back on for me."" 'Despite needlework not being my strong point, I did have the shirt ready in time. 'And we were all sorry to hear what happened to him!' He didn’t last. The toughest part of working at a red top tabloid, with its constant 'turning over' of people is keeping hold of your contacts. Mixing with the highest society: Rebekah Brooks and Piers Morgan meet the Queen during a reception for the media at Windsor Castle in 2002. Brooks is adept at charming contacts and then keeping them . Leading the high life: Brooks meets the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall at The Sun Military Awards at Hampton Court Palace in 2008 . But Rebekah had the unique flair for befriending people that were important to her and keeping hold of them. She worked hard at making sure celebrities and their agents fell for her charm. She was tagged, 'The most charming tabloid operator of all time'. She even took golf lessons so as she could network at the News International celebrity golf tournament. It worked. On the course she met Ross Kemp, then one of TVs' biggest stars thanks to his role as Grant Mitchell in EastEnders. Friends and neighbours: Rebekah Wade with David Cameron during a book launch in 2009. When she threw a Christmas party at her Cotswold home last December, top of the invite list were near neighbours the Camerons . She met Ross Kemp, Grant Mitchell in EastEnders, at the News International celebrity golf tournament. He wooed her with a £20,000 engagement ring, but the marriage didn't last . He was smitten, wooed her with a £20,000 art deco engagement ring and they married in 2002 in Las Vegas. The . marriage didn’t last, in fact it exploded in November 2005 when Rebekah . was arrested for an alleged assault on hard man Ross. She was released without charge and went straight from the police station to the morning news conference she was due to chair. For . once, the usually boisterous room was hushed as the news editor read . through his list of news stories getting no reaction from a head-bowed . Rebekah. By chance or design he had left on his list an item about domestic violence. Rebekah’s reaction sums up her abilty to deal with adversity. With all eyes on her, she looked up with a smile that said, 's**t happens'. The room erupted with laughter and normal service was restored. As her career moved up so did her circle of contacts and friends. After a spell as deputy editor of The Sun in 1998, where she questioned whether it was time to stop running the Page Three girls, she became, at the time, the youngest editor of national British newspaper just days before her 32nd birthday when she was appointed editor of the News of the World in 2000. It was there, following the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, that she launched her controversial Sarah’s Law campaign to name to name and shame convicted sex offenders. 'I had just joined the News of the World as editor,' she explained, 'and after the daily pace of The Sun was frustrated by the waiting room atmosphere of a Sunday paper newsroom on a Tuesday. Courting controversy: Rebekah Brooks with Sara Payne, mother of murdered Sarah Payne. Brooks campaigned for Sarah's Law, to name and shame sex offenders . 'So I took a chance and drove down to see Sarah’s parents Mike and Sara. 'The press pack waiting outside were more than a little surprised when I turned up on the doorstep. 'Inexplicably Mike and Sara agreed to see me and the repercussions of that meeting started the Sarah’s law campaign.' In 2003 she became the first female editor of The Sun. The Sun prides itself on its political influence. Its owner Rupert Murdoch expects it. Rebekah made sure she delivered. She became close friends with then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie. When Rebekah married former racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks in 2009 wedding guests included Tory leader David Cameron and Prime Minister Gordon Brown. And when Rebekah threw a Christmas . party at her Cotswold home last December, top of the invite list were . near neighbours the Camerons. Rebekah with Piers Morgan, her former editor at the News of the World, and with close friend Tony Blair . But the most important person she has charmed in her career is Rupert Murdoch. In 2009 he appointed her chief executive Officer of News International. Media commentators refer to her as 'close to the family' and for her birthday Rupert gave her an original painting by L S Lowry. Way things were: Elisabeth Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at a lunch for women in business at 10 Downing Street. Today it emerged that Miss Murdoch allegedly accused her erstwhile friend of 'f******' the company . Special guest: Rebekah joins Elisabeth Murdoch on her hen night . As the phone hacking scanda grew, Rupert Murdoch showed his support for Rebekah. He was pictured smiling as . he left a restaurant in central London with his arm round her following an hour-long meeting at his luxury flat last weekend. When asked what his top priority was, Murdoch gestured at her and said: 'This one'. As pressure grew for Rebekah to . resign, with even David Cameron calling the action 'truly . dreadful', he said: 'Recent . allegations of phone hacking and making payments to police with respect . to the News of the World are deplorable and unacceptable. 'I . have made clear that our company must fully and proactively cooperate . with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News . International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah . Brooks' leadership.' And, while the media commentators . predicted and awaited the news of Rebekah’s resignation, Murdoch once . again pulled the rug from under their feet by choosing to close the . 168-year News of The World instead. But in the end even that monumental decision couldn't save the fiercely ambitious high-flier. Today it emerged that Rupert's daughter Elisabeth allegedly said Rebekah had 'f****** the company'. They said it wouldn't last. It hasn't. Rebekah and Charlie Brooks married two years ago. Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha have regularly dined with Mrs Brooks and her husband .","Deputy Editor of NotW by the age of 27, then first female editor of The Sun .

"By . James Chapman and Hugo Duncan . Last updated at 2:33 PM on 15th September 2011 . Britain is drawing up contingency plans for a catastrophic collapse of the euro which experts fear could plunge our economy back into a recession ‘beyond comprehension’. Economists believe the EU would be unlikely to survive a disorderly break-up of the euro and say that even stronger economies could contract by as much as 25 per cent in the aftermath. Amid a mounting sense of inevitability that Greece will default on its massive debts and be forced to leave the single currency, the U.S. urged EU governments to use ‘overwhelming force’ to address the debt crisis. U.S. treasury secretary Tim Geithner, . who will take the unusual step of attending a meeting of EU finance . ministers in Poland tomorrow, admitted Washington had been ‘behind the . curve’ in tackling its own financial crisis but urged Europe to act . decisively. A policeman clashing with an anti-austerity protester near the Italian Parliament building in Rome . Protesters and riot policemen clash in front of the Italian parliament in Piazza Montecitorio . Yesterday . ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the credit ratings of two of France’s . largest banks, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, because of their . exposure to Greek debt causing panic on French stock markets. The ratings agency left France’s . largest bank, BNP Paribas, on review, saying its profitability and . capital base gave it an adequate cushion to support its Greek, . Portuguese and Irish exposure. World markets rose sharply after European leaders vowed to help Greece avoid default in a bid to sooth trader jitters. The leaders of Greece, France and Germany - in a telephone conference call - agreed Greece was an 'integral part' of the eurozone. And Greece promised to stick to agreements on debt reduction - a condition of the further bailout package from other European nations. The FTSE-100 was up more than 70 points or 1.44 per cent this morning, with the Dax and Cac-40 both up 1.9 per cent. Overnight, Japan's Nikkei rose 1.5 per cent, South Korea's Kospi 0.6 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng 0.5 per cent and Australia's ASX 200 0.8 per cent. Benchmarks in Singapore, Taiwan and New Zealand also rose, although most Chinese stocks were unaffected. Pulling together: Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have insisted Greece is in 'integral part' of the euro . Moody's has downgraded Societe Generale and Credit Agricole because of their exposure to Greek debt . Yesterday, U.S. stocks saw their third day of gains in a row. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 140.88 points, or 1.3 per cent. Uri Landesman, president of the New York hedge fund Platinum Partners, said worries over Greece have gone too far because it won't be allowed to default. 'They're just not going to let them [the Greeks] go under,' he said. 'That's just not happening. I think people have learned the lesson from letting Lehman Brothers fail.' Despite today's reassurances, even the most die-hard pro-Europeans appear to accept that the eurozone is in terminal trouble. Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord . Ashdown, a long-time supporter of the single currency, asked in an . interview with The Spectator whether he thought the euro could survive . in its current form, replied: ‘No, I don’t.’ ‘The . most likely outcome is probably a core euro, a euro that has Germany, . Austria, Finland and the Benelux countries in it – you’d have to have . France in there for political reasons, even though economically they . wouldn’t come up to the mark precisely – and maybe Sweden. ‘Then you have a core euro and you then create the institutions to govern the euro.’ Martin Callanan, Conservative leader in Brussels, said: ‘The thing is in absolute crisis. Everybody is panicking over here. ‘And it seems to me the least worst . option is to accept the inevitable for Greece to default on its debt, . leave the euro and devalue its currency and then give it space to . restructure’. But he warned that Britain could be caught in the fallout as the eurozone collapses. Andrew . Lilico, chief economist at analysts Europe Economics, said the collapse . of the euro would almost certainly mean the end of the EU. ‘The . EU is most unlikely to continue without the euro,’ he said. ‘Sudden and . disorderly collapse of the EU would induce a massive further phase of . recession.’ He referred to . predictions by the Swiss bank UBS of a 20-25 per cent contraction in . gross domestic product for strong countries and 50 per cent for weak . countries. ‘I happen to think that the UBS figures are somewhat emotional,’ he said. ‘But it would certainly involve a recession on a scale beyond modern experience or comprehension in a Western democracy.’ In an extraordinary sign of alarm across the globe, five big developing countries said they were ready to discuss bailing out Europe. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – the ‘BRICS’ countries – are to meet at the annual World Bank and International Monetary Fund summit next week to talk about providing emergency assistance. The head of the World Bank said the global economy had entered a new ‘danger zone’ and that the ‘time for muddling through’ was over. Robert Zoellick said: ‘Unless Europe, Japan, and the United States can face up to responsibilities they will drag down not only themselves but the global economy. They have procrastinated for too long on taking the difficult decisions, narrowing what choices are now left to a painful few.’ Treasury sources believe that Germany is now resigned to the eurozone breaking down in its current form and a new European ‘inner core’ being created. There is an increasing expectation that this will mean a new EU treaty. Downing Street confirmed that officials were working on ‘contingency plans’ aimed at trying to insulate Britain from a full-blown crisis in the eurozone, but refused to speculate about what form they would take. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in a speech on the economy, warned: ‘The economic context is much worse than before. Yes, facts have changed.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls warned of the danger of a ‘massive economic catastrophe’ on a larger scale than the banking crash in 2008. ‘The issue now isn’t really Greece, it is what is happening in Spain and in particular Italy,’ he said. Polish finance minister Jacek Rostowski, who will chair a meeting of EU finance bosses tomorrow, said the EU could be destroyed by the debt crisis. But the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, insisted that the answer to the growing threat to the euro was a more, and not less, integrated EU.","Stronger economies could contract by 25% if EU falls apart .

"Joseph Pedersen and Holly Grigsby captured in car belonging to missing teen . Supremacist tattoos disguised with band aid and roll-neck top . Wanted for questioning over murder of stepmother and disappearance of father in Oregon . By . Lucy Buckland and Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 1:01 AM on 7th October 2011 . The white supremacist couple who were wanted in connection with the death of a woman and disappearance of her husband have been arrested, and police believe they murdered the Oregon teenager who went missing last week. Authorities are not sure how the paths of a teenager who called . his mother daily and two white supremacists fleeing a murder scene in . Washington state crossed in Western Oregon's Willamette Valley. Cody Myers, from Oregon, who had thoughts of joining the ministry was found dead yesterday in woods near his home, the victim of 'homicidal violence'. Scroll down for video . Supremacist: These booking photos released on Thursday show Holly Grigsby, a suspect in the death of her boyfriend's stepmother and an Oregon teenager . David Pedersen, who has a plaster on his cheek and a roll-neck to hide his tattoos, is handcuffed by California Highway Patrol Officers . Holly Grigsby sits in the back of a police car, having been caught following her alleged rampage with boyfriend Pedersen . The two people who commandeered his . car — subjects of a manhunt in the death of a Washington state woman and . disappearance of her husband — threw up their hands in surrender to . police on Wednesday. An Oregon sheriff called their week-long road trip by down the West Coast 'a vicious, vile reign of terror'. Police had been searching for the couple after Leslie Pedersen, the 69-year-old stepmother of heavily-tattooed Pedersen, was found dead with her hands tied and a bloody pillow strapped to her head. Investigators also linked the pair . with the disappearance of Pederson's father, who has not been seen since . the slaying of his wife. Oregon State Police confirmed that the body they discovered on Tuesday was that of teenager Myers and the cause of death was 'homicidal violence'. Relatives and friends say he was studious, religious and caring. 'Cody was devoted to his family. He . would've done anything for anybody to help anybody,' said his mother, . Susan Myers. 'He had passion for life, for God, for his beliefs. He . didn't deserve this.' Exactly what took place in the woods west of Corvallis, Oregon, is unclear. Police know that Grigsby and Pedersen . were spotted by a camera at a convenience store on Sunday, where they . used a stolen credit card. The card belonged to Pedersen's . stepmother, Leslie Pedersen. She was found dead on September 28. His . father, David Jones Pedersen, is still missing. Armed and dangerous: David Joseph Pedersen, 31, (left) and Holly Grigsby, 24, are linked to a murder and two disappearances . A martial-arts expert with a . prominent white-supremacy tattoo on his neck, Pedersen spent the ages of . 16 to 31 in one form of incarceration or another, save for a one-year . stretch in the mid-2000s. Even while in prison, Pedersen . couldn't avoid trouble. Major disciplinary infractions included assault, . extortion, disobedience, harassment and destruction of property. Grigsby, whose white supremacist . leanings were made clear to her fellow inmates at Coffee Creek . Correctional Facility, also found herself in trouble in prison, getting . written up for assault and possession of contraband. Oregon State Police said Pedersen and Grigsby were seen on Sunday morning in the Plymouth Breeze . that Mr Myers was driving when he left his . Willamette Valley home for the Oregon coastal town Newport for a jazz festival on Saturday. Grigsby was dating Pedersen, but is married to Dannel Larson of Portland, Oregon. He said his wife is simply gullible, . the victim of a person capable of manipulating her into doing things she . never would otherwise . 'That man,' Mr Larson said, 'took her on a road straight to hell.' Missing: Teenager Cody Myers (left) has been found dead after disappearing on Saturday. His mother Susan (right) had been 'hoping for a miracle' after reports his car was used by the wanted pair . They somehow came into contact with . Cody Myers, who worked two summers for a relative's construction . company, said the company's owner, Mike Klein. When the crews would go on the road, Cody would call his mother at least once a day. His parents, brother and sister and . other relatives were at a Wednesday night press conference in Salem . where police confirmed the body that had been found was the missing . teen's. Details remain unclear. Pedersen and . Grigsby have been named 'persons of interest'. They were found with . handguns and rifles, all of them loaded, but police have not said how . the 19-year-old died. Pedersen and Grigsby come from a world inhabited by convicts, violence and white supremacists. Grigsby's father, Fred Grigsby of . Portland, said his daughter had been involved with white supremacists, . and also had battled drug addiction. 'She went to treatment. I thought she got her life together,' he said. Dead: Police said Cody Myers was a victim of homicidal violence, which they believe was at the hands of Grigsby and Pedersen . Grigsby spent time in prison for a . variety of charges beginning in 2006, including identity theft and . unauthorized use of a vehicle. After completing probation, she was again sentenced in 2008 on identity theft charges and served two years. Her boyfriend, Pederson, has a white supremacist tattoo on his neck and convictions dating back to 1997. He was first convicted of robbery at . age 16 in Marion County, Oregon, and has spent a total of 13 years in . prison for felony offences that include assault and robbery and sending a . letter threatening to kill a U.S. judge. Pederson was released from prison in May. His time free of bars and handcuffs lasted 134 days. On Wednesday afternoon, California Highway Patrol Officer Terry Uhrich was on a routine patrol in rural Yuba County. He spotted a woman standing next to a parked vehicle, three of its doors open. A man was inside the car. 'I pulled up to the side of them, . just thinking they were needing assistance or something like that. I . asked the female if they were all right. She said they were fine, she . was stretching, he said. 'It kind of hit me that dispatch had . put out a BOL about an hour and a half before — be on lookout for a . stolen vehicle out of Oregon and it had a male and female out of it.' He ran the license number and . confirmed it was Cody Myers' vehicle, then began following the couple as . they drove slowly down the road. After about two miles, they turned . into a side road leading to a church, and Officer Uhrich followed them. He turned on his patrol car lights, . got out and, using his door as a shield, drew his sidearm and ordered . them to turn off the engine. They complied, keeping their hands where he could see them. They occasionally leaned over and kissed. Other officers arrived within minutes . and arrested the couple, finding a rifle and two handguns inside the . stolen car. The handguns were within reach of the suspects. They were taken to a Yuba City police . department holding cell to await interviews by the Oregon State Police . and Everett, Washington, police.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 2:46 PM on 6th October 2011 . The son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour did not realise he was swinging from the Cenotaph because he had grown up in the countryside without access to television, a court has been told. David Spens, Charlie Gilmour's lawyer, made the revelation about his upbringing to the Appeal Court while arguing his client's 16-month prison sentence should be reduced so he can finish his degree at Cambridge University. Mr Spens told the hearing that history student Gilmour was aware of . the significance of the Whitehall monument but 'didn't realise that the . monument from which he was swinging was a war memorial let alone the . Cenotaph.' Paying the price: Charlie Gilmour, pictured with his mother, author Polly Samson, and father Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour during his trial . Gilmour, 21, was 'out of his mind' on LSD, whisky and valium when he indulged in 'outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour' at last December's student riots. He was jailed for 16 months in July after admitting a charge of violent disorder - but his lawyer has argued that the sentence was 'unduly harsh'. Gilmour was seen swinging on the Union Flag at the Cenotaph just hours before he hurled a bin at a car . escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. The student also jumped on the bonnet of the car, . which was carrying close protection officers, blocking the driver's view . of the Prince's Rolls-Royce in front, it was claimed. Gilmour was also accused of twice kicking a window of Top Shop in Oxford Street as staff and customers cowered inside and he was pictured setting fire to a pile of newspapers by the door of the Supreme Court during central London disorder on December 9 last year. Mr Spens argued at a hearing at the Court of Appeal that it couldn't be proved the history student was the man who threw the bin, and he 'didn't remember' doing it. Rampage: Gilmour's lawyer said he had been 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras . He also added it was still 'not too late' for Gilmour to begin his third year at University if he has his sentenced reduced and is released by October 17. Mr Spens said: 'The concern that I have on behalf of Mr Gilmour is that he is keen to know the outcome, whether there's any prosect, by the 17 October this month, for him to resume his studies. 'His case was he could remember being knocked over by the Jaguar's door, he could remember being at the side of the Royles Royce, he could remember sitting on the Jaguar's bonnet. 'He had no recollection of throwing the bin. He is confident if he threw the bin, he would have remembered'. He also argued his client had simply being 'playing the fool' and 'acting up' for cameras during the day. Disputing the length of Gilmour's jail sentence, Mr Spens claimed it was not possible to say for sure the CCTV image of the man throwing the bin was Gilmour despite the figure wearing similiar clothes. He also argued Judge Price hadn't given him sufficient credit for his guilty plea or consider his personal mitigation enough. Mr Spens said: 'I do accept on Mr Gilmour's part that anyone who takes part in violent disorder committed by a body of people adds to the overall criminality of the behaviour and therefore will receive a longer sentence than if he had committed the offence in isolation. 'A shorter, sharp shock would be perfectly sufficient to punish him, and at the same time to send a message loud and clear to others who might be minded to act as he did. 'This sentence was unduly harsh, unnecessarily so, his potential, like that of other young people in his position is being wasted while he spends too long in prison.' The dark side of the son: Charlie Gilmour was seen rampaging through the streets of London and was photographed clambering up the Cenotaph . During the sentencing hearing at Kingston Crown Court, it was said that just before his violent outbursts on December 9 last year, Gilmour had 'binged' on whisky and valium. In his mitigation, Mr Spens explained how Gilmour had become increasingly 'dependant' on drink and drugs since he was rejected by his biological father, the poet and playwrite Heathcote Williams four months before the incident. And the night before, the 'gentle' and 'promising' student had binged on LSD and alcohol. Lord Justice Hughes, sitting with Mr Justice Cranston and Mr Justice Hickinbottom, reserved judgement until next week. Lord Justice Hughes said it was important to wait for the judgement of the Lord Chief Justice in the sentences imposed on the August rioters, in case there were 'implications' for Gilmour's case. He said: 'It seems likely to us that we ought to at least see what the other court has to say about disorder, generally. 'We will reserve judgement because we need to see whether there there is any bearing on this from the judgement due in the other court.' Gilmour was adopted by rock star David Gilmour, worth £78 million, when he married his mother, writer and journalist Polly Samson. The couple were in court to hear the appeal against their son's sentence, but declined to comment.","Charlie Gilmour was undergraduate history student at Cambridge University .

It emerged that the £180,000-a-week Manchester United star had slept with prostitutes while his wife, Coleen, was pregnant. He is currently in Montenegro with . the England team for today's Euro 2012 qualifier. Team manager Fabio . Capello insisted Rooney had not been upset by his father's arrest. 'I found him relaxed and calm,' Capello said. 'There is no problem for the game, he will play against . Montenegro. He told me there are no problems.' On duty: Wayne Rooney (centre) trained today with Phil Jones and Danny Welbeck (left) while his father was questioned . Steve Jennings was arrested after allegedly getting himself sent off deliberately during a match . But Rooney's estranged cousin Stephen, 27, a homosexual and cross dresser, said the arrests were 'embarrassing'. 'It's hysterical, but I'm quite . surprised it's just the two,' he said. 'And they have the cheek to tell . me that putting a dress on is embarrassing for the family.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police . confirmed nine men, aged between 22 and 68, had been arrested in . Liverpool and Glasgow on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud as part of a . joint operation with the Gambling Commission into suspicious betting. Wayne Rooney Snr, footballer Wayne's father, is one of the nine people being questioned over an alleged betting scam . There was no sign yesterday of . unemployed Wayne Snr, a 48-year-old former boxer, at the home he shares . with Rooney's mother, Jeanette, in West Derby, Liverpool. Anthony Barnfather, the lawyer . representing him, said: 'Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these . allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No . further comment will be made at this time.' Neighbours at 54-year-old Richie . Rooney's home, in Croxteth, Liverpool, confirmed a police car had been . parked outside the modest semi in the early hours. He refused to comment . when he returned home on bail yesterday afternoon. Members of the Press soon arrived outside the house of Wayne Rooney snr this afternoon . He spent 20 minutes inside before . being driven off in a Ford Focus by his daughter, Claire. One visitor, . who described himself as a member of the family, said: 'He doesn't know . anything about all this.' England captain John Terry, who has . experienced media attention on his own family, also backed Rooney. 'Wayne is focused on the game tomorrow,' Terry said. 'We all realise the importance of . that. It's important for him to go out there and play his football, . which he loves doing. He'll always be fully focused on the pitch.' Police were alerted after the . Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of . irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Jennings being red-carded. Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool – Rooney's home town. One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000. Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time. The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell. Speaking in the wake of the incident, . Jennings said: 'I want to make it clear I had no involvement whatsoever . in any betting scam. 'I want to clear my name as quickly as possible.' It is understood Jennings became friends with the Rooney family after striking up a friendship with Richie's son, Thomas, 26. By last night all nine men had been released on bail.","Seizures relate to Motherwell/Hearts clash last year .

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 2:27 PM on 6th October 2011 . A 14-year-old boy is being held in a harsh prison cell on the holiday island of Bali for drug possession - one of the youngest foreigners to be arrested in Indonesia. The young Australian faces up to 12 years in jail after being arrested for allegedly being in possession of 6.9 grams of marijuana. The teenager, who was on holiday with his parents and friends, was said last night to be crying in his cell at Denpasar's police headquarters. Holiday resort: The teenager is believed to have been approached by a drug dealer near to Kuta Beach in Bali . Sydney's Daily Telegraph said it had been told by a source on the island that the boy bought the marijuana because he felt sorry for a man who gave him a hard luck story. The source said the boy was on his way to get a massage near the famous Kuta Beach holiday strip when he was approached by a dealer who asked him to buy the drug because he needed the money to buy food. The boy, who comes from the city of Newcastle, 100 miles north of Sydney, is believed to have paid the equivalent of £15 for the marijuana. He went on his way to have the massage and he was arrested shortly afterwards. It is not known whether the dealer had 'shopped' the teenager to the police as part of a sting. Jailed: Schapelle Leigh Corby in Denpasar before her trial. She is serving a 20 year sentence for drug smuggling in Indonesia . Under Indonesia's harsh narcotics laws, drug possession carries a maximum of 12 years behind bars. The country's prisons are notorious for their bleak conditions. Scores of foreigners have been arrested in Bali for drug possession but the teenager is believed to be one of the youngest - if not the youngest ever. Because there are no children's courts and very few children's jails in Indonesia, juveniles are dealt with in adult courts and if convicted end up in adult jails. His only 'respite' is the fact that under law, any case against a child offender must be presented to Prosecutors within a month of arrest, as opposed to 90 days in adult cases. The two highest profile cases in recent years have involved Australians. One involves the so-called 'Bali Nine' who are serving long jail sentences - and two are fighting the death sentence - for heroin smuggling. The other notorious case surrounds Schapelle Corby, who is serving a 20-year sentence for importing 9.3lb of cannabis into Bali.","No child courts and few children's jails in Indonesia .

His opponents will testify to his seemingly super-human fitness levels, but Rafael Nadal has shown that his body is fallible with a dramatic collapse during a press conference at the U.S.Open. Very publicly and without warning, he went into seizure while answering questions in his post-match interview, and while there is no lasting damage the incident vividly showed the physical demands of professional sport. Nadal was answering questions after his victory in the third round of the U.S. Open. Suddenly, the 25-year-old clutched at his right leg and then put his hands to his head as his discomfort grew with the threat that he could go into full body spasm. Scroll down for video . In pain: Rafa Nadal slid off his chair and on to the floor . He slipped back into his leather chair and gently slid down, finally allowing himself to fall to the floor behind the desk. The room was cleared as a physio and . doctor were swiftly sought and, within minutes of being given the . correct stretches and liquids he was walking around as if nothing had . happened. A . similar thing happened to British No 1 Elena Baltacha's opponent Jamie . Hampton on court last week and, again, while that looked dramatic it was . quickly remedied. A grinning Nadal, who went on to do his . round of TV interviews, made light of the whole episode, saying: 'It was . just unfortunate that it happened in the front and back of my leg at . once . 'It's just bad luck that it happened in public. It was really hot, I ran a lot and you sweat a lot in these conditions.' Concern: Nadal later returned to announce he felt cramp in his thigh . As the cramp takes hold Nadal heads for the floor . Going, going, gone: Nadal slides under the desk . Andy Murray thought it was not that unusual an occurrence. 'I don't think it's odd that someone's cramping,' he said. 'I'm sure a lot of people were surprised because it was him that was . cramping, but Rafa's human. I think some people forget that sometimes. 'I think around midday loads of people were struggling with the heat. He very rarely plays that early. 'So . if you mess up like your eating or get it wrong or you're drinking . wrong before the match - and from the parts of the match I saw today he . did quite a lot of running, as well - you can get yourself in a bad way . in these conditions. 'I'm glad he's all right, but I'm sure it was a bit of a shock for him.' Pleasure and pain: Rafa celebrates his victory against David Nalbandian before succumbing to the pain of cramp in the post-match interview . Andy Roddick also played down Nadal's drama, saying: 'Not to put a dampener on the story, which I know you guys think is really big, but people cramp after matches when you're cold. It's just something that happens. 'It's just unfortunate it happened in front of you all. Every single player in there has had that happen before. Every single one.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:59 PM on 5th October 2011 . U.S. farmers believe they are close to getting permission to sell rice in China which would mean a massive boost for an industry that has seen prices stagnate recently. If China opens its markets to U.S. rice, it could cause a spike in demand that drives up prices and encourages farmers to grow more, industry observers said. China is the world's largest producer of rice, but it consumes nearly everything it grows and already imports some rice from Thailand and Vietnam to feed its 1.3 billion people. Harvest time: American farmers believe they are close to getting permission to sell rice to china . The U.S. is the world's fourth-largest rice exporter, shipping to more than 100 countries. But China has resisted opening its markets, saying its inspection agencies have not certified that U.S. rice is safe from disease, bugs and other pests. To help move things along, the U.S. Rice Producers Association invited Chinese inspectors to tour farms in Arkansas, California and Louisiana. The U.S. is currently the fourth largest exporter of rice in the world . China has long had a policy of self-sufficiency in grains, stockpiling crops such as corn, wheat and rice to cope with shortages and avoid having to rely on other countries for essentials. As more migrants move to cities and incomes rise, China's demand for staples has often outstripped its domestic production. It has had to import 'significant quantities' of corn in some years and has grown into the largest importer of soybeans in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's contributed to a spike in demand that's driven up prices for both of those items. The great hope is that as China's middle class becomes wealthier, its members will want to buy high-quality rice from the U.S. even if it's more expensive. 'You think of rice as just rice, but I'm . always surprised by how sophisticated rice palettes are,' said Andy . Hewes, partner in a Texas rice marketing firm and publisher of The Rice . Market Letter. 'Sometimes even the slightest variations can put people . off.' Potential boost: Graph shows average U.S. rice production by rice type and state . Greg Yielding, an official with the U.S. Rice Producers Association, has conducted taste tests where he had . shoppers try different varieties of American rice - the short- and . medium-grain grown in California and the medium- and long-grain rice . grown in Arkansas and elsewhere in the South. But Milo Hamilton, publisher of Firstgrain.com, a rice industry news service, said breaking into China could be tricky. 'You . have to be very careful with the protocol,' he said.

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 12:37 PM on 6th October 2011 . It became one of the most infamous resignations of recent times and catapulted an air steward to worldwide stardom. But a year after Steven Slater swore at a passenger, grabbed some beers and jumped down a plane's emergency chute, he maintains in an interview that he would not change a thing. This is despite being unable to find a job, the criminal conviction that followed  the incident at New York's JFK airport and lurid headlines about his sex life which included the revelation that he is HIV positive. No regrets: Steven Slater before he quit in a storm at New York's JFK airport . In October 2010 Slater pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal mischief, was forced to enter counselling and rehab, and was required to pay his former airline Jet Blue $10,000 in compensation. He had flown off the handle on August 9 during a flight from Pittsburgh after asking a passenger not to remove her belongings from the overhead baggage compartment while the plane was still on the runway. The woman reportedly swore at Slater and grabbed her case anyway, cutting the irate attendant on the forehead with the bag as he tried to intervene. After the plane had stopped and the 100 passengers started shuffling to the exit, Slater's voice was allegedly heard bellowing over the loudspeaker. Dramatic exit: Mr Slater flew into a rage and left the plane via the emergency chute after a passenger tried to retrieve their luggage at the wrong time . Incident: The Jet Blue flight from Pittsburgh to New York JFK was carrying 100 passengers . 'I've had it! To the passenger who called me a mother******, **** you! I've been in this business for 28 years and that's it. I'm done,' he said. Then he grabbed his bags  -  and two cans of beer from the galley  -  and popped the lever for the plane's inflatable emergency chute. With his bags in his lap he slid down to the tarmac, ran to pick up his silver Jeep Wrangler and drove off. An hour later police came to arrest him at his home, where he was in bed with his boyfriend. 'I don't believe in the word regret. It's too strong a word. It's my story. It's what happened. But I don't believe in trying to undo the past. It gave me the chance for the first time in my life to say ""No"",' he said in an interview with the Huffington Post. Folk hero: The air steward who lost his cool found himself an unexpected star, with thousands of fans on Facebook . Fasten your seatbelts: A handcuffed Slater is strapped into the back of a New York City Police Department van after being arrested . 'It gave me the chance to champion myself, to say enough is enough, to take care of myself, to take care of my loved ones, and those were the lessons that I needed to learn. 'I think that at that particular moment in time, most everyone could relate to where I was emotionally at the time.' On the back of his meltdown the recovering alcoholic became a folk hero in America and abroad, and has 185,000 fans on Facebook. T-shirt tribute: The story spread like wildfire across the internet with thousands of people signing up to pages in Slater's name and t-shirts printed in his honour . ...and there's a message on the back directed at the unnamed woman passenger who sparked the outburst . 'Most everyone could relate to doing more with less, being outsourced, being downsized, taking care of aging parents, trying to take care of their children -- it was a familiar place that people could find resonance with. And I think a lot of people found a bit of themselves within me,' he said. Mr Slater is still unemployed and admits he has struggled with the media interest in his life. He also misses his life as a steward but accepts that he will never work again in that industry. He is now preparing a book charting his story, thought to be called 'Cabin Pressure'.","'I've had it!

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 4:55 PM on 6th October 2011 . A school bus driver who crushed a six-year-old boy to death when his vehicle sped out of control was jailed for 28 months today. Adrian Shearing pressed the accelerator instead of the brakes on the 67-seat DAF coach as Nicola Connor dropped off her son, Finlay, at school. They both became trapped between the bus and a Fiat Punto outside the gates of Woodborough School in Pewsey, Wiltshire, when the tragic accident happened. Finlay Connor died after he was crushed between a coach driven by Adrian Shearing . Mrs Connor was then dragged under the . coach for 30 metres until Shearing, 52, managed to stop. She suffered . 'massive injuries' to her legs, pelvis and body but Finlay never . regained consciousness, Winchester Crown Court was told. During the hearing Mrs Connor and Finlay's father Greg . sat in the well of the court during the hearing and wept as the court . was told of the events. Adrian Shearing, arriving in court today, was visibly shaken after the accident . Afterwards the family issued a . statement: 'Finlay Joseph Connor was simply the most perfect son to us . as parents and a wonderful big brother to Louis. 'From the moment he was born he has . brought us all love and joy, he really was a shining star who lit up our . lives each and every day. 'On March 14 Finlay walked hand in . hand to school with his mummy, as we did each and every day, so full, as . always, of excitement for the school day ahead. 'This is my last memory of Finlay, as within just moments of reaching the school gate, the school coach accelerated towards us, running us down. 'In that moment our little boy's wonderful life was ended and his family's lives destroyed. 'Now nearly seven months on, we struggle to live our lives without him. He was so adored and is so missed.' Shearing had only driven the coach . owned by Bodman And Sons once before and was a part-time driver who had . been employed for six months by the company to drop pupils off at . various schools. Shearing, from Trowbridge, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. Moments before colliding with Finlay and Mrs Connor, a tractor had scraped the side of the coach. He was described as 'annoyed but not . angry' before getting back into the bus. In the meantime, the narrow . road outside the school had become blocked with a second tractor wanting . to get through. Finlay's parents, Greg and Nicola, sobbed as they heard details of their son's death on March 14 . Parents had parked further away and were walking in the middle of the road to get to the school gates. Colin Meeke, prosecuting, said: 'The . second tractor driver, Ryan Lanfear, described hearing the bus rev hard . three times and then continuously. 'He could not believe the speed that . the bus took off past him. There are quite a number of witnesses who . describe the high revs and shooting off at some speed.' The barrister said the Fiat was in front of the bus as it sped off. Adrian Shearing was jailed for 28 months for causing Finlay's death . 'In a ghastly coincidence Mrs Nicola . Connor was leading her son by the hand behind the Fiat just as the coach . careered forward into it. 'Both were struck down. Finlay Connor received fatal injuries and did not regain consciousness. 'Mrs Connor suffered massive injuries. There was nothing whatsoever she could have done. She suffers . survivors' guilt but there was nothing anyone could have done.' A visibly shaken Shearing was heard to say after the death that the brakes had failed on the coach. But the court heard it had no defects . and that Shearing had suffered sudden acceleration syndrome, a common . cause of similar accidents involving automatic buses where the driver . becomes confused when he presses the accelerator by mistake and not the . brake and cannot understand why the vehicle will not stop. In mitigation, the court heard . Shearing was an ordinary hard-working family man with no previous . convictions. He accepted the coach was out of control, and gave his . heartfelt sympathy to the family. 'It was his error that caused the . accident. He panicked and slammed his foot down on the accelerator,' his . barrister Michael Hall said. Imposing the prison term and a . three-year driving disqualification, Judge Guy Boney QC accepted . Shearing's culpability in the death was low, but he said: 'The . consequences of your driving come very high. A life has been lost at the . very outset of its course and you ultimately bear the responsibility.'","Driver is jailed for 28 months for causing death by dangerous driving .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 7:26 PM on 6th October 2011 . They fought, and suffered terrible injuries, on battlefields across the world. Now 300 wounded or emotionally-traumatised soldiers will have a little piece of Britain to call their own. A pioneering £27million veterans' village is set to be built on a 55-acre site in the scenic countryside. Pioneering: A new retreat is being built for injured veterans and will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility (2), 200 bungalows (7), a leisure centre (3) and a donkey sanctuary (11) The village will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility, 200 bungalows, leisure centre with swimming pool, social club, lakes, woodland walks and a donkey sanctuary. In a first of its kind in the UK, its population will almost entirely be made up of former troops who have suffered horrific physical or psychological injuries on the battlefield. A large number of servicemen and women will have been badly-wounded in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The project, dreamed up by the Veteran's Retreat charity, would be built on a former tileworks close to the hamlet of Newlands, Northumberland, and the village of Ebchester, County Durham. The trustees will seek planning permission in December and hope to open the first homes and care facility late next year. Despite concerns from local residents that the new development will blight the countryside, the charity points out that it is on a brown-field site that housed a factory. The veterans' village will also create up to 500 jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment and pump money into the local economy. The plans were launched by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, the youngest soldier ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest military decoration for valour. Launch: Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC helped to unveil the new retreat earlier this week and said it would offer something no doctor could . Lance Cpl Beharry, now 32, of the 1st . Battalion, Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, was honoured for saving . members of his unit from ambushes on May 1 and June 11, 2004, in Al- . Amarah, Iraq. He suffered . serious head injuries after a rocket propelled grenade hit a vehicle six . inches from his, causing shrapnel injuries to his face and brain. Yet he managed to drag several comrades to safety. He said: 'For guys to be able to sit down and talk about the old days and what they have been through is something that doctors cannot offer. So we, as ex-servicemen and women, are going to cure ourselves. 'We are regimented and we are one family and we will look after each other. On civvy street you do not have that - this is a good way of continuing friendships.' Gary Russell, who suffered a serious leg injury in a landmine explosion in Bosnia, in 1995, said the village would be welcomed by military veterans. Ambitious scheme: Bill Liddle, who is leading the scheme, hopes it will be completed in five years . The father-of-three, from Consett, County Durham, who served with the Royal Fusiliers, said: 'People who are coming out of the service can find it difficult and may need counselling and medical treatment, such as physiotherapy, if they have been injured. 'When you are with someone who has been through what you have been through, you can talk about your experiences and that makes them easier to deal with. 'To have that sort of environment sitting there waiting for you when you come out, with a bungalow if you are in a wheelchair and with medical facilities on tap, is just a brilliant idea.' Veteran's Retreat hopes to raise initial funds of more than £100,000 to get the project up and running. The ambitious scheme is being led by former military policeman Bill Liddle, 64, who hopes the facility will be completed within five years. He said: 'We want to change the lives of hundreds of ex-service personnel who suffer physical or emotional trauma by providing a unique residential and medical facility, dedicated to the long-term care and support of former troops. 'It was fantastic to witness such over-whelming support, not only from the local community, but also from veterans themselves. This is the least we can do for guys who have given so much.' The Duke and Duchess of Northumberland are the charity's official patrons.","Facility is first of its kind in the UK .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 21st September 2011 . Caravans from the Dale Farm travellers' site have upped sticks and set up an illegal camp 55 miles away leading residents to fear that many more are on their way. Around 20 families have moved from Essex to Stockwood Park, close to Luton in Bedfordshire, after gaining access to a 100-hectare piece of land. Those who stayed at Dale Farm, where travellers have been in a ten-year battle with Basildon Council, were given a last-minute reprieve from the High Court after a judge ruled that the proposed . measures ‘may go further’ than the terms of the enforcement notices. One of the travellers at the site said there were another 40 caravans on their way as people in Luton feared there would be a similar situation to that in Essex. Scores of caravans from Dale Farm are expected to move to Stockwood Park in Luton (pictured) The 100-hectare site neighbours a golf course, horse riding centre and various other outdoor pursuits venues . Although travellers own the Essex site near Basildon they only have planning consent for half the site. However, the whole area is strewn with mobile homes and they have been in a battle with the local council for the last ten years. The Luton site is described as an 'athletics track' and 'riding centre'. Nearby there are golf and rugby clubs, and a children's playground. Travellers first started pitching up on Monday night and it has been alleged that one man arrived in a mobile home, using bolt-cutters to break through the park gates, according to the Sun. One of the travellers, Flint Devons, 29, claimed he had lived at Dale Farm for seven years. He said: 'I moved to Luton rather than wait for the bailiffs because my health was suffering. My son and daughter were already in schools in Essex. Then we had to move and lose it all. 'We came to Luton because we've been here before. The word has now spread back to Dale Farm. There'll be 20 to 40 more caravans coming from Dale Farm. We have nowhere else to go.' People living near the site have . criticised the police and local council for not responding more quickly. One neighbour said: 'I used to look out of my bedroom window and see a . beautiful park. Now it's caravans. I'm sure the gypsies won't cause . trouble. Let's hope it stays that way.' A . spokesman for Luton Borough Council said: 'The council was made aware . of the encampment and immediately started the standard legal procedure . for eviction. We expect to move them on very soon.' Around 60 caravans from Dale Farm (pictured) are expected to pitch up at the site in Luton . The travellers started moving from Dale Farm to Stockwood Park on Monday night . Last stand: Kathleen McCarthy (centre) appealed to Prime Minister David Cameron to stop the eviction . In scenes bordering on farce, the . eviction of Dale Farm began with an all-day stand-off and ended with yet . another legal hitch in a local council’s efforts to clear Europe’s . largest illegal site earlier this week. On one side were protesters and travellers insisting they shall not be moved. On the other, bailiffs and a small . platoon of blue-uniformed officials spouting health and safety concerns . through a loudhailer that didn’t work. HARRY PHIBBS: For Basildon Council to have had to . battle on behalf of their residents for ten years to get the illegal . caravan site on Dale Farm evicted is absurd. The . cost to the Council of the whole operation could be up to £8million. Planning enforcement should be nothing like as long or as costly. Sorting out this mess will not be easier. But . rather than attack the Government for making the situation worse it . should be recognised that they are restoring some semblance of sanity. Localism will help and the Government should press ahead with it. Read more here . But this long-awaited first stage in . the Battle of Basildon was abruptly halted when a judge . sitting 50 miles away granted a last-gasp injunction to delay further . action. Now the operation to clear the site . has been put on hold until at least the end of the week after Mr Justice . Edwards-Stuart ruled at the High Court in London that the proposed . measures ‘may go further’ than the terms of the enforcement notices. Basildon Council was thrown into . disarray last night as its lawyers scrambled to read through the . injunction. Leader Tony Ball hurriedly left a television interview for . an urgent briefing. He didn’t explain the ruling when he . returned to give a brief statement an hour later but said he was 'extremely disappointed and frustrated' by the decision. He added: ‘The motion was put forward . to the High Court without notice, which meant the judge only had one . side of the story and therefore has given the council until Friday to go . back to the High Court to make its argument. ‘I am absolutely clear that, in this . issue on Friday, the court will find in the council’s favour and the . clearance will be able to continue.’ The latest twist came as it was . revealed that the travellers on the site at Crays Hill in Essex have . been offered a total of 38 local authority homes to move from the site. Danger: A sign of the barricade at Dale Farm warning that the 18-year-old girl attached by her neck will be killed if bailiffs open the gate . Basildon Council has suggested a variety of temporary flats and houses . over the past six months in an effort to resolve the decade-long . stand-off. But they were turned down for reasons . including because they smelled of smoke or were made of bricks and . mortar, 'contravening' the travellers' desire to spend their life on the . road. A council spokesman said the . injunction provided a 'blanket ban against the removal of any and all . property' from the illegal camp. A source later said they believed it . might refer to the High Court order earlier this year which stated the . eviction could go ahead and the concrete driveways, ‘hard standings’, . the caravans stand on could be removed. The source added they understood . this failed to refer to fences and some other structures on the . hard-standings, creating a legal loophole. News of the injunction brought whoops . of delight from travellers and supporters. One, who gave her name as . Mary, said: 'Thank God for British justice.' The travellers and . troublemakers had manned the ramparts of their barricade from before . dawn as police, the local council and bailiffs set up camp beside the . main entrance. Fifty-one plots containing homes . built without planning permission are set to be cleared from the . six-acre site, along with their remaining residents, in an operation . which could cost £18million. Like opposing armies, the two sides . emerged into daylight in different uniforms – the authorities a mixture . of orange, yellow and blue, versus the travellers’ preference for . track-suits.

"Grace Ford, from Lancashire, fell through air shaft in hotel reception . By . James Tozer . Last updated at 12:30 AM on 30th September 2011 . A private schoolgirl died after falling 90ft down an air shaft while trying to visit a fellow holidaymaker’s apartment on a trip to Majorca. Grace Ford, 17, was celebrating finishing her A-levels when she met 18-year-old Edward Soppet during a night out in Magaluf. They planned to return to his room, but the building’s porter said no visitors were allowed. 'A tragic waste': Grace Ford, 17, from Lancashire, died of horrific injuries after falling 90ft down an air shaft in Magaluf, Majorca while on a post A-levels party with friends (pictured with a friend who was not involved in the incident) Instead, Mr Soppet apparently helped Grace climb through a window which they thought led to reception – but it opened into an air shaft. She fell 90ft to an internal patio at a lower level of the hotel, breaking both legs and her pelvis, while her friend –  not realising why she had vanished – went to his room alone and fell asleep. Talented: Grace Ford had just completed her A-levels at the £9,000-a-year Kirkham Grammar School in Lancashire . He was arrested after the seriously injured girl was found at the bottom of the shaft, but released without charge. Grace was put in a medically induced coma at Palma Hospital with parents Chris and Suzanne at her bedside, but she died 12 days later after suffering an infection. Full details of the accident in July last year emerged at an inquest this week, after which a family friend described her death as a ‘waste’. Grace, a former pupil at £8,500-a-year Kirkham Grammar School in Lancashire and a keen horserider and athlete, met Mr Soppet, a promising schoolboy rugby player, on July 17 and returned to the Torrenova apartment block where he was staying at about 5.30am.  The hearing in Blackpool was told it had a strict no entry policy for non-guests. So when Grace, from Greenhalgh, near Kirkham, was turned away by the night  porter, the pair found a window which they believed led to  the reception. But it opened into a dark shaft which dropped to an indoor patio area, and Grace fell six storeys, suffering catastrophic fractures to her legs and pelvis as well as internal bleeding. A consultant pathologist gave Grace’s cause of death as complications due to multiple injuries due to the fall. Horrific accident: Miss Ford climbed through a window and fell 90ft down an airshaft to an indoor patio at the Terranova apartment block in Magaluf . Blackpool coroner Anne Hind recorded a verdict of accidental death, adding: ‘She was 17 years old, which is one of the most heartbreaking aspects of all. ‘Her short life has ended because of this terrible thing. All this promise she had of  a wonderful life was brought  to an end.’ After the hearing, Steven Hall, a close friend of Grace’s family who flew out to Majorca to support her parents, said: ‘She was a stunning girl in every aspect. She was a straight-A student and a wonderful athlete. Everything she did was to be the best. She never did anything by half. It’s just a waste.’ Tragedy: Grace Ford fell from the seventh floor of Torrenova . Arrest: Police with Edward Soppet, who was later released after telling a judge he was unaware Grace had fallen . Mr Soppet, who is known as Ted, was . not asked to give evidence at the inquest. Now 19, he is believed to . have finished his A-levels at £27,000-a-year Bloxham School in Banbury . and started university. Last night, his father Allan said he . believed the ‘extremely sad’ accident was down to the amount of alcohol . which had been consumed on the night. Mr Soppet, of Bladon, Oxfordshire, . added: ‘The death and all that followed hit Edward very hard and it has . taken him, and us, a long time to get over.’","Grace Ford, from Lancashire, fell through air shaft in hotel reception ."
"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 2:51 PM on 7th October 2011 . Savaged: John Paul Massey was killed by his uncle's pitbull . Police ignored reports that illegal dogs were being bred in a house where a four-year-old boy was killed by a pitbull, a damning report has revealed. Despite a senior housing officer telling officers that the uncle of little John Paul Massey was breeding illegal dogs in the same property where the youngster was mauled to death, police did nothing. Watchdog bosses have now rapped officers from Merseyside Police for failing to act in the nine months before the child's death. John Paul Massey was savaged by his uncle Christian Foulke's pitbull, Uno, while he was at his grandmother's home in November 2009. The little boy suffered appalling injuries to his head and neck after being shaken like a 'rag doll' by the dog. Foulkes, then aged 22, admitted owning the animal and was jailed for four months last June. A report into the incident centres on officers choosing to reject an earlier report that Foulkes was nurturing illegal dogs at a house in Wavertree, Liverpool, where his mother Helen lived. The Independent Police Complaints Commission described the force's reaction to the initial report a 'inadequate', highlighting a catalogue of errors. Key findings in the report include how: . Two police officers - an acting sergeant and a PC - as well as a member of the police communication staff were given 'management advice' for the inadequate handling of the report following the inquiry. Naseem Malik, IPCC commissioner for the north west, said: 'We will never know with any certainty what might have happened if a different decision had been taken by the officers and staff in February 2009. 'With hindsight it is easy to say that had the police responded differently the dangerous dog may have been seized and John Paul Massey would not have died. 'However hindsight is a wonderful thing. We cannot know for certain what would have happened.' Family tragedy: John Paul Massey's uncle Christian Foulkes (left) and the tragic youngster's mother Angela McGlynn (right) She added: 'What is a terribly sad certainty is that in November 2009 a young, innocent boy lost his life. 'I read the emotional tributes paid to John Paul after his death - he was clearly a well-loved little boy. 'He was too young to know the potential risk posed by that dog. The tragedy is others either were aware, or should have been aware, of the potential risk and they will have to live with that knowledge.' Merseyside Police introduced a dangerous dogs policy following the death of Ellie Lawrenson in St Helens in 2007, which was recognised for good practice by the Association of Chief Police Officers. However, failings in the John Paul Massey case 'undermined' the good work achieved previously. Illegal: Pitbulls are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act . Ms Malik ruled: 'An opportunity was clearly missed which may have resulted in further investigation. 'However this was not due to malice or any deliberate act. Rather it was poor decision making on behalf of the officers and staff involved. 'The officers and staff - the acting Sergeant, the PC who requested the log be closed and the communications room supervisor who closed the log - have been subject to action plans.' Chief Superintendent John Young, from Merseyside Police's Force's Professional Standards Department, said: 'Following the death of John Paul Massey we made a voluntary referral to the IPCC after the investigation discovered that information about potential illegal dog breeding at an address had not been dealt with adequately. 'This information was received by a police call handler nine months before a dog owned by John Paul's uncle and looked after by his grandmother, killed John Paul. 'However, on this occasion appropriate action was not taken. All recommendations made by the IPCC have been implemented.'","Housing officer reported illegal dogs in house nine months before John Paul Massey was savaged .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 9:34 AM on 26th September 2011 . The red squirrel faces extinction in the next two decades as its population has dropped by half in the past 50 years, warn researchers. Efforts through wildlife biodiversity action plans to save British mammals have failed to halt the decline in numbers of red squirrels, as well as hedgehogs, Scottish wildcats and dormice. Red squirrel populations have been hit by invasive grey squirrels, which compete with reds for food and carry a disease which is fatal to their native cousins. And wildlife experts think the animals will soon be confined to remote areas of Britain such as the Scottish Highlands. Under threat: The population of red squirrels has fallen by half in the past 50 years, according to experts . According to a Oxford University report, . numbers of UK hedgehogs have dwindled to about 1.5million, compared . with 30million in the 1950s. A report by the university's wildlife conservation unit for the People's Trust for Endangered Species states that the common dormouse and mountain hare are also under threat, despite the efforts of nationwide biodiversity action plans. The State of Britain's Mammals study claims that seven mammal species whose conservation was given priority status were still declining last year. The report states: 'Although many of Britain's mammals apparently declined significantly in the past 25 years, some appear to have stabilised or even increased in the last decade,' the report states. 1 Red-necked phalarope (pictured) 2 Black-tailed godwit . 3 Scottish wildcat . 4 Capercaillie . 5 Cuckoo . 6 Red squirrel . 7 Turtle dove . 8 Natterjack toad . 9 Brown hare . 10 Hedgehog . 'Of the 25 monitored mammal species native to Britain, half are stable (not necessarily in a good state) or increasing.' Despite the largely negative news from the report, there was some encouragement from the fact that the populations of bats, otters and water voles has increased. Otters in particular have benefited . from cleaner rivers in Britain, following a ban on chemicals used in . sheep dip in the late 1990s. But a combination of pesticides killing their prey, hedgerow low and other factors has seen the UK's hedgehog numbers plummet. The . omens for the red squirrel have also not been helped by the discovery . in Scotland in 2005 of the squirrel pox virus, carried by grey . squirrels. The disease had previously been confined to England, where it has been one of the causes of the huge reduction in the number of red squirrels. David Macdonald, one of the report's authors, warned: 'We expect the future of red squirrels to be confined to a few islands, such as Anglesey and the Isle of Wight, or in the Highlands of Scotland.' He and co-author Dawn Burnham added: 'The last 15 years . have seen some successes, particularly recovery of some rare species. 'However, with the ongoing decline of . once common species, like hedgehogs, it is widely accepted that targets . for the Convention on Biological Diversity, for 2010, were missed. 'In . general, progress has been better for species restricted in range that . could benefit from targeted, site-based, conservation efforts. 'There's been less progress on targets for habitats and many widespread species.' Dying out: The hedgehog is now on the list of the 10 most endangered species in Britain . As well as 'holding the line' by taking steps to protect threatened mammals, the authors suggest radical conservation efforts including bringing back once-native species, such as beavers and even the Eurasian lynx, to the UK. 'We should be thinking about beaver reintroductions in Wales and England in the course of the immediate future,' Professor Macdonald said. He has also floated the idea of more radical interventions to help Britain's wildlife, including taking large areas out of agriculture for 're-wilding' and fenced and unfenced nature reserves. An environmental survey last month named red squirrels, hedgehogs, the brown hare and the Scottish wildcat in Britain's top 10 endangered species. The red-necked phalathrope was said to be Britain's most endangered species, while the red squirrel was sixth, and the hedgehog tenth.","Hedgehog population drops to 1.5m from 30m in 1950s .

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 7th October 2011 . A British racehorse has become the first in history to be valued at £100million, an estimate which is considered 'conservative'. Frankel, a three-year-old bay colt, has won all eight of his flat races and is the hot favourite for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot next weekend. Frankel, who is kept at Warren Place Stables in Newmarket, Cambridgeshire, has already earned his owner £805,000 . in prize money and will bank close to £1million if he . triumphs at Ascot. Pedigree: Frankel, galloping on Newmarket race course, has been valued at £100 million after winning all eight of his flat races and being favourite for Ascot next week . Frankel, who can gallop at up to 40mph, has been dubbed the 'Usain Bolt' of the horse racing world. Here the Jamaican athlete celebrates winning the 200m at the World Athletics Championships in South Korea . The extraordinary  valuation is only partly down to his success on the track. Frankel's worth also reflects the £100,000 'covering' - the price charged for him to mate with a mare - that the horse will be able to command when he is put out to stud. Currently the most expensive stud fee is between £70,000 - £80,000, charged by the owners of racing legend See The Stars. Frankel, who can gallop at up to 40mph, has been dubbed the 'Usain Bolt' of the horse racing world. The horse is owned by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. Security around the animal is so tight his trainer, the highly respected Sir Henry Cecil, sleeps next to a video screen which streams live footage of Frankel in his box. The valuation was calculated by McKeever Bloodstock, one of Britain's biggest bloodstock agencies. Johnny . McKeever, who runs the company, said: 'Given the value of stallions now . it is not at all unreasonable to put this kind of price - or even a . higher one - on Frankel.' Nick Attenborough, a spokesman for horse racing industry body Racing For Change, agreed the estimate could be slightly modest. He . said: 'At £100k a time and with him able to cover up to 120 mares in . one breeding season it would only take him eight years to earn his owner . £100million, provided his offspring prove as good as he is. 'Frankel . is the perfect racehorse, he is very big and extremely powerful. When . he gallops very few horses can keep up with him and he has incredible . stamina. Winning team: The reclusive Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah, pictured at the Arc de Triomphe Grand Prix 2011, is a multi-billionaire known for breeding world-class racehorses . Best in the business: Frankel's trainer Sir Henry Cecil has CCTV of the horse in its stable in Newmarket streamed to a monitor next to his bed . Frankel the champion horse is worth the equivalent of: . 'He has such a huge stride that he often makes other very capable horses look slow. Frankel used to be very headstrong when he was young but he has calmed down and is maturing into a phenomenal horse. 'If anyone wanted to buy him today I expect they would have to find in excess of £75million to prise him out of the Prince's hands, but to be honest he doesn't need the money.' Frankel was born in 2008 and is owned by Khalid Abdullah, a reclusive Saudi Arabian prince and multi-billionaire businessman. The sheik has a history of breeding top quality horses and has also owned Known Fact, Zafonic, Rainbow Quest, Danehill, Dancing Brave and last year's Derby winner Workforce. The champion horse's biggest achievement was taking victory by an incredible six lengths in the eight furlong 2000 Guineas, one of Europe's most prestigious Classic races, at Newmarket in April.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:51 PM on 7th October 2011 . Sir Cyril Smith, the ultimate political heavyweight, is not the first person you would associate with the modern obsession of exercise and keeping fit. Yet the massive 29-stone former Liberal Democrat, who needed eight yards of material for his suits, will be remembered in his home town of Rochdale after councillors decided to dedicate a sports centre in his honour. The politician's name will live on in the Greater Manchester area when the 'The Sir Cyril Smith Sports Complex' opens its doors next year. Big idea: Sir Cyril Smith has had a sports centre named after him in his home town of Rochdale . A one-time fiery contender for the leadership of the party he died aged 82 in September last year. The renaming of the town's sports centre after the former mayor, who had a 75-inch waistline, came about after town hall chiefs asked for suggestions for the name of their revamped sports centre. Rochdale councillor Dale Mulgrew, Sir Cyril's godson, was responsible for the dedication idea. But it has sparked anger in the town with opponents declaring it 'daft' to name a sports facility after such an overweight public figure. Sir Cyril . Smith was known for his larger-than-life personality forged out of a . difficult upbringing as an illegitimate child, when such things still . mattered. He is believed to be Britain's heaviest MP, peaking at 29 stone and 12 pounds (about 190 kilograms). His nickname, 'Big Cyril', was . also the title of his autobiography. A common joke on the size of the . Parliamentary Liberal Party in the early 1970s was that only one taxi . would be needed to transport the entire party; after Smith's election, . the party could fill two taxis. After . a lifetime of public service, which included a spell as Mayor of . Rochdale with his mother as Mayoress, he died in his sleep in a nursing . home weighing just ten stone following a battle with cancer. Meanwhile Councillor Mulgrew has defended the naming decision and said: 'Apart from the plaque that we intend to unveil outside the town hall . next month, which really is no more than a small civic commemoration, . the town won't have a totemic, significant memorial in lasting tribute . to Cyril's work. 'After all, Gracie Fields has a theatre. 'Clearly, a lot of Cyril's work over his time was around education, and . clearly the new leisure centre will have a schools dimension because it . will be used during the day by our local education establishments. 'This . is about a lasting memorial, irrespective of the facility, and Cyril . would have promoted the community and social aspects of this building.' Labour MP for Rochdale Simon Danczuk added: 'It just goes to show how out of touch Rochdale Lib Dems have become. Even Cyril would have thought this was a daft idea.' The centre, which will open next year, will have an eight-lane 25-metre swimming pool, a learner pool with a moveable floor, a sports hall, thermal and fitness suites, dance studios and a youth gym. Sir Cyril, a bachelor who once said he was 'married to politics', served as Rochdale's MP from 1972 until his retirement in 1992. He won the seat by securing a huge swing away from Labour - becoming only the seventh Liberal MP in parliament at the time. Sir Cyril, who was knighted in 1988, remained active within the Liberal Democrats until only a few months before his death.","Godson came up with the idea to dedicate gym to former Rochdale MP .

The officers, who swooped at dawn on . the £450,000 home of Wayne Snr, also arrested the England striker's . uncle, Richie. They are probing a rash of suspicious bets placed on a . sending-off. The investigation centres on the red card given to Motherwell's Steve Jennings after he swore at the referee in a match against Hearts last December. Coleen, Wayne and Wayne Rooney Snr . Looking relaxed: England's Wayne Rooney during a training session at the City Stadium in Podgorica, Montenegro, today . Rooney's father was one of nine men held by police over the alleged £100,000 betting scam. Merseyside Police confirmed that all the men arrested yesterday as part of their investigation into suspicious betting have been bailed but enquiries are ongoing. Last night a 67-year-old man from Fazakerley, a 31-year-old man from Litherland, a 29-year-old man from Bootle, a 36-year-old man from Kirkby and a 26-year-old man from Glasgow were bailed. Earlier in the day a 54-year-old man from Norris Green, a 22-year-old man from Kirkdale, a 48-year-old man from West Derby and a 26-year-old man from Croxteth were released. According to The Sun, Wayne Snr lives in a house paid for by his son Wayne, who earns £8 million a year with Manchester United and is worth £37 million. There was no sign yesterday of . unemployed Wayne Snr, a 48-year-old former boxer who runs a boxing club, at the home he shares . with Rooney's mother, Jeanette, in West Derby, Liverpool. Jennings, a former Tranmere Rovers player, who hails from Kirkby, near Liverpool, was arrested at his home in Glasgow. The investigation comes at a bad time . for Rooney, 25, who has been working to clean up his image following . damaging revelations about his private life. It emerged that the £180,000-a-week Manchester United star had slept with prostitutes while his wife, Coleen, was pregnant. He is currently in Montenegro with . the England team for today's Euro 2012 qualifier. Rooney was told his relatives had been arrested as he waited with the team for their flight at Luton Airport. Team manager Fabio . Capello insisted Rooney had not been upset by his father's arrest. 'I found him relaxed and calm,' Capello said. 'There is no problem for the game, he will play against . Montenegro. He told me there are no problems.' On duty: Wayne Rooney (centre) trained today with Phil Jones and Danny Welbeck (left) while his father was questioned . Steve Jennings was arrested after allegedly getting himself sent off deliberately during a match . But Rooney's estranged cousin Stephen, 27, a homosexual and cross dresser, said the arrests were 'embarrassing'. 'It's hysterical, but I'm quite . surprised it's just the two,' he said. 'And they have the cheek to tell . me that putting a dress on is embarrassing for the family.' A spokesman for Merseyside Police . confirmed nine men had been arrested in . Liverpool and Glasgow on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud as part of a . joint operation with the Gambling Commission into suspicious betting. Anthony Barnfather, the lawyer . representing Wayne Snr, said: 'Mr Rooney vigorously denies all of these . allegations. We are co-operating fully with the investigation. No . further comment will be made at this time.' Wayne Rooney Snr, footballer Wayne's father, is one of the nine people being questioned over an alleged betting scam . Neighbours at 54-year-old Richie . Rooney's home, in Croxteth, Liverpool, confirmed a police car had been . parked outside the modest semi in the early hours. He refused to comment . when he returned home on bail yesterday afternoon. He spent 20 minutes inside before . being driven off in a Ford Focus by his daughter, Claire. One visitor, . who described himself as a member of the family, said: 'He doesn't know . anything about all this.' England captain John Terry, who has . experienced media attention on his own family, also backed Rooney. 'Wayne is focused on the game tomorrow,' Terry said. 'We all realise the importance of . that. It's important for him to go out there and play his football, . which he loves doing. He'll always be fully focused on the pitch.' Members of the Press soon arrived outside the house of Wayne Rooney snr this afternoon . Police were alerted after the . Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of . irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Jennings being red-carded. Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool – Rooney's home town. One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000. Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time. The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell. Speaking in the wake of the incident, . Jennings said: 'I want to make it clear I had no involvement whatsoever . in any betting scam. 'I want to clear my name as quickly as possible.' It is understood Jennings became friends with the Rooney family after striking up a friendship with Richie's son, Thomas, 26.","Nine men seized in relation to Motherwell/Hearts clash last year .

"By . Paul Bentley . Last updated at 4:40 PM on 6th October 2011 . Sarah Palin announced she will not run for President in 2012 in a statement to her supporters late on Wednesday afternoon. After months of speculation months and side-stepping questions. she finally announced that she will not run for the White House in a statement because her 'family comes first'. In a letter sent to her supporters, she wrote: 'After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for president of the United States.' Hours later she appeared on Fox News and further explained her decision to be an effective outsider. By for now! Sarah Palin announced she will NOT run for President, but she won't be far from the media eye as she promised to work an outsider to help causes and candidates she supports . 'After prayerful consideration and a lot of discussion with the family, I concluded that I believe I can be an effective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants elected to office,' she told Greta van Sustern. Palin said she announced her 'no' in a statement because, unlike Chris Christie, she didn't want to have a big press conference about it as it's 'not about me' 'You don't need a title to make a difference in this country. I think that I'm proof of that.' Palin also insisted it wasn't an easy or absolute decision. 'I would go back and forth about whether now is the time, and if I say no to the opportunity that's in front of me via running for office now, will -- political speaking, will I die? Will I be ineffective?' She also managed to make a dig about New Jersey governor Chris Christie. 'I wanted to, you know, just kind of put the marker down and say, No, I'm not running, not have a big press conference about it, not make a big darn deal about it because this isn't about me. And it's not about Chris Christie.' It has been suggested that she now will lend her weight to Texas governor and Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry. The announcement comes after she was stung by suggestions in a new book that she once snorted cocaine off a 55 gallon oil drum while snowmobiling with friends and had illicit affairs with a top NBA star and one of her husband's business partners. The revelations, which will inevitably now be seen to have struck a devastating blow to her political ambitions, suggest Mrs Palin took the class A drug with her husband, while smoking marijuana at college in secret liaisons with one of her professors. Race: It is likely Palin will now support Rick Perry in the battle to unseat President Obama . Joe McGinniss's book The Rogue: . Searching for the Real Sarah Palin also alleged that the former governor . of Alaska is far from the traditional family woman she claims to be. Mrs . Palin, 47, had a one-night stand with Miami Heat basketball star Glen . Rice less than a year before she eloped with her husband, the book . claimed. She was said to . have met the 6ft 8ins player in 1987 when he was playing in a college . basketball tournament in Alaska and she worked as a sports reporter for . KTUU television. It was also claimed that she had a . six-month affair with Brad Hanson, who ran a snowmobile dealership with . her husband Todd - a betrayal which led to Todd dissolving their . business. Heat: The book alleges that Palin had a one night stand with basketball star Glen Rice . Explosive: The book, written by Joe McGinness, right, may well be seen to have halted Palin's 2012 bid . In a bid to expose Mrs Palin's . skeletons, Mr McGinness studied the former vice presidential candidate . for three years and last year even moved in to a home next door in . Wasilla, Alaska, to dig some more. Recent polls had, however, suggested the outspoken politician was gaining ground on President Barack Obama. After . trailing Mr Obama by more than 20 percentage points in polls all year, . the McClatchy-Marist survey, taken on September 13 and 14, had the . President leading Mrs Palin by only 49 points to 44. A key reason is that she started to lead Mr Obama among independents - a sharp turnaround. The . poll found that Obama looks increasingly vulnerable in next year's . election, with a majority of voters believing he will lose to any . Republican, a solid number saying they will definitely vote against him . and most potential Republican challengers gaining on him. Separation?: Todd Palin, seen here with his wife outside their house in Wasilla, Alaska, is said to be filing for a divorce . Governor Rick Perry of Texas continues to lead the field of announced candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, supported by 30 per cent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. He is followed by former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts with 22 per cent and Representative Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota with 12 per cent. Others trail in single digits. A separate survey for Fox News - where Palin is a highly-paid commentator - found that an astonishing 66 per cent of Tea Party supporters - and 71 per cent of Republicans - would prefer, however, if she did not run for President. October 5, 2011 . Wasilla, Alaska . After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for President of the United States. As always, my family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision. When we serve, we devote ourselves to God, family and country. My decision maintains this order. My decision is based upon a review of what common sense Conservatives and Independents have accomplished, especially over the last year. I believe that at this time I can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office – from the nation’s governors to Congressional seats and the Presidency. We need to continue to actively and aggressively help those who will stop the “fundamental transformation” of our nation and instead seek the restoration of our greatness, our goodness and our constitutional republic based on the rule of law. From the bottom of my heart I thank those who have supported me and defended my record throughout the years, and encouraged me to run for President. Know that by working together we can bring this country back – and as I’ve always said, one doesn’t need a title to help do it. I will continue driving the discussion for freedom and free markets, including in the race for President where our candidates must embrace immediate action toward energy independence through domestic resource developments of conventional energy sources, along with renewables. We must reduce tax burdens and onerous regulations that kill American industry, and our candidates must always push to minimize government to strengthen the economy and allow the private sector to create jobs. Those will be our priorities so Americans can be confident that a smaller, smarter government that is truly of the people, by the people, and for the people can better serve this most exceptional nation. In the coming weeks I will help coordinate strategies to assist in replacing the President, re-taking the Senate, and maintaining the House. Thank you again for all your support. Let’s unite to restore this country! God bless America. Sarah Palin .",'You don't need a title to make a difference' she told Fox News of decision .

A bride spent the first night of her marriage locked up in a police cell wearing her bloodied wedding dress after she was arrested for attacking her neighbour. Newlywed Imogen Hope accused Samantha Pilling of being a white witch who had cursed her family before launching the astonishing attack just hours after her nuptials at Halifax Registry Office. When the 37-year-old was arrested police asked her if she wanted to change out of her dress, but she refused and spent the night in cells wearing her bloodied bridal gown - while her disappointed groom slept at his parents' house. For better, for worse (for wear): Imogen Hope (left) had downed lager and spirits at her wedding reception before launching the attack on Samantha Pilling... still dressed in her bridal gown . Hope returned home drunk from her wedding reception with new husband Keith, 38, just after midnight when she decided to confront Mrs Pilling, who had a long-running dispute with the Hope family, a court was told. Mrs Pilling was in an upstairs bedroom knitting when Hope shouted up to her. Hope, who weighs just eight stone and is a slight size six, had downed lager and spirits at her reception at the Shears Inn, in Halifax, West Yorkshire. Her wedding dress was already bloodstained after she broke an acrylic nail when she fell on a cobbled street outside her reception. She began hurling abuse on her neighbour's doorstep, calling Mrs Pilling - who is a practising pagan - a 'white witch' and accused her of cursing her father-in-law, who lives in the house between two and had recently been diagnosed with cancer. The husbands of both women - gas board worker Keith Hope and former bouncer Stuart Pilling - also got involved and tussled as as they separated their wives. It was Mr Pilling who eventually called police. Hope struck at least three blows to Mrs Pilling, causing bruising and scratches to her face and wrist, prosecutor Jane Farrar told magistrates. Special day: Newlywed Hope with her groom Keith... before she spent the night in a police cell . Mother-of-three Mrs Pilling is on medication for anxiety and and has suffered an abscess in her jaw, which she believes was triggered by the attack. According to PC Stephen Young - who was the first officer on the scene at the incident on July 19 this year - Hope was asked if she wanted to change out of her bridal gown when she was arrested. He said: 'It was suggested to her . that she get changed out of her wedding dress. That was the initial . agreement. She then changed her mind and decided to attend the custody . suite as she was. 'There was a little bit of amazement . from the lady and quite understandably on her wedding day. Her husband . was obviously disappointed.' Mrs Pilling, who moved in next door to Hope's in-laws Christine and Keith five years ago, told Calderdale Magistrates' Court: 'She told me her father-in-law had cancer and it was my fault because I had cursed him. 'I don't deal with curses, I work with crystals.' She also claimed she had never spoken to Hope before and was shocked at the abuse, in which she called her a 'slag'. She added: 'Personally I thought it was not the way a bride should behave on her wedding night.' The student nurse, who trained as a . paramedic with the British Armed Forces, said: 'I'm not practising as a . witch at the moment, there's too much negativity in my life.' She told the court she didn't hit . Hope because she was not a violent person and could easily have hurt her . because of her Army training, adding: 'I have been trained to kill.' Hope, a nursery nurse assistant, was bailed after her arrest but was banned from returning to he marital home for two weeks because it was just two doors down from Mrs Pilling. She told the court: 'I was taken away from my home for two weeks I couldn't see my kids, my husband because of something I hadn't done.' The court also heard how her husband was devastated when he couldn't spend their first night of matrimony together. He told magistrates: 'I asked the police ""please don't, it's my wedding night"".' The bridegroom ended up spending the evening at his parents' house next door because he couldn't face sleeping in the marital bed alone. Hope, who claimed she couldn't remember what had happened because she was drunk, denied one charge of assault by beating. However magistrates found her guilty after the one-day trial. She was given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £75 in compensation to Mrs Pilling and court costs of £300.","Imogen Hope returned home from her reception drunk before attack .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 1:58 AM on 7th October 2011 . A wife who said she shot her retired police officer husband to death in self-defence was today acquitted of his murder. But Barbara Sheehan, 50, was convicted by a New York jury of a weapons charge that will result in her serving some prison time. Her supporters cheered as the verdict was read, with many dressed in purple to support domestic violence victims. But Sheehan will be jailed for between three and 15 years for the weapon charge. Trial over: Barbara Sheehan, 50, of New York, pictured last month, was only convicted by a Queens jury of a weapons charge over the shooting of her husband Raymond Sheehan at their home . Sheehan says she shot her 49-year-old husband of 24 years, Raymond, 11 times after suffering decades of physical and verbal abuse. He allegedly pointed a 9mm Glock at her and she shot him with a .38-calibre revolver. She says he threatened to kill her and . he meant it. But prosecutors said she was not abused and was angry over . her husband's infidelities. Authorities say she fired 11 times while her husband, a former New York City police sergeant, was shaving in the bathroom. Court documents said Sheehan told . police the night of the incident: ‘I shot him! I shot him! I think he's . dead. He's in the bathroom.’ Together: Sheehan, right, claimed her husband Raymond, left, was an abusive, reckless and terrifying man . Legal experts said the case is a test of the battered-woman defence. 'I don't think people understand how bad it was at home. I don't think they understand how my . father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he . was doing that he'd kill us too' Ray Sheehan, son . This is when the history of abuse is . explored to explain a woman's mental state at the time she is accused of . committing a crime. The issue is self-defence, which under . New York state law justifies the use of lethal force in response to an . immediate threat to life. Under the battered-woman defence, lethal force can sometimes be justified even if the threat may not appear immediate. Sheehan testified her husband smashed her head . against a cinder-block wall when they were on holiday in 2007, reported the New York Times. On the . day of the killing in February 2008 he allegedly threw boiling pasta . sauce at her and punched her in the face. Allegations: Sheehan shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded, prosecutors say . ‘She acted out of defence,’ her daughter Jennifer Joyce said. ‘There were no other options. He was pointing a gun to her head.’ Prosecutors said there were other reasons Sheehan killed her husband. She was allegedly furious over his infidelity and sexual habits such as wearing nappies and women's clothes. 'She acted out of defence. There were no other options. He was pointing a gun to her head' Jennifer Joyce, daughter . They also said she would benefit from life insurance policies - but Sheehan's son Ray disputed this. ‘I don't think people understand how bad it was at home,’ he said. ‘I don't think they understand how my . father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he . was doing that he'd kill us too.","Barbara Sheehan cleared of murdering husband Raymond in New York .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:36 AM on 7th October 2011 . An Arts Council-funded theatre company has been criticised after appealing to rioters in prison to 'give their side of the story'. The Tricycle Theatre wrote to Inside Time, the prisoners' magazine, asking for inmates to share their 'direct experiences' of the civil disorder that swept the country in August. In the letters page of the magazine - which is read by an estimated 50,000 prisoners - Zoe Ingenhaag, associate producer of the company, says the play, called The Riots, needs convicts' input. Their side of the story: A youth walks past a burning vehicle in Hackney during the August riots. Jailed rioters have been invited to contribute to a new play . The 24-year-old Bristol drama graduate said: 'We would like to hear your direct experiences and opinions, and we would then hope to put them on stage, word-for-word. 'This is an opportunity to have your voice heard on a national platform, and you can choose to be anonymous if you would rather. 'Any thoughts, personal observations, views on the sentencing, or the police response, will be extremely useful to this project - we want to hear as many different views as possible.' 'Insensitve': The Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn, north London, has asked jailed rioters to contribute to its latest production . The Tricycle Theatre Group has a record for attacking the 'establishment' and has in the past put on plays criticising the war in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and Bloody Sunday. In 2007 the company produced a play called 'Called to Account - the indictment of Tony Blair for the crime of aggression against Iraq - a hearing'. A prison source, speaking yesterday, said the request by the Tricycle Theatre Company would 'not be appreciated' by prison staff. 'For this theatre company to effectively give these people a voice is not something that we in the prison service will appreciate. 'These people made life hell for countless thousands of people across the whole of the UK and for them to be asked to give their opinions on the riots is like asking a murderer to try and explain to the family of the victim why they killed him. 'It is insensitive and basically lets these people who have looted and damaged shops, cars and people's property gain what they might see as 'respect' for what they have done.' The Tricycle Theatre received £725,315 . from the Arts Council - a non departmental public body run by the . Department of Culture, Media and Sport - in April this year. The . play - due to be shown at the group's 235-seat theatre in Kilburn, . north London, from November 17 until December 10 - hopes to build a . 'real-time picture of the riots as they unfolded'. On . the theatre company's website it states: 'The Government has so far . refused a Public Inquiry into the riots that shook our cities this . Summer, so the Tricycle is mounting its own. Destruction: Council cleaners sweep away the rubbish left behind after looters swept through Clapham, south-west London . 'From tweets by taxi drivers, to moment-by-moment accounts by riot police, it will build a real-time picture of the riots as they unfolded. 'And then, from interviews with politicians, police, teachers, lawyers, community leaders, as well as victims and on-lookers, The Riots will analyse what happened, why it happened, and what we should do towards making a better future for ourselves and our city. 'Astonishing stories and equally astonishing conclusions told by the many voices that have been stirred up by the riots.' Tickets cost £13.","Tricycle Theatre, funded by Arts Council, says it will use prisoners' stories 'word-for-word'"
"By . John Hutchinson . Last updated at 7:54 PM on 6th October 2011 . Volkswagen is recalling 168,275 cars equipped with diesel engines because of a defect in the fuel injection system that could cause fuel leaks and fires. The recall affects certain 2009-2012 Jetta midsize cars, and some 2010 through 2012 Golf small cars, as well as some Audi A3 models from the 2010 through 2012 model years, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday on its website. Danger: Volkswagen cars, such as the Jettas pictured, are being recalled in mass numbers over a fear that certain diesel engines are faulty and can cause fires . 2009-2012 Jetta midsize cars . 2010-2012 Golf small cars . 2010-2012 Audi A3 models . Note: Not all of the above will be recalled as only certain models are likely to be affected. All are equipped with two-litre TDI diesel engines. Cracks can develop in the fuel injection system and cause fuel to leak, possibly causing fires, VW said in documents filed with federal safety regulators. However, the company said in the documents that it doesn't know of any fires, crashes or injuries caused by the problem. Fuel injectors squirt fuel into the cylinder, where it is ignited. The resulting explosion pushes the pistons, which move to power the cars. On some of the VW diesels, a vibration given off by the injectors can cause stress that eventually can lead to cracks in the injector fuel lines, VW said. Volkswagen will replace a fuel injector line in some models and install dampers to cut the vibrations on all of them. Faulty: It is back to the drawing board for many Volkswagen cars after the latest revelations regarding a faulty fuel injection system . The repairs will be made free of charge. The recall is expected to start in November, NHTSA said. The recall includes 161,144 Golf and Jetta models and another 7,131 Audi A3s. The Jettas, including SportWagens, were made from May 2008 through September of 2011, while the Golfs were made from May of 2009 through September of 2011. The A3 models were made from September of 2009 through September of 2011. About 20 percent of the cars built during those time periods will need to have fuel lines replaced, and all will the vehicles will get the vibration dampers, VW said. More than 20 percent of the Volkswagens sold in the U.S. have diesel engines.","Certain Jetta, Golf and Audi A3 models most likely to be recalled .

Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, expressed sympathy for savers but insisted he would not 'push Britain into a recession' just to help them . The fragile finances of families, savers and pensioners suffered a huge blow yesterday when the Bank of England launched a desperate new bid to stave off recession. The Bank’s governor pumped £75billion of new money into the flatlining economy, saying the worst financial crisis in modern history demanded it. But Sir Mervyn King admitted there could be a severe price to pay. The move could: . The Bank decided to restart its programme of quantitative easing in the face of growing fears of a double-dip recession exacerbated by the eurozone debt crisis. Sir Mervyn expressed sympathy for savers but insisted he would not ‘push Britain into a recession’ just to help them. ‘I would desperately like to get back to a world as soon as possible with normal levels of interest rates we need to encourage people to save,’ he added. ‘I have enormous sympathy with the predicament that savers, and particularly those who are retired, face. They are suffering from the consequences of an economic crisis which they did not cause or are responsible for. ‘But this is a situation where Britain, on its own, cannot easily get out of it. The only way to return to a situation with full employment, steady growth and a balanced economy is to make sure other countries expand their spending. ‘We are doing it because there is not enough money in the economy. Now that may seem unfamiliar to people but it is unfamiliar. That is because this is the most serious financial crisis we have seen at least since the 1930s, if not ever.’ Critics branded yesterday’s decision to print money ‘a Titanic disaster’ which will deepen the squeeze on those already hit by low savings returns. Anger: Jason Riddle, director of Save Our Savings, smashes a papier-maché pig during a protest outside the Bank of England . Is the risk of higher inflation a price worth paying? Is it fair that this price is being paid by pensioners, along with savers who are already being punished with negative real returns on their accounts, and families who have seen their incomes fall in real terms? Asks RUTH SUNDERLAND . Read more here . Tom McPhail, of financial advisers . Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Pensioners are facing a perfect storm of . their investments falling in value, collapsing annuity rates and rising . inflation.’ Bank policymakers yesterday also voted to keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent – the level at which it has been frozen for more than two years. Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank’s monetary policy committee, said: ‘The Bank is meant to control inflation and it would appear they’re trying to stimulate the economy when actually what is needed is to get inflation down. ‘Over the past year what we’ve actually seen is inflation squeezing out growth. 'The reason consumers are not buying more extra goods and services is because the prices of the ones they’re already buying are going up too rapidly and they don’t have the money.’ Yesterday savers staged a demonstration outside the Bank of England, claiming their suffering was being ignored. Part-time special needs teacher Joy Cavanagh and her husband Ed, a former postman, joined the protest outside the Bank of England. Mrs Cavanagh said: 'These abysmal rates have had a huge effect on us and lots of other people, that's why I was at the protest.' Protest Group Save Our Savings yesterday held a rally in the City of London before interest rates were again held at 0.5 per cent, urging the BoE to take a different tack. Simon Rose, of Save Our Savers, said the MPC was 'failing to do its job' and keep control of inflation, which is way above the Government's two per cent target. Rose said: 'All savers are seeing their capital whittled away as inflation outstrips negligible interest rates. For the millions of pensioners who depend upon their savings, the future is terrifying. 'If the members of the MPC would look beyond their graphs and equations they would see the all too real effect their policies are having on people young and old. They are playing Russian roulette with the economy.' The Bank’s decision to pump more money . into the economy is also almost guaranteed to drive annuity rates below . even their current historic lows.Had you cashed in a £100,000 pension pot in 1990, you would have received an annual income of £16,000. The equivalent figure now would be £5,945. Joanne Segars, of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘This is another kick in the ribs for many people who have worked all their lives and are trying to retire. Annuity rates are woefully low.’ To add to the crisis, inflation, currently 4.5 per cent, more than double the Government’s 2 per cent target, is set to climb higher. Sir Mervyn said: ‘In two weeks we will get another inflation number which may well go above 5 per cent but that, in our view, is the peak and it will then start falling and, in the first few months of next year will fall quite rapidly so that the underlying inflationary pressures will disappear over the course of the next year.’ The Bank blamed the crippling rise in energy bills, up 14.3 per cent this year. What is quantitative easing?QE . is an emergency tool of monetary policy that the Bank of England can . use to boost the UK economy. Cutting interest rates is the principal . way the Bank can fire up economic activity but rates have been cut as . low as they can go. How does it work?The . Bank generates fresh amounts of electronic money to encourage lending . to businesses. Specifically, the Bank buys assets like Government and . corporate bonds with its new cash. The companies selling those assets - . usually commercial banks or other financial businesses such as . insurance companies - will then have new money in their accounts, which . in turn should feed into the wider economy. So it's not really 'printing money'?Not . in the literal sense, no. And not in the sense that money was printed . in Weimar Germany or more recently in Zimbabwe. That money was used to . fund massive government deficits and led directly to hyperinflation. This is outlawed under the Maastricht Treaty. Haven't we had QE already? The Bank has already issued £200billion . in QE: it started in March 2009, when it had already cut rates to the . record low of 0.5% - where they remain – but when the UK economy was . still struggling to emerge from recession. It then injected the cash in . tranches over the following 11 months, after which it closed off the scheme. Did it work? According to research recently . published by the Bank, yes. A report from the Bank found the stimulus . measure provided a 'significant' benefit to growth and helped GDP . increase by around 1.5% and 2%. This was equivalent to dropping . interest rates by between 1.5% and 3%, the Bank found. Others are more . sceptical that it is possible to attribute such economic dividends to . QE. Didn't it fuel inflation? Again, according to the Bank, not as . much as many had expected it to. Its study found the consumer prices . index rate of inflation increased by between 0.75% and 1.5% following . the last round of QE. But inflation now stands at 4.5%, way above the . Government's 2% target. So why more QE now? The UK economy looks in danger of . slipping into a second dip of recession. Data on the economy is . increasingly downbeat, with second-quarter growth downgraded to just . 0.1%, and instability in financial markets and the eurozone debt crisis . have raised the risk of another fully-fledged recession. Moreover, . banks are worried about the strength of their finances and not lending . to businesses or individuals. Will it work again? Fears of debt contagion from Europe and . major changes to regulation in the UK still mean banks are being . cautious with their balance sheets: they could just hoard the cash they . get from selling assets to the Bank. What about inflation? The Bank will say that QE is necessary to stop inflation falling too far below its 2% inflation target on the two-year horizon.","Move seen as last-ditch bid to stave off new recession .

A spurned girlfriend who took baby pictures from a friend’s Facebook page and tricked her former lover into thinking the child was theirs has been banned from teaching for two years. Primary school teacher Victoria Jones, 23, used 82 photographs of the smiling baby girl to deceive her ex-boyfriend in revenge for dumping her. A teaching disciplinary hearing was told that Jones kept up the pretence for two years and even told him that she had taken their little girl to Australia so he could not see her. Scroll down to read Victoria's fantasy emails . Deception: Primary school teacher Victoria Jones (left) grabbed pictures of a . baby girl she found on Facebook and duped her ex-boyfriend, Daniel Barberini . (right), into thinking the child was his . She also claimed the daughter she called Keira was a twin, but that her baby brother Harrison had died soon after birth because he had Downs Syndrome. She weaved the elaborate web of deceit to get revenge on ex-boyfriend . Daniel Barberini, 26, after their 16-month relationship ended. She dreamed up the hoax after former . school friend Sarah Jensen added her as a ‘friend’ on Facebook to show . the photos of her own daughter Aliyah. The happy Facebook snaps showed . Aliyah hours after she was born, celebrating her first birthday, . enjoying Christmas and playing at home. Jones claimed to have given birth to Mr Barberini’s children in New York before emigrating from Britain to Australia. The disciplinary hearing was told . that Jones was still teaching in the nursery of Ringland Primary School . in Newport, Gwent – and had no child. She was found guilty of misconduct over the use of the photographs but cleared of compromising her position of trust and bringing the school into disrepute. Victims: Baby Aliyah with her mother Sarah Jensen, who was horrified when she found out what Victoria Jones - a former classmate of hers - had done . The disciplinary panel ruled that she should be suspended from the teacher register for two years when she will be allowed to reapply. Panel chairman John Collins said: 'We are satisfied Miss Jones actions fall short of that expected of a registered teacher. 'Although acts were conducted in her private life, the consequences impacted adversely in her standing as a teacher as well as bringing the profession into disrepute. January 22, 2009 .

'She used the photos to support a fictitious tale in her personal cause. We are satisfied she copied photos of the child from Facebook. 'The behaviour did not occur during school hours and did not affect pupils. However the conduct could not be described as an isolated incident. 'This was serious misconduct which took place over a prolonged period of time and involved deception.' Miss Jones, who was not at today's hearing, admitted taking the photographs from Facebook but denied unacceptable professional conduct. The cruel hoax only came to light when proud 'dad' Daniel showed one of the baby pictures to a friend - who is also knew Aliyah's real mother. Sarah Jensen told the police but after an investigation officers ruled the teacher had not broken the law. She said: 'Vicky was one of the quietest people you could ever meet when we were at school. I remember she came to my 14th birthday party. 'She had access to my Facebook site as a friend but I haven't seen her for six years. After I found out what was going on she phoned me and wanted to meet up - but I said no. 'Vicky said she wanted to explain why she did it. She told me: 'He dumped me so I wanted to get my own back and hurt him. So I told him I was pregnant because it was the only way I could get back and hurt him.' 'I was crying so much I could barely talk to the police. Her ex, Daniel, arrived at the police station and he was just devastated too. I'd never met him before but he said: ""I'm so sorry"". 'Even though they were not together as a couple he was over the moon about having a daughter. He told me Vicky sent him hundreds of emails talking about their twins Keira and Harrison. 'Vicky sent him one email saying she was coming to London from Australia later this month and invited him to see their daughter for the first time at her hotel. 'Some of the pictures of Aliyah she sent him also showed me and my partner Justin. Vicky had told Daniel I was her best friend. 'But the thing that got to me most were the plans for Daniel to see the baby in London. I'm too scared to go out or even open the door in case somebody grabs the baby.

Two blundering hitmen killed an A-level student with ‘indescribable savagery’ when they went to his suburban home by mistake, a court heard yesterday. Ben Hope, 38, and Jason Richards, 37, had been paid ‘a pittance’ to kill a father-of-four after a property deal went sour, it was alleged. But showing staggering incompetence they entered a semi-detached home 100 yards away from their intended target, where they stabbed to death sixth former Aamir Siddiqi, 17, jurors heard. Aamir’s retired parents tried to fight off the masked assassins – but were stabbed by Hope and Richards, who howled during the attack to intimidate them, it is claimed. The killers, who are both heroin addicts, then went on a shopping spree with the money they received for the killing, with Hope spending £700 on a laptop in PC World and £100 on training shoes in JD Sports, jurors heard. The alleged crime boss who ordered the killing – Dubai-born Mohammed Ali Ege, 32 – is on the run, the court was told. Aamir, who was studying at a £9,000-a-year private school and had hoped to read law at Cardiff University, was described by his parents as a ‘young gentleman’. Patrick Harrington QC, prosecuting, told Cardiff Crown Court: ‘On a sunny Sunday afternoon, this young man was stabbed to death in the hallway of his home. ‘Neither he nor his parents had any expectation that their lives would be shattered by that attack that day.’ 'Ordered the killing': The heroin addicts claim Ege (left), who is on the run, paid them a pittance to carry out the attack, resulting in Aamir's death (right) Mr Harrington said that the two men, allegedly recruited by Ege ‘over a debt’, were ‘disorientated possibly because of drugs’. ‘With what can only be described as staggering incompetence, they went to wholly the wrong address and killed an innocent young man who was waiting for his Koran teacher,’ he said. Aamir was stabbed in the neck on the doorstep of his five-bedroom, semi-detached home in Ninian Road in the leafy Roath Park suburb of Cardiff on April 11 last year. Murder scene: The doorstop of Aamir's semi-detached home . But their intended victim was a father-of-four living less than 100 yards away – in a terraced house in neighbouring Shirley Road, the court heard. Aamir’s father Iqbal, 68, a retired civil servant and mother Parveen, 55, a retired education official, were injured trying to help their son. Mr Harrington said: ‘While the emergency services attempted to revive Aamir, the defendants went off in pursuit of their blood money. ‘It’s a chilling thought that in this city there are two men who murdered for the price of a pair of training shoes and a laptop computer.’ Mr Harrington added: ‘These two men used lethal weapons against a totally defenceless teenage boy and his parents for a pittance. ‘This was a crime of indescribable brutality and savagery which they are now trying to avoid the consequences of by blaming each other.’ The court heard Richards blamed the killing on Hope and a ‘man from Sheffield’. And Hope claims he had been in the . company of Richards at times during the day, but that during the . afternoon he had fallen asleep after taking heroin, Mr Harrington said.

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Last updated at 12:44 AM on 20th September 2011 . Raids on release: Joseph Williams targeted a number of bookies to feed his gambling habit . A convicted hammer killer carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers while he was on day release from prison. Joseph Williams was allowed temporary leave from his ‘open’ prison in preparation for permanent release from his life sentence for murder. But the 52-year-old gambling addict took advantage of lax supervision to go on a robbery spree to pay for his habit. Yesterday at the Old Bailey he was jailed indefinitely as the court heard he posed a ‘significant risk’ to the public. The case raises questions over why he was let out and the failure of supervision while he was at large. Prison officials said all inmates on temporary release have to ‘meet strict criteria and pass a rigorous risk assessment’. Williams was caught entirely by chance when he shunted an unmarked police car and a sharp-eyed officer recognised his face from a wanted poster. Back bench Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This shows that there is something badly wrong with our criminal justice system. If people are going to have confidence in that system we need to hold to account the probation service, the courts and prosecutors.’ Williams, of Bolton, was jailed for life in 1996 for battering to death sociology lecturer Ayodele Odamttun with a claw hammer while high on crack cocaine. On leave: Williams was granted day release from HMP Blantyre House to work as a lorry driver . Williams was jailed for life in 1996 . for battering Mr Odamttun to death with a claw hammer in the victim's . flat in Battersea, South-West London. He was high on crack cocaine when he inflicted at least 24 blows to his head as well as multiple stab wounds, on July 27 1995. Williams, then 36 and from Bolton, . Lancashire, confessed to the murder to a friend as they watched gangster . movie 'Carlito's Way', telling him: 'I just weighed somebody in.' At the time Judge Alexander Hutchinson QC described it as 'a brutal murder' resulting from an 'explosion of violence'. He was sentenced to a minimum 12 years, later increased to 13 years, and had become eligible for released on licence. He rained at least 24 blows on his 45-year-old victim’s head and inflicted multiple stab wounds. He confessed to the murder as he watched gangster movie Carlito’s Way with a friend, telling him: ‘I just weighed somebody in.’ At the time Judge Alexander . Hutchinson QC said the attack involved an ‘explosion of violence’ and . sentenced Williams to at least 12 years – a term later increased to 13 . years. As he came to the end of his . sentence, Williams was allowed day release from HMP Blantyre House in . Kent. He took up a driving job with an insulation firm in  Croydon, . South London, as the parole board considered letting him out . permanently. But the  court heard Williams blew his wages on gambling and turned to robbery to fund his betting addiction. Armed with a spanner and paint brush . taped together and wrapped in a carrier bag to look like a gun, he . carried out his first robbery at Paddy Power in Wallington, South . London, on February 24 last year, stealing £300. Within six months he had committed 11 . robberies or attempted robberies at bookmakers in the area – including . three more at the same branch of Paddy Power – netting him £3,300. Prosecutor Kate Lumsdon said: ‘He was . acting alone, he wore a black hooded coat or jumper with a scarf across . his face, or sometimes a balaclava. He carried a plastic bag which . appeared to have  something in it, and the way he held it was as if it . was a gun. This “gun” was used to threaten staff in order to get them to . hand over the money.’ Williams was caught when he drove into . the back of an unmarked police car. The driver, Detective Constable . Peter Jelly, then spotted his face on a Flying Squad wanted poster. After the accident Williams apologised to the officer and laughed, adding: ‘I am on day release from Blantyre House.’ Williams was later picked out on CCTV . from one of the betting shops, and his DNA was found on gloves dropped . as he fled from William Hill in Hackbridge, South London. After a week-long trial at the Old . Bailey last month, Williams was convicted of eight robberies, three . attempted robberies and nine counts of possessing an imitation firearm. Yesterday, the judge, Recorder Joanna . Greenberg QC, ordered he serve an indeterminate sentence for public . protection with a minimum term of six years. A probation officer who assessed him . said he had ‘the capacity to cause very serious harm through extreme . levels of violence’ and identified him as ‘high risk’. Tory MP for Croydon Gavin Barwell . said: ‘This story shows that when people are put in prison we need to do . a better job addressing the problems that lead them to commit crime. ‘And until we are sure they have done that, we shouldn’t release them early.’ The Prison Service said: ‘Cases like . these are extremely rare. The overwhelming majority of releases pass . without any problems and help to resettle prisoners back into the . community.’",Gambling addict Joseph Williams now jailed indefinitely .
"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 2:43 PM on 8th October 2011 . Wayne Rooney failed to keep control of his emotions last night as he was sent off in shame during England's match against Montenegro - the day after his father and uncle were arrested and bailed in connection with a 'football betting scam'. The £180,000-a-week Manchester United star, who is worth £37million, lost control 17 minutes from time and kicked out at Miodrag Dzudovic. It led England, who were winning 2-1, to concede a last minute goal. And it provoked a stern response from . angry manager Fabio Capello who, despite seeing his team qualify for . Euro 2012, appeared to utter an Italian expletive in the direction of . the disgraced player as he passed him. Scroll down to see video of last night's sending off... Off: Wayne Rooney was dismissed during the second half of England's match against Montenegro after fouling Miodrag Dzudovic . Kicking out: Rooney was shown a straight red card for a moment of petulance . Capello had said on the eve of the game that Rooney was 'focused and calm' following the arrest of his father, also called Wayne, and his uncle Richie. The pair were arrested on Thursday and bailed in connection with a spot-fixing investigation. Both deny the allegations. Following last night's sending off, Rooney is now automatically banned from the opening game of Euro 2012 - probably the first two - although UEFA will decide the length of his suspension towards the end of next week. Allegation: Wayne and Coleen Rooney sit alongside the Manchester United star's father Wayne Snr (right) who was arrested in connection with a betting scam . Rooney is only the second England player to be sent off twice - the other being former captain David Beckham. England drew 2-2 to secure top spot in Group G but Capello said: 'He made a silly mistake when he kicked the opponent. The arrests of Wayne Rooney's father, uncle and seven other men followed a police probe into a rash of 'suspicious bets' placed on a sending-off. Police were alerted after the Association of British Bookmarkers raised concerns about a number of irregular bets, ranging from £200 to £500, on Motherwell's Steve Jennings being red-carded, after he swore at the referee in a match against Hearts in December 2010. Jennings had already been booked by referee Stevie O'Reilly when he was shown a straight red card seven minutes from time. The 26-year-old reportedly asked the referee when he was going to 'stop cheating' Motherwell. Some of the activity is understood to have taken place via a new account opened in Liverpool - Rooney's home town. One bet of £500, placed at odds of 10/1, netted £5,000. Former boxer Wayne Snr, 48, was arrested in a 7am raid at the lavish £450,000 home the striker bought for his parents in West Derby, Liverpool. Richie Rooney, 54, was arrested at his home in Croxteth, Liverpool, while Jennings, a former Tranmere Rovers players who hails from Kirkby, near Liverpool, was arrested at his home in Glasgow. The alleged betting scam is said to be worth £100,000. All men deny the allegations. 'And he will now not be able to play the first game in the Euros. It's a red card. You can't defend that. 'I'm not happy, absolutely. I spoke with him. He made a silly mistake and he said, ""Yes, sorry"". More than that, I can't do. 'He's a really important player with a lot of experience and he's played really important games. But it's a silly mistake. 'Rooney was not happy because he missed some control and some passes. For this reason, I think he reacted. His reaction was to kick the opponent. 'It will be good lesson for him and the team. The player is frustrated from on the pitch not from what happened away from it.' Goals from Ashley Young and Darren Bent gave England an early 2-0 lead but they were pegged back to 2-2 by a goal in the final seconds of each half. Capello added: 'I can't enter into the head of Wayne Rooney when he plays. I can speak before. I can substitute him. 'I can find different solutions. But the reaction of the players, you cannot understand during the game, why things happen.' When Andrija Delibasic equalised in stoppage time at the end of the game, the home crowd went crazy. The draw clinches second place for them and a chance to qualify through a play-off. Home fans invaded the pitch and taunted the England fans. England's players ran for the tunnel to avoid the stampede. It ought to have been a night of celebration for Capello's team but the late goal and Rooney's red card took off the gloss. Montenegro manager Branko Brnovic said: 'I read in the newspapers that Rooney has some family problems in England. To be honest, I didn't expect him to play.' Joe Hart said after the game that the England players had been disappointed by the antics of their opponents. He claimed England had met with physical intimidation and questioned why there was not a red card for Montenegro.","Team left hanging on with 10 men to scrape into European Championships after dismissal .

The U.S. drones used to kill Anwar al-Awlaki and other Al Qaeda chiefs have been infected by a computer virus that logs their every move, it has been claimed. The unmanned Predator, which killed the American attack planner, and the Reaper crafts are still able to complete missions over Yemen, Afghanistan and other warzones. But each keystroke made by pilots, who operate the drones remotely from a base in Nevada, is said to be recorded by the virus and experts are struggling to remove it. Predator: The craft, which killed Al Qaeda boss Anwar al-Awlak, is said to be one of two drones infected by the virus . Specialists think the infection has hit both classified and unclassified machines at the base. This means that some of the data captured by the virus may have been transmitted to the internet and could be available to terrorists online. In recent years the U.S. military has . increasingly relied on drones, which were first used in the mid-1990s. Although, each drone cost between . $10million for a Predator and $30million for a Reaper, they are highly . valued because they do not risk the . lives of U.S. servicemen. Their . use, particularly in remote areas of Afghanistan, Pakistan . and Yemen has risen amid the increasing military death toll. Given . the controversial nature of missions in sovereign countries, which have not approved U.S. operations, . drones are seen as the best way of carrying out such missions. Last month, a Predator drone scored . its most high-profile victim yet, killing Awlaki and other Al Qaeda . operatives in a convoy in Yemen.

They are understood to have killed more than 2,000 suspected terrorists and civilians. More than 150 additional craft, under U.S. Air Force control, watch over the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. American . military drones struck 92 in Libya between mid-April and late August, . when dictator Moammar Gaddafi was ousted from power after 42 years. None of the remote cockpits, in which pilots steer the craft using joysticks and monitors, are supposed to be connected to the public internet. But the so-called ‘air gaps’ between classified and public networks have reportedly been bridged in the past through the use of discs and removable drives. Predator and Reaper crews use removable hard drives to load map updates and transport mission videos from one computer to another. The virus is believed to have spread through these removable drives. Drone units at other Air Force bases worldwide have now been ordered to stop their use. In the meantime, technicians at Creech Air Force Base are trying to get the virus off the Ground Control System machines. ‘We keep wiping it off, and it keeps coming back,’ says a source familiar with the network infection told technology website Wired.com. ‘We think it’s benign. But we just don’t know.’ However, security specialists at Creech are not sure whether the so-called ‘keylogger’ virus were introduced intentionally or by accident. They believe it may be a common piece of malware that just happened to make its way into these sensitive networks. The situation is serious enough that senior officers at Creech are being briefed daily on the virus. In recent years the U.S. military has increasingly relied on drones, which were first used in the mid-1990s in the former Yugoslavia. Although, each drone cost between . $10million for a Predator and $30million for a Reaper, they are highly . valued because they can search, spy and destroy without risking the . lives of U.S. servicemen.

American military drones struck 92 in Libya between mid-April and late August, when dictator Moammar Gaddafi was ousted from power after 42 years. But despite their widespread use, the drone systems are known to have security flaws. Notably, hours of footage was captured by Iraqi insurgents in 2009 using a $26 piece of software. The Air Force declined to comment directly on the virus, when . ‘We generally do not discuss specific vulnerabilities, threats, or responses to our computer networks, since that helps people looking to exploit or attack our systems to refine their approach,’ Lieutenant Coloenel Tadd Sholtis, a spokesman for Air Combat Command, told Wired. ‘We invest a lot in protecting and monitoring our systems to counter threats and ensure security, which includes a comprehensive response to viruses, worms, and other malware we discover.’","Predator and Reaper drones 'hit by mysterious keylogger virus'

Accomplished soldier: L/Cpl Jonathan McKinlay died when his patrol came under fire in Afghanistan's Helmand Province on September 14 . Tributes have been paid to a British soldier killed in Afghanistan who 'died trying to make the world a better place'. Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, of B Company, 1st Battalion The Rifles, was killed on September 14 by a burst of small-arms fire while on patrol with his team. Family and friends gathered for his funeral at St George Church, Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, today - on the 10th anniversary of the conflict in Afghanistan. His union flag-draped coffin adorned with flowers was carried into the small church by six of L/Cpl McKinlay's comrades to the sound of High on a Hill. The 33-year-old from Darlington, County Durham, leaves behind his wife Lisa, mother Valerie, sister Becca, daughter Megan and stepchildren Ollie and Piper. During the service, tears mingled with mirth as people laughed at stories from L/Cpl McKinlay's life. The mourners were told 'there was never a dull moment' when L/Cpl McKinlay was around. Speaking to more than 200 mourners packed into the church, Padre Grant Ashton told them L/Cpl McKinlay had 'died trying to make the world a better place'. He read out a few words from L/Cpl McKinlay's mother, who said: 'Jonathan always lived life by the skin of his teeth. 'He sky-dived, loved it; he rode a motorbike, loved it; and he was an infantry soldier, loved it. Not a safe trio, I'm sure you'll agree. 'He died doing the job he loved with his kind of people around him. 'As his mum, I will miss him dearly until the end of my days. Life is going to be a lot duller without him.' Grieving: L/Cpl McKinlay's wife Lisa (blonde hair, centre) and his family follow the coffin from George Church, Bulford Camp, in Wiltshire . Poignant: L/Cpl McKinlay's funeral was held on the 10th anniversary of the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, the invasion of Afghanistan . Serjeant Gavin Shorrock, who had been L/Cpl McKinlay's best man at his wedding, read a tribute from Lisa. It said: 'From the moment we met, you wowed me. We connected right there and then and always said we were two missing pieces come together. 'Wherever you are Jon, forever you have our hearts. Watch over Ollie, Megan and Piper and me. I love you.' Sjt Shorrock added his own stories of L/Cpl McKinlay, bringing laughter from the congregation about nights out, fancy dress and on-tour anecdotes of three course meals using almost all of their ration packs. He added: 'Jon, I cannot believe I'm standing here doing this when it is only 11 months ago I was doing your best man speech. I was proud of you then and I am proud of you now. 'You served your country with honour and you were an asset to the Rifles. Mate, it's never going to be the same without you. You've done your job, stand down.' Paying respects: Soldiers from the 1 Rifles Honour Guard fire volleys within the grounds of the church as L/Cpl McKinlay's coffin is placed into the back of the hearse . Following the Last Post, the coffin was taken from the church to the sound of Pink's Who Knew. As it was placed into the back of the hearse, the 1 Rifles Honour Guard fired volleys within the grounds of the church. Watching the hearse, with flowers that spelled out Dad, his family wiped tears from their cheeks and hugged each other before the cortege made its way to Salisbury for a private cremation. L/Cpl McKinlay was known as an outgoing and friendly commander who was said to have had time for everyone he met. Mourning: Lisa McKinlay (left) comforts ten-year-old daughter Piper (right) outside the church. Paying tribute, Mrs McKinlay asked her husband to watch over her and his three children from beyond the grave . In loving memory: The hearse leaves the funeral carrying the Union Flag-draped coffin adorned with flowers which spelled out 'dad' Paying tribute, Major Alex Price, 1 Rifles, said: 'To anyone who met him, L/Cpl McKinlay made an instant impact. 'He was a man of great character, he was agile of mind and he was not afraid to express a considered opinion when the opportunity arose. 'He took delight in doing things for others to make their life more comfortable and he was a real grafter. He was happy to help out in any scenario no matter how big or small the contribution required. '1 Rifles have lost a fantastic battalion character and a highly accomplished soldier.' Too many deaths: L/Cpl McKinlay is among 382 British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks . L/Cpl McKinlay deployed to Afghanistan as a battle-casualty replacement in June 2011, having recently qualified as a Bravo Mortar Fire Controller. He was based in Checkpoint Chaabak in the Nahr-e Saraj (South) district of Helmand. The soldier was with members of the Afghan Uniform Police in a village near his checkpoint when they came under attack. This week marks 10 years since the US and UK launched the campaign known as Operation Enduring Freedom in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. The conflict in Afghanistan has left hundreds of British families mourning the deaths of loved ones who fought and died there. The number of British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 currently stands at 382. This compares with 179 UK personnel who died in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. L/Cpl McKinlay joined the Army in 1996 and racked up 'a great degree of experience' throughout his career, with deployments to Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence said. The MoD added: 'He held an impressive array of qualifications on top of this, making him a great asset to his company and the battalion.'","L/Cpl McKinlay 'lived by the skin of his teeth' and 'died doing a job he loved'

Tragic Sian Thomas, 38, tumbled in a nightclub after catching one of her white leather heels in the hem of her dress during a friend's leaving party. She suffered bruising to her knee which developed into an embolism and she died two days later from a blood clot on the brain, an inquest at Worcestershire Coroners Court was told. 'Dreadfully tragic': Sian Thomas developed a fatal blood clot after falling over in her high heels on a night out on June 6 . Miss Thomas, a landlady at the Berkeley Arms in Spetchley, Worcestershire, was 'in agony' the day after the fall, but managed to joke about the incident. She told pals on Facebook about her 'good night' at Mode nightclub in Worcester on June 6. She wrote: 'Had a good night for jenny's leaving party but slipped over in my heels and been to A AND E and i have bruised the bone on my knee !!! in agony, cant walk :(...' A friend replied: 'hi sianey well that was silly wasnt it'. Just hours after posting the comments, Miss Thomas was taken ill at her partner Rob McCairn's house and was rushed to Worcestershire Royal Hospital at 10am. Humour: Miss Thomas, pictured here with partner Rob McCairn, joked about her tumble on Facebook, but died in 'fantastically rare' circumstances the next day . She tragically died the next afternoon, on June 8, after developing an embolism as a result of her fall. A pathology report revealed she had developed deep vein thrombosis in her left leg from not being able to move it. This led to a blood clot which went into her lungs and passed through a hole in her heart, before entering her brain. Popular: Miss Thomas, a landlady at the Berkeley Arms in Spetchley, Worcestershire (pictured), was dedicated to her job, friends and family . Consultant Rosemary Johnson, who treated Miss Thomas, told the inquest such clots would normally be filtered out in the lungs, but the hole had enabled it to pass through. She described the circumstances as 'fantastically rare', saying she had never seen it occur in her 15 years as an A&E consultant. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Worcestershire coroner Geraint Williams said the incident was 'dreadfully tragic'.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:35 PM on 7th October 2011 . Bank tellers, restaurant workers and other service employees in New York lifted credit card data from foreign tourists and residents as part of an identity theft ring that stretched to China, Europe and the Middle East and victimized thousands, authorities said Friday. In total, 111 people were arrested after a more than $13 million spending spree in luxury goods, and five separate criminal enterprises were dismantled. District Attorney Richard Brown in the New York borough of Queens called it the largest fraud case he'd seen in his two decades in office. NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said while it wasn't a typical stick up, hundreds of people were robbed in the mass fraud bust revealed on Friday . The charges include enterprise corruption, theft and grand larceny. 'These . weren't holdups at gunpoint, but the impact on victims was the same,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. 'They were robbed.' Authorities say the graft operated like this: . At least three bank workers, retail employees and restaurant workers would steal credit card numbers in a process known as skimming, in which workers take information when a card is swiped for payment and illegally sell the credit card numbers. Thieves would steal data and forgers would make new credit cards and IDs to spend victims' money . Other members of the criminal ring would steal card information online. The numbers were given to teams of manufacturers who would forge Visas, MasterCards, Discover and American Express cards. Realistic identifications were made with the stolen data. Teams if criminal 'shoppers' would use the cards for spending sprees at higher-end stores including Apple, Bloomingdale's and Macy's. The groups resold the merchandise to locations in China, Europe and the Middle East. More than $13 million was spent on iPads, iPhones, computers, watches and handbags from Gucci and Louis Vuitton, authorities said. The suspects also charged expensive hotel rooms and rented private jets and fancy cars, prosecutors said. 'Thieves have an amazing knowledge of how to use technology,' Kelly said. 'The schemes and the imagination that is developing these days are days are really mind-boggling.' Detectives with language skills spent hours translating Russian, Farsi and Arabic during the investigation, Kelly said. Part of the problem, especially for foreign tourists, is that credit card companies in the U.S. do not install special microchips that make skimming more difficult, said Deputy Inspector Gregory Antonsen of the NYPD's organized theft and identity theft task force. But he said the companies work with police to help fight theft. 'So if you're a victim of a loss ... you will get your money back,' Antonsen said.","Over $13million spent on iPads, iPhones, computers, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, hotels and private jets ."

"By ANTHONY BOND . Last updated at 6:11 PM on 8th October 2011 . Two Polish men have been arrested and charged with carrying out a string of bomb attacks at Ikea stores across Europe and trying to extort millions from the Swedish furniture giant. The arrests shed light on a mysterious spate of bombings that had prompted the evacuation of shoppers and forced the popular retailer to beef up security around the continent. A handful of homemade bomb attacks took place between May and September in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the Czech Republic. Suspects: Plain-clothed police officers arrest the two men who are alleged to have carried out a string of bomb attacks at Ikea stores throughout Europe . Two people were lightly injured in the German attack but there were no fatalities. Some of the bombs were potentially lethal, although not all detonated. Polish officials said they have significant evidence incriminating the two men for planting the explosives and trying to extort 6 million euros from Ikea. The arrests were made after a manhunt involving investigators from across Europe. 'The perpetrators prepared for this very carefully. Handcuffed: One of the two 39-year-old men arrested in Poland in connection with attacks against Ikea in Europe . 'They set up a bank account, demanded a transfer over the Internet, but fortunately the ransom was never paid,' said Andrzej Matejuk, police commander with the Central Bureau of Investigation. 'Significant evidence was gathered on the men which clearly points to their guilt,' Mr Matejuk said. After the last attack in Prague, the men demanded that Ikea pay them 6 million euros and threatened more attacks if the money wasn't paid quickly, Matejuk said at a news conference in Wroclaw. Ikea spokeswoman Camilla Meiby said today that the 'detonations recently have developed into an extortion scheme, which we of course have taken very seriously.' She said Ikea was informed of the arrests today by Polish police but did not want to comment any further. 'We continue to closely cooperate with the Polish police,' Ms Meiby said. Both men were charged with endangering the lives of many people, extortion and racketeering and could face up to 10 years in prison. They were identified as Mikolaj G. and Adam K., both 39-year-olds from the northern Polish city of Gdynia. Their full names were not given, in accordance with Polish laws that protect the identities of suspects. Mr Matejuk said that one of them has committed crimes in the past, including dealing drugs. The other has a very different profile: a former manager of several companies who speaks four languages and had no criminal record. Police operation: Officers from Poland's Central Bureau of Investigation arrested the two men in the Kujawsko Pomorskie region of Poland . Police spokesman Mariusz Sokolowski said the men were arrested on Wednesday. Hundreds of Polish officers have been working on the case along with their counterparts in the countries where the attacks occurred. 'Because the bomb loads were getting stronger, there was a serious threat to the life and health of many people. Time counted,' Mr Sokolowski told the news agency PAP. Stores in Belgium, the Netherlands and France were hit by simultaneous bombings in May. Witnesses at a store in Ghent, Belgium, compared the explosions to large firecrackers and an employee and a security guard complained of minor ear injuries as a result of the noise. Threat: Belgian police block access to an Ikea store during a bomb alert in Anderlecht, a suburb of Brussels, earlier this month . The explosion in the Netherlands destroyed a trash can. Two people suffered blast trauma and some furniture was slightly damaged in a blast in Germany in June. Ikea said at the time the explosives were different from those used in the simultaneous incidents. The most recent bombing was in the Czech Republic on September 2. The attacks across Europe frightened shoppers and prompted Ikea to beef up security and vigilance at its stores. It's not clear, however, if the attacks scared off enough shoppers to hurt Ikea's income. The family-owned company last reported earnings early this year. Ikea said net income was 2.69 billion euros in the 12 months to August 31, 2010. That was up from a profit of 2.53 billion euros in the previous year, which was the first time the company released a full-year financial statement.","Pair alleged to have attempted to extort millions from furniture giant .

Three inspirational women who have campaigned for equal rights and an end to violence in Liberia and Yemen were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize today. Liberian, Leymah Gbowee, who mobilised fellow women against the country’s civil war by organising a 'sex strike' was named along with her nation's president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The third recipient who will share the prize worth more than $1.5 million  was Tawakkul Karman, who has campaigned tirelessly for women's rights in Yemen. Girl power: Left to right, Yemeni activist Tawakkul Karman, Liberian President Ellen . Johnson Sirleaf and Liberian 'peace warrior' Leymah Gbowee have jointly . won the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize . Prior to the announcement bizarre rumours had circulated that the award would go to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, reflecting the role of social networking sites in the Arab Spring uprisings . Announcing the award committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said:   'We . cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women . obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all . levels of society. 'The Nobel Peace Prize for 2011 is to be divided in three equal parts between Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights to full participation in peace-building work.' Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, is Africa’s first freely elected female president and the 24th President of Liberia. Joy: Yemeni activist Tawakkul Karman laughs as she speaks on the telephone after the announcement of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize in Sanaa, Yemen, today .

Gbowee was on a book tour in the United States, her Accra, Ghana-based office said. Tawakul Karman is a Yemeni politician and human rights activist who created the group Women Journalists Without Chains (WJWC) in 2005. Cheers: Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize 2011 today, waves to supporters at her house in Monrovia . The group aims to promote human rights 'In particular particularly freedom of opinion and expression, and democratic rights'.

She said today the award was a victory for Yemen and all Arab Spring revolutions and a message that the era of Arab dictatorships was over. 'This is a victory for the Yemeni woman. Today the whole world can hear our joy. I am very very happy and I thank God for this award,'  the 32-year-old mother of three said. 'This is a victory for the Yemeni people, for the Yemeni revolution and all the Arab revolutions. This is a message that the era of Arab dictatorships is over. This is a message to this regime and all the despotic regimes that no voice can drown out the voice of freedom and dignity.' Mr Jagland added: 'In the most trying circumstances, both before and during the Arab Spring, Tawakkul Karman has played a leading part in the struggle for women’s rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen.' 'It is the Norwegian Nobel . Committee’s hope that the prize to Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee . and Tawakkul Karman will help to bring an end to the suppression of . women that still occurs in many countries, and to realise the great . potential for democracy and peace that women can represent.' Committee . chairman Jagland had fueled speculation that the award would go to . Facebook CEO  Zuckerberg after remarks he made during an interview with . the Associated Press. He said: 'For me and the committee it is quite obvious if you look at the world today and see what is happening out there. 'What are the major forces pushing the world in the right direction?' He added that the winner would be 'obvious' and would reflect 'the most positive development' of the year. Commentators . were quick to link his words to the Arab Spring Uprisings and more . specifically the role of social networking sites such as Facebook and . its rival Twitter in spreading the dissent. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has  welcomed the announcement that the women received the Nobel Peace Prize, saying it was 'a testament to the power of women.' 'Above all, it underscores the vital role that women play in the advancement of peace and security, development, and human rights,' he said. 'I really congratulate all three winners from the bottom of my heart.' Praise: 'We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society,' committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland said today . Award: Thorbjoern Jagland, General Secretary of the Council of Europe and Norwegian chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize award (centre) announces the winners in Oslo . ELLEN JOHNSON SIRLEAF . Politician Johnson-Sirleaf earned the nickname 'Iron Lady' by challenging warlord Charles Taylor for the presidency in 1997 during Liberia's brutal civil war. She lost by a landslide, but that never shook her resolve. She won the 2005 presidential run-off against football icon George Weah, who alleged fraud although the polls received a clean bill of health from observers. She was sworn in as Africa's first elected female head of state in January 2006. Johnson-Sirleaf vowed to create a 'government of inclusion' to heal the wounds of war and toured the streets to win over Liberia's poor youth, many of them former child soldiers who believe Weah was cheated. In January 2010, she went back on her campaign promise to be president for only one term when she announced she would contest the 2011 presidential election, to be held on October 11. She has won widespread international praise for her work rebuilding Liberia, but is still struggling to convince many in the country that change is coming fast enough. LEYMAH GBOWEE . Activist Leymah Gbowee, 39, mobilised and organised women across ethnic and religious divides to help bring an end to the war in Liberia and to ensure women's participation in elections. Following the 2003 peace treaty, her network encouraged many more women to vote and was instrumental in the victory of Johnson-Sirleaf. Since 2004, Gbowee has served as a commissioner on Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Since 2006, Gbowee has been executive director of Women in Peace and Security Network - Africa, an organization that works with women in Liberia, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone to promote peace, literacy, and electoral politics. TAWAKUL KARMAN . Both before and during the 'Arab Spring', protester and campaigner Tawakul Karman, 32, has played a leading part in the struggle for women's rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen. Founder in 2005 and chairwoman of Women Journalists without Chains, Tawakul Karman is a Yemeni journalist and activist who has devoted herself to the fight for media freedom. She is also a member of the Islamist party Islah Was. A thorn in the side of the government, she was briefly arrested early this year after leading protests against autocratic Arab rulers. She vowed in February to galvanise a youth-led uprising against President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has ruled Yemen for 33 years.'We started rallies before Tunisia's revolution and were demanding reforms and other rights. But after Tunisia, we realised the solution is for this regime to go,' she said.","Liberian Leymah Gbowee mobilised women against civil war .

His dignified plea for calm just hours after the death of his son at the height of this summer’s looting was credited with averting a race riot. Tariq Jahan, 46, was praised by police, the Prime Minister and media alike for his decisive intervention in the street where, hours earlier, he had cradled his dying son, Haroon, 21. Even last week he was described as a ‘hero’ by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and days ago he was handed a Pride of Britain award by a national newspaper. But Mr Jahan delivered his call for calm while facing charges over an alleged attack which left a man seriously injured, it has emerged. Mr Jahan, who met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Birmingham after the riots, is said to have punched a man in the face, breaking his jaw, in an alleged road rage incident in July. He was originally arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm – which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment – but now faces the lesser charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent. Mr Jahan’s son and two friends were killed as they tried to defend a petrol station against looters on August 10 in Winson Green. Birmingham was left a tinderbox after it was confirmed that a man arrested on suspicion of murdering the Asians was black. The three men who died that summer's night: From left, Haroon Jahan, Shazad Ali and Abdul Musavir . It was then that Mr Jahan stepped . forward, telling a crowd: ‘I lost my son. Blacks, Asians, whites, we all . live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another? Why are . we doing this? Step forward if you want to lose your sons. Otherwise, . calm down and go home – please.’ West Midlands Police chief constable . Chris Sims described the appeal for calm as a ‘powerful, generous and . decisive intervention’. Another senior officer admitted that . the speech ‘turned the tide’. David Cameron told MPs ‘everyone will have . been impressed’ by Mr Jahan’s ‘brave words’. The West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Mr Jahan is charged with inflicting GBH without intent.

"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 1:32 AM on 8th October 2011 . Beleaguered savers faced a new nightmare yesterday as 12 banks and building societies had their credit ratings downgraded. Those with large amounts of savings were urged to move their money to safe havens amid fears that some banks could go under. Just a day after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said the world was facing its worst ever financial crisis, Moody’s Investor Service slashed the . ratings of Lloyds, Santander, RBS, the Co-operative Bank, the Nationwide . building society and seven smaller societies. Save our savings: A protest outside the Bank of England on Thursday . Pensions . Downgrades . The downgrade saw their share prices tumble. It is also likely to drive up borrowing costs and starve businesses of credit. That prospect sparked Liberal Democrat calls for RBS to be totally nationalised and forced to lend to small firms. Whitehall insiders warned that the bank might need another state bailout . to pass ‘stress tests’ being conducted by the European Union. RBS, . Lloyds, Santander, Co-Operative Bank, Nationwide, Newcastle, Norwich . & Peterborough, Nottingham, Principality, Skipton, West Bromwich and . Yorkshire . To add to the panic, another credit rating agency, Fitch, downgraded the . prospects of Italy and Spain, describing the economic outlook for both . as ‘negative’. That increased the chance of Europe’s third and fourth . biggest economies needing massive loans. UK taxpayers have already contributed £12.5billion to a £235billion fund to prop up Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The Fitch downgrade will pile greater pressure on British banks, which . are heavily exposed to other financial institutions in the troubled . eurozone. Moody’s said the downgrades followed the Government telling the banks to . stand on their own two feet rather than rely in future on taxpayer . bailouts. The agency said it believes the institutions are now at . greater risk of needing financial help. RBS and Lloyds TSB – which both received handouts – saw their shares drop by more than 3 per cent. Moody’s said the downgrade was not a sign the banks’ situation had . deteriorated. Storm: Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King, left, warned of the biggest financial crisis in history, but Chancellor George Osborne said the Government had a plan for the growing storm . ALEX . BRUMMER: 'From the Government’s point of view the most worrying of the . UK bank downgrades will be Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking . Group, in which they hold 82pc and 40pc stakes respectively. Customers . on the high street looking for the safest place to deposit their money . face hard decisions too, as trusted names such as the Co-operative, . Nationwide and Santander are also downgraded. The wise depositor should . now seek to spread their savings as widely as possible and not . necessarily just chase the best return.' Read more here . From yesterday's Mail . But the change is likely to drive up the cost of . borrowing, hitting small firms already starved of cash. Last night Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close ally of Business . Secretary Vince Cable, said: ‘We must now nationalise RBS to do the job . our nation needs. ‘Taxpayers own 82 per cent of the shares but we’re getting the worst of . all worlds because the Treasury hides behind outside shareholders . instead of controlling lending and bonuses. RBS is the worst culprit, . starving viable small businesses of the credit they need to grow. ‘They can’t wait for the Treasury  to dream up fancy new financial . structures – they just want them to pull the stuck lending levers now . right under their noses, starting with RBS.’ George Osborne insisted the . Government’s calls for the banks to hold more cash had helped protect . them from the worst of the financial whirlwhind. The Chancellor said Britain was ‘out of the eye of the storm’, adding: . ‘I am confident that British banks are well capitalised, they are . liquid, they aren’t experiencing the kind of problems that some of the . banks in the eurozone are experiencing.’ But experts warned those with savings of more than £85,000 to divide . their money between institutions. The sum is the maximum guarantee for . each separately-registered bank or building society under a government . compensation scheme. Jason Riddle, founder of campaign group Save our Savers, said: ‘The . downgrade of 12 banks and building societies will further undermine . savers’ faith in the banking system. Double-dip recession fears in the U.S. eased today after a better-than-anticipated jobs report for September. U.S. firms created 103,000 jobs, against economist expectations of 60,000, . but the additional hiring was not enough to lift the overall . unemployment rate, which stayed at 9.1 per cent for the third month in a . row. The data gave . markets across Europe a modest boost with the FTSE 100 Index up more . than 70 points soon after the figures were released, though the UK's top . flight eased back subsequently. Andrew . Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co, said: . 'In the big picture, today's reading soothes recessionary fears.' Companies . with large U.S. businesses led the rally. Building supplies firm . Wolseley, which generates 40 per cent of revenues in the country, topped . the FTSE 100 risers while there were also good gains for Holiday Inn . and Crowne Plaza hotel group InterContinental. The . US labour department also raised its estimates for the number of jobs . created in the previous two months. Non-farm payrolls, or new jobs . added, rose by 57,000 in August and by 127,000 in July, according to the . revised data. ‘Most people’s savings will be more than adequately covered by the government guarantee. ‘But anyone with more would be well advised to spread their money over . several institutions which are separately registered for the . compensation scheme.’ Kevin Mountford, of the comparison site Moneysupermarket.com, said: . ‘Savers will be nervous on banks and building societies being . downgraded. ‘The savings environment is increasingly challenging for  savers looking for security and good rates. ‘But they should not panic and take money out of banks and put it under . the mattress. 'Their money is protected by the government compensation . scheme.’ Established in 1900, Moody’s vies with Standard & Poor’s as the . world’s biggest credit ratings agency. 'It is a public company listed on . the New York Stock Exchange and legendary investor Warren  Buffett is . the biggest shareholder with a stake of 13 per cent. Moody’s failed to raise the alarm in the run-up to the financial crash. Lehman Brothers and AIG both enjoyed top-notch ratings from the agency . before they nosedived in 2008. Fitch, which was set up in New York in 1913, is the smallest of the big three credit ratings agencies. It merged with UK-based rival IBCA in 1997. What are bank credit ratings? Three big agencies – Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch – analyse the balance sheets and trading environments of financial institutions on a regular basis so that investors, depositors, and the Government can make a judgements as to their stability. The top-notch rating is AAA.Why are they important? They determine how easily the bank or building society can obtain loans on the money markets and therefore maintain cash-flow, or liquidity. But almost as importantly they affect the general perception of how safe an institution is.So Moody’s is saying these banks and building societies are now less safe? Well, sort-of: it is saying that they are less likely to receive capital injections from the public purse in a crisis. Smaller building societies are likely to come out of this analysis badly because they are small enough for the Government to allow them to fail if they get into financial difficulties. But the report also implies that now – unlike during the financial crisis when the Government came to the rescue of stricken banking giants like Lloyds and RBS – no bank is too big to fail. The Nationwide, which has been downgraded, is the biggest mutual in the UK.But by saying this Moody’s is in itself making them less safe? Yes, there’s a perverse logic at work. Governments might be less willing to jump in to help an institution with a poorer credit rating, and depositors and investors may start to avoid them.Can we trust these agencies? Many people think not. They did not come particularly well out of the financial crisis, when they failed to spot the massive weaknesses in big world banks’ balanced sheets caused by the trading in sub-prime mortgage debt.Perhaps chastened by that experience, some suspect now that they are too trigger happy in their judgements on banks.What will be the immediate impact? The direct impact may be minimal. Banks obtain their funding from a variety of sources including long-term bonds which will now be more expensive. Moreover, the new round of quantitative easing announced by the Bank of England, which could reach a total of £300bn in fresh cash, should ensure that the high street banks can sell securities to the Bank for cash. So mortgage, loan and card borrowers should hopefully not see rates rise or credit harder to come by.So what does it mean for savers? Customers on the high street looking for the safest placed to deposit their money have traditionally faced tricky choices, and many were caught out by the collapse of Northern Rock in September 2007.But Government guarantees mean ordinary depositors are protected up to £85,000 (£170,000 for joint accounts) at each separate institution where they hold deposits. Those worried about private sector banks might consider National Savings bonds, savings accounts or Premium Bonds – which are directly guaranteed by the government – as possible homes for spare cash.","Decision will make it harder for banks to borrow and loan .

Coffee shops famous for selling cannabis in the Netherlands will be forced to remove some types of the drug from their stores  after new restrictions are brought in. Due to higher potency levels, the Dutch government is reclassifying some strains of the plant to the same category as hard drugs. Dutch politicians say the more popular high-strength cannabis, known as 'skunk', is more dangerous than it was before and will have to be removed from coffee-shop shelves. Blow: Coffee shop owners famous for selling cannabis will have to replace about 80% of their stock with weaker varieties due to new restrictions . It is claimed that the amount of the . main active chemical in cannabis THC, has gone up, making it far more . potent than a generation ago. The new restrictions will mean that . anything containing more than 15% THC will be treated the same way as . hard drugs, such as cocaine and ecstasy. Soon to be banned: High strength 'Skunk'' will be banned in the Netherlands from next year . The news has come as a blow to the . coffee shop owners as they will have to replace about 80% of their stock . with weaker varieties. Marc . Josemans, who runs a cafe in Maastricht, told the BBC that he believes . that the new tough approach is being driven by the increasingly . influential far-right in Dutch politics. He said: 'You immediately can taste the difference. Everything which is considered unusual for them - they call it 'left hobbies' and under this name they want to ban all 'left hobbies', like using cannabis,' The ban on the high-strength 'skunk' is expected to be introduced next year, when police will start doing random checks in the cafes.

"By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 1:19 AM on 8th October 2011 . Jailed: David Simmonds, the son of a company director, admitted battering graduate Jia Ashton to death . A 6ft 2in man battered a petite business analyst to death as she walked home from work and then calmly ordered fish and chips. Sentencing 19-stone David Simmonds to 28 years in jail for the murder of six-stone Jia Ashton, a judge asked the hushed courtroom: ‘Can you imagine a more unequal contest?’ He said the economics graduate’s final moments as she walked along a woodland path known as the Yellow Brick Road must have been ones of ‘abject terror’. The injuries she suffered were so horrific that a pathologist compared them to those suffered in a car accident or a fall from a tall building. Following the brutal killing, tattooed Simmonds then buried her body under logs and rocks before leaving to calmly order a fish and chip dinner from his local shop. The former Thorntons worker even pretended to friends at the shop that the scratches on his arms and face were caused after he got into a pub brawl to ‘protect a girl’. Mrs Ashton’s body was found three days later by a mountain rescue dog following an intensive search of the local area. The 25-year-old, who had been to see a doctor to discuss starting a family shortly before her death, was described in court as ‘conscientious, determined and focused’ with ‘every prospect of a successful career’. In contrast, Simmonds was staying at the homes of various friends after a fall-out with his parents, and had taken out a £30 crisis loan from his local Jobcentre Plus on the day he killed the young woman. Nottingham Crown Court heard Simmonds, 21, claimed to have ‘panicked’ while attempting to rob Mrs Ashton, possibly after she fought back or recognised him. The pair lived in the same area and Simmonds had been employed at Thorntons as a seasonal Christmas worker twice in the past. But Judge Michael Stokes QC said her horrific injuries, including a ruptured heart, suggested a ‘sinister motive’ and ‘dangerous hidden aspects’ to the 21-year-old. Matthew and Jia Ashton on their wedding day in China: He called her his 'Pocket Princess' The hearing was also told that police . had suspected a sexual motive for the attack, but there was no forensic . evidence to back the claim. Judge Stokes added that Simmonds had robbed Mrs Ashton and her husband . Matthew, 26, of a ‘golden future’ together in a ‘most cruel and wicked . manner’. Jailing Simmonds for life, with a recommendation he serve at least 28 . years before being considered for release, he added: ‘You have pleaded . guilty very late in the day to a truly terrible crime that has left . Jia’s husband and family utterly devastated. ‘You have visited immense shock on your own family. They can simply not imagine what you have done. ‘Had your motive been only robbery, given the huge disparity in size and . weight, you would have had a simple task of relieving her of the few . pounds she had in her possession. ‘I am satisfied that, whatever the motive, you intended to kill her.’ Relief: Widower Matthew is accompanied by his mother Sue Ashton and Detective Superintendent Terry Branson outside court after Simmonds pleaded guilty to murder . Detectives leading the investigation said the attack on Mrs Ashton, who was on her way home along a woodland path known as the Yellow Brick Road, was a chance attack and Simmonds did his best to conceal the murder. He covered her body with twigs and branches and scattered her belongings around Sleetmoor Woods immediately after the murder. Mrs Ashton, who graduated from Warwick University with an economics degree, was eventually found by a mountain search and rescue dog on March 13, three days after she vanished. Simmonds has refused to offer any explanation for the attack, although police say there may have been a ‘sexual element’ to the fatal assault. While . Mrs Ashton had not been sexually assaulted, her clothing had been . pulled up, exposing her abdomen, where ‘contact’ DNA was recovered. Her . purse was also empty, suggesting robbery as a possible motive for the . attack . Following . Simmonds’s guilty plea, it can be revealed that he had temporary jobs . at Thorntons over the last two Christmas periods, though police do not . believe he met Mrs Ashton or her music teacher husband. Murder: Mrs Asthon (left) disappeared after leaving work on March 10. Simmonds (right) murdered her in what police described as a 'sustained and brutal attack' Mrs Ashton suffered severe injuries and broken ribs and died of a . compression to the chest, which caused her heart to fatally rupture. Her shoulder bag was found 15ft up in the branches of a tree. Five . buttons from her coat were also scattered nearby. Also discarded in the . woods were her glasses, MP3 player and damaged mobile phone. Tragically, Mrs Ashton had rowed with her husband in the days leading up . to her death, causing to him to briefly move out of the home they shared . in Somercotes, Derbyshire, close to the Thorntons headquarters where . she worked. In a heart-rending twist, she left a conciliatory voicemail message for . Matthew, saying they should ‘do something nice’ that evening - but he . didn’t listen to it until the next day, after she had been killed. Mr Ashton, a junior school teacher and private piano tutor, had been an . early suspect in the murder after he had been filmed on CCTV booking . into a local Travel Lodge around the time his wife disappeared. This Derbyshire police handout shows how Mrs Ashton's belongings, including an umbrella cover and coat buttons, were found scattered near her body . This map shows where objects were found in relation to Mrs Ashton's body (white dot) He told police he spent a night at the hotel after a fall-out with his . wife. But the row had ‘not been serious’ and he said he had just needed . to ‘give Jia some space’. When he returned home from work the following evening, on March 10 this . year, he discovered the house was empty and reported her missing. The 26-year-old was arrested and quizzed by police before being eventually cleared of any involvement in her death. Shortly after ruling him out, detectives became convinced the killer was . a local after receiving several witness reports of a scruffy man acting . suspiciously in the 50-acre Sleetmoor Woods around the time she was . attacked.

Right, Mr Ashton pictured after Simmonds admitted to murdering the wife he called his 'Pocket Princess' Tragedy: Mr Ashton (right) carries his wife's coffin in June 2011 at St Thomas's Church in Alfreton, Derbyshire . From the descriptions, police decided there was a strong possibility the . wanted man was a vagrant and obtained from the local council a list of . the registered homeless. It included Simmonds, whose fingerprints and DNA matched that found on her belongings recovered from the scene. It was a vital breakthrough as Simmonds, who had no previous convictions, was not on the police’s national DNA database. Simmonds initially pleaded not guilty to Mrs Ashton’s murder and was due . to go on trial on November 1. But he changed his plea at Nottingham . Crown Court last week. Following that hearing, Mr Ashton released a statement ‘for the family . of Jia Ashton’ in which he said: ‘I hope that justice will be done and . that this despicable being will never be free to kill again.’","Jia's heart was crushed and ruptured by 19 stone David Simmonds .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 4:54 PM on 8th October 2011 . One of the jurors who overturned Amanda Knox's murder conviction has said he was never convinced by the 'conjecture' of the prosecution's case and that he believed the US student and her co-defendant simply did not kill her British roommate. Mauro Chialli was one of eight jurors who on Monday ordered Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito be freed after acquitting them of charges that they sexually assaulted and murdered Meredith Kercher in 2007. Knox returned home to Seattle on Tuesday, and Sollecito to his home in southern Italy. Innocent: Mauro Chialli said he was determined Amanda Knox, left, and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, right, were telling the truth during the trial . In an interview with Italy's state-run RAI television, Mr Chialli said he had spent a lot of time during the 10-month appeals trial reading the faces of Knox and Sollecito and determined they were telling the truth in insisting on their innocence. 'I saw the faces of these two kids, and they couldn't bluff. They didn't bluff. My point of view is that these kids weren't guilty. They weren't there,' he said. Knox and Sollecito were arrested a few days after Miss Kercher's body was discovered in a pool of blood on November 2 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia. Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede was convicted in 2009 of Meredith Kercher's murder and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court . They were convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. A third defendant, Rudy Hermann Guede, was also convicted and had his 16-year prison sentence upheld by Italy's highest court. Following Monday's acquittals, Guede . remains the only one in prison for the death. His lawyer has said he . wants the case reopened, given that Italy's high court determined Guede . did not act alone. Mr . Chialli said there were several elements of the prosecution's case that . did not convince him, primarily the lack of a motive and uncertainties . about the precise time of Miss Kercher's death. Relief: Amanda Knox cries following the verdict that overturns her conviction and acquits her of murdering her British roomate . 'What . didn't convince me was that in the end, it was an accusation based on . so many conjectures,' he said. 'It could have been this way, it could . have been another way.' Knox and Sollecito maintain they were at Sollecito's apartment the night of the killing, smoking hashish, watching a film and having sex. Earlier in the week, the Italian judge who presided over the appeal, Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, said the two were cleared of murder based on the evidence but that the real truth could be different. Justice: Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann during the appeal hearing.

Unexpected: The comedian was struck by an illness just minutes before he was due to perform . Legendary comedian Jerry Lewis was rushed to hospital in Sydney today, after falling ill minutes before he was about to perform to a club. The 85-year-old entertainer, on his eighth tour of Australia to raise money for the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation, fell ill just before he was scheduled to entertain an expectant crowd. Mr Lewis was so ill that he could not even get out of a car which brought him to the club last night. He was driven to hospital where he was admitted for tests but there was no immediate comment on his condition. Mr Lewis had shown no sign of illness earlier in the day, conducting a series of newspaper, tv and radio interviews. In true style, he had radio broadcaster Alan Jones roaring with laughter when he said he wasn't going to be in Sydney after all, but was flying to Brisbane. When Jones asked why, Mr Lewis replied: 'I don't know - I just made that up. I haven't got anything else to say.' [related . Later he told another journalist that he loved coming to Australia, where people had always treated him like a friend since his first visit in 1970 when he ended up staying in Tasmania for four weeks. 'It's a beautiful country, filled with honest beautiful people,' he said. Keeping the laughs coming: Jerry Lewis, seen here in 1967, still attracts big crowds . Clearly the warm feeling is mutual, as when club patrons were told that he had been taken ill and would not be able to continue with his scheduled performance, the gave him a standing ovation and wished him good luck. Mr . Richard Errington, chief executive officer of the Rooty Hill Returned . Servicemen's League club, where Mr Lewis was due to perform, said he was . with the American when he arrived at the club's entrance. Warm welcome: The popular comedian was given a standing ovation of support by the expectant crowd . 'He looked ill. He couldn't even get out of the car,' said Mr Errington. 'He was pale and looked extremely unwell. 'But I was heartened when I went on to the stage to advise the sell-out crowd that he had had to cancel. 'I told the audience they could have refunds, but they rose as one and gave Jerry Lewis a personal standing ovation of support. They said his charity could keep their ticket proceeds as a donation. 'It was a touching gesture that was recorded and will be seen by Mr Lewis when he is well.'

"By . Russell Myers . Last updated at 5:09 PM on 9th October 2011 . A British ticket-holder came forward yesterday to claim a staggering £101 million EuroMillions jackpot – but the identity of the winner remains a mystery. The prize is the third biggest won in the UK, and makes the lucky ticket-holder £1 million richer than pop star David Bowie, the 703rd richest person in the country. A National Lottery spokeswoman said last night: ‘This is amazing news – we are absolutely delighted for the winner. Jackpot jubilation: Biggest-ever EuroMillions winners Colin and Chris Weir, who scooped £161m in July . ‘We’ve got the champagne on ice and look forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into the National Lottery millionaires’ club.’ It was unclear last night if the jackpot had been won by a single ticket-holder or by a syndicate. The winner contacted representatives of Lottery organiser Camelot yesterday by telephone to report they had the seven winning numbers. The numbers from Friday night’s draw were 18, 26, 34, 38 and 42. The Lucky Star numbers were 5 and 8. Subject to checks, the prize could be paid out as early as tomorrow morning when the banks open. 'Mr Scotland' Jordan Steele and model Emily Shakarji pictured in Glasgow in the lead up to last night's huge draw . Scottish couple Colin and Chris Weir scooped the biggest-ever EuroMillions jackpot of £161million earlier this year. The latest lucky British winner may look to the husband and wife from Largs for inspiration on how to spend their fortune. Mr and Mrs Weir decided to buy homes for son Jamie, 22, and 24-year-old daughter Carly, a photography student. They also modestly aimed for driving lessons for them both and said Jamie would probably quit his job at a call centre. The loaded pair also intended to . start their own charity and travel to Cambodia, Thailand and Australia, . where Mr Weir wanted to visit mystical Ayers Rock. Mr Weird jokily said he wanted to keep his 'reliable' Suzuki SX4 and six-year-old Suzuki Ignis. But Mrs Weir insisted she wanted a Lexus Prius Hybrid. However, the winner is not expected to meet Camelot officials until later in the week to have their claim validated.Officials will then advise them on setting up a more secure bank account in which to transfer the funds – an eye-watering £101,203,600. The biggest ever EuroMillions prize was a £161m jackpot won by Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Scotland, in July. The second largest was claimed by a single ticket-holder, who chose to remain anonymous after scooping £113m in October last year. The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May. In . February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, . broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest . prize in the history of EuroMillions. The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. Subject to checks, the prize can be paid out as early as Monday morning when the banks open their doors. The millionaires will now be able to buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each. Cash bonus: Nigel Page and Justine Laycock scooped £56million in the EuroMillions last year . Or they could treat themselves to 720 pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie. They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:05 PM on 4th August 2011 . War speech: Cofer Black calls on security researchers at the Black Hat hacker conference to prevent further cyber attacks . A former director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Centre has warned of an imminent 'code war' where hackers target technology that runs real-world infrastructure such as power stations and water plants. Cofer Black pointed to last year's Stuxnet computer worm, which some researcher's think was designed to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, as a sign of things to come. Hacking, once seen as college prank, has now moved into 'physical destruction of a national resource', he said. 'I don't necessarily understand how this (Stuxnet) was executed, but the important points are that it was really expensive, so a nation-state had to be involved.' Black was speaking yesterday as IT firm McAfee claimed to have uncovered one of the largest-ever cyber attacks - a five-year campaign which targeted 72 organisations. Somewhat fittingly, Black's keynote talk at the Black Hat hacker conference at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, was interrupted by real-world alarm and flashing lights. 'Attention, please. Attention, please,' a robotic woman's voice said repeatedly as Black smiled, apparently confused. 'We are currently investigating the alarm signal you are hearing. Please remain calm.' After a pause and some laughs from the audience, Black kept going. 'This is a very delicate window into our future,' he told the hackers. 'Cold war, global war on terrorism and now you have the code war - which is your war.' Coincidence? The Black Hat hacker conference, held at Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas (pictured), was interrupted by an alarm - just as Mr Black was warning against cyber attacks on real-world targets . It's unclear what caused the alarm - whether it was planned to help make Black's point, was an accident or the result of a hack. Security firms, the UN and the International Olympic Committee are among 72 organisations targeted in a five-year campaign of cyber attacks, IT experts McAfee have claimed. McAfee will not say who it thinks may be responsible, but there is speculation it could be China. Last month, the Pentagon admitted it lost 24,000 files of sensitive data in March in a cyber attack by a foreign government. William Lynn, the US deputy secretary of defence, said the data was taken from the computers of a corporate defence contractor. He said the US government had a 'pretty good idea' who was responsible, but did not elaborate. Many cyber-attacks in the past have been blamed on China. But Beijing has always denied any state involvement in cyber-attacks, branding the allegations 'groundless'. Black Hat is a computer security conference attended by thousands of hackers. One Black Hat spokeswoman said alarms happen every year at the event, but she's not sure what causes them. Another said it wasn't a hack. 'With over 6,500 people in here, it's hard to control who pulls the alarm,' Natalia Wodecki wrote in an e-mail. In any event, Black's siren-punctuated words carry weight, since he's credited with warning the United States government about a September 11-type terrorist attack in August 2001. Black recalled the moment he told defense officials about the threat of al Qaeda - and compared that moment to his Black Hat talk. Officials should be more concerned about a cyber attack, he added. 'People say, ""Were you surprised when 9/11 took place?"" and I can tell you neither myself nor my people in counterterrorism were surprised at all. 'Instead, it was a strange validation of what we had anticipated had indeed taken place. 'In the technology world, you may face similar issues in the future.' Far-reaching: A graphic showing a breakdown of McAfee's findings into one of the biggest series of cyber attacks ever known . He left the talk on an optimistic note, calling on security researchers in the audience to work to prevent such attacks. 'We're all in this together - and we're counting on you,' he said. Black spent 28 years working for the CIA and was appointed director of the agency’s Counterterrorist Centre in 1999 and co-ordinator for counterterrorism for the Department of State. Is nowhere safe? Even the Pentagon (pictured) was targeted when a foreign government stole 24,000 sensitve files in a hacking attack .","Cyber crime moving into 'physical destruction' of national resources, Cofer Black claims .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:49 AM on 28th June 2011 . The TTP have vowed to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden by targeting 10 places in America, the UK and France . The Taliban has issued a chilling threat to carry out a series of attacks against 10 targets in Britain, American and France to avenge the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 'Soon you will see attacks against America and Nato countries, and our first priorities in Europe will be France and Britain,' deputy Pakistani Taliban leader Wali-ur-Rehman said in a videotape aired on Al Arabiya over the weekend. The Tehrik-e-Taliban (TTP), or Taliban Movement of Pakistan,  which swears allegiance to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar, is blamed for many of the suicide bombings across the country and remains highly dangerous despite a series of army offensives against its strongholds in the north-west of the country, on the Afghan border. It has not demonstrated an ability to stage sophisticated attacks in the West, however, and the TTP's one apparent bid to inflict carnage in the U.S. failed. The group claimed responsibility for the botched car bomb attack in New York's Times Square last year. But American intelligence agencies . take it seriously. It was later added to the country's list of foreign . terrorist organisations. The video showed Rehman, described as more sober and experienced than other TTP leaders, flanked by armed followers walking through rough mountain terrain. He sits on a blanket beside a sniper's rifle on a hilltop and explains the TTP's plans. He said: 'We selected 10 targets to avenge the death of bin Laden.' Deputy Pakistani Taliban leader Wali-ur-Rehman made the threats in a video which aired over the weekend . Attack: Labourers clean the Police Station which was stormed by the armed Taliban militants in Kolachi, a town of volatile Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan . Rehman, also seen firing a machine gun into the distance in the video, did not elaborate. But he said the first revenge operation was the Taliban siege of a Pakistani naval base in Karachi last month - one of several setbacks the military has suffered since U.S. special forces killed bin Laden on Pakistani soil on May 2. The TTP regards the Pakistan army as a U.S. puppet and it has kept the government on the defensive since bin Laden's death, staging suicide bombings, large-scale attacks on security forces with large numbers of fighters, and employing new tactics. A Taliban militant and his wife carried out a weekend shooting and suicide bombing on a police station that killed 12 policemen. Britain confirmed yesterday that it is withdrawing 18 military trainers, who had been working with an anti-Taliban unit in Pakistan, amid ‘security concerns’. It was unclear whether the move is linked to the latest threat. The United States has been leaning hard on Pakistan to crack down on militancy since it was discovered that bin Laden may have been living in the country for years. More Pakistani cooperation is needed as Washington seeks to wind down their war effiorts in Afghanistan and defeat Al Qaeda, and its allies. But Pakistan's generals are furious because the United States kept them in the dark over the bin Laden raid . The Pakistani and Afghan Taliban move easily across the porous frontier and provide each other with shelter and intelligence, complicating efforts to root out militancy in the region U.S. President Barack Obama has described as 'the most dangerous place in the world'.","TTP video does not elaborate on targets .

A 33-year-old woman has been jailed for life after murdering her widowed mother in a frenzied knife attack in which she was stabbed more than 60 times. Lisa Traves attacked her 61-year-old mother Priscilla in a 'moment of madness' at the house they shared in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, last November. She stabbed her with a 12.5cm long kitchen knife and left her for dead while she went into Lincoln city centre to meet a friend, before finally ringing 999. Guilty: Lisa Traves was jailed for life after being found guilty of murdering her widowed mother in a frenzied knife attack . Traves was today sentenced to life . imprisonment at Lincoln Crown Court. Judge Michael Heath ordered she . serve a minimum term of 13 years. He told Traves it was clear she and her mother loved one another but she had never been able to develop an independent life. Evidence . suggested that stresses involved in their relationship as well as . financial worries and Traves' claims that she was sexually assaulted . could have contributed to the murder, Judge Heath said. He . told Traves, who put her fingers in her ears and shook her head as the . judge described some of the injuries her mother suffered: 'This was a . deliberate, brutal, sustained and at times forceful attack. 'She was slightly built, unarmed and in no position to defend herself.' Traves originally denied the murder but changed her plea to guilty on July 11, the day she was due to stand trial. The . court heard that on the day of the murder Mrs Traves found out about . her daughter's claims that she was sexually assaulted by two . ex-boyfriends - which were never substantiated by police - and was . demanding she got help, refusing to let her leave the house. At . around 6pm, Mrs Traves tried on three separate occasions to ring a . victim support line on her daughter's behalf, but the calls were never . answered. Traves was sentenced to a minimum term of 13 years at Lincoln Crown Court (pictured) Prosecutor Yvonne Coen QC told the court: 'Within about 45 minutes of those calls Mrs Traves was dead or dying.' She and her daughter got into a squabble that became physical and Traves grabbed a kitchen knife, stabbing her more than 60 times to the chest, neck and back, the court heard. She cleaned the blood off her body, changed out of her blood-stained clothes and made her way into Lincoln city centre to meet a friend. She rang 999 once she was at Lincoln Cathedral, where officers traced the call and arrested her. Ms Coen told the court Traves, who was 32 at the time of the offence, had a difficult relationship with her mother and was unable to talk to her about personal matters, particularly romantic relationships.

New ideas: Major Alex Turner of the Irish Guards who has been awarded with a medal for his original and bold tactics in Afghanistan . An innovative army major has been recognised for his original and bold tactics against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Major Alex Turner has been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his work in the Nahr-e Saraj district. One of the most important achievements of the 37-year-old was in befriending Afghans who had fought against the Soviets in the 1970s and 1980s and convincing them to join with the British in taking on the Taliban. Speaking to The Sunday Times, the Old Etonian said he was forced to change tactics midway through a recent tour because it was difficult to get the local Afghan men to cooperate. 'These men were ex-mujaheddin. The ex-mujaheddin in my area were the first to say, ""This insurgency is different {from their own against the Soviets}. There's no nationalist component to this."" 'They provided the backbone to my security force, that they created. They were very experienced fighters who said ""well, I've fought for 24 years, another year won't hurt."" 'We dressed them in brown salwar kameez outfits and Afghan hats to make them look as much like the local people as possible. I kept it deliberately simple. On guard: A file picture showing a British Army soldier on patrol in Afghanistan . Maj Turner, who is the commanding officer of No 2 Company, 1st Battalion the Irish Guards, also ordered his men to sneak into a Taliban-controlled village at night and plant a flag carrying the message 'sleep well, we're watching you'. The bold move worried the insurgents and also helped reassure some of the locals who were concerned of Taliban attacks. War zone: A map showing the Nahr-e Saraj district in Afghanistan where Major Alex Turner used his innovative tactics . Maj Turner, who read war studies at King's College in London, also used his historical knowledge to borrow tactics used by the French in Algeria and American forces in Vietnam to force insurgents out of 'no man's land' in Helmand. In another incredible achievement, he also made a Taliban warlord dig up the improvised explosive devices (IED) which he had earlier planted. Maj Turner is among 140 servicemen and servicewoman who have been honoured for gallantry during the winter tour of 16 Air Assault Brigade.","Officer ordered his men to sneak into Taliban-controlled village and plant 'we're watching you' flag .

The Thomson Airways flight from Birmingham airport was the first UK commercial biofuels flight ever from a UK airport. One of the engines on the twin- engined Boeing 757 flight was operated on a 50 per cent blend of 'Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids', produced from used cooking oil, and 50 per cent Jet A1 fuel. Not red faced: Protesters from Plane Stupid at Birmingham airport protesting against the UK's first commercial flight using biofuel because of the damage it does to the rainforest . Fry up: Britain's first commercial flight powered by sustainable biofuel takes off from Birmingham airport . But environmental protesters stripped naked and covered themselves in red body paint in a bid to disrupt the launch. Calling themselves Plane Stupid they said that rainforests were being wrecked to make way for biofuel plantations. The cooking oil used for the Thomson flights is collected from the kitchens of hotels and restaurants and then goes through a special processing treatment. Carl Gissing, director of customer service at Thomson Airways, admitted that the biofuel cost around five to six times the price of aviation fuel, but said the airline was prepared to 'put its money where our mouth is' because it believed in sustainable biofuels. You're not under a vest: A Plane Stupid protester is led away by police after the scenes at Birmingham airport . Mr Gissing said: 'We are proud to be . leading the way with the first commercial biofuel flights and we hope it . will make people sit up and take notice.' Mr . Gissing said the move was designed to make a statement which it was . hoped would lead to industry and governments investing in developing . fuels which would reduce carbon emissions. After today's light, carrying 232 passengers, there will be a six-week . gap before Thomson starts a full programme of biofuel flights in 2012 . from Birmingham Airport. Dirk . Konemeijer, managing director of skyNRG, which supplies the biofuel, . said it made sense to utilise used cooking oil because it was a waste . product which couldn't be used for anything else. It . was not economically viable at present to supply the whole of the . aviation industry with the fuel and that was why government support was . needed. Long-term other technology was necessary and in three to four years a totally new fuel could come along. Joe . Peacock, from Birmingham Friends of the Earth, however, said: 'We . cannot ignore the massive environmental and social problems caused by . trying to feed our addiction to fossil fuels with plant-based . alternatives.' Grub's up: The biofuel is made by collecting fat from the kitchens of hotels and restaurants before being refined in a special processing treatment . Plane Stupid protester Chris Cooper said: 'Thomson seem to be acknowledging that we can't continue business as usual in the face of the current climate emergency. 'It's a shame their solution is to make matters worse. 'Vast tracts of rainforest, eco systems vital to halting climate change, are currently being trashed to make way for biofuel plantations. 'Land that grows food is being stolen from some of the world's poorest people so that it can start feeding planes. It's a disaster.'","Plane flew from Birmingham airport to Lanzarote .

Running-back Eric Kettani does both - but New England Patriots fans will be disappointed to hear he has been ordered back to duty with the Navy. Kettani arrived at the USS Klakring, a frigate in Jacksonville, Florida, on Friday after being released from the Patriots practice squad. Popular: Navy footballer Eric Kettani, centre, jokes around with his teammates as they have their picture taken on the Capitol steps in December 2008 . ‘I love my country and I’m happy to serve it, but I’m also happy to be a New England Patriot,’ the 24-year-old told ESPN. The Patriots had signed Kettani, who played full-back at Navy, in May 2009 and placed him on the reserve and military list two months later. Kettani, who was appealing the Navy’s decision, was later activated from that list, released after training camp and signed to the practice squad. By releasing him instead of returning him to the reserve list they can bring him back if ‘other things get worked out’, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. Two jobs: New England Patriots running-back Eric Kettani has been ordered back to duty with the Navy on board the USS Klakring, a frigate in Florida . ‘Once he’s on reserve, then he’s out for the year,’ he added. 'Playing for the Patriots was a dream, and he was living it. He did sign up for the Navy and I’m sure serving is an honour. But in this one instance, it would have been nice to allow him to keep playing.' Ian Rapoport, Boston Herald . The Patriots filled the practice squad vacancy with defensive back Josh Victorian, who had been released on Wednesday.

The English-speaking teenager, who refuses to have his picture taken to help find his family, appeared at Berlin City Hall early last month.

He claimed that when his father died suddenly in August he buried him among trees, and then walked for two weeks to Berlin using a compass and map. But police and social workers began suspecting two weeks ago that his story was bogus and  his motives were suspect. They cannot understand why the only personal details he has revealed are his birthday and first name. He has told investigators he has no memory of his past.

A couple who hid the horrific injuries they inflicted on their baby daughter by switching her with her identical twin were jailed yesterday. Mohammed and Nafisa Karolia fooled health visitors by making a series of excuses for only one child being at home at any one time. The baby – known as Twin M – suffered broken ribs, legs, arms, brain damage, and damage to her head, ears and nose during her seven months of life. Abuse: Mohammed (left) and Nafisa Karolia hid their child's injuries from health visitors by swapping her with her twin sister . The injuries were inflicted on at least three separate occasions and some were six weeks old or more. No attempt was made to seek medical . attention and Twin M later died of an unrelated illness. The couple, who . were convicted of child cruelty in July, were given five-year prison . terms. Passing sentence yesterday, Mr Justice Irwin said: ‘What emerges from the evidence is repeated cruelty to one child. ‘The surviving twin has never suffered any injury or neglect and appeared to be very well cared for.’ Preston Crown Court heard that when . health visitors called, Nafisa, 22, – who was on a child studies course – . and Mohammed, 29, a taxi driver, deliberately concealed the injured . twin. Often they would claim she was with her grandparents or other . relatives. Jailed: The pair were given a custodial sentence at Preston Crown Court (pictured) for child cruelty . A social worker was also duped when she called at the family home in Blackburn, being told that Twin A was Twin M. Joe Boyd, prosecuting, said the . injuries must have been caused by the parents because Twin M was away . from their care for only a few hours of her short life. In June last year, the child was taken . to hospital with breathing difficulties and pronounced dead an hour . later. At the hospital, the Karolias claimed the dead girl was actually . Twin A. Their story unravelled when a social worker noticed discrepancies in head, weight and height measurements. A post-mortem examination revealed more than 20 injuries to the baby girl and found that she died from bronchopneumonia. Detective Inspector Pete Broome of . Lancashire Police said: ‘This was a truly horrific and tragic crime . committed by two parents who have shown no remorse for their actions . and have failed to offer any sort of explanation for what they did.’","Parents concealed abuse by hiding injured child from health visitors .

Home Secretary Theresa May today named Warwickshire Police Chief Constable Keith Bristow as the head of the new National Crime Agency. Mrs May said Mr Bristow will 'develop an agency of powerful operational crime fighters who will ensure those who commit serious and organised crime are tracked down, pursued and brought to justice'. The new National Crime Agency is expected to start its work in December 2012. Promotion: Warwickshire Police Chief Constable Keith Bristow, pictured being decorated with the Queen's Police Medal in 2008, is the head of the new National Crime Agency . The FBI-style police force will tackle the rising threat of organised crime gangs and beef up border security. The NCA will replace the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), which  Labour launched in a blaze of publicity in 2006. Soca has been criticised for failing to recover the proceeds of organised crime. Mrs May today said: 'I am delighted to announce Keith Bristow as the new head of the National Crime Agency. 'For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border. 'In his new role, Keith Bristow will . develop an agency of powerful operational crime fighters who will ensure . those who commit serious and organised crime are tracked down, pursued . and brought to justice. 'Keith Bristow will be the NCA's first operational head and will play a vital role in developing the new agency.' Keith Bristow was appointed Chief Constable of Warwickshire Police in 2006. He joined West Mercia Constabulary as a police cadet and then served through to the rank of Detective Chief Inspector in a range of uniform and specialist posts. In 1997, he was appointed as Staff Officer to the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). The following year he was selected for promotion to Superintendent and seconded to the West Midlands Police Major Investigation Team. Mr Bristow said: 'The NCA will protect communities and individuals from harm by tackling serious, organised and complex crime. 'In partnership with other law enforcement agencies, we will ensure that criminals are identified, pursued and brought to justice, their groups dismantled and their activities disrupted. We will do even more to strip away their illegally obtained assets. 'Officers and staff from existing agencies that will become part of the NCA are already working hard to tackle serious, organised and complex crime and new approaches and capabilities will become operational before 2013 to cut crime and protect our borders. 'I shall be working closely with Chief Constables, leaders of other law-enforcement organisations, Police Authorities, Police and Crime Commissioners and the Government to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available.' In 2009, damning figures revealed . that Soca clawed back only £78million over its first three years, despite . the agency costing the public £1.2billion. Soca employed a chairman, a director-general, ten directors and 30 deputy directors.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:20 PM on 10th October 2011 . The News of the World's 'Fake Sheikh' told a court today how he uncovered a cricket match-fixing ring by posing as a wealthy businessman. Mazhar Mahmood used a hidden camera to film a sports agent accepting £150,000 in return for Pakistani players bowling no balls in the Lord's Test against England, the court heard. The agent, Mazhar Majeed, also allegedly said he could secure the involvement of Australian players in match-fixing. Accused: Salman Butt, left, and Mohammad Asif are currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court . Mr Mahmood, 48, investigations editor of the now-defunct Sunday tabloid, was allowed to give evidence from behind screens to jurors at Southwark Crown Court today in order to protect his identity. It is alleged Majeed conspired with Pakistan's former Test captain, Salman Butt, 27, and fast bowlers Mohammad Asif, 28, and Mohammad Amir, 19, to bowl three deliberate no balls in the match. Prosecutors claim Majeed also boasted of having three other corrupt players in his pocket willing to take part in match fixing and claimed to be able to throw matches for $1m. The three players and agent have been accused of being key players in 'rampant corruption' at the heart of the international game. Butt and Asif deny conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. Amir and Majeed are not before the jury. Agent: Mazhar Majeed, left, is accused of entering into a match-fixing ring with players Butt, Asif and Mohammad Amir, right . Today the jury heard excerpts from a series of covert recordings made by Mr Mahmood during several meetings with Majeed. At their initial meeting in August 2010, at which the reporter posed as a rich Indian businessman, they discussed organising a 'big money' tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Majeed was heard saying that if the reporter could secure sponsorship and a guarantee a prize fund of £1m he could provide players from Pakistan and India willing to take part. 'You will find there are only a few players who are genuine and do it for the love of the game, and there's not many - they do it for the money,' he said. 'How much they get paid is a joke. They will be up for it. They will be up for making money. As long as there is prize money, good prize money.' No Ball: Pakistan's Mohammed Asif bowled this illegitimate delivery during the Fourth Test at Lord's . He also claimed that the cricketers had arranged the fixing in the first place, saying: 'The players will never tell anybody else. They're the ones that approached me about this. This is the beauty of it. 'I was friends with them for four or five years. And then they said this happens and I said ""Really?"" and I was so innocent of it.' Majeed went on to allege that Australian players would fix 'brackets', a set period of a match on which punters bet on, for example, how many runs will be scored. 'The Australians, they are the biggest. They have 10 brackets a game,' he said in the tape played to the court. Lord's: The 'home of cricket' was the scene of the alleged fixing plot last August . Majeed was heard boasting throughout the meeting of his celebrity contacts including the actor Brad Pitt, former tennis World Number 1 Roger Federer and cricketing 'friends' Mike Gatting, Phil Tufnell and Geoffrey Boycott. The jury heard that it was at this meeting the two men first discussed fixing. Mr Mahmood was heard saying to Majeed he would need at least three players 'in on the betting side of things'. Majeed replied: 'Boss, I've got six.' Prosecutors allege that Butt, Asif and Amir were three of the players allegedly willing to fix games.

Izabelle Easen, seven, died at her home in Thorne, South Yorkshire, in April 2009, from an asthma attack brought on by a cardiac arrest . Lorna Easen said she had felt partially responsible for not knowing how to perform emergency first aid on her dying daughter . The paramedic was struck off in 2010 after the Health Professions Council (HPC) heard about Izabelle's case and other, separate incidents - including one in which he 'behaved without compassion, feeling or tact towards the patient and his family'. Mrs Easen told Sky News: 'It's morally wrong, if nothing else. Absolutely terrible. 'They should have informed me. They should have informed the police as far as I'm concerned. It's my child, not theirs. To them she's just a piece of paperwork.' Papers from the HPC about Mr McKenna's case do not mention Izabelle's name.

Hush-up: Paramedic James McKenna who drove a South Yorkshire Ambulance similar to the one pictured, was found to have 'behaved without compassion' Experts have said, though, that the chances were that Izabelle was unlikely to have survived even if these actions had been taken. Denials: Wakefield Trust said there had been no policy of keeping any information from the Easen family . Mr McKenna was only brought before the HPC after an audit of the documentation. A spokeswoman for Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which is part of Wakefield District NHS Primary Care Trust, said: 'It has not been, and is not, our intention to keep information from the family concerned and we would like to reassure them and members of the public that we are committed to being open with patients and their relatives.

"By . Hugo Gye . Last updated at 7:18 PM on 29th September 2011 . Football star Paul Scholes has revealed that his young son suffers from autism. The disorder, which hinders communication skills and social interaction, is thought to affect around 0.2 per cent of the population. And now former England and Manchester United ace Scholes has announced that his six-year-old son Aiden suffers with the condition and has learning difficulties. Revelation: Paul Scholes has announced that his six-year-old son Aiden, pictured, suffers from autism . The former Old Trafford playmaker makes the surprise revelation in his autobiography, Scholes: My Story, which is published today. Despite his sporting success, Scholes has always been protective of his private life and shunned the celebrity lifestyle favoured by his team mates. Writing in the Sun, the football legend revealed Aiden's struggle with the life-altering disorder, saying his son is 'in his own little world'. 'We hope his condition improves but we're not banking on it, just doing everything we can to make sure he has a happy life,' Scholes wrote. Family: Scholes holding Aiden and accompanied by Arron, 12, Alicia, 10 and his wife Claire . 'He has a load of people trying to help him, speech and play therapists for example.' He added that Aiden has discovered a love of swimming, and said: 'He'd be swimming every minute of the day if he could and on holiday we even feed him in the pool.' Scholes's other children with wife Claire, 12-year-old Arron and Alicia, 10, cope 'brilliantly' with their brother's ongoing condition, according to their proud father. The footballer, who retired last year after 20 years at Old Trafford, has been described as 'undoubtedly the greatest midfielder of his generation' by French hotshot Zinedine Zidane. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder believed to be genetically transmitted. Symptoms of the disorder usually start appearing in children before the age of three. Happily married: The footballer wed his childhood sweetheart, Claire, in 1999 . It is far more common in boys than girls, with a male to female ratio of more than four to one. People who have autism find it difficult to communicate with others and generally have low empathy skills. They also often show obsessive and repetitive behaviour. Children with autism usually cannot adapt to independent living as they move into adulthood. Other famous figures whose children are autistic include Sylvester Stallone and John Travolta, whose son Jett died in 2009. The young son of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and his reality TV star wife Sally has also been diagnosed with the condition.","He says family cope 'brilliantly' with little Aiden .

A quick-thinking bank cashier helped catch a conman posing as a painter and decorator after he tried to swindle her elderly customer out of £1,600. Alison Wheeldon became suspicious when the 85-year-old woman went into the bank in Allenton, Derby, to try to withdraw the sum of money from her account. But after learning the money was to pay a man who had unexpectedly turned up at her door to carry out repair work, she asked if she could accompany the woman home. Alison Wheeldon became suspicious when the 85-year-old woman went into the bank to try to withdraw £1,600 from her account in Allenton, Derby . But 'handyman' George Brailsford, 26, who had 18 previous convictions for 59 crimes, fled when she arrived realising he had been caught out. This week, a judge praised the bank worker as he jailed Brailsford for 18 months. Ms Wheeldon, who works at the Lloyds TSB bank in Allenton, said: 'I could see things did not add up as soon as the customer came over to my desk. 'I've worked in the bank for 26 years, and I've seen similar things in the past. 'I spoke to my manager, who agreed I could accompany the lady home, and we contacted the police. 'I'm so pleased things turned out OK for the customer in the end. 'I was only doing my job - we look out for our customers, and that's why we ask the questions that we do.' Derby Crown Court heard that Brailsford had targeted the woman at her home in Shelton Lock, Derbyshire, offering to carry out painting and home improvements. Derby Crown Court heard that 'handyman' George Brailsford had targeted the woman at her home in Shelton Lock, Derbyshire, offering to carry out painting and home improvements . He originally told her the work would . cost £800, but after just a few hours' painting then demanded £1,600 and . told the pensioner to go and withdraw the money from her bank. But Ms Wheelson asked why she needed so much money and after becoming concerned, she went with the woman back to her house. Brailsford ran off but was later caught by the police covered in the same paint he had been using to paint her home. Recorder Andrew Maw told Brailsford: 'You are a thoroughly dishonest man. There is no doubt you have a tendency to prey on vulnerable, elderly people in the hope of getting easy, substantial amounts of money. 'It was only due to the perception and initiative of this bank employee, who should be publicly commended, that you did not succeed in taking this money.' Jeremy Janes, prosecuting at Derby Crown Court, described how Brailsford had cold-called the pensioner's home in June. Mr Janes said: 'Due to her frailty, she agreed. The initial quote was for £800, but relatively soon afterwards, more work was pointed out, and the quote went up to £1,600.' Mr Janes said: 'Alison Wheeldon's suspicions were aroused due to a similar scam she was aware of in the area.' Brailsford had been sentenced to 17 months in 2009 for similar crimes, charging pensioners thousands of pounds for 'urgent repairs'. At the time, Judge David Pugsley called him 'evil, warped and twisted'. Mitigating for Brailsford, Chris Hallas said: 'He understands, at the age of 26, and in light of his appalling criminal record, his mitigation is extremely limited. What motivates this man to offend is essentially alcohol.'","Lloyds cashier became suspicious when she tried to withdraw £1,600 .

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 7:30 PM on 22nd September 2011 . Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4 . Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month.' This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late next month. Mr Gore's statements - at a conference in South Africa - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent iPhone rumours. AllThingsDigital said Apple is . expected to hold its next big media event on October 4, when it is . expected to launch the iPhone 5. Apple plans to make the new device available for purchase within a few weeks of the launch, sources added. As usual, the company declined to  comment. While the iPhone 5 is much anticipated, there is more at stake than usual. This is because, since legendary . outgoing CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs announced his departure, it will be newly installed CEO Tim Cook’s first big product . introduction, and the place where the public will get a first lengthy . impression of him. People have wondered whether Apple can continue to compete without its creative driving force - especially as rivals such as Samsung continue to gain ground on the tech giant. Could Al Gore have revealed not one, but two big secrets about Apple - a company of which he is a board member? Ever since Apple launched its iPhone, it's been an open secret that Samsung makes many of the components inside it - in fact Samsung's CEO has admitted, 'Apple is our biggest customer.' But ever since Samsung launched its own Galaxy series of phones and tablets - high-powered touchscreens whose flagship, the Galaxy S II, currently outpaces iPhone on the processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine countries. This week, a Samsung source revealed Samsung was considering legal action to ban Apple's upcoming iPhone 5 in Europe - after an executive admitted a similar move in Samsung's native Korea was planned. Too similar? Samsung's Galaxy touschscreens and iPhone are the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries . A Samsung executive told the Korea . Times this week, 'When the iPhone 5 arrives here, Samsung plans to take Apple to . court here for its violation of Samsung's wireless technology related . patents.' This is in . response to Apple's continued legal action against Samsung's Galaxy . family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are . currently illegal in Europe, thanks to Apple lawsuits claiming they are 'slavish' copies of iPhone and iPad. Samsung recently overtook Nokia in . the smartphone market, and its Galaxy S II offers a larger screen and . faster processor than iPhone 4 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs. This month, Apple even forced Samsung to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a Berlin electronics show. Samsung's larger Galaxy 10.1 tablet remains illegal in Europe thanks to Apple's legal action. The Maeil Business Newspaper reported that the South Korean firm may seek an injunction against Apple's new iPhone in Europe. Samsung said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues. Legal battle rages between Apple and Samsung over alleged 'similarities between their touchscreen smartphones and handsets . The two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as Google and Microsoft. The latest attacks come after Apple successfully blocked Samsung from selling its latest tablets in Germany and some smartphone models in the Netherlands and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in Australia. After Apple's latest legal victory in Germany earlier this month, Samsung said it would take all available legal options. Apple first sued Samsung in April, claiming its strongest competitor had 'slavishly' copied its product designs, and Samsung had since counter-sued, arguing Apple infringed on its mobile technologies.","Official announcements expected on October 4 .

The hugely-anticipated launch of the iPhone 5 is only two days away - and speculation is mounting over what the must-have gadget will look like. Now designers have developed a mock-up, showing a slightly wider device to its predecessor and a four-inch screen covering the whole model. Experts at Giga Netzwerk have compiled leaked hints, hardware components and computer designs to show how they think it will appear. Scroll down for video . Prototype: Designers have developed a 3D mock-up, showing a slightly wider device to its predecessor and a four-inch screen covering the whole model . The iPhone is still the smartphone industry's benchmark after four years and is expected to come out in the U.S. this Tuesday, before the holidays. The Giga Netzwerk mock-up shows a ‘teardrop’ design, aluminium back instead of glass and an oval rather than a circular ‘home’ button. The mute switch is expected to move to the other side of the phone but the camera placement is likely to remain unchanged from the iPhone 4. A new operating system is expected to have excellent voice recognition software that will allow users to dictate emails or SMS messages. Aluminium back: Experts at Giga Netwerkz have compiled leaked hints, hardware components and computer designs to show how they think it will appear . The device could even be called the ‘iPhone 4S’ instead of the ‘iPhone 5’ when it is launched this week, reported the Huffington Post. The release will be Tim Cook’s first major product launch since taking over from an ill Steve Jobs as Apple’s CEO in August. The iPhone 5 is already widely expected to have a bigger touchscreen and faster processor than the current iPhone 4. Some users have predicted a bigger screen - as 'apps' such as Facebook's seem to be behaving oddly, and re-formatting themselves as if in anticipation of a larger screen. Leaks from Apple's own inventory seem to have confirmed that it will ship with the fast A5 processor found in iPad 2. Voice-control functions also seem highly likely. But competition is fierce, as more than 550,000 Google Android-based devices - including tablets-- are activated each day globally. Rivals such as HTC, Google and Samsung are also launching hi-tech flagship handsets within a week of Apple's - a time when mobile companies usually tend to keep their heads firmly below the parapet. Compared: The iPhone 5, prototype right, is already widely expected to have a bigger touchscreen and faster processor than previous iPhone models . An insider source said in August that the new model will have a bigger screen, better antenna and an impressive eight-megapixel camera. Apple's iPhone has been a huge success since it debuted in 2007, transforming the firm into one of the world's leading mobile device makers. It accounts for around 40 per cent of Apple's revenue, with margins estimated at 60 per cent. Meanwhile, the mysterious closure of a number Apple stores in the U.S. has prompted speculation they will re-open as the iPhone 5 launches.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:11 AM on 11th October 2011 . Detectives investigating the 32-year-old mystery of a young woman's death today charged a man with murder. Sally McGrath, 22, was found naked in a shallow grave in woodland near Peterborough in March 1980 after vanishing in July 1979. Despite what police describe as Cambridgeshire's biggest pre-Soham murder investigation the killer was never found. Cambridgeshire Police re-opened inquiries following a cold case review last year. Murdered: Sally McGrath's body was found in woodlands near Peterborough in March 1980. She had been missing for eight months . Paul Barry Taylor, 59, originally from Peterborough and now living in Fareham, Hampshire, was charged with the murder yesterday. He will appear at Peterborough Magistrates Court later today. The twice-married grandfather was originally arrested last December and was charged after answering bail at a police station in Cambridgeshire. Taylor also faces three counts of rape, one of serious sexual assault and one of indecent assault against three different women. One of the rape charges relates to an attack a month before Miss McGrath's disappearance on a woman in Castor Hanglands, the place where the body was found. Taylor, who worked as builder in the city where he lived with his wife and two children, later moved to Hampshire where he re-married and ran a fish and chip shop. Miss McGrath was last seen alive at about 3pm on July 11, 1979 at the Bull Hotel in Westgate, Peterborough, in the company of a man. Her body, naked except for a pair of boots, was found by a gamekeeper on March 1, 1980, partially buried in Wild Boar Spinney, at Castor Hanglands, to the west of Peterborough. Her body was badly decomposed and police at the time could not recover any forensic evidence. A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from a 'blunt force' injury to her head. Miss McGrath had been living with her parents and brother in Towler Street, Peterborough, when she vanished. Her parents are both in their 80s and described as frail. However, Miss McGrath's mother, Christina McGrath, welcomed the re-opening of the case. The couple were said to be relieved that progress had been made so long after their daughter's death.","Paul Barry Taylor accused of murdering Sally McGrath .

Looking tired and dejected, England's rugby team finally appeared to be taking things seriously as they arrived back in Britain today. After being dumped out of the Rugby World Cup by France at the weekend, England had looked in high spirits as they boarded a plane home from New Zealand. But their demeanour as they touched down at Heathrow Airport this afternoon was more suitable for a side that had delivered poor performances on the field and poor behaviour off it. Facing the music: Mike Tindall (left) and Manu . Tuilagi exit a side-door after landing at Heathrow Airport today . England coach Martin Johnson appeared more relaxed as he prepared for the final leg of his journey home . Mike Tindall and team-mate Manu . Tuilagi looked like players preparing to face the music as they exited . an airport side-door - in sharp contrast to their high jinx at Auckland . airport yesterday. There, Tuilagi kissed his team . captain’s head in what was believed to be a reference to Tindall's . encounter – captured on a nightclub’s CCTV – with old friend Jessica . Palmer. Tindall, of course, is newly married to Zara Phillips, the . Queen’s grand-daughter. Not that Tuilagi had any reason to be . playing the jester. Hours earlier he had been held by police after . jumping from the deck of a ferry - the final embarrassment of the trip. The 20-year-old, who came close to . being deported from Britain last year for overstaying his visa, was held . in Auckland after he jumped from a ferry as it was about to berth and . swam ashore, apparently egged on by other players.

"By . Oliver Pickup . Last updated at 8:29 AM on 11th October 2011 . Rebel fighters in Libya have reached the centre of Muammar Gaddafi's hometown, Sirte, but there is still no sign of the North African country's ousted leader. Anti-regime forces have managed to usurp a convention centre which had previously been used by men loyal to the 69-year-old in the northern coastal city located between the capital Tripoli and Benghazi. The inability to take Sirte - the most important remaining stronghold of Gaddafi supporters - more than six weeks after rebels seized the capital, has stalled efforts by Libya's new leaders to set a . time-line for elections and move forward with a transition to democracy. Libyan rebels fire a rocket as they enter in Sirte today . Colonel Gaddafi supporters also hold the inland enclave of Bani Walid, believed to be harbouring high-level figures in the old regime. Revolutionary forces also reported key gains in that northern city - located inland to the west of Sirte - after weeks of faltering advances that resulted in part from the challenging terrain of desert hills and steep valleys. The transitional leadership has said it will declare liberation after Sirte's capture because that will mean it holds all of the seaports and harbours in the oil-rich Mediterranean coastal country. Libya's de facto leader, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil, head of the governing National Transitional Council, said yesterday that anti-Gaddafi fighters have made huge gains in Sirte and Bani Walid, south-east of the capital. 'I do believe, God willing, that the liberation of these cities will happen within this week,' Abdul-Jalil said in Tripoli. He claimed that revolutionary forces in Sirte have punched their way into the city centre in fierce fighting and are now cleaning out pockets of resistance. A tank fires another missile into Sirte, as used shells litter the dusty floor. But there is no sign of Colonel Gaddafi . More rebel fighters aim at key pro-Gaddafi points in the northern coastal city, which they expect to be liberated within the week . Colonel Gaddafi has so far not been hunted down in his hometown of Sirte . In Bani Walid, advancing fighters drove Gaddafi forces out of the airport, said Abdullah Kenshil, who led failed talks for the revolutionaries in search of a peaceful surrender of the city. 'The takeover of Bani Walid is imminent,' he said. 'The fighters are only one kilometre from the heart of Bani Walid.' He claimed that Gaddafi's son Seif al-Islam was seen on Saturday distributing cash to his loyalists in Bani Walid. 'We are 100 per cent sure that he is inside, at least until last night,' Kenshil said. Located 250 miles (400 kilometres) south-east of Tripoli, Sirte is key to the physical unity of the nation of some six million people, since it lies roughly in the centre of the coastal plain where most Libyans live, blocking the easiest routes between east and west. After a three-week siege from the outskirts, revolutionary forces launched an all-out assault on Sirte on Friday, pounding the city with tank shells, field cannons, rockets and heavy machine guns. Loyalists have put up fierce resistance, and fired back with sniper rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. On Sunday, the Ouagadougou Convention centre, an ornate complex that Gaddafi frequently used for international summits, lay in ruins. Throughout the siege, Gaddafi fighters used the walled complex as a base and stronghold. From there they were able to dominate surrounding neighbourhoods and assault revolutionaries trying to enter Sirte. In a bloody street battle, a rebel fighter fires a the pockets of remaining pro-Gaddafi forces over the weekend . At the nearby Ibn Sina Hospital, scores of wounded civilians crowded the corridors, lying on gurneys and floors to protect them from the shelling and gunfire. There was no electricity or water, and a handful of medical students and nurses were the only medical staff. Revolutionary fighters roamed the hallways checking IDs and detained about 25 people suspected of being Gaddafi fighters or mercenaries. 'These are all Gaddafi people. They are snipers and we have captured them,' said Ahmed Rahman, a field commander, as his soldiers cuffed a suspected pro-Gaddafi sniper. The revolutionary forces also now control the University of Sirte on the southern outskirts. As they push forward, Gaddafi loyalists are fighting in an ever-shrinking defensive perimeter consisting only of a Gaddafi  palace complex, some residential buildings and a hotel near Green Square in the city centre.","Inroads made at Bani Walid, too - both cities expected to be liberated this week .

"By . Ian Drury and Tim Shipman . Last updated at 8:28 AM on 12th October 2011 . Liam Fox enjoyed sunshine breaks with his friend thanks to flights funded by the taxpayer, it emerged last night. The Defence Secretary tagged four short foreign trips with Adam Werritty, who was best man at his wedding, on to official Government trips. Two of the mini-breaks were in Dubai and two in Hong Kong. On one occasion, Dr Fox took two days’ annual leave to spend time with his former flatmate and self-styled ‘adviser’ in luxury in the Gulf before continuing his journey to meet British troops risking their lives in Afghanistan. As the one and two-day breaks were tagged on to Government trips, Dr Fox could legitimately have his travel paid for from the public purse. Suits and ties: Dr Fox and Mr Werritty in Tampa, Florida, on an Atlantic Bridge trip in 2008. Right, The Defence Secretary, his wife Jesme and Adam Werritty at a rugby club event this summer . The new disclosure raised more questions about Dr Fox’s judgment and his dealings with Mr Werritty. It came as Mr Werritty attempted to explain exactly how he managed to afford his air fares to meet Dr Fox on the same visits. He . told senior civil servants he was employed as an international . networker by wealthy business donors who had an interest in politics and . energy security and needed a middle-man to open doors to senior . politicians. Details of the mini-breaks emerged as: . ■ Mr Werritty was quizzed for two hours by a senior civil servant about how he paid for his extensive globetrotting; . ■ Sri Lankan officials claimed Mr Werritty offered to help them buy arms during a visit with Dr Fox; . ■ A businessman accused Dr Fox of telling MPs ‘half-truths’ about their meeting with Mr Werritty and said the adviser liked to travel first-class; . ■ David Cameron faced demands to bring in a sleaze watchdog to run the inquiry; . ■ Dr Fox pulled out of a press conference today in Paris with his French counterpart. Dr Fox is under investigation by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O’Donnell after it emerged that 33-year-old Mr Werritty held 40 meetings with the Defence Secretary in just 16 months. Mr Werritty was asked to explain how, despite having little obvious income, he has been able to afford to run up an estimated bill of £85,000 on flights and luxury hotels since the general election. He has now been asked to provide bank statements to back his claims he was being bankrolled by wealthy businessmen. On 18 occasions since the general election the two friends met abroad and four times Dr Fox, 50, took leave before, in the middle or at the end of official trips to meet Mr Werritty. Luxury: Fox enjoyed sunshine breaks in Dubai, left, and Hong Kong, right, while he was on Government trips . Dr Fox, who has in the past stayed in . five-star hotels – including the  63-storey, £600-a-night Address hotel . in Dubai and the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong – paid for his own . accommodation during the breaks. He did not pay for Mr Werritty and the MoD has refused to say who picked up his tab. The details of the trips were disclosed in a list published by the Ministry of Defence on Monday. Sources close to the Secretary of . State insisted there was no additional burden on the taxpayer because he . would have travelled on the routes while undertaking trips for the . Ministry of Defence. Watchdog: Lib Dems want to call in Sir Philip Mawer, the independent guardian of the ministerial code of conduct . But if he had not had the benefit of . the official flights, he would have had to pay for the flights from . Britain from his own pocket – at a cost of around £10,000 in British . Airways business class. Labour MP Dan Jarvis, who served as a . major in the Parachute Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: ‘I find . this appalling. The message that it sends out to our Armed Forces, who . are doing a fantastic job in the most difficult conditions, is that the . first priority of the Defence Secretary is a bit of sunshine by the side . of the pool rather than the well-being of troops facing danger every . day.’ Last night Mr Werritty faced serious new . allegations. Sources in Sri Lanka told Channel 4 News that he had . offered to help the regime there acquire arms supplies for internal . security during a visit with Dr Fox – claims denied by the Defence . Secretary. Mr Werritty also stands accused of . offering to improve the regime’s international reputation following . accusations that the government there was guilty of genocide during its . war with the Tamil Tiger rebels. Pressure intensified on the Defence . Secretary yesterday as David Cameron faced growing calls to draft in Sir . Philip Mawer, the independent guardian of the ministerial code of . conduct, to rule on whether Dr Fox has broken the code. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made . clear he thinks Dr Fox has broken the rules, saying ministers should . observe the ‘spirit and the letter of the ministerial code’ and that Dr . Fox admits ‘a blurring of the professional, political and the personal’ in a way ‘that raises serious issues’. In private, senior Lib Dems are demanding that Sir Philip is drafted in. And Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said an ‘independent person’ should conduct the investigation so it would ‘have much more public confidence’. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said: ‘Doesn’t this show that they’re prepared to sacrifice high standards in public office to protect the Secretary of State?’ Dr Fox also came under fire again from a businessman with whom he and Mr Werritty held talks in Dubai in June. Harvey Boulter, who was hoping to sell technology to the Libyan rebels, said it was a ‘half-truth’ for Dr Fox to suggest that their meeting was the result of a chance encounter with Mr Werritty in a restaurant. He had a meeting with Mr Werritty in April, following which the ‘clear intention’ was that the ‘adviser’ would arrange for him to see Fox. He said he had assumed that Mr Werritty was a Government adviser to Dr Fox. ‘To me he was the route to Liam Fox, without a doubt,’ Mr Boulter said. ‘He did disclose to me that he liked to travel first-class.’ He added: ‘This appeared to be a friendship between Fox and Werritty and I think Werritty perhaps overstepped the friendship into an official role. I don’t understand the motivation of Dr Fox allowing him to do that.’ Dr Fox’s aides said Mr Boulter had changed his story and pointed out that Mr Boulter confirmed ‘the topic of money never came up’. His spokesman denied that Mr Werritty had offered to help the Sri Lankans acquire arms, saying: ‘Dr Fox’s visits to Sri Lanka in opposition have been to promote post conflict reconciliation and development. Any suggestion otherwise is without foundation and is insulting.’ Adam Werritty’s business dealings were under scrutiny last night as questions were raised about how he financed his high-rolling lifestyle. On the one hand the self-styled adviser to Defence Secretary Liam Fox was able to take at least 18 trips around the globe to meet his friend, trips which are estimated to have cost up to £85,000. But on the other it has emerged that Mr Werritty was so cash-strapped he had asked for a rent reduction on his flat in London. Mr Werritty stunned business associates who believed he worked for the Ministry of Defence by boasting about his generous perks, including plush hotels and first-class travel, at a time when the cash-strapped Whitehall department was implementing significant budget cuts. Yet an investigation into the 33-year-old’s finances indicates that, at best, he earned around £55,000 a year from his businesses and consultancy firms. The freelance defence consultant had extraordinary access to the MoD – visiting 22 times – and crossed paths with the Defence Secretary on 18 overseas trips. He has flown to destinations including Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Israel, the U.S., Singapore, Switzerland and Sri Lanka, and stayed in hotels. The MoD insisted it had not paid. A calculation using British Airways prices yesterday suggested that flying economy class would cost Mr Werritty around £25,000, with business class seats pushing the bill closer to £78,000. Accommodation would cost an estimated £7,000 based on £200-a-night rooms – a total of £85,000. Downing Street sources warned that Sir Gus O’Donnell, the country’s top civil servant, would be faced with figures that did not add up when he investigated the Scotsman’s background. Mr Werritty pays an estimated rent of more than £2,500 a month for his flat in Pimlico, a short walk from the Houses of Parliament. Last night a source told the Mail: ‘Mr Werritty has tried to get the agents to reduce the rent on the property but has been told that it is not possible.’ Mr Werritty has run a string of companies. He started UK Health Ltd when Dr Fox was shadow health secretary but this was dissolved and he founded Security Futures in 2006 after his friend moved to the defence brief. This company ceased trading last year but its last accounts revealed a pre-tax profit of just £4,000. Mr Werritty also started Danscottia Consulting Ltd in 2007 but the latest accounts show an £8,000 loss last year. His other company is Todiha Ltd was formed in February. Another venture is the Atlantic Bridge Education and Research Scheme, a think-tank founded by Dr Fox in 1997. Mr Werritty was the sole employee of the charity, which was wound up last month after the Charity Commission ruled it was not meeting its ‘charitable purposes’. The charity’s accounts show it paid £37,000 for an annual salary to an unnamed individual. It also paid consultancy fees of £87,738 over three years to Mr Werritty.","Dr Fox and Adam Werritty took luxury stays in Hong Kong and Dubai while  on Government trips .

A father claims he was quizzed by police under anti-terror legislation after he was spotted taking a photo of his daughter in a shopping centre. Chris White took a picture of his four-year-old daughter, Hazel, while she was eating an ice cream at Braehead shopping centre near Glasgow last Friday. However, Mr White said a security guard ordered him to stop, claiming it was 'illegal' to use a camera in the centre, and asked him to delete any images he had taken on his mobile phone. Snapped: Chris White took this picture of his four-year-old daughter, Hazel, while she was eating an ice cream at Braehead shopping centre near Glasgow . Police told Mr White, pictured, there were 'clear signs' in the centre ordering shoppers not to take pictures inside the mall . Mr White had paused to take a snap of his daughter posing on the back of a scooter seat at an ice cream bar on their way around the shops. A Facebook campaign was launched over the weekend calling on the public to boycott the mall. It has attracted more than 19,000 'likes' on the social networking site and hundreds of comments. Mr White said he was approached by the security guard who asked him to delete the pictures at about 4pm. Explaining the incident on his Boycott Braehead Facebook page, Mr White said: 'I explained I had taken 2 photos of my daughter eating ice cream and that she was the only person in the photo so didn't see any problem. 'i also said that I wasn't that willing to delete the photo's and there seemed little point as I had actually uploaded them to facebook. 'He then said i would have to stay right where I was while he called the police, which seemed a little extreme.' When police arrived he told Mr White there were 'clear signs' in the centre ordering shoppers not to take pictures inside the mall. Glasgow's Braehead shopping centre. The mall's management has apologised to Mr White and said it was changing its policy 'with immediate effect' so families and friends can use their cameras in the centre . Mr White said: 'The police officer than started to say that there were privacy issues . around photographs, to which I said yes and in a busy shopping centre I . waited until only my daughter was in the shot. 'I explained that I was . happy to show him the photos although not sure under what authority he . could ask me to delete the photos.' Mr White said police told him they 'were within their rights under the Prevention of Terrorism Act' to confiscate his mobile phone without any explanation. However officers let Mr White keep his photos but took all his details and he was then allowed to leave. The shopping centre yesterday apologised to Mr White and said it was changing its policy 'with immediate effect' so families and friends can use their cameras in the centre. A Braehead spokesman said in a statement: 'We have listened to the very public debate surrounding our photography policy and as a result, with immediate effect, are changing the policy to allow family and friends to take photos in the mall. 'We will publicise this more clearly in the mall and on our website. We will reserve the right to challenge suspicious behaviour for the safety and enjoyment of our shoppers. 'We wish to apologise to Mr White for the distress we may have caused to him and his family and we will be in direct contact with him to apologise properly.' Mr White said he had been overwhelmed by the public response on the issue and thanked people for their support. He added: 'Hopefully we can now move forward with a common sense approach into a situation that allows families to enjoy precious moments with their children, but at the same time ensure that such public places are areas where we can feel safe and protected.' Supt George Nedley, of Renfrewshire and . Inverclyde division, told BBC Scotland: 'As a result, a full review of . the circumstances surrounding the incident and the allegations made is . under way.'","Incident sparks Facebook campaign calling for boycott .

"'To have an actor pretending to be my father is an insult to the memories of his victims,' says mother of two Anne-Marie Davis . Gloucester Police have 'let former colleagues down' by being involved . By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 3:45 PM on 2nd September 2011 . The daughter of serial killer Fred West branded actor Dominic West a 'hypocrite' after he claimed he felt 'sullied' and suffered nightmares while playing the murderer in a new TV drama. Anne-Marie Davis, 47, criticised the cast, . programme makers and police for their controversial roles in Appropriate Adult, a new ITV production about the murders of women and girls at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. She said: 'When an actor like . Dominic West talks about being ''sullied'' by the role and talks of . nightmares, you have to question their hypocrisy. 'Hypocrisy': Anne-Marie Davis (left) who was raped and tortured by her father Fred West, has criticised actor Dominic West for saying he had nightmares playing her father in a new drama (right) 'What of the victims . who survived and all the victims' families who have lived with this for . more than two decades? He has had but a glimpse of their world.' The mother-of-two slammed ITV for using the 'Fred and Rose brand' in a 'global money-making exercise'. Mass murderer Fred West, 53, hanged himself in Winson Green Prison on New Year's Day 1995 as he awaited trial for 12 murders. His wife Rose West, 57, is serving a . full-life term in Low Newton Prison after she was found guilty of her . part in ten murders including that of her 16-year-old daughter Heather at . Winchester Crown Court in 1995. The ITV drama is seen through the eyes . of the 'appropriate adult' Janet Leach, who acted as an independent . safeguard by sitting in on Fred West's police interviews. Ms Davis was raped and tortured by the Wests when she was eight and her mother Rena Costello  and sisters Charmaine . and Heather were murdered. Anne-Marie condemned current . Gloucestershire police chiefs for assisting ITV production staff, a decision which has concerned retired officers . who worked on the West case and pledged to look after the . victims' families. She said:'I believe that decision is . pretty lame and the current regime should be ashamed of the position . they have put the victims' families in, and ashamed that they have let . down former colleagues whose morality was, and remains, so resolute. 'ITV . have used the police input to advertise the validity of their research. It is questionable whether police resources should be spent helping a . private enterprise that exploits the victims of crime for profit.' Twisted: Fred and Rose West at the wedding of their daughter Anne-Marie (pictured left of her father) Dominic West, who starred in The Wire and BBC drama The Hour, has previously said how he suffered 'pretty horrible dreams during the shoot where I'm perched on a wall and Fred West was trying to grab me and pull me down. 'I was fairly determined not to let him get to me. I only did it for three weeks and it was a pretty intense, very dark three weeks. It was pretty grim.' Ms Davis has been critical of the new, two-part drama throughout its making. She said: 'I'm still unsure whether ITV and the actors comprehend the depth of our grief, but how could they? I just ask that they spare a thought for the victims and their families when they pick up their pay cheques. 'We live in an age of multiple TV channels, many of which regularly screen repeats. That means for the rest of our lives this programme will be re-run over and over. 'Whilst Dominic West moves on to his next role, another life sentence will start for all of the families.' Ms Davis, who gave evidence against Rose West at her trial, has refused to watch the first 90-minute episode of Appropriate Adult when it is screened at the weekend. Monster: Serial killer Fred West with e daughters Anne-Marie (standing) and Tara West . She said: 'I find the whole idea of this production sickening, but I have tried to be balanced in my criticisms. 'I have enough emotional and mental baggage and I don't need an actor to haunt or further remind me of the crimes my father perpetrated. 'Many people think that it's my perception there will be re-enactments of murder and gratuitous violence and that is why I am so disturbed. It is not. 'My frustration stems from the resurrection of my father on screen, the re-enactments of dialogue between interviewing police officers and my father describing the circumstances surrounding my mother's and sisters' disappearances, their murders and his subsequent disposal of their bodies. 'No doubt, the same treatment will be given to the other victims and the effect this will have on their families must be considered.' She added: 'I hadn't spoken publicly for ten years until this drama was mooted. I have never put myself forward as a spokesperson for the victims' families, and I never will. Evil: Rosemary and Fred West tortured, raped and murdered at least 12 young women at the Gloucester home . 'Maybe, as a member of the West family, I shouldn't have a view. All I can say is that I speak for my sanity. 'It is indicative of our society that we haven't moved on from the voyeurism that surrounds the ''Fred and Rose'' branding and I suggest that ITV wouldn't have invested so heavily in ''The Janet Leach Story'' without it. 'I congratulate them for finding their angle, riding high on the back of Mrs Leach. They have walked a tightrope, balancing the validity and compassion for Mrs Leach with the memory of the victims and their families' grief - and they have opted to fall on the side of Mrs Leach. ""I would ask people to put aside that voyeurism for just a few minutes and consider the victims of all such crime, their families and the life sentences they have to serve - without choice.' Ms Davis, who was sexually abused by Fred and Rose West and other men they brought to 25 Cromwell Street, managed to flee the family home when she was 15 in just the clothes she was wearing. She said: 'My mother Rena and my sisters Charmaine and Heather, are my heroes. I was an eight-year-old coward and I was still a coward when I ran away. 'But my mother and siblings stood up to them and paid the ultimate price. To have an actor pretending to be my father and describing how he murdered and disposed of their bodies I find an insult to their memories because they were real people, not just a name on a page, who deserve a little more respect.' The mother of two described the lasting effect that the horrific experiences had on her own life. 'There was no doubting the overwhelming sense of emptiness and loss. Justice had been served and now it was time to try and pack away the memories of past and present, except it was not that easy. 'There was little support available locally and the NHS just didn't know what to do with me and I am ashamed to admit that I attempted to take my own life on a number of occasions and I am lucky to be alive. 'It would take years before I got the kind of counselling and professional support that I desperately needed.'","'To have an actor pretending to be my father is an insult to the memories of his victims,' says mother of two Anne-Marie Davis .

The richest woman in Britain and her billionaire husband have just splashed out on the biggest motor yacht ever built in the UK. Former Miss UK Kirsty Bertarelli and her Swiss husband, Ernesto, had the massive 96-metre six-deck Vava II built to replace their existing 47-metre vessel at a cost of an incredible £100m. The superyacht, the 33rd largest in the world, was built in Plymouth and boasts luxury interiors, a helicopter landing pad, lavish guest cabins and four boats to ferry passengers to shore. Vava II: The incredible £100m superyacht has been built for Britain's richest woman Kirsty Bertarelli and her billionaire husband Ernesto at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth . Incredible sight: The £100m Vava II sits at Plymouth awaiting extensive sea trials . Swiss pharmaceuticals chief, Bertarelli, 45, is a twice winner of the prestigious America's Cup yacht race and is worth a reputed £6.8billion, making him the 81st richest man in the world and the fifth richest in the UK. His wife is currently ranked the UK's richest woman. Vava II took more than 200 craftsmen over two years to build at the Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth after the hull was built in Appledore in Devon. Britain's richest woman: Kirsty Bertarelli has had Britain's largest yacht built in Plymouth . Stunning: Kirsty Bertarelli when she won Miss UK in 1988 when she was 17, she now lives in Switzerland . The incredible high tech specification for Britain's largest ever built yacht also includes a fold-down beach club and a pool which can be varied in depth to cater for guest preferences. Known during the build process as Project-55 the exterior finishes on the superyacht have been designed by Hampshire-based specialists Redman Whiteley Dixon while the interiors have been styled by Remi Tessier. All the engineering on the state of the art ship was carried out by workers at the Devonport Royal Dockyard. The luxury yacht builders, Devonport Yachts, was bought from dockyard owners Babcock last year by Falmouth-based Pendennis shipyard. Yachtmaster: Ernesto Bertarelli, centre, on his America's Cup winning yacht Alinghi. He and his wife have just bought a £100m superyacht after a two year build. Successful: Kirsty Bertarelli embraces her husband after he and his crew won the coveted America's Cup . Sea trials will start next week to . test the design of the multi-million pound boat which can be seen in . dock and is visible in Plymouth Sound. Detailed specifications for the incredible boat have remained a closely guarded secret throughout the two-year build. Managing Director Stephen Hills said the vessel was 'anabsolute credit to the capacity of the South West as a superyacht building location'. He added: 'We are looking to continue this industry in the South West.' And the man who will helm Britain's largest home-built yacht Brendan O'Shannassy, said of the yacht: 'To have such a ground breaking construction unveiled in Plymouth should make the region justly proud.' It is possible that the huge superyacht will be chartered for part of the year to wealthy clients while it is not being used by it's super rich owners. Hiring a yacht of the calibre of Vava II can cost ten of thousands of pounds a week and if chartered the Bertarelli's yacht will set a new standard in the rental market next year.

"By . Steve Doughty . Last updated at 11:21 AM on 11th October 2011 . The extent of the UK’s reliance on the South to prop up the economy was laid bare by official figures yesterday. They showed that only two areas in the north of England and one in the Midlands could match the wealth creation per worker of London and the South. And only four of Scotland’s towns and cities and one in Wales could do so. The Midlands area is the Birmingham suburb of Solihull, while the two in the north are Cheshire and Derby. Wealth creation was measured using a . complicated formula taking into account the amount of the nation’s GDP . created per region, the number of workers there and the number of hours . they work. It excluded the effects of unemployment, so only measured the value of those in work. The analysis by the Office for National . Statistics concluded: ‘The highest productivity levels are found in . inner London, with productivity in Inner London West 56 per cent above . UK average and Inner London East 33 per cent above UK average.’ South props up economy: Only two areas in the north of England and one in the Midlands could match the wealth creation per worker of London and the South. (Data from the Office for National Statistics) The analysis found that the highest productivity levels are found in inner London . Economist Ruth Lea, of the Arbuthnot . Banking Group, said: ‘There is no doubt that workers in the south are . supporting those in the rest of the country.’ And Rob Harbron, of City think-tank . the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ‘Other regions . have a high dependence on public sector spending.’ People . working in Berkshire, Surrey and Swindon also brought in productivity . returns that put their value at more than 15 per cent above average. The . new official demonstration of the concentration of wealth creation in . London and the South was published in the wake of the latest European . attempt to cream off profits from the City and financial industries. Lower levels of productivity: Wealth creation was measured using a complicated formula taking into account the amount of the nation's GDP created per region, the number of workers there and the number of hours they work . Worst-performing: Bottom of the pile for worker productivity per hour was Blackpool . The transactions tax proposed by European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso would fall heavily on England, with finance industries in the south of England paying up to 70 per cent of the tax proceeds across Europe. Profits generated in southern England already heavily subsidise life in the rest of the country: most other regions are dependent on taxes paid in the south, and three have economies in which 60 per cent of all spending is provided by the state. The ONS analysis examined gross value added per hour worked – the amount of wealth generated by a worker every hour in 2008, the first full year of the recession. The method eliminates the effects of unemployment and worklessness and measures only the value produced by those who are actually in jobs. The worst-performing areas were largely rural or tourist regions and depressed cities. Bottom of the pile for worker productivity per hour was Blackpool, 67 per cent of average, followed by Cornwall, East Cumbria, Torbay, Northumberland, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire, Blackburn, Shropshire and Stoke-on-Trent. The lowest-place major city was the northern side of Manchester: Greater Manchester North returned 83 per cent of average productivity. In Scotland just four areas: Edinburgh, Falkirk, East Lothian and Midlothian, and Aberdeen, were above average. Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan were the only part of Wales to top the average.","Highest productivity levels are found in inner London .

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 1:56 AM on 29th September 2011 . The first TV commercial for a sex toy company has been approved for broadcast during daytime viewing hours. Executives at the firm involved, Lovehoney, have hailed the development as a breakthrough in terms of the nation’s attitude to sex and pleasure. However, the decision has triggered anger among family campaigners who argue it turns sex into a commodity. The commercial, which carries the strapline ‘Live a Sexier Life’ advertises the company rather than any specific products. Racy? A still from the Lovehoney advert to be shown on television and used as a print ad in women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan . Nonetheless, parents may find it difficult to explain away the TV commercial and the internet shopping site that is being promoted. It . features a couple in a steamy embrace, kissing passionately for around . 20 seconds. They then break away as they laugh and giggle and say to . each other ‘have a good day’. A recent study claimed that British and international sales of sex toys are set to match smartphones like the iPhone. The . study, Women, Sex and Shopping, argued that sales of so-called . 'pleasure goods' have escaped their sleazy history and are about to move . into the mainstream. The . research was compiled by respected analysts Hewson Group and identified a . strong desire among women to buy products designed to enhance their sex . lives. It stated: 'Over 60 per cent of women find the idea of buying a sex toy to be ‘exciting’. 'Women are motivated by far more basic instincts than are commonly ascribed to them. The erotic, the naughty, the forbidden and even perhaps the slightly sordid all have their appeal.' Lovehoney, . who dub themselves 'sexual happiness people,' say they're keen for . consumers to cast aside their prudishness and enjoy their sex lives . Some four million sex toys are said . to be sold in the UK every year, while it estimates the number of women . using them at 6.5 to 9.6million. The . decision by regulators to approve the Lovehoney commercial follows . earlier controversy over the liberalisation of advertising rules. Last year, industry codes were changed to allow condoms to be advertised before the 9pm watershed. An . advertisement by the Marie Stopes organisation, which carries out . thousands of abortions each year, drew more complaints than any other . last year – 4,600, including those via petition. Lovehoney . describes itself as ‘the sexual happiness people’. A spokesman said: . ‘We sell more sex toys online than any other UK company. ‘We are now a £13.4 million business, fulfilling in excess of 10,000 orders every week.’ 'One in two marriages is failing and a way of dealing with that is to use sex toys. We should be encouraging it,' says expert Tracey Cox . An initial booking to show the commercial on ITV2 at 10.15am on October 3 during the programme The Real Wives of New York City fell through. However, Lovehoney claims it will be shown during daytime on MTV, E4 and Living. Director of the Family Education Trust, Norman Wells, condemned the decision, saying: ‘Sex is an intimate expression of lifelong commitment between a man and a woman, not a commodity to be advertised and sold like washing powder or a mobile phone. ‘Sexual intimacy belongs in private and is cheapened when it is paraded on television and used as a tool to entice viewers to visit and make purchases from an online shop. ‘Many viewers will find this advert very distasteful, not because they are prudes who disapprove of sex, but because it divorces sex from its proper context and further adds to the sexualisation of society with all its damaging consequences.’ The web retailer has a relationship with sex therapist Tracey Cox, who sells a range of products through the site. She said the commercial was tame in comparison to the music videos which appear regularly on daytime TV. ‘If you look at the ad and compare it to any music video clip – like Rihanna for example – this is pre-school. What they get away with in music videos is crazy,’ she said. One in two marriages is failing and a way of dealing with that is to use sex toys. We should be encouraging it.’ WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ADVERT? WATCH IN FULL HERE...","Family campaign groups say bedroom toys commodify sex...

"Woman, 31, unable to appear in court because of 'extreme' mental problems . Sally Hodkin was killed in a random attack and a second woman was injured . By . Rebecca Camber and Arthur Martin . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 11th October 2011 . This is the face of a woman accused of hacking a grandmother to death with a butcher's . cleaver in an apparent stranger killing. Nicola Edgington, 31, was due to appear in court charged with the murder of Sally Hodkin, 59, in a busy shopping street  in . Bexleyheath yesterday. But Greenwich Magistrates' Court was told Edgington, from Greenwich, south-east London, was unfit to be taken into the courtroom to face charges today due to her 'extreme' mental health problems. Accused: Nicola Edgington, left, is accused of killing Sally Hodkin, right, in an apparently random attack in Bexleyheath, Kent . Hidden: Edgington is led from the rear of Greenwich Magistrates' Court after her appearance earlier today . The defendant who has a 'history of mental health problems' was held in the cells but excused from attending the packed courtroom after applications by her counsel, the court's head of security and a psychiatrist. Dr Amit Chatterjee, duty psychiatrist at the court, said: 'I have had the opportunity to meet her this morning. 'She does have extreme mental health problems. I don't think she is fit to attend court in her mental state.' A security guard summoned described Edgington's condition said the woman was 'agitated'. He said: 'At the moment she is in a cell with three officers but I am a bit reluctant to bring her up with everyone around. 'She seems to be very agitated with people in the cells, she's getting very agitated and uppity.' Chair of the bench Stephen Langford agreed for the hearing to be held in her absence. Edgington, who was represented by her solicitor, Callum Haddow, was told her case will be heard next at the Old Bailey on Thursday when a bail application is due to take place. Mr . Langford said: 'This will be sent to the central criminal court for . January 17 2012. There will be a bail application on Thursday October . 13.' Stabbed to death: Mrs Hodkin with her husband, Paul, pictured at a wedding together three years ago . Edgington is also charged with the . attempted murder of a 23-year-old woman, Scotland Yard said. Sally Hodkin, 59, was killed less than five minutes from her home while on her way to work at a firm of solicitors. Mrs Hodkin worked . at law firm Cunningham Blake. An answerphone message at the practice said the office was closed due to a . bereavement and would reopen today. An earlier attack left a 23-year-old woman injured at a nearby bus stop. After stabbing Mrs Hodkin, the attacker calmly approached a shopkeeper and said: 'I think I have just killed someone. 'Can you call the police?' Last . night it was claimed that the suspect, who has a history of . mental health problems, attempted to get herself sectioned the night . before because she had stopped taking her medication, but was turned . away from hospital. An NHS inquiry has begun. Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services in south-east London, said Edgington had unexpectedly left an assessment suite while a bed was being prepared for her at 7am yesterday. A statement read: 'Nicola Edgington has been receiving regular treatment from the trust since 2006. 'She attended A&E at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich yesterday at around 5am seeking help and was transferred to our mental health assessment unit at Oxleas House on the QEH site. 'At Oxleas House she was promptly assessed. A bed was available and medication was being prepared before admitting her to a ward on a voluntary basis. 'At 7am she unexpectedly left the assessment suite. Staff saw her leave and pursued her but were unsuccessful. 'Up to this point she had not given any indication she intended to leave and had agreed to admission. Staff notified the police. We will carry out a full and thorough investigation. The trust is shocked and saddened by this tragic incident and would like to pass on our sympathies to family members.' The . 30-minute knife spree began after the attacker bought a six-inch blade . from an Asda supermarket in Bexleyheath, south-east London, at around . 8am. On leaving the . store, she attacked a woman at a nearby bus stop, slashing her hands as . the victim fought to defend herself in front of horrified . schoolchildren. A man in his . 50s ran to the victim's aid and the attacker dropped the weapon and ran . off. The victim was left with minor injuries. But . minutes later the woman burst into a nearby butcher's shop, grabbed a . 12-inch cleaver and lunged at a butcher behind the counter. Grieving: Members of Mrs Hodkin's family lay flowers at the scene where she was murdered in Bexleyheath . Gathering evidence: Forensics officers surround the scene where Mrs Hodkin was fatally stabbed in south-east London . David Russell, 59, escaped by running . out the back of the property. He said: 'She never said a word. She had . dark hair and her face was pale, ill looking. She seemed calm. 'She just walked round the counter. I . turned round and was about to say “what do you think you're doing” and . she got the knife and raised it above her head. It was like a scene from a horror movie.' Within minutes of leaving the shop, . the woman encountered Mrs Hodkin, who had just left her £350,000 home in . Bexleyheath on her way to Cunningham Blake solicitors in Blackheath, . where she worked as an accounts manager. Mrs Hodkin, who was married to Paul . and had two sons and two grandchildren, was stabbed once in the neck and . left lying face down in a pool of blood. The attacker is then said to have . walked into a tile shop 50 yards away. Ryan Higgins, who works at . Bexleyheath Tile Centre, said: 'She said, “I think I've hurt someone, I . think I have just killed someone. Can you call the police”. 'She seemed in a state of shock. She . was upset but she didn't seem angry. When the police arrived she was . crying quite a bit, she kept telling the officers, “I should have been . sectioned last night. I need my medicine”.'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:27 PM on 10th October 2011 . Brand management: Dr Pepper Ten is a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign . Dudes don't drink diet. Or at least that's the idea behind Dr Pepper Ten, a 10-calorie soft drink Dr Pepper Snapple Group is rolling out on Monday with a macho ad campaign that proclaims ‘It's not for women.’ The soft drink was developed after the company's research found that men shy away from diet drinks that aren't perceived as ‘manly’ enough. To appeal to men, Dr Pepper made its Ten drink 180 degrees different than Diet Dr Pepper. It has calories and sugar unlike its diet counterpart. Instead of the dainty tan bubbles on the diet can, Ten will be wrapped in gunmetal grey packaging with silver bullets. And while Diet Dr Pepper's marketing is women-friendly, the ad campaign for Ten goes out of its way to eschew women. For instance, there's a Dr Pepper Ten Facebook page for men only. And TV commercials are heavy on the machismo, including one spot that shows muscular men in the jungle battling snakes and bad guys and appear to shoot lasers at each other. ‘Hey ladies. Enjoying the film? Of course not. Because this is our movie and this is our soda,’ a man says as he attempts to pour the soda into a glass during a bumpy ATV ride. ‘You can keep the romantic comedies and lady drinks. We're good.’ Dr Pepper Ten is not the first diet soda aimed at men. (Think: Coke Zero and Pepsi Max.) But it’s the first ad campaign to be so overt about courting men who want to drink a soda with fewer calories. The ads come at a time when overall sales in the $74billon soft drink industry are slowing as more Americans buy healthier options like juice and bottled water. Volume has fallen from slightly over 10 billion cases in 2005 to 9.4 billion cases in 2010, according to Beverage Digest data. ‘Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas,’ said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. Dr Pepper said men, in particular, are dissatisfied with the taste and image of diet drinks. The company wouldn't disclose the formula of Dr Pepper Ten, but said that the drink has 10 calories and 2 grams of sugar, which gives it a sweeter taste. Dr Pepper said there are 23 flavours in . its regular soda, (which has 150 calories and 27 grams of sugar per can) and Dr Pepper Ten contains all of them. Interesting approach: It's not often that a major brand tries to block out an entire segment of the population, but that's exactly what Dr Pepper is doing with the launch of its latest product, Dr Pepper Ten . The company, which declined to give figures for how much was spent on the campaign, also worked hard to craft a macho message. 'One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded. That will always get someone's attention' Deborah MitchellUniversity of Wisconsin . The company said ads for Dr Pepper Ten will air on all major networks, FX and ESPN during college football games. A Facebook page for the drink contains an application that allows it to exclude women from viewing content, which includes games and videos aimed at being ‘manly.’ For instance, there's a shooting gallery where you shoot things like high heels and lipstick. There is also a ‘man quiz’ with questions on activities like fishing and hunting. ‘One topic people never tire of talking or arguing about is differences between men and women, particularly if women are excluded,’ said brand expert Deborah Mitchell. 'Regular sugared soft drinks have declined in recent years, and some consumers have taste issues with some of the diet sodas' John SicherBeverage Digest . ‘That will always get someone's attention,’ added Ms Mitchell, executive director for the Center for Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin School of Business. As for whether the ads will resonate with men remains to be seen. Paul McDonald, 25, who works in green energy contracts in Berkley, California, says he drinks soda labelled ‘diet’ and doesn't think there is any stigma attached. ‘No one has ever made fun of me for drinking a Diet Coke, and I'm on a rugby team - we make fun of each other for everything,’ he said. 'Women get the joke. ""Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product' Jim TrebilcockDr Pepper . And women? Jim Trebilcock, executive vice president of marketing for Dr Pepper, said he's not worried that they'll be offended by the campaign. The drink and marketing were tested in six different markets across the country before being rolled out nationally, and women weren't offended, he said. In fact, about 40 per cent of people who have tried the soda so far are women. ‘Women get the joke,’ he said. ‘“Is this really for men or really for women?” is a way to start the conversation that can spread and get people engaged in the product.’ See video here .","Research found men shy away from diet drinks not perceived as 'manly'

She was jailed for seven years for abuse of office . The former PM compared her verdict, which she claimed was written by her longtime foe, President Viktor Yanukovych (pictured), to the horrific purges by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . Last night there was a furious reaction from the EU, Washington and even Russia – normally a supporter of Mr Yanukovych. EU foreign policy chief Baroness . Ashton said she was ‘deeply disappointed’ with the verdict and warned . that Ukraine’s plans to become part of the Union by signing a free trade . deal were now in jeopardy. Mrs Tymoshenko is said to have . cheated Ukraine out of £130million in a 2009 gas deal signed with . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. She has been ordered to repay the full amount. Mrs Tymoshenko remained calm, but didn't . wait for Judge Rodion Kireyev to finish reading the lengthy ruling, . standing and addressing reporters in the courtroom as he spoke. She compared her verdict, which she claimed was written by her longtime foe, President Viktor Yanukovych, to the horrific purges by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. 'The year 1937 has returned to Ukraine with this verdict and all the repression of citizens,' she said. She added that she would contest the ruling, which also bans her from holding government posts for three years after she completes her sentence. 'As for me, be sure that I will not stop my fight even for a minute. I will always be with you as long as it is necessary.' 'Nobody, not Yanukovych, not Kireyev, can humiliate my honest name. I have worked and will continue to work for Ukraine's sake,' Mrs Tymoshenko told reporters earlier. As the judge was leaving the courtroom, Mrs Tymoshenko's husband Oleksandr yelled out that his time would also come for a similar verdict. One Tymoshenko supporter shouted 'Shame!'

She compared her verdict, which she claimed was written by her longtime foe, President Viktor Yanukovych, to the horrific purges by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . Politics: Court security guards avert their gaze as Tymoshenko embraces her husband Oleksander. He yelled out as the judge left the courtroom, promising the current regime's time would come . Mrs Tymoshenko was found guilty of . exceeding her authority during the signing of a natural gas import . contract with Russia in 2009. The . court ruled that she was not authorised to order the contract signed . and that the price she agreed to was too high, causing losses to the . state budget. The European . Union was quick to condemn the verdict as politically motivated and . urged the Ukrainian authorities to ensure a transparent and fair appeals . process for Mrs Tymoshenko. A . failure to do so would have 'profound implications' for Ukraine-EU . relations and could jeopardise the conclusion of a landmark association . agreement, Baroness Ashton said in a statement. Mrs Tymoshenko was a driving force behind the 2004 Orange Revolution, which overturned Mr Yanukovych's fraud-tainted election victory that year. Last year, Mr Yanukovych staged a comeback, narrowly defeating his rival in a presidential vote amid public disenchantment with economic hardships and constant bickering among the political class. Riot police detain a supporter of the former PM in Kiev today. Outside the courtroom, her supporters and opponents held competing rallies . Mrs Tymoshenko has already spent over two months in jail after Judge Kireyev ordered her arrested for contempt of court. She . had also spent several weeks in prison in 2001 on charges of document . forgery and tax evasion, but the charges were later dropped. Mrs Tymoshenko maintains her innocence and . charges that her trial was orchestrated by Mr Yanukovych in order to . bar her from upcoming elections. She . says as prime minister she did not need any special permission to order . the signing of the gas deal and maintains her actions helped end a . bitter pricing dispute between Moscow and Kiev, which had led to energy . supply shortages across Europe. On . Tuesday, the area outside the court building was flooded by helmeted . riot police as supporters and opponents of Mrs Tymoshenko held competing . rallies. Police buses blocked traffic on Kreshchatik Avenue, which runs through the heart of the capital. National heroine: In this 2005 file photo supporters of Yulia Tymoshenko carry her on their shoulders during a huge rally at the Indepedence Square in Kiev to mark the first anniversary of Ukraine's Orange Revolution . Born in November 1960, Yulia Tymoshenko shot to world prominence when she helped lead the 'Orange Revolution' street protests in Kiev in 2004-5 which doomed President Viktor Yanukovich's first bid for power. With her peasant-style hairbraid - her political trademark - she enthralled her supporters with fiery speeches in which she portrayed herself as the saviour of Ukraine from corruption and criminality. Mr Yanukovich, who defeated her in a presidential election in February 2010 and is her political arch-rival, has been the principal target of her invective. Tymoshenko's fiery performance in the 'Orange Revolution' earned her the role of prime minister under Viktor Yushchenko, her ally in the protests. He became president. Tymoshenko fell out with Mr Yushchenko and was sacked in September 2005 after less than eight months in office. She was later briefly reconciled with Mr Yushchenko and had a second spell as prime minister. In January 2009, as prime minister, Tymoshenko brokered the 10-year gas deal with her Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, which has now led to her conviction. The prosecution in her trial alleged she abused her power by rail-roading the state energy firm, Naftogaz, into signing a 2009 gas import agreement with Russia. Mr Yushchenko, who has appeared as a witness at her trial, put the blame squarely on her. He says she went to Moscow to negotiate the deal by herself and then hid details of it from him. For her part, Tymoshenko says the trial against her is a vendetta by Yanukovich aimed at neutralising her as a political force. The United States and the European Union, which see her trial as politically motivated, have called for an end to the case against her and for her to be released.","Yulia Tymoshenko sentenced to seven years in jail for abuse of office .

"By . Thomas Durante . Last updated at 9:06 AM on 11th October 2011 . A Wisconsin woman who already had three children and was desperate to have one with her new boyfriend was today charged with killing a pregnant mother, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own. The criminal complaint filed today details the horrific story behind the murder of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, who was expecting her fourth child that she had planned to name Omar. Her alleged killer, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, admitted she . had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant . woman whose child she could steal and call her own. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday . On October 6, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride. When . she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go . back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in . to use the bathroom. It . was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her . with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times. With . Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she . passed out, and cut her open, attempting a Cesaerean section that she . had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez is accused of murdering Maritza Ramirez-Cruz then savagely cutting out her unborn child . Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday . Morales-Rodriguez then hid the body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a . call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had . just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the . criminal complaint. Indicted: Annette Morales-Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder . Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but, . after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the . woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. Police Chief Edward Flynn said: 'During . the ensuing investigations, detectives determined that the 33-year-old . woman was not, in fact, the birth mother of the baby.' The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. The medical examiner determined that Ramirez-Cruz likely died from excessive loss of blood. Local residents and neighbours have . been shocked by the brutal killing, and many cannot believe police have . the right person in custody. On Sunday night, the victim's husband, Christian Mercado, told WTMJ that his wife was a 'good person.' Because he doesn't speak English, Mr Mercado's stepmother Darla Guiterrez translated for him. She said: 'We still can't believe it. We know it's true but we can't believe it and the whole family is taking it real hard.' Jacqueline Bonilla, whose daughter lives next-door to Morales-Rodriguez, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'She was acting like she was [pregnant]. Grief: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz's husband Christian Mercado is shocked by her death, and says she was a 'good person' 'She'd push her belly out and I'd say, ""Oh, she's pregnant.""' Another neighbour, Keila Perez, claimed the Morales-Rodriguez is the godmother to her daughter. 'From what I know she had a baby, she had baby stuff in there, she has a car seat and everything in there. I don't know what the hell is going on.' Morales-Rodriguez lived in the property with a man and her three children, but police said no-one else is being considered as an accomplice. Neighbours said Morales-Rodriguez claimed to have been pregnant for months. Police tape: The home where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lived in suburban Milwaukee remains blocked off after police found the body of 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz in the basement . Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lives with her boyfriend and three children . Ms Perez said Morales-Rodriguez had been talking about pregnancy, and had even shown her a sonogram of the baby. She claimed she was expecting to deliver the baby by Caesarean section in the coming weeks but had called Ms Perez around noon on Thursday to say she was having contractions. She said the woman's three other children ranged in age from five to 14, and her current boyfriend was not their father. She added that Morales-Rodriguez had lived in the neighbourhood for seven years, after moving from Puerto Rico. Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:45 PM on 15th September 2011 . A student who was arrested under the Terrorism Act and kept in custody for six days has been awarded £20,000 compensation by the police. Rizwaan Sabir, 22, who was studying for a master's at Nottingham University, was arrested after downloading a terrorist manual for his research on al Qaeda. Police arrested him on the university campus on May 14, 2008 on suspicion of possessing extremist material. Wrongfully arrested: Rizwaan Sabir has secured a £20,000 payout from police . Mr Sabir was arrested after downloading an edited version of the The Al Qaeda Training Manual from a US government website for his postgraduate research, his solicitor said. He was held for six days before he was released without charge. After the cash award was announced, Mr Sabir said he was pleased to have cleared his name after a battle lasting more than three years. A police spokesman confirmed a sum of £20,000 had been agreed to settle Mr Sabir's civil case. 'We stand by the fact that the arrest, detention and obtaining of a warrant of further detention were all perfectly legal, proportionate and necessary in the circumstances as they were in 2008,' a statement said. Researcher: Mr Sabir downloaded an al Qaeda manual from a U.S. government website . 'The matter was settled without admission of liability save that the force admitted that one brief search of Mr Sabir and his vehicle carried out in February 2010 was the result of a mistaken belief on the part of the officers involved. This was admitted in November 2010 and the force apologises for this search. 'Nottinghamshire Police has also agreed to amend some records held on Mr Sabir to give them greater clarity. 'Given that all litigation carries with it a risk, this modest monetary settlement was viewed as a sensible way of keeping overall costs to a minimum.' Following his release from custody, Mr Sabir told ITV Central News: 'It was the most terrifying experience that I have ever had. 'It absolutely broke me. It has been the lowest time in my entire life.' He said he had felt 'the bureaucracy of the state hit me in its hardest form and I feel that the police powers were used in the wrong ways'. Mr Sabir, who is of Pakistani descent, said: 'There is no smoke without fire. There's fire and the fire is that I am Asian and I'm Muslim and I have got a beard and that's the fire so there is smoke.' Mr Sabir, who is currently a PhD student at the University of Strathclyde researching the UK's domestic counter-terrorism policy, was arrested after the manual was discovered on a friend's computer. It is understood Mr Sabir had sent the 1,500-page document to the friend - who was also arrested on May 14 under the Terrorism Act and later released without charge - because he had access to a printer. A statement issued today by Bhatt Murphy Solicitors on Mr Sabir's behalf said the manual was 'well established as a document used for research in the field of counter-terrorism policy', was referred to in standard textbooks and was widely available. The statement said Mr Sabir brought proceedings against Nottinghamshire Police for false imprisonment and breaches of the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Human Rights Act 1998. He claimed that false information on Nottinghamshire Police records, including a clear but unfounded assertion that Mr Sabir had been convicted of a terrorist offence, had led to Mr Sabir being subject to numerous stops and searches. Mr Sabir said the police 'have been forced to account for the wrong they did to me. 'But I am one of the lucky ones. I cannot forget all those other innocent people like me who have suffered at the hands of the police but do not have the chance or means to vindicate their names.' Michael Oswald of Bhatt Murphy said: 'Clearly, the police have a difficult and important job to do in their counter-terrorism role, however, they must nonetheless act within the law and must be held to account when they do not. 'Through his remarkable effort and fierce determination over the last three years, Mr Sabir has been able to hold the police to account for their failings.'",Rizwaan Sabir had downloaded a terrorist manual from a U.S. government website to help his research .
"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 6:01 PM on 7th October 2011 . Justice Secretary Ken Clarke proposes to increase sentencing from two years in prison to five . Dangerous drivers who cause serious injuries on the road could be jailed for up to five years under new plans, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said today. The introduction of a new offence of 'causing serious injury by dangerous driving' would more than double the current maximum sentence of two years for dangerous drivers whose victims are seriously injured but not killed. The change was spurred on by cases such as that of motorist Christopher Marr, who was jailed for just 26 months when he left 14-year-old Devon Foster with horrific injuries after a collision. Judge Steven Everett presided over his case and said it 'defies belief' that he could not sentence Marr for longer. He was released from prison after 13 months. Campaigners welcomed the proposals, saying that, with 1,850 deaths on the roads in Britain last year alone, the move would 'help to provide justice to families whose lives have been ripped apart by dangerous drivers'. Mr Clarke said: 'We have listened to the victims of dangerous drivers, their families, MPs, judges and road safety groups and their experiences have directly informed these changes. The review was sparked by the lack of sentencing power that a judge said he had when jailing the driver behind the horrific injuries of 14-year-old Devon Foster . 'Making our roads safer is a priority - . five people died on our roads each day last year, so we need to do . everything we can to further improve safety.' Ellen . Booth, from road safety charity Brake, said: . 'This new offence finally means that serious injury is recognised . within the title of the offence, and this recognition is vitally . important to victims and their families. 'It also means that dangerous drivers . who inflict serious injuries can expect to see higher sentences to . better reflect the terrible trauma and injuries they have caused.' Andrew Howard, head of road safety at . the AA, said the changes, which will be part of the Government's Legal . Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, 'should make sentences . more proportionate to the devastation dangerous driving causes and . should also deter people from driving badly'. Road Safety Minister Mike Penning added that while the vast majority of motorists were safe and responsible, 'the wilfully reckless minority who put lives in danger must face serious penalties'. Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'RoSPA has previously called for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving to be extended to cover causing serious injury, so we welcome the announcement of a new offence of 'causing serious injury by dangerous driving'. 'Serious injuries often cause life-long disability for the victims of bad drivers and can fundamentally affect their quality of life and that of their families. 'To ensure this new law works as intended, it will be absolutely crucial to ensure that it is applied consistently in terms of prosecution and sentencing.' Robert Gifford, executive director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, said 'The main response to this proposal must be to ask: what exactly is meant by ""serious injury""? 'The definition in Reported Road Casualties refers to a visit to accident and emergency or an overnight stay in hospital. 'I assume that, if the injury results from an act of dangerous driving, then the definition must imply an injury that is life-changing. 'It will be important for Parliament to give a clear indication of what is understood by serious when the amendment is debated. Otherwise, it is quite likely that the offence may be placed on the statute book with little or no effect. 'At present, just under 6,000 drivers are charged every year with dangerous driving. Yet we have no information about how many of those charges are the result of a crash involving serious injuries. 'So, it will be important to understand just how many extra court cases will result from the new offence. 'I hope that MPs and peers will therefore look very carefully at the detail of this offence to ensure that it leads to improvements in road safety, especially as it was not referred to in either the Strategic Framework for Road Safety published by the Government in May 2011 or the earlier consultation document on Road Safety Compliance published in November 2008.' A judge who wrote to David Cameron last year asking why he was unable to sentence a driver to more than two years has been cited as sparking the the re-think in the law. Christopher Marr  was sentenced to 26 months in prison when he crashed into three teenage girls in Bromley Cross, Bolton, after taking his girlfriend's car while drunk on August 22 last year. He drove at 90mph on the wrong side of the road before mounting a pavement and colliding with the girls, who were walking home from a party, leaving a scene of 'absolute devastation'. When jailing Christopher Marr (left) for just 26 months for dangerous driving Judge Steven Everett wrote to David Cameron to ask for tougher sentences . Marr took his girlfriend's car without her consent when he drove at 90mph, on the wrong side of the road, while drunk before hitting Devon and two friends . Devon Foster, then 14, was left fighting for her life with a fracture that ran from ear to ear under the front of her eyes, a cracked bone in her back, a bruised kidney, a fractured right arm and an ankle injury. She was left with brain injuries, scars and still suffers from hearing problems but has been able to finish her GCSEs. Devon Foster, pictured while recovering, suffered from a skull fracture that left her with hearing problems . Judge Steven Everett presided over the case and ordered for the court transcripts to be sent to the Prime Minister and the Justice Secretary when he found he could sentence Marr for just 26 months. He was released after 13 months. Summing up at Bolton Crown Court he said: 'For many years lawyers and judges have been railing against the government to change the sentence. 'It defies belief that successive governments have not seen fit to increase the maximum sentence. It is about time the government got its facts right and sorted itself out.' Miss Foster, now 15, backs the proposal. She said: 'I'm very happy the law is being changed. It's just sad that I have had to go through what I've been through for the law to be changed.' Her mother, Sam, 42, added: Devon's mum Sam, 42, added: 'It is wonderful, it's great news. It is a pity it has had to happen like this for so many families to go through what we've gone through for the Government to sit up and take notice. 'Christopher Marr is already out of prison but Devon is still serving her life sentence. 'She's got scars to look at every day, medication to take every day, hospital appointments each month. Devon's life has been turned upside down and her life has been put on hold. 'People may think twice now before driving dangerously.'","Sentences would be increased from maximum of two years in prison to five under the new court guidelines .

Upset: Anderson Cooper is 'very saddened' by the teenager who is reportedly in a coma after falling off a skateboard whilst filming himself for the show . A representative for Mr Cooper said producers had been working with the boy and his parents on the science behind the teenage brain. 'As part of our routine process, we ask guests for video footage and photos,' he told Gawker. 'We did not provide the family with a camera.' But on the morning the boy was supposed to travel to New York City, producers found out that he had been injured. He was pushed to 'film the crazy stuff you do' but suffered a severe head injury when falling from his skateboard, a source told Gawker. This left the teenager in a coma and the show never aired.

"By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 3:11 PM on 8th October 2011 . Ed Miliband called up two of Gordon Brown’s backroom bruisers to the political front line yesterday in a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle designed to beef up his attacks on the Tories. Tom Watson – who led a campaign to expose the News of the World phone-hacking scandal – will become deputy party chairman in charge of a new campaigns attack unit. In a sign Labour is failing to land significant political punches, he will be joined by Michael Dugher – a former Brown spin doctor who becomes Shadow Minister without Portfolio. Ed Miliband has turned to one of 'Brown's bruisers', tom Watson, to be deputy party chairman . The Labour leader’s decision to create a Brownite cabal at the top of the party overshadowed the elevation of rising stars such as Chuka Umunna, the business spokesman; Rachel Reeves, the new Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury; and Liz Kendall, who will speak on care and pensioner issues. The reshuffle left the most senior posts unchanged. Husband and wife team Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper remain Shadow Chancellor and Shadow Home Secretary respectively, while Douglas Alexander retains his position as Shadow Foreign Secretary. But in a painful admission that his party has failed to land meaningful blows against the Coalition’s NHS shake-up, Mr Miliband moved former health secretary Andy Burnham back to his old policy patch. He replaces John Healey, who has returned to the backbenches. And in a signal that Mr Burnham had left Education Secretary Michael Gove to grab the credit for Labour’s academy schools programme, Blairite former schools minister Stephen Twigg was given the key education job.

Douglas Alexander Shadow Foreign Secretary . Yvette Cooper: Shadow Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities . Sadiq Khan Shadow Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice . Rosie Winterton: Shadow Chief Whip . Yesterday’s front-bench reshuffle was . billed by Labour bosses as the moment the ‘new generation’ of MPs were . promoted – with five of those winning promotion to Mr Miliband’s top . team having been elected for the first time last year. But it also saw . Mr Miliband hand top jobs to Mr Brown’s toughest henchmen. Mr Watson was best known until recently as a prime mover in the Curry House plot that helped to oust Tony Blair. He and Mr Dugher were also friends . with Damian McBride, the former Brown spin doctor who resigned in . disgrace after unleashing ‘the forces of hell’ in negative briefings . against political friend and foe alike.

"By . Kirsty Walker and Becky Barrow . Last updated at 11:33 AM on 12th October 2011 . Middle-income families are suffering an ‘unprecedented collapse’ in living standards as inflation and poor wages wipe thousands off incomes. On the eve of the release of the worst unemployment figures for 17 years, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found families are about to endure their biggest income drop since the 1970s. This means a typical couple with two children is likely to be £2,080 worse off in 2013 terms than they were last year as their real income falls from £30,056 to £27,976. Worrying times: The Institute of Fiscal Studies warned that the next two years will be 'dominated by a large decline' in incomes . The IFS warned that the next two years will be ‘dominated by a large decline’ in incomes. It revealed median incomes are set to fall by 7 per cent after inflation has been taken into account – the sharpest drop in 35 years. A leading think-tank today warned the economic recovery in the UK was the weakest of any since the end of the First World War. The warning came as the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said its monthly estimates suggest gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 0.5 per cent in the three months to September, compared to a revised 0.4 per cent in the quarter to August. NIESR said the level of GDP in the period is still 4 per cent below the pre-recession peak - suggesting the recovery is the weakest since 1918. The figures for the third quarter may surprise some economists who have forecast near stagnant growth between July and September. The study said: ‘The unprecedented . collapse in living standards is chiefly due to the high inflation and . weak earnings growth over this period.’ Robert Joyce, of the IFS, described it as the ‘delayed effect’ of the recession. He said: ‘Real earnings didn’t fall for a while after the economy started contracting, partly because inflation was very low. ‘But inflation has risen sharply and earnings have not done so in response.’ The grim report came as another respected think-tank warned UK recovery will be the weakest ‘since the end of the First World War’, as the economy remains mired in a ‘depression’. The National Institute of Economic . and Social Research estimated GDP rose by just 0.5 per cent in the three . months to September. In its monthly report, NIESR said the figures were . a slight improvement compared with growth of 0.4 per cent in the  three . months to August. But . it said the level of GDP is still 4 per cent below the pre-recession . peak – suggesting the recovery is the weakest since 1918. It added: ‘UK . economic growth over the past year has been anaemic.’ An individual is in relative poverty if they live in a household whose income is below 60% of the average in that year, and in absolute poverty if a household's real-terms income is below 60% of the 2010/11 average. Source: IFS . Unemployment: The number of jobless people is set to hit a 17-year high . Economists . had predicted stronger growth for the period to September as the weak . second quarter was blamed on special factors, such as the Royal Wedding . bank holiday. The IFS . also forecast that 600,000 more children will be pushed into poverty by . 2013, taking the total living in ‘absolute’ poverty to 3.1million. It says the Coalition’s tax and . benefit reforms will drive down real incomes, and the new Universal . Credit system will fail to make up for the losses of the poor. The . report was seized upon by Labour as evidence that the Government is . condemning hundreds of thousands of children to lives in poverty. And Shadow Treasury Minister Chris Leslie said: ‘The Tory-led Government’s policy of cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast has delivered slower growth and higher unemployment, which will mean billions more borrowing than planned.’ But Universities Minister David Willetts insisted: ‘We have tried to hold down fuel duty, we are freezing council tax, we have increased the income tax allowance, we have tried to do the things that help, but you can’t ignore the basic rules of economics, that when you inherit a situation where an economy has shrunk by 7 per cent there isn’t the money there.’ However, official figures, to be published today, are expected to show the unemployment crisis is getting worse, particularly among the young. The latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics showed a record 20.8 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 are unemployed. And the numbers are rising rapidly. Between May and July, an extra 78,000 joined the youth unemployed, pushing the total to 973,000. Economists fear today’s figures could show the number hitting an all-time record of 1million. Total unemployment is expected to top the 2,521,000 recorded in 1994.","Warning recovery is weakest since World War I .

Roy Wyre was handed the fine by a council official as he brushed two-year-old Spencer on Harvey Hadden Playing Fields in Nottingham. The 66-year-old had been sitting with his pet on a blanket, brushing the dog's hair, when he was approached by a council community protection officer. Barking mad: Roy Wyre was fined £75 for littering as he brushed his dog Spencer in the park . The retired security guard was wearing a high-visibility jacket when he was approached by the official, who accused him impersonating a police officer. Roy, from Bilborough, Nottingham, said: 'I had been walking the dog and we'd sat down for a bit of a rest and I was giving him a brush. 'This man walked over and told me to take my hi-vis jacket off because it looked like I was impersonating a police officer. 'He asked me for my details and I said that I had done nothing wrong and I was not giving him my name and address. 'Then he called for a police officer, who also told me to take my jacket off, and asked for my name and address before leaving. Red faced: Nottingham City Council has backed down and retracted the fine . 'As soon as he had gone, the community protection officer came back with a fine slip with a £75 charge on it. 'He put on the slip ""litter, large amounts"", but there was nowhere near large amounts at all. 'You could brush Spencer all day and there wouldn't be more than a handful of hair. 'If there is a little bit of hair coming off, one of the birds will pick it up for a nest. It's not like dropping paper or something.' But after Roy complained to the council, officials were forced to drop the fine issued last Wednesday. A community protection spokesman at Nottingham City Council said: 'A CPO on routine patrol on Harvey Hadden playing fields was concerned after coming across what was believed to be a member of the public wearing a police uniform. 'After checking with a police colleague, this turned out not to be the case. 'The gentleman in question was also fined for littering, but once the full circumstances became clear a decision was made to overturn this and an apology was issued.'","Roy Wyre, 66, also accused of impersonating a police officer by wearing a high-visibility jacket ."

Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout fund this week, the main opposition leader said today -just one day after parliament rejected the proposal, causing the government to fall. Robert Fico, head of Smer-Social Democracy, said that in exchange for his party's votes, three outgoing government party leaders have agreed to hold early general elections on March 10. He said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest,' Collapsed: In a desperate effort to force a vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta Radicova tied it to a confidence vote - the one-year-old government subsequently collapsed . Tuesday's vote on the bail out failed because a junior coalition party, the Freedom and Solidarity party, was against it. In a desperate effort to force that . party to vote in favour of the bailout fund, Prime Minister Iveta . Radicova tied the vote to a confidence vote - but it failed causing her one-year-old government to collapse. With the government defunct - and . with the promise of early elections - Fico said his party will now vote . in favour of the bailout fund, which all 16 other members of the . eurozone have already supported. The leaders of three coalition parties . - Mikulas Dzurinda of the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, which . Radicova belongs to; Jan Figel of the Christian Democrats and Bela Bugar . of a party of ethnic Hungarians - confirmed the deal. Bugar said. 'We had to pay a political price. And the early election is the price.' Just one day after parliament rejected the proposal causing the government to fall, Slovakia's main political parties have reached a deal to approve changes to an EU bailout . Opposition party leader, and former prime minister, Robert Fico said: 'Slovakia will ratify the EU bailout fund without any problems. I believe it will happen on Friday this week at the latest' The announcement came hours after EU . President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose . Manuel Barroso called on Slovak political parties 'to rise above the . positioning of short-term politics, and seize the next occasion to . ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement.' They said the enhancement of the . €44billion Euro European Financial Stability Facility is crucial 'to . preserve financial stability in the euro area. And that is in the . interest of all euro countries, including the Slovak people.' Eurozone leaders had agreed in July to . increase the size and powers of the bailout fund, giving it the ability . to lend quickly to governments in case of market trouble in order to . contain the stubborn financial crisis. Fico's populist leftist party is by . far the strongest political force in Slovakia and stands a good chance . to win the early ballot. It won last year's general elections in June . with 34.8 percent of the vote, taking 62 seats in the 150-seat . Parliament. The senior party of the outgoing . coalition, the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union, was well behind in . second, with 15.4 percent, or 28 seats. Fico's party campaigned on a promise . to maintain the country's welfare state even as other European countries . slash their budgets to deal with the economic crisis. During his term of prime minister . between 2006 and 2010, Slovakia adopted the euro currency in 2009. Despite him taking the largest share of the vote in the 2010 election, . four opposition parties with a majority of 79 parliamentary seats agreed . to form a ruling coalition. Mr Fico and his party had always . supported expanding the fund expansion in principle, but had said it . would vote 'yes' only if the government agreed to call early elections. As major eurozone policies need the . approval of all 17 countries that use the currency, Slovakia's vote - . the last - carried immense weight. For . weeks it appeared certain it would reject boosting the bailout fund, . unnerving financial markets and threatening the future of Europe's plans . to fight the crisis. Experts . said EU officials could possibly find a way around a Slovakian . rejection of the bill to boost the powers and size of the bailout fund, . the European Financial Stability Facility (ESFS), but that doing so . would carry costs to European unity. In . the longer-term, the drama seems sure to add momentum to the push for . nimbler rules to govern the 17-country eurozone, where government . reaction to the unfolding crisis has seemed for many months to be behind . the curve. That push has been gathering momentum for some time. Charts key economic data for Greece . In August, the leaders of France and Germany, President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chancellor Angela Merkel, proposed that the heads of the eurozone countries elect the president of a new 'economic government' who would direct regular summits to respond to the continent's financial crisis. And in September Jose Manuel Barroso. president of the European Commission, decried what he called 'the constraint of unanimity'. Mr Barroso told the European Parliament: 'The pace of our joint endeavour cannot be dictated by the slowest.' At issue now is an agreement reached by the eurozone leaders in July to enlarge the EFSF's capital guarantee from 440billion to 780billion euro. Slovakia would contribute about 1 per cent, or 7.7billion euro. In addition, if the changes are approved, the facility would have new powers and able to prop up government bond markets and help put new capital reserves against losses in banks. Although 16 countries have given the thumbs-up, approval of the changes has found itself in potential jeopardy because of the opposition of a junior member of Slovakia's governing coalition, the Freedom and Solidarity Party.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:10 PM on 11th October 2011 . A junior football league which stopped publishing scorelines from one-sided matches to spare losing players' blushes has agreed to resume the proper reporting of results. The Telford Junior Football League had come under fire for listing all home wins as 1-0 and away victories as 0-1 to ensure the welfare of youngsters aged between 9 and 16 following heavy defeats. The league claimed to be keeping to Football Association guidelines in withholding the true scores from its matches, but the ruling body has no rules requiring results to be changed. Victory: The Telford Junior Leagues has said it will now publish the correct scores on its website having initially insisted all results be recorded as either 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 to avoid embarrassing young players . In a statement confirming that the . Telford league has now agreed to report actual scorelines, the . Shropshire Football Association said: 'The Telford Junior/Youth Football . League, in response to the FA National Youth Review, have piloted a . different system of recording results. 'In hindsight, this was a decision . that should have been taken in consultation with the member clubs of the . league and the county Football Association. 'Following a meeting between the . league management committee and Shropshire FA vice-chairman David . Simpson, it has been recommended to the league by the Shropshire FA that . in the interim, before a meeting of the league management and member . clubs to discuss future policy of reporting results, the correct scores . be reported.' A spokesman for The FA commented: . 'There's an FA rule that prohibits the publishing of results and league . tables across all media for U7 and U8 age groups where the focus of the . game is about learning to play without the pressure of full-time scores. 'Across all age groups, there are no rules, sanctions or FA guidelines which indicate that the final score should be changed.' The league, which was founded in . 1984 and has more than 2,000 players from clubs in Telford, north . Shropshire and Bridgnorth, had said it would will also stop recording results for under-11 . teams altogether from next season. 'Still 1-0... despite 7 goals': The Telford League had stopped recording thrashings, no matter how many goals young players scored . The move drew criticism from parents, who said it made the league table a pointless exercise. One parent, who did not want to be . named, said: ‘This is because they don’t want kids embarrassed if their . team has lost . ‘If that’s the case what’s the point of having a league table up on the website at all?’ Another parent, who also did not want . to be named for fear of turning officials against his son’s team, said: . ‘I think it’s crazy - kids need to learn about winning and losing from . an early age. They aren’t recognising the boys’ achievements. ‘They might not want to embarrass the . losing team but if one of the lads scores six or seven goals and that . isn’t recorded what kind of message does that send to them? ‘The lads might as well not turn up.’ Assistant secretary Stephen Groome said the league had introduced the results policy on its official website this year. But not everyone was against the moves and Stephen Clarke, manager of the under-11s Wrekin Panthers team, backed the move. He said: ‘The children’s welfare is . paramount. The winners have three points on the website if they win and . the children who lose 20-0 would feel very disheartened if it was on the . website. ‘They might think of not playing. I think it’s a very good idea.’ But Mr Clarke added there must come a point when players had to accept defeat. He said: ‘I think probably by the age . of 15 then they have an understanding that life is a bit of a . competition and we are competing with other people.’ Dame Kelly Holmes, the double Olympic champion, has spoken out in the past about the decline of competitive sports for children. She said it risked spawning a . generation of bad losers and blamed a culture of political correctness . for making ‘competitiveness’ a dirty word.","All results recorded as 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 as league refuses to record thrashings .

Hamilton has a history of unfortunate events in games. In July a Rangers fan fell to his death in a tragic accident after reaching over a railing to try to catch a ball Hamilton tossed into the stands. The next night, Hamilton hit a foul ball that struck a fan sitting about five rows behind the third-base dugout. He had blood on his face and needed stitches but was treated at the stadium and was OK. Last night the blow seemed to stun the man at first, but he was evaluated by medical staff at the Comerica Park stadium and stayed in his front-row seat, holding a cold pack on the back of his head. The bat that went into the stands was returned to the Rangers, who appeared to pass along another one to the dinged-up fan. Security stopped at least one reporter approaching him for an interview. ‘It's a tough way to get a souvenir bat and we hope that gentleman is OK,’ a Major League Baseball (MLB) television commentator said immediately after the incident on Tuesday night.

Cummings admitted to the photos Friday, just two weeks after it was revealed that two other LA fire stations allowed their engines to be used in two porn movies. The chief said he allowed the woman to pose partially naked in front of the engine, violating LAFD policy. Cummings said he is punishing himself by volunteering to do 120 hours of community service to reinforce 'the public's trust' in him.

"By . David Gardner . Last updated at 10:20 AM on 13th October 2011 . Michael Jackson could still be alive if six 'extreme deviations' in his treatment had been avoided, a court heart yesterday. Cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg listed six flaws in Conrad Murray's treatment in Los Angeles Superior Court which had a direct impact on the 50-year-old 'Thriller' star's death. Prompted by prosecutors, he described Murray's 'bizarre' behaviour in trying to revive Jackson after he stopped breathing on June 25, 2009, and his catalogue of elementary blunders in caring for the star. On Wednesday a jury heard how Conrad Murray made a series of obvious errors in the minutes before Michael Jackson died . He told the court that Murray: . Cardiologist Dr. Alon Steinberg detailed numerous errors, including wrongly administered CPR, failure to call 911, misusing Propofol and not having proper medical equipment . 'All these extreme deviations, giving Propofol in the wrong setting without proper equipment or personnel, not making proper preparations, not calling 911 in a timely manner, not keeping records, all directly impacted on Mr Jackson's life,' said the cardiologist. 'When you monitor a patient you never leave their side, especially after giving them Propofol. It's like leaving a baby that's sleeping on your kitchen counter top. More... Jury shown photo of Michael Jackson's naked dead body and hear how daughter Paris sobbed about being an orphan . 'You would never do it because there is a chance the baby could wake up and fall off or grab a knife or something. You just don't do it. 'If these deviations didn't happen, Mr Jackson could have been alive.' Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering Jackson a lethal dose of Propofol to help him sleep. But Dr Steinberg listed the medical equipment Murray should have had on hand for dealing with a potential emergency. Murray tried giving one-handed chest compressions to Jackson as he lay on the bed, instead of using two hands on a hard surface. Either way Murray was wrong as Jackson still had a pulse when he began . They included equipment for checking his heart rate, his oxygen levels, a back-up battery, a backboard for CPR, a defibrillator to shock the heart, life-saving drugs and trained assistants. 'It is basic knowledge in America that when someone is down you need to call 911 for help. One of the first things Dr Murray should have done was call 911. There was a significant delay,' he said. The cardiologist criticised Murray for calling an assistant rather than an ambulance.  'Every minute counts,' he added. He added that he'd never heard of Propofol being used outside a hospital. Dr Steinberg was testifying after Dr Christopher Rogers, the Los Angeles Deputy Medical Examiner, insisted Jackson could not have killed himself by self-administering Propofol. He told jurors that the circumstances of Jackson's death didn't support the claim by Murray's lawyers that the singer was to blame for his own death. 'In order for Mr Jackson to have administered the Propofol to himself, you would have to assume he woke up and although he was under the influence of Propofol and other sedatives, he was somehow able to administer Propofol to himself,' said Dr Rogers. 'Then he stops breathing and all this takes place in a two-minute period of time. To me, that scenario seems less reasonable.' Jackson could have survived had 911 been called, experts testified, who also said there is no way the pop star could have given himself the lethal dose of sedatives . Murray's lawyer, Michael Flanagan told the judge the defense was dropping the claim that Jackson may have swallowed a deadly dose of Propofol to cause his own death. Dr Steinberg insisted that Jackson's life could have been saved if Murray called 911 the moment he discovered the star's breathing had stopped. 'He was definitely savable at that point. There was a delay in calling 911. If they had got there six minutes later Mr Jackson would still be alive,' said the cardiologist. 'He had a heart pressure and the heart was getting excited and there wasn't enough oxygen. If he had all the help and equipment that he didn't have, Dr Murray could probably have saved Mr Jackson at that point. 'He should never have started chest compressions. He should have called 911. Obviously, waiting didn't work. 'If you put all these things together, yes, he's responsible.' He added that Murray's use of Propofol was 'unethical and untested.' The case continues.","Cardiologist lists catalogue of 'elementary blunders' in care of pop star .

"By . Nick Enoch . Last updated at 7:14 PM on 12th October 2011 . A Harley Street doctor who . put a porn addict through 'total hell' by prescribing him an unlicensed . hallucinogenic drug failed to fully explain the risks of the experimental . treatment to him, a tribunal ruled. Dr Peter . Brackenridge gave the drug, Ibogaine, to the 25-year-old man who was obsessed with . internet pornography. The . patient paid more than £1,900 for the treatment, which was administered in Brackenridge's bedroom at his home in north London. Dr Peter Brackenridge (above) gave Ibogaine, an unlicensed hallucinogenic drug (right), to a 25-year-old porn addict . The . Australian-trained doctor claimed effects would be like 'floating on a river' and that he would spend 36 hours in a 'waking but dreamlike state', the General . Medical Council heard. But the . celibate addict, known as patient A, said it was a 'horrendous treatment', and . within minutes of taking the drug he felt 'everything had changed'. He went . on to experience months of mental health problems, including insomnia, paranoia . and psychosis. Brackenridge . now faces being banned from the profession after being found guilty of failing . to properly explain the risks of the drug and gain his patient's informed consent. His . website 'failed to set out a single risk' associated with the drug, which is . banned in a number of countries, said panel chairman Dr Jack Crane. 'The panel . considered there to be an obligation upon you, as a registered medical . practitioner, to set out a balanced view of the risks and benefits associated . with the use of Ibogaine,' he said. 'This is . particularly important because the drug is unlicensed.' Brackenridge ran a . website offering the controversial medicine and promised it could cure drug and . alcohol addiction, the hearing has been told. Patient A first visited Dr Brackenridge at his Harley Street Clinic in February 2009 and paid £100 per counselling session and £1,900 for the Ibogaine . But the . medicine, which is derived from the root of an African plant, has been banned . in a number of countries (see box below) after being linked to patient deaths and has a . worrying catalogue of side effects. Patient A . first visited Dr Brackenridge at his Harley Street Clinic in February 2009 for . a porn addiction, and paid £100 per counselling session and £1,900 for the . Ibogaine. The addict . would watch hours and hours of internet pornography every night and could not . stop himself from doing so despite knowing it was unhealthy and that he was . 'hooked'. He was not . told of risks including insomnia, vomiting, cardiac arrest and serious allergic . reactions before being given the drug in Brackenridge's home. The medic . only gave him a consent form listing previously unmentioned side effects just . before administering the drug on August 1, 2009. Patient A . said: 'I was hallucinating, seeing things inside the eye of my mind and then I . didn't know where I was and didn't know what time it was. 'It was . horrible, I was panicking. I started having convulsions. 'My chest . was all over the place, I couldn't control it. After a while, it felt like my . heart was slowing down. It was . total hell really.' Giving evidence, Brackenridge claimed the treatment is . 'actually very safe', and could provide patients with a 'deeper experience' and . a 'window of freedom from that addiction'. Ibogaine (seen above in powdered form) is an extract of the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga, a relative of the coffee plant. In West . Africa, it is a well-known hallucinogen used in male rites of passage. The drug is also used as a tool by hunters to increase awareness and allows them to . remain very still for long periods. Its . current legal status in the UK, and much of the rest of the world, is . that of an unlicensed, experimental medication, and it is not therefore an . offence to possess it, though to act as a distributor may be . breaking the law. Ibogaine is a restricted substance (possession is . illegal) in some countries, including the U.S., Switzerland, Denmark, . Sweden and Belgium. The medic . said he had been prescribing the drug for about a year and insisted that . 'practically all' of 19 deaths associated with it had been caused by other . medical ailments. He said: . 'It has been used for centuries by traditional people who tend to avoid . poisonous things that are harmful. 'Also, it . has been used by French and German workers in Africa, and it has been . prescribed in Europe since the early part of the last century as a . neuromuscular stimulant. 'There . isn't a licensed alternative for this.' Brackenridge was found to have failed . to state that Ibogaine was an unlicensed drug and to set out possible risks in . a website advertising treatment with the drug. The medic . admitted that he did not discuss alternative treatments that were licensed in . the UK, and did not inform the patient's GP about the treatment. He further . failed to explain the risks adequately to Patient A before handing him a . consent form to sign on August 1, just before treatment began. It meant . Brackenridge did not ensure that the addict understood the risks involved in . the treatment prior to prescribing the drug, and did not obtain his informed . consent, the panel ruled. 'The panel . notes that the risks set out on the consent form are almost exclusively . physical in nature,' said Dr Crane. 'The panel . noted from the documentation provided that there may be psychological risks . associated with treatment with Ibogaine. 'Patient A denied being made . aware of some of these risks, both physical and psychological. 'The panel . found that you had failed to ensure that patient A understood these risks. Brackenridge . also inappropriately treated patient A at his home address on 1 August 2009, as . it did not have facilities for a 'medical or psychiatric emergency which could . have arisen' the panel ruled. The medic . was cleared of 'acting inappropriately' by 'laughing at and belittling' the . patient and dismissing his concerns he might lose his job, as the panel said . there was not enough evidence to support the charges. He was . also cleared of refusing to allow his mother to attend a session, which the . panel accepted would not be good practice. But . Brackenridge was found to have inappropriately refused to meet with Patient A's . parents, who were waiting outside his house, after a consultation on October . 12, 2009. 'By October 12, 2009, there had been a clear deterioration in Patient A's mental health . of which you were aware,' said Dr Crane. 'The . parents had serious concerns regarding their son's wellbeing to which you . should have listened.' T . he panel must now decide if the doctor is fit to . continue practising unrestricted. The . hearing continues.","Australian-trained physician had claimed he would float in a 'dreamlike state' after taking Ibogaine .

At a press conference on Wednesday the FBI showed how the celebrities, more 50 in total and many still anonymous, were hacked in six steps . 'It helps get out the message that . cyber-hacking is a real threat,' said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte, who . called those who engage in such activity as 'scum.'

'virtually instantaneously,' to an email account he controlled, . according to an indictment handed up Tuesday by a federal grand jury in . Los Angeles. He allegedly used the hacker names . 'trainreqsuckswhat,' ''anonygrrl' and 'jaxjaguars911,' and also used the . victims' identities to illegally access and control computers. Celebrities who agreed to be named in the indictment included Mila Kunis, Christina Aguilera and lesser known actress Renee Olstead, who has a role on TV show The Secret Life of the American Teenager . Chaney . is accused of damaging email servers that caused losses of at least . $5,000 per instance. Authorities wouldn't say whether . Chaney was able to access email accounts via cell phones, but he was . able to figure out secure passwords to various celebrity accounts . through information that had been made public. A message seeking comment was left on . an answering machine for a Christopher Chaney in Jacksonville. There . was no answer at a telephone listing for another Christopher Chaney.

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 9:12 AM on 12th October 2011 . When Zachary Huxtable was born last week his parents were expecting a bundle of joy - but perhaps not such a large one. For the baby boy tips the scales at 13lb 11oz - making him one of the biggest babies to be born in Britain. The five-day-old is more than twice the average weight of a newborn baby and is wearing clothes that would normally fit a 6-9 month old. Big boy: Zachary Huxtable held by his mother Rosie Hall. He was born at Birmingham Women's Hospital . His mother Rosie Hall delivered him naturally with only a little gas and air at the end of her nine-hour delivery last Thursday at Birmingham Women's Hospital. Midwives at the hospital were so surprised by his size they weighed him twice. His proud dad Matthew Huxtable, 19, said: 'He was off the scale on all of the scans so we knew he was going to be big but we didn't think he would be that big. 'He is wearing clothes for a six to nine-month old. We had to go a buy a load of emergency clothes because all the ones we had didn't fit.' Rosie is no stranger to big babies after she gave birth to the couple's first child, 14-month-old Ellie, who weighed in at 10lb 9oz. The mother went into labour around 9am last Thursday and gave birth at 6.17pm the same day. They are both still recovering in hospital but are due to return home to their home in Smethwick tomorrow. 'We are extremely relieved Zachary is okay and healthy,' she said. 'It's wonderful.' Father Matthew, a mechanic, added: 'He is absolutely huge, the other babies look dinky compared to him.' What a whopper: Zachary is nearly twice as heavy as the average newborn boy . Proud Grandmother Katherine Huxtable, from Bearwood, West Midlands, said big babies ran in the family. 'One of the nurses at the hospital said she had never seen a baby as big in her life,' she said. 'He is absolutely beautiful. He is a wonderful child. He is going to need a reinforced pram.' She continued: 'We are quite a big family, Matthew and Rose are both 6ft and Matthew was 10lb and Rosie was over 9lb.' Full time mother Rosie didn't want pain relief after suffering with her back following an epidural when she had Ellie. Katherine added: 'She was a soldier. She soldiered right the way through. She was in quite a bit of pain but she was really good. She had child bearing hips.' Zachary follows in the large footsteps of Jack Herman who was born in 2007 in Manchester weighing 14lb 8oz. The biggest baby born in the UK is believed to be Guy Carr who was delivered in Cumbria in 1992 weighing 15lb 8oz. The biggest British baby girl was Libby Woods, who was born in March this year weighing 12lbs 8oz.",Zachary nearly twice average size of a newborn .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 10:18 AM on 13th October 2011 . A nurse was allowed to force-feed her baby daughter to death under the noses of social workers who believed she was ‘concerned’ for her child. Gloria Dwomoh, 31, faces jail after being found guilty yesterday of killing ten-month-old baby Diamond by pouring food into her lungs from a milk jug. The disturbing case is the first of its kind in Britain and doctors nationwide are being warned about the dangers of force-feeding. Tragic: Gloria Dwomoh, a picture of baby Diamond, circled, and two of her children - faces obscured to protect their identity . The Old Bailey heard how social workers, doctors and police missed a series of opportunities to save Diamond’s life. The blunders included: . Guilty: Dwomoh was convicted of causing or allowing the death of her daughter . An independent review of the case . also found officials did not realise the Ghanaian mother was obsessed . with the weight and size of her children. It said health workers were ‘inexperienced’ at dealing with force-feeding and under-estimated the danger to the new baby. Baby Diamond died in a London hospital after fragments of food in her lungs triggered a bout of pneumonia in March last year. Detectives . from Scotland Yard’s child abuse command were brought in when a . post-mortem examination revealed she may have been force-fed for up to . six months. The pathologist who examined her body told police he had ‘never seen so much food’ in the lungs of a dead child before. Dwomoh . admitted using the spout of a small china milk jug to hold baby . Diamond’s tiny mouth open to tip in food as she weaned her. She . fed her baby rice, African corn porridge and chicken soup up to three . times a day at their home in Waltham Forest, East London. The . nurse admitted that her baby often vomited after being fed, but said it . did not worry her because her other children had been the same. She . insisted the feeding technique was ‘entirely perfect’ because she had . seen it being used in Ghana, adding she also used a syringe to feed her . baby milk. Dwomoh, pictured in court in an artist's impression with her husband who was found not guilty, had wept in court after denying harming her baby . She told the . court: ‘I was scared – I come from a place where children don’t eat and . they starve and they die, and I don’t want my child to starve and die.’ But experts are convinced Diamond must have been obviously distressed, choking and spluttering as the torture continued. Dwomoh, . a committed Christian, travelled to Britain in 2000 to study fashion . but switched to nursing before being granted indefinite leave to remain. She . was suspended from her job at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, where her . duties included feeding terminally ill patients, as police uncovered a . history of abuse. They . found she had been confronted about force-feeding her other children, . now aged between five and nine, as far back as 2006 and 2007. She . blamed her senile 68-year-old mother, who cared for them for long . periods in Ghana during their early years. But officials still failed to . act after doctors sparked a formal child-protection inquiry when she . went to hospital to give birth to Diamond in 2009. One . medic spotted that Dwomoh’s youngest daughter had a mouth injury that . later required plastic surgery. Investigators concluded it was caused by . the rough rim of a plastic cup as she was force-fed. Officials . found all three siblings suffered breathing difficulties, growth . problems and were left so traumatised by force-feeding that they were . scared to eat. Police later realised the nurse had a dangerous obsession with food. Neighbours . said she was always cooking and she was counselled by a psychologist in . an attempt to get to the bottom of her desire to constantly feed the . children. Just 24 hours . before her death, Diamond was examined by a GP who diagnosed her with . ringworm but said she had no other injuries or symptoms of pneumonia. Laura . Eades, of the Waltham Forest Safeguarding Children Board, admitted . there were ‘weaknesses and shortcomings’ in the work of the authorities. She insisted Diamond’s death was ‘not predictable’ but added that if proper procedures had been followed she may not have died. As Judge Brian Barker QC remanded Dwomoh in custody after the three-week trial, he said it was a ‘very disturbing case’. Dwomoh . was convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, which . carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years. She will be sentenced next . month.","Hospital worker was 'obsessed with daughter's weight' and poured food into her mouth .
Infant died from pneumonia caused from meat and cereal found in her lungs .
Knowing that all three of Dwomoh’s older children suffered similar abuse and serious health problems as a result of inhaling food; .
Failing to follow up a warning at least four years before the baby’s death that the shocking practice should stop; .
Being ‘insufficiently sensitive’ to the ‘significance of cultural values’ attached to eating in the family; .
A belief that Dwomoh’s actions were motivated by genuine concern for her baby; and .
Failure to intervene even after doctors realised one of her other children needed plastic surgery to repair a force-feeding injury."
"By . Leon Watson . Last updated at 5:31 PM on 13th September 2011 . They targeted her in a creepy, stalker-themed online advertising stunt - but now the joke is on them. Toyota and Saatchi & Saatchi are being sued for $10 million after marketeers launched a prank campaign of terror against an unsuspecting woman. Amanda Duick, from California, first filed papers against the car-maker and ad agency two years ago over the intrusive 'Your Other You' campaign. Creepy: A scene from the Toyota advert that 'freaked out' Miss Duick . Now a court in the U.S has ruled the defendants' claim that she unknowingly agreed to the whole thing was invalid. Miss Duick's nightmare started when she began receiving frightening e-mails day after day from a strange man. The man had her home address and appeared to be a 25-year-old beer-guzzling English football hooligan. He told her he was on the run from the law and needed to hide out at her place with his pit bull Trigger. But 'Sebastian Bowler' was in fact a fictional character made up by advertising staff. He even had a MySpace page which advertising staff purporting to be him sent to the terrified Miss Duick. Bowler told the prank victim he was on a cross-country road trip and would be at her house in a few days. After . Bowler wrote that he'd run into some trouble at a motel, Duick received . an e-mail from someone purporting to be manager of the motel. It included a bill and said Miss Duick was responsible for a TV Bowler had smashed. Duick then 'freaked out' over the e-mails before she received a message directing her to a video explaining she'd been pranked. The . video revealed Bowler was a fictional character, and the whole thing . had been part of an ad campaign for Toyota's Matrix car. Unknown to Duick, someone had signed her up for the campaign at YourOtherYou.com, a web site set up for the prank. Frightening: A picture posted on MySpace of 'Sebastian Bowler' the fictional football fan who threatening to visit Miss Duick . The campaign was aimed at . 20-something males because Toyota's advertising firm, Saatchi & . Saatchi LA, believed men of that age like to prank their friends. Anyone signing up could choose one of five fictional characters – among them a heavy metal fanatic and a football hooligan. The character would then barrage the designated friend with text messages, phone calls, e-mails and videos for five days. The . aim was to freak out the friend by making him or her think the stranger . possessed personal information about the target - phone number, home . address - and was on his way to visit. Saatchi . & Saatchi made sure the deception was complete by going so far as . to create online personas for the fictional characters, including a band . web page for the heavy metal fanatic. The agency even recorded an album for the fictional character's fictional band. Saatchi . creative director Alex Flint said about the campaign in 2008: 'Even . when you get several stages in, it's still looking pretty real. 'I think even the most cynical, anti-advertising guy will appreciate the depth and length to which we've gone.' Messing with their heads: Toyota's online advertising campaign tried to prank people . Campaign of terror: The 'Your Other You' marketing campaign tried to tap into what you males think is funny . Miss . Duick however sued Toyota and Saatchi & Saatchi and fifty . individuals associated with the campaign for intentional infliction of . emotional distress; unfair, unlawful, and deceptive trade practices; and . negligent misrepresentation. She is seeking $10 million in compensatory damages. Toyota . tried to dismiss the suit, insisting that an online terms-of-service . agreement that Miss Duick had clicked on authorised the company to send . her the e-mails and included a provision that any disputes over the . campaign would have to be handled through arbitration. But . a California Appellate judge ruled that Toyota had enticed Miss Duick . to click on the agreement under false pretenses, thus invalidating the . arbitration provision. According . to the suit, after Duick's friend signed her up to participate in the . campaign without her knowledge, she received an e-mail with a link to a . web site where she was invited to have a personality evaluation. Duick . clicked on the agreement, which made only vague references to an . 'interactive experience' and a 'digital experience,' thinking she had . signed up for a personality test. She then began receiving the disturbing e-mails from 'Bowler'. The . court ruled that the terms-of-service were void due to 'fraud in the . inception' and the defendants 'misrepresented and concealed (whether . intentionally or not) the true nature of the conduct to which Duick was . to be subjected'.","Amanda Duick is now suing car maker for $10million .

A woman who faces life in prison for allegedly drugging her husband before cutting off his penis with a kitchen knife and grinding it up in a garbage disposal reportedly told police, 'he deserved it'. Catherine Kieu, 48, is said to have made her 60-year-old husband dinner at their California home earlier this month and put a poison or drug in the food to make him pass out. When he woke up, he was tied to a bed and could not move while his wife took a 10 inch knife to his genitalia before throwing the organ into the garbage disposal and turning it on, police said. On Friday Mrs Kieu pleaded not guilty to aggravated mayhem as Orange County Superior Court Judge Debra Carrillo set bail at $1million. The couple, who married in late 2009, were involved in divorce proceedings and the horrific attack followed an argument over the husband having a male friend around friend to stay at the house, according to prosecutors. Kieu appeared briefly in a blue jail jumpsuit, with chains . rattling as she walked. Her long dark hair blocked portions of her face, . and she answered Carrillo's questions through a Vietnamese-language . interpreter. Hiding: Catherine Kieu hid her face behind her hair as she appeared in court . Behind bars: Kieu faces life in prison if found guilty and given the maximum sentence . She is charged with torture and aggravated mayhem, with sentencing enhancements for great bodily injury and use of a knife. If convicted of all counts, she could face life in prison without parole. Frank Bittar, Kieu's attorney, declined to comment on the allegations, except to say 'there's a lot there, to the case - more than meets the eye.' Authorities were called to the . couple's home in Garden Grove, just south of Los Angeles, after Kieu . called 911 reporting a medical emergency. Kieu, who works as a real estate . broker, told officers who found her husband tied to the . bed and bleeding from the groin that he 'deserved it'. She had blood spattered on her legs and shirt when authorities arrived, according to court documents. The man was rushed to the University of . California-Irvine Medical Center in Orange where he underwent emergency . surgery. The severed organ could not be reattached. The husband told police she served . him a tofu dinner which tasted 'metallic' and he went to bed at about 9pm feeling tired. Prison: Kieu is being held at Orange County jail charged with poisoning and spousal abuse . While . he was sleeping, Kieu 'tied the victim’s legs and arms to the four . corners of the bed with nylon ropes', prosecutors said. The victim told authorities that when . he woke up, Kieu pulled his pants 'grabbing the victim’s penis and . severing it with a knife'. Kieu then took the penis to the kitchen and . threw it in the garbage disposal, 'turning it on, and mutilating the . organ'. In 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband's penis in Virginia and . threw it out of her car window into a field on the side of the road.

We thought this would be fun. Instead, it’s a nightmare' Lost woman . Mr Connor said they were the first family to get stuck in the maze this year - and the farm will put a mark at the point where they got lost. ‘We designed the maze for people to get lost but it’s all about family fun and it’s unfortunate that the family got stuck,’ Mr Connor told ABC. Farm staff don’t leave the site until every visitor has found their way out, he said. The couple paid around $15 to walk through the maze. Challenging: Utah-based company the Maize designed the Connors Farm maze and a spokesman said it takes the average person 45 minutes to get out . Utah-based company the Maize designed the Connors Farm maze and a spokesman said it takes the average person 45 minutes to get out. But marketing director Kamille Combs told the Los Angeles Times she had never heard of police rescuing someone from a corn maze.

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 5:19 AM on 12th October 2011 . The mother of a 10-month-old girl reported missing last week is preparing for her 'inevitable' arrest as police run out of leads, according to her fiancé's sister. Crews spent hours on Tuesday emptying and then searching a 36ft well at an abandoned home in the Kansas City, Missouri neighbourhood where baby Lisa Irwin was reported missing, but once again authorities came up empty-handed. Ashley Irwin, who is the aunt of the missing baby, said Deborah Bradley is getting ready to be taken into custody and charged in connection with her baby's disappearance. Scroll down for video . Parents: Police are searching a well a few blocks from the home of Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley . Dozens of officials swarmed the vacant home on Tuesday to search the well . Ms Bradley is engaged to Jeremy Irwin, but is still married to deployed Army member Sean Bradley, Ashley Irwin told ABC News. Neither parent has been named as a . suspect, but Ms Bradley has said police told her she failed a lie . detector test. They did not show her paperwork supporting that claim, . however. Criticising the investigation, Ashley Irwin told ABC: 'It's what the police do. They don't have any leads so they just have to pin it on somebody.' Ms Irwin said she thinks the police are spending more time investigating the family rather than looking for viable suspects. She added that she has no doubt . that that neither her brother Jeremy Irwin or Ms Bradley has anything to . do with Lisa's disappearance. 'Anybody who spends any time with . them, you know it's not true - she's genuine - she loves that child. It's her baby … she would never anything to hurt her,' she told ABC . News. 'She doesn't care what happens to . her, she doesn't care what people say about her, she doesn't care what . people think about her, all she cares about it getting Lisa home.' Missing: It is a week since 10-month-old Lisa Irwin has last been seen . Disappeared: Police have been asking neighbours if they have seen a homeless man in his twenties riding a bicycle in the area as they search for clues to help find missing Lisa . Ms Irwin's comments came as . authorities searched a drainage ditch behind the parents' home - among . the more elaborate efforts authorities have made in their search for . baby Lisa. Her parents reported her missing . after her father got home from work about 4am October 4. Deborah Bradley . and Jeremy Irwin said a window on their home had been tampered with, . and they believe someone abducted their daughter while Bradley and the . couple's two sons slept nearby. Police have searched the couple's . home, nearby wooded areas, an industrial park, landfills and sewers. They've checked out more than 300 tips, including at least one report of . suspicions about a couple with a child near Lisa's age. Authorities said the house that . stood on the same property had already been condemned, and about an hour . after the search ended, wrecking crews came in, demolished it and . carted the pieces away in dump trucks. A caller had suggested police . search the property. 'There was no reason not to search . it,' said Captain Steve Young, spokesman for the Kansas City Police . Department. 'We did everything we could to check it out, and there was . nothing there. And we're moving on to the next lead.' None of their efforts have turned up any clues, and they still have no suspects, they said on Tuesday. The search of the abandoned . property came a day after a court ordered Kansas City television . stations to submit all footage of interviews with the girl's family and . friends. Helping with enquiries: The parents of missing 10-month old Lisa Irwin, Jeremy Irwin, right, and Deborah Bradley, are reportedly co-operating with police again . Gone: Lisa Irwin reportedly went missing from her parents home in Kansas City last week . Grand jury subpoenas from Clay . County Circuit Court were sent late on Monday to at least four network . affiliates in Kansas City, according to their websites. The subpoenas . asked the television stations to submit 'all footage, including raw . footage of any interviews or statements given by neighbours, family or . friends of the family, regarding missing baby, Lisa Irwin.' The subpoenas, which were . requested by the Clay County prosecutor's office, ordered at least two . of the stations to appear with the footage in court on October 18. Jim Roberts, a spokesman for the . prosecutor's office, said the subpoenas were needed to prevent . broadcasters from destroying video they might otherwise discard because . it could be needed later. The subpoenas were issued by a sitting grand . jury, not one called specifically for this case. Bryan McGruder, vice-president for . news at WDAF, said the station would provide all footage it had aired . about the case. But he said the station would not hand over raw footage . because workers 'routinely recycle what we use.' R Michael Cassidy, a professor at . Boston College Law School, said investigators may want the footage to . find inconsistencies in the parents' accounts of their daughter's . disappearance. 'It could mean that they have one . or both of the parents as suspects, and they are developing evidence of . everything they said in the past and prior to the arrest,' Cassidy said . Tuesday. 'To show that someone's story has shifted over time can also be . very damning. Neighbours said yesterday that . police have been questioning the parents about a homeless man in his . twenties, who was seen riding a red bike in the area. Police also may want the footage . to review 'the landscape around the house,' shortly after the . disappearance was reported, Cassidy said. 'It could be that these visuals of the immediate area are important,' he said.

"By . Paul Harris and Inderdeep Bains . Last updated at 3:19 PM on 12th October 2011 . They had sprayed champagne, talked excitedly about a shopping list of cars and mansions and made generous promises to help friends in need. But as Dave and Angie Dawes were flown away by helicopter after being unveiled as ecstatic £101million Lottery winners, a  rather less jolly picture emerged. Not everyone, it seems, is lining up to wish them well. Angie’s ex-husband, John Leeman, could barely contain his anger as he claimed she had left him and her son with £20,000 of debts after having a secret affair with Mr Dawes. Sweet and sour: Dave and Angie Dawes' celebrations were marred by allegations that she had thrown her husband and son out of the family home after a string of affairs . Jackpot winners: Dave and Angela Dawes, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, hold their £101million cheque. The couple are not married but plan to tie the knot next year . And her teenage son Steven claimed his mother abandoned him when she walked out on the family to start a new life. Mr Leeman, married to her for 12 . years until the alleged affair was exposed, told the Daily Mail last . night: ‘She’s talking about making 20 of her friends millionaires – but . what about her son?’ The bitter allegations surfaced . within hours of the couple starring at a press conference to tell the . world that Mr Dawes’s single line of numbers in the EuroMillions lottery . had scooped the massive prize. They spoke of their plans to buy a . new engagement ring to replace the £800 model Miss Dawes already has. Marriage plans: Angela Dawes wears her . engagement ring, right, at the news conference. Her partner, who has the . word 'hate' on his knuckles, left, is planning on buying her a new one . with their £101m winnings . Humble: Dave and Angela Dawes share a one bedroom £70 per week flat in this block in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire . Then a house in Chelsea for Mr Dawes, within walking distance of the . factory worker’s beloved team’s Stamford Bridge ground. Hurt: Steven Leeman claims his mother abandoned him when she walked out on the family . They also hope to buy a home in . Portugal, where they plan to marry next year in a ceremony which Miss . Dawes said would be a ‘bit more glamorous now’. Then came gifts for friends. ‘We’ve . drawn up a list of about 15 to 20 people that we’re going to sort of . make millionaires,’ said Dave, in much the same tone as someone . distributing a couple of fivers from of his wallet. ‘Anyone that’s . helped us through our life.’ The winning line was a selection of randomly chosen numbers and the ticket was bought from WH Smith in Market Place in Wisbech. He . told the press conference in Hatfield Heath, Hertfordshire: 'We were . watching TV and the EuroMillions draw show came on so we kept watching, . not thinking we would win anything. 'We got our tickets out and watched in shock as, one by one, the numbers came up on the line I'd chosen. 'We couldn't believe it! It was too . late to call Camelot so I kept the ticket on me all night until the . morning but we didn't sleep a wink.' But Back home in Wisbech, . Cambridgeshire, where the couple shared a £70 a week one-bedroom flat, . the bile was already beginning to surface. Last night Miss Dawes released a . statement saying she was saddened by her ex-husband’s claims and that . she loved her son and would like to rebuild their relationship. Mr Leeman, a lorry driver, accused . his 43-year-old ex-wife of ‘abandoning’ their son Steven after . conducting a secret affair with her lover in the family home. Up and away! The £101m jetsetters plan to holiday in Las Vegas before tying the knot in Portugal next year . Big winners: Dave plans to buy Angela a new engagement ring before they tie the knot next year. She changed her surname to Dawes after getting divorced . Shopping spree: Dave and Angela are planning to buy properties in London and abroad, and are looking forward to a trip to Las Vegas and a skiing holiday in Switzerland in the coming months . Big winners: Dave and Angela's windfall catapults them into 703rd place in the UK's rich list . Mr Leeman said he returned home one night to find his clothes thrown outside in bags. Steven, now 17, claimed when he  had . arrived hom from a school trip to France he found his father had gone. When he asked his mother where he was, he claimed:  ‘She packed my bags . and told me if I didn’t like it I should go’. While the couple have been catapulted up the rich list they are only Britain's third biggest jackpot winners. Colin and Chris Weir (pictured), from Largs, Scotland, won £161m in July while another single ticket holder collected £113m a year ago. The biggest ever win was £195million won in 2002 by Andrew Whittaker, from West Virginia. Elaine and Harold Messner from New Jersey shared the world’s largest lottery prize of £250m when they won the Mega Millions draw in March 2007. However, the prize was shared further with an anonymous truck driver from Georgia. A single ticket claimed by eight co-workers from a Nebraska meat processing plant won £234m in February 2006. Larry and Nancy Ross from Michigan and Joe and Sue Kainz from Illinois shared the £232m jackpot from The Big Game in May 2000. A £154m Mega Millions prize pool was shared by two winners from Georgia and New Jersey in January 2011. Mr Leeman accused his ex-wife, who . had told reporters of her work at a British Heart Foundation shop, of . ‘preaching on TV about doing charity work’. He added:  ‘I don’t want her . money, but I want her to do right by her son. ‘Angela loved going out clubbing and drinking, having a child just got in the way of her fun. ‘During his school holidays, she . would force me to take Steven in the lorry with me so he would be out of . the way when she went out to have fun. ‘She has neglected her own son very . badly. It is not right. She needs to recognise her son, rather than . trying to change her identity in the way she has. Instead she is rubbing . this in our faces.’ Miss Dawes, who has changed her name . to that of her fiance, said: ‘I’m saddened by these reports - a lot of . what has been said since my divorce has been untrue and very hurtful. ‘I’ve always wanted to be in contact with my son, who I love dearly, and very much still want to rebuild our relationship.’ The . biggest ever EuroMillions prize won in Britain was a £161million . jackpot won by Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in Scotland, back in . July. The second largest was claimed by a . single ticket-holder, who chose to remain anonymous after scooping £113m . in October last year. The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May. In . February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, . broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest . prize in the history of EuroMillions. The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. The millionaires will now be able to . buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted . timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each. Or they could treat themselves to 720 . pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 . diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie. They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000. For a party to celebrate the win, they could easily afford Barbadian singer Rihanna, who charges £500,000 for a performance. But . if they wish to avoid long-lost family members who are no doubt set to . come out of the woodwork, the winners could escape to their own private . island, such as £100million Rangyai near Phuket in Thailand. The 110-acre private island boasts white beaches as well as tropical forests. Additional reporting: Andrew Levy .","Dave and Angie Dawes have drawn up a list of 15 close friends to give cash .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:42 PM on 28th September 2011 . A man who killed a teenager by shunting his car off the road with his sports car in a revenge attack for eggs being thrown at his brother's restaurant has been jailed for 12 years. Abid Kwaik, 38, deliberately rammed his Honda NSX into 19-year-old Shenol Ahmet's car because he blamed the victim and his two friends for throwing the eggs, the court heard. Mr Ahmet suffered massive injuries in the collision and died four days later in hospital. Abid Kwaik, left, rammed the Fiesta driven by 19-year-old Shenol Ahmet, right, off the road with his Honda sports car because he blamed him and two of his friends for throwing eggs at his brother's London restaurant . A Honda NSX similar to this model was used by Kwaik to ram the Fiesta off the road . Front seat passenger Corey Holliday, then 18, received serious head injuries and spent five months in a coma. He now requires round-the-clock treatment. Rear seat passenger Luke Hall, also 18 at the time, suffered several broken bones in the collision on November 8, 2009. The court heard that Kwaik was said to have hunted down . the teenagers in the car after they pelted the Sahara Lounge in . Stanmore, north-west London, with eggs from the windows of their Fiesta. The incident is believed to have been a random act of vandalism. Kwaik then chased the teenagers for more than a mile. As the two vehicles reached The Common, Kwaik pulled alongside Mr Ahmet and rammed his car up against its side. Mr Ahmet lost control of the Fiesta, which spun in the road and careered down a verge into a tree. Prosecutor . Duncan Penny said: 'Through the way that he furiously drove his vehicle . after them and ultimately into the Fiesta he was effectively using his . car as a weapon.' Kwaik was convicted of manslaughter and two counts of unlawful wounding by a jury at Southwark Crown Court. Passing sentence Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Kwaik: 'By that unlawful act you caused the death of one young man and you caused the most serious injuries to another young man, rendering him into a state where he cannot exist without full time care and where recovering from his severe brain injuries is unlikely. The Sahara Lounge restaurant in Stanmore, north-west London, which the teenagers pelted with eggs, in what was believed to be an act of vandalism . 'You used your vehicle as a weapon, intending that the other vehicle should lose control. You had a persistent flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and . complete disregard for the great danger being caused to those three . young men.’ The Judge said that the throwing of eggs went no way towards mitigating the gravity of his offence. Mr . Hall told the court: 'As the Honda carried on pushing our car started . sliding to the right. The Honda carried on pushing and then our car . started going to the other side of the road. 'Our car was facing the trees and his car would have been in line with our back right wheel. 'I do not remember seeing it leave the road, I just remember going close to the tress and then everything went black.' Giving evidence, Kwaik told the court he had chased after the car because he wanted to get the registration number. He claimed that the crash happened as he tried to overtake Mr Ahmet because he was frightened of being attacked by the occupants of a car following him. Kwaik was convicted of manslaughter and two counts of unlawful wounding. He was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter with five years and three year concurrent sentences for the two counts of unlawful wounding. Judge Pegden also banned Kwaik from driving for ten years.","19-year-old died after his car was forced off road and into a tree .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:13 PM on 12th October 2011 . Burma began to free prominent dissidents today at the start of a general amnesty for more than six thousand prisoners. It was not clear how many of the . country's estimated 2,000 political detainees were included in the . amnesty - one estimate said 155 of them were freed. But the . released included ailing Shan Army commander Hso Hten and comedian . Zarganar, who was imprisoned after criticising the government's response . to Cyclone Nargis in 2008. Amnesty: Women walk free from Insein Prison near Rangoon after President Thein Sein issued an amnesty for 6,359 prisoners yesterday . Zarganar said after his release: 'I will be happy and I will thank the . government only when all of my friends are freed.' Those still held include student leaders . from the failed 1988 democracy uprising in Burma, also known as Myanmar. Western governments, the UN and Burma's opposition have eagerly awaited a broad political amnesty as a gesture of liberalisation by the elected government after decades of harsh military rule. Free at last: Comedian and political prisoner Zaganar, who was freed from Myitkyina prison in northern Burma, at Rangoon airport after his release today . Jubilant: Released prisoners make their way through the crowd as they leave Insein Prison near Rangoon . A failure to follow through could hamper the country's efforts to improve its human rights record and have Western economic and political sanctions lifted. Relatives and freed prisoners held emotional reunions with loved ones around the country a day after the new civilian president declared an amnesty for 6,359 inmates - many of them ordinary criminals - on humanitarian grounds, but without disclosing any names. Joyful: Aung San Suu Kyi speaks to the families of political prisoners in Rangoon as 155 dissidents are released. Right, a freed prisoner embraces his weeping mother outside Insein prison . Pro-democracy campaigner and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, herself released from 15 years of house arrest last November, said: 'The freedom of each individual is invaluable, but I wish that all political prisoners would be released.' Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy confirmed the release of 155 political detainees, including members of her party, spokesman Nyan Win said. But other dissidents could have been freed from remote prisons without having contacted anyone yet. President Thein Sein, a retired senior army officer who took office in March, has launched a series of economic reforms and eased limits on freedom of speech by relaxing censorship and unblocking banned websites. He also has started a dialogue with Suu Kyi, made calls for peace with Shan ethnic minority rebel groups and suspended a controversial China-backed hydropower dam project after a public outcry. Amnesty International called the prisoner release a 'minimum first step'. Hso Hten, the released Shan Army commander, was serving a 106-year prison sentence for high treason following his arrest in 2005. The Shan are a repressed minority within Burma who have been enganged in conflict with the Burmese government for decades. It was initially thought that Ashin Gambira, a young charismatic Buddhist monk who was among the leaders of the September 2007 anti-government uprising, had been freed but it transpired that he was still in prison. Walk to freedom: Women clutching their possessions leave the gates of Insein Prison, many were held for years without hope of release . Family joy: Relatives of prisoners wait outside Insein Prison following the announcement that inmates were set to be released . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton, speaking to Reuters, said she was encouraged by 'promising . signals' of political reform but it was too early to announce any steps . Washington might take in response. The . United States, Europe and Australia have said freeing an estimated . 2,100 political prisoners in Burma is essential to even considering . lifting sanctions that have crippled the pariah state and, over years, . driven it closer to China. Free at last: Prisoners take their first steps of freedom today from the men's jail at Insein near Rangoon . Relief: Prisoners show their emotion as they are let out from the gated prison . Day they never thought would come: Men are marched out of Insein prison, just 24 hours after the announcement that more than 6,000 prisoners would be given amnesty . Mrs Clinton said: 'We're encouraged by the steps we see the . government taking... we're going to take them at their word. 'But we want to see actions. And if they are going to release political prisoners that would be a very positive sign.' Previous general amnesties have . included only a token number of political prisoners but there was optimism this time as the Burmese government seeks to . distance itself from China and makes overtures to the West. The army nominally handed over power . in March to civilians after elections in November, a process ridiculed . at the time as a sham to cement authoritarian rule behind a democratic . facade. Nevertheless, President Thein Sein, the first civilian head of state in half a century, . has initiated overtures including calls to win over ethnic . minorities. The new national human rights . commission called on the president in an open letter published in state . media on Tuesday to free prisoners who did not pose 'a threat to the . stability of state and public tranquillity'. Zarganar , 49, was imprisoned after speaking out against the official response to cyclone Nargis in 2008, which left more than 140,000 people dead. He is celebrated for his films, plays and poetry and even dubbed the comedy Dalai Lama. But even though he was imprisoned 900 miles away from his family in Myitkyina prison in Rangoon in 2010 a brief poem penned by him was passed to a friend. It read: 'It's lucky my forehead is flat/Since my arm must often rest there/Beneath it shines a light I must invite/From a moon I cannot see/In Myitkyina.' This was the forth time the comedian had been imprisoned . He had always insisted humour would prevail: 'Burmese people love to laugh. If I can’t speak, jokes will still spread. People will make them up themselves.' The . open letter marks a significant shift in the former British colony where authorities have long refused to recognise . the existence of political prisoners, usually dismissing such detainees . as common criminals. The government has faced pressure for . change on multiple fronts, from the need . to find alternatives to China in the face of popular resentment of its . influence, to growing frustration in Southeast Asia over Burma's . isolation as the region approaches an EU-style Asian community in 2015. Diplomats . say other factors play into its desire to open up, include a need . for technical assistance from the World Bank and other multilateral . institutions which cut off ties years ago in response to abuses of human rights. Nestled . strategically between the powerhouses of India and China, Burma has been one . of the world's most difficult destinations for investors, restricted by . sanctions, blighted by half a century of oppressive military rule and . starved of capital despite rich natural resources, from gems to timber . to oil. The country's infrastructure is in . shambles and its economy has few sources of growth beyond investment . from China and Thailand. About 30 per cent of its 50 million people live . in poverty, according to UN data. Some analysts say Burma also wants to show the United States that it is independent of China. Last week, the government suspended a £2.3billion Chinese-led dam project, a victory for . supporters of Suu Kyi and a sign the country was willing to yield to . popular resentment over China's growing influence. These . moves have fuelled hopes the new parliament will slowly open the . country that just over 50 years ago was one of Southeast Asia's . wealthiest as the world's biggest rice exporter and a major energy . producer. In Tokyo, a foreign ministry official . said Japan had resumed some aid to Burma in June after the release of . Suu Kyi and other signs of reform. 'We may continue with this stance if . there are more releases of political prisoners,' the official said. 'Work still needs to be done in terms of democracy but we think they are . moving in the right direction.'","155 political prisoners freed, says Aung San Suu Kyi .

A mentally ill woman accused of stabbing a grandmother to death was previously detained under the Mental Health Act, it was revealed last night. Nicola Edgington, 31, was deemed fit to be freed in September 2009. But that decision is now subject to an urgent Health Service inquiry after it emerged that she tried to get herself sectioned shortly before a rampage in which she is accused of murdering Sally Hodkin, 59, and attempting to kill Kerry Clark, 23. Accused: Nicola Edgington, left, is accused of killing Sally Hodkin, right, in an apparently random attack in Bexleyheath, Kent. She is pictured when she was detained in 2006 . Yesterday the father of one of her . alleged victims told of his anger and astonishment that the suspect . walked out of a mental health unit only an hour before Monday’s . bloodbath. Edgington arrived at the A&E department of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south-east London, at around 5am on Monday. She was referred to a mental health ward, but while nurses were preparing a bed and medication for her, she left. Staff chased after her, but Edgington outran them and is said to have escaped in a taxi at 7am. Within an hour, she had bought a 6in . knife from an Asda store and allegedly attacked Miss Clark, who was . waiting at a bus stop nearby. Killed: Accounts manager Sally Hodkin, pictured centre, was stabbed to death with a cleaver . Miss Clark, an artist, suffered minor . hand injuries as she fought to defend herself. It is claimed Edgington . then dropped the weapon and ran off. Attack: Kerry Clark was injured while she was sat at the bus stop . But minutes later, she is accused of . stealing a 12-inch meat cleaver from a butcher’s shop and hacking to . death Mrs Hodkin, who had just left her £350,000 home in Bexleyheath to . walk to Cunningham Blake solicitors in Blackheath, where she worked as . an accounts manager. The grandmother of two  died after being knifed in the neck. Edgington was arrested at the scene. Yesterday Miss Clark’s father David . said: ‘My daughter had a lucky escape. I cannot believe that woman was . allowed out of hospital.’ The 59-year-old rail supervisor added: . ‘My daughter Kerry was sitting at a bus stop and she saw this woman . coming towards her out of the corner of her eye. ‘The woman pulled a knife  out and . started to attack  her. How can it be that someone like this is allowed . to walk  the streets?  Surely she should  be in hospital. ‘Why is the NHS sending people like this into the community when they are clearly not well?’ Yesterday the petite 5ft 2in suspect . was said to be too ill to attend Greenwich Magistrates Court to answer . charges of murder and attempted murder. Hidden: Edgington is led from the rear of Greenwich Magistrates' Court after her appearance earlier today . Stabbed to death: Mrs Hodkin with her husband, Paul, pictured at a wedding together three years ago . The mother of two, who lives alone in . sheltered accommodation in Greenwich, was described as having ‘extreme’ mental health problems. Psychiatrist Dr Amit Chatterjee told . magistrates: ‘She does have extreme mental health problems. I don’t . think she is fit to attend court in her mental state.’ No plea was entered on Edgington’s behalf. Edgington is the daughter of former Daily Mail Moscow correspondent Harry Edgington. Grieving: Members of Mrs Hodkin's family lay flowers at the scene where she was killed in Bexleyheath . Yesterday a spokesman  for Oxleas NHS . Foundation Trust said she had received treatment in the community in . line with  the conditions of her release  in 2009. He added: ‘Nicola Edgington has been receiving regular treatment from the trust since 2006. ‘She attended A&E at Queen . Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich yesterday at around 5am seeking help and . was transferred to our mental health assessment unit at Oxleas House on . the QEH site. Gathering evidence: Forensics officers surround the scene where Mrs Hodkin was fatally stabbed in south-east London . ‘At Oxleas House she was promptly . assessed. A bed was available and medication was being prepared before . admitting her to a ward on a voluntary basis. ‘At 7am she unexpectedly left the assessment suite. Staff saw her leave and pursued her but were unsuccessful. ‘We are carrying out a full investigation which will look at all of the treatment Nicola received from the trust.’","Nicola Edgington, 31, was deemed fit to be freed in September 2009 .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 4:35 PM on 12th October 2011 . Inmates at a high-security jail have bombarded prison bosses with thousands of trivial complaints about missing DVDs, poor heating and having to share a cell with smokers. Workers at Strangeways, which houses 1,200 prisoners and 200 lifers, were bombarded with 3,500 complaints last year - or almost ten every day. Records show staff have had to deal with hundreds of petty grievances - including one from an inmate who complained that he had not received a television listing magazine. Petty grievances: Staff at HM Prison Manchester have been bombarded with almost 10 complaints a day from inmates in the last year . On another occasion staff were forced to trawl through CCTV footage to find out what had happened to a missing flask. Several complaints were received about the prison heating system, which does not offer in-cell temperature control, details released under Freedom of Information laws revealed. Other grievances raised included cold showers, the quality of meat in the . canteen, a confiscated pen, outstanding DVD orders, dodgy milk, missing . newspapers, sharing cells with smokers and demands for hot chocolate . and extra bread. Staff at the jail - also known as HM Prison Manchester - were also asked to amend the washing powder order after one prisoner requested non-bio because of a skin condition. Other complaints included a problem with gym equipment and a problem with Playstation games, which are available as an incentive to prisoners. Of more than 750 grievances logged in . the first three months of this year, only around 30 were of the most . serious nature, involving issues with or allegations against staff, such . as assault or bullying. Many were found to have no supporting evidence. Two were referred to the police for investigation. Other legitimate grievances involved . transfer requests, appeals over prisoner categorisation or requests to . come off closed visits, where inmates are separated from visitors by . glass. Gripes: Staff had to trawl through CCTV to find out what happened to a missing flask in response to one complaint at HM Prison Manchester . The prison employs a full time clerk . to handle complaints. But many of those logged through official channels . do not require formal handling, said officials. Many of the complaints involved grievances about food and diets - including a mix up over a sausage roll in which the prison had to apologise to an inmate with severe allergies. One of the first complaints of the year came from an inmate who had not received a Christmas card. He was advised that there was no outstanding post. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'Prisoners are expected to raise concerns so their matter can be addressed appropriately. 'The formal complaints system exists so they can raise more important issues. Often topics raised under the complaints system are more appropriate to be dealt with by other means, but are registered as a complaint. 'Issues that can seem quite minor can cause disproportionate concern to prisoners. 'A formal complaints system plays an important part in defusing these concerns.'","Workers at Strangeways forced to deal with 3,500 complaints in a year - or almost ten per DAY .

"By . Arthur Martin . Last updated at 11:07 AM on 30th September 2011 . A High Court judge yesterday warned residents living on Europe’s largest illegal traveller site that they cannot expect to get what they want by breaking the law. The stinging rebuke came as Mr Justice Ouseley presided over the latest legal attempts by travellers to stop the bulldozing of Dale Farm. The news also came as it was revealed the legal battle over Dale Farm has so far cost taxpayers at least £1.6million. 'A lovely turnout': Ladies representing the Dale Farm travellers arrive at the High Court, dressed in black skirts, colourful tops... and carrying Red Bull . Since 2005, Basildon Council has . spent at least £1.41million on court cases, bailiffs and other measures. This does not include officer time additional costs. However, the authority cannot collate its costs for barristers at . numerous public inquiries and enforcement action over the site between . 2001 and 2004 when the problem began. Plans to start the £18million eviction were scuppered when three separate judicial reviews were lodged at the High Court. After a judge gave them a stay of execution earlier this week, inhabitants of the Essex site triumphantly declared they would be still be living there in 30 years. But yesterday Mr Justice Ouseley said: ‘It is not always possible to get what they most want, especially when what they most want is to go on committing a criminal offence.’ He added that the travellers were faced with two options – move into housing, or ‘take risks on the roadside’. He continued: ‘Whatever choice they make cannot be visited on an authority endeavouring to uphold the law.’ One of the applications has been brought by Mary Sheridan, who claims being evicted would be a breach of her human rights. Although Basildon Council has said the travellers can apply for accommodation, her barrister Marc Willers argued that it had an ‘obligation to facilitate the gipsy way of life’. He added that if the case went to the European Court of Human Rights, the travellers were likely to win. But Reuben Taylor, acting for the council, said allowing them to escape eviction would ‘strike to the very principles of the rule of law’. Those who refused to leave 51 illegal plots at six-acre Dale Farm were originally due to be removed on September 19, but bailiffs were blocked by a last-minute injunction. Shades of blonde: Stylish sisters Margaret and Mary McCarthy draw attention to their cause as they pose outside the High Court . I'm ready for my close-up: The Dale Farm Divas were so dressed to impress that there was speculation they could be hoping to star in an offshoot of the reality show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . Even if the latest judicial review applications fail, the travellers are due to return to the High Court next week. They will argue that the council’s plans are ‘over-enforcement’. Meanwhile, the Dale Farm divas were enjoying their 15 minutes of fame as they strode into the High Court for the latest episode in the legal fight to stop travellers being evicted from the site. The power-dressing girls were in London, showing their support in the fight to allow travellers to stay at the camp in Basildon, Essex. The McCarthy sisters - Joanna, 38, Tina, 40, Margaret, 46, Kathleen, 50, and Marie, 55 - attracted the attention of the judge at court last week when they wore matching blue and pink floral-print blouses to show 'solidarity'. Legal fight: Leader of Basildon Council Tony Ball (centre) arrives with other council officials for the hearing . After Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart praised . their 'lovely turnout' and said they 'brightened up the court' last . week, they were back today to show off a wider variety of styles. Indeed they were so dressed to impress that there was speculation they could be hoping to star in an offshoot of the reality show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. Three of them teamed midi-length black skirts in a jersey fabric with colourful tops. The two blondes wore fashionably striped T-shirts - one with a nod to last week's florals - while another was dressed in an pink, ruffled top with black piping and her hair pulled back in a chignon. One was clad in sandals in a nod to the unseasonably fine weather while her two sisters opted for demure Mary-Jane black courts. Another McCarthy fashionista paired black leggings with a black and leopard print top. We mean business (from left to right): Candy Sheridan, Margaret McCarthy and Mary McCarthy gather on the steps of the High Court to talk to the media about their plight . All of them glowed with a healthy tan as the travellers arrived for the latest episode in their decade-long battle with the courts - which has been condemned by some critics as a 'farce' - and which could cost in the region of £18million. And the girls brought a posse of female friends with them - all dressed for the occasion - to show their support for three separate applications for judicial review following the official eviction date last week. Many of the women at court were in bright pink, with one sporting a multicoloured bag, black mini and pink socks peeping over knee-high black boots. Another came in one of the high-impact floral blouses, but toned down the look by throwing a grey cardigan over the outfit. The first challenge today was brought by Irish traveller Mary Sheridan. Her counsel, Marc Willers, said the case had an 'extensive history' but Ms Sheridan was not claiming she should be allowed to stay at Dale Farm 'forever - or indeed for many years, or even a year'. Controversy: The Dale Farm travellers site in Essex. The residents won a temporary reprieve following a 10-year legal battle to evict them . Daily life: Richard and John 'Button' Sheridan, aged 2, play with bubblewrap outside their caravan at Dale Farm seemingly unaware of the court battle over their home . Mr Willers said: 'This claim is . brought on this basis: there is no alternative, suitable accommodation . at this point in time, and it would be disproportionate to be forced to . leave in the absence of such accommodation.' It was not being suggested that Ms . Sheridan felt she had any hope or prospect of being granted planning . permission at Dale Farm in the future. The . judge heard the other claims for judicial review would raise several . other legal issues under human rights legislation and planning law. The hearing is now expected to take at least two days. According to Basildon Council leader Tony Ball, the wheels of justice were 'grinding slowly' but 'going forward'. Sound asleep: Triplet brothers asleep in their shared bed. It was argued there had been no proper consideration of the impact of eviction on children's physical and mental health and emotional well-being . Welfare: It was argued that there had been a failure to give the interests of children, like Gaffer Flynn, 2, living on the site primary importance . He said: 'We will be back in court . tomorrow afternoon and again on Monday and the judge has indicated there . will be a judgment by Tuesday at the earliest. 'As . I have said before, it has taken 10 years so far, and we now know the . vast majority of British people support us, and we can wait a few more . days for justice to be done.' According . to a YouGov poll, two-thirds of the British public support the . council's attempt to clear the 51 illegal plots at six-acre Dale Farm - . home to about 400 travellers. The . residents unsuccessfully applied to English Heritage for official . protection status for the scaffolding gateway at the site entrance. According to a YouGov poll, two-thirds of the British public support the council's attempt to clear the 51 illegal plots at six-acre Dale Farm - home to about 400 travellers like Tom Sheridan, aged 1, and his brothers . Battle: There are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots . They say it has become an 'emblem of the struggle for travellers' rights'. Today, Mr Justice Ouseley was at first presented with two judicial review applications, but a third was swiftly added. In . the first challenge, the judge is being asked by Ms Sheridan to quash . the council's decisions to carry out evictions on the grounds that they . violate the travellers' Article 8 rights to family and private life . under the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr . Willers said Ms Sheridan was the daughter of Mary Flynn, another Dale . Farm resident who lost a recent Court of Appeal attempt to block the . council's use of direct action to clear the site. Her failed application . was based on her poor health. Mr . Willers argued the personal circumstances and medical conditions of . several Dale Farm residents meant council decisions to continue direct . action against them was unreasonable and legally flawed. He also argued there had been a failure to give the interests of children living on the site primary importance. The . council had failed to comply with its obligations under section 11 of . the 2004 Children Act to safeguard and promote the welfare of the . children. Flower power: The Dale Farm divas, including Kathleen McCarthy at centre, impressed the judge at court last week with their matching floral tops . Backing performers: Other women from Dale Farm followed the sisters' lead in brightly coloured outfits . Mr Willers argued there had been no proper consideration of the impact of eviction on their physical and mental health and emotional well-being. Even if their latest judicial review application fails, the travellers are still due to return to the High Court next week. They will then argue before Mr Justice Edwards-Stuart that the council's plans to go to the site to demolish hard standings for caravans and remove buildings, walls and fences will amount to 'over enforcement', not covered by the enforcement notices. There are already indications that the travellers are confident of securing at least six plots.","Judgment to be returned by the High Court on Tuesday .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 7:19 PM on 12th October 2011 . A human rights watchdog has criticised a string of celebrities including Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank for attending a concert celebrating the birthday of Chechnyan leader Ramzan Kadyrov. New York-based Human Rights Watch hit out at Swank, Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and British violinist Vanessa Mae for attending the event in Grozny last week. Kadyrov has been accused of rights abuses including orchestrated abductions, extra-judicial killings and the enforcement of Sharia law in the Russian republic of Chechnya. Human Rights Watch allegedly contacted some artists urging them not to perform and to 'avoid legitimising people like' Kadyrov. American actress Hilary Swank, center, attends a concert in the new ""Grozny City"" residential and commercial complex in the Chechen capital Grozny late Wednesday . Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme speaks during the ceremony . The lavish multi-million dollar birthday event was held last Wednesday at a police-cordoned concert hall on Kadyrov's 35th birthday. During the event on October 5, Kadyrov took to the stage to address crowds who had gathered in the residential and commercial complex in the Chechen capital. He thanked Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for helping rebuild the region that was devastated by two separatist wars. All smiles on the night: Miss Swank laugh as she addresses the audience during the lavish bash . Strings attached: British violinist Vanessa-Mae performs during the event. She is understood to have charged a fee of half-a-million dollars . Earlier in the day the controversial . leader opened a riverside complex that includes three skyscrapers, a . hotel and conference centre. A hospital, bridge and an avenue named after Mr Kadyrov's late father, Akhmad, who was killed in a suicide bombing in 2004, was also unveiled. Kadryov denied that the bash had been . staged to celebrate his birthday and insisted instead that the gathering . was to mark the 193rd anniversary of the founding of Grozny.  The . celebrations had been paid for by the Kremlin. 'There will be no ceremonies around my . birthday,' he said, according to the Telegraph. 'I categorically forbid . any events to be devoted to it wherever they are.' Chechyen leader Ramzan Kadyrov . However, critics pointed out that the host of celebrities in attendance signalled that the celebrations were for Kadyrov. It is understood that violinist Vanessa Mae was charging a fee of half a million dollars (£320,000) to perform in a concert. But Colombian singer Shakira is believed to have turned down an invitation to perform at the event. 'Rights activists wrote a letter to Shakira telling her not to come because the authorities here kill people and human rights are breached,' Kadyrov said in a TV interview. 'Only enemies of the people could write this.' Bright: Fireworks are sen over the war-ravaged city to mark the leader's birthday. Thankfully for the residents these explosions were not from fighting . Illuminated: A mosque and buildings of the business district are glow during the celebrations that were bankrolled by the Kremlin . The artists' representatives were not immediately available for comment. Kadyrov became president in 2007 three years after his father Akhmad Kadyrov, the former Chechen President, was assassinated. Kadyrov had the support of Putin and he was awarded the Hero of Russia medal following violent clashes with Chechan government warlords for control of the country. Despite stabilising the country and redeveloping large parts of the war-ravaged capital, he has come under fire for alleged corruption and human rights abuses. Mr Kadyrov has insisted that he is innocent and dismissed the accusation as smears against him by his enemies.","Human Rights Watch says celebrities have 'legitimised' controversial leader .

"By . Claire Ellicott . Last updated at 11:37 PM on 10th October 2011 . A junior football league has stopped publishing the results of its matches in case the scores embarrass the young players. Telford Junior League – made up of 20 divisions ranging from under-10s to under-16s – now records all games as either 1-0 wins or 1-1 draws. Bosses at the league have defended the decision to withhold the number of goals scored which they claim will spare the youngsters the humiliation of losing badly. Barmy: The Telford Junior Leagues have stopped publishing the true results and record all scores as either 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 to avoid embarrassing young players . But campaigners and parents say the . policy teaches children that competition is a bad thing and risks . creating a generation of bad losers. Unrepentant league bosses have defended the policy, saying it is in line with Football Association guidelines, which the FA disputes. The FA says it has no rules relating to results above the age of eight. And the league, which was founded in . 1984 and has more than 2,000 players from clubs in Telford, north . Shropshire and Bridgnorth, will also stop recording results for under-11 . teams altogether from next season. One parent, who did not want to be . named, said: ‘This is because they don’t want kids embarrassed if their . team has lost heavily. ‘If that’s the case what’s the point of having a league table up on the website at all?’ Another parent, who also did not want . to be named for fear of turning officials against his son’s team, said: . ‘I think it’s crazy - kids need to learn about winning and losing from . an early age. They aren’t recognising the boys’ achievements. ‘They might not want to embarrass the . losing team but if one of the lads scores six or seven goals and that . isn’t recorded what kind of message does that send to them? ‘The lads might as well not turn up.’ Assistant secretary Stephen Groome said the league had introduced the results policy on its official website this year. 'Still 1-0... despite 7 goals': The Telford League have stopped recording thrashings - and will get rid of all scores from next season for under-11s (file photo) He said: ‘Shropshire FA have said it . is a guideline and we chose to go with it. If someone else wins, the . children do not need to be embarrassed. ‘There are mixed feelings about it . and it’s up to each league. From next season under-11s won’t even have . their results recorded.’ He said goal difference did not play a . part in determining final league positions and teams finishing on equal . points would share their position. ‘Sometimes there is a 16-1 or 16-0 . goal difference but it’s not a determining factor in junior football . because the league will be shared,’ he added. Stephen Clarke, manager of the under-11s Wrekin Panthers team, backed the move. He said: ‘The children’s welfare is . paramount. The winners have three points on the website if they win and . the children who lose 20-0 would feel very disheartened if it was on the . website. ‘They might think of not playing. I think it’s a very good idea.’ But Mr Clarke added there must come a point when players had to accept defeat. He said: ‘I think probably by the age . of 15 then they have an understanding that life is a bit of a . competition and we are competing with other people.’ Dame Kelly Holmes, the double Olympic champion, has spoken out in the past about the decline of competitive sports for children. She said it risked spawning a . generation of bad losers and blamed a culture of political correctness . for making ‘competitiveness’ a dirty word. A spokesman for the FA commented: 'There’s an FA rule that prohibits the publishing of results and league tables across all media for U7 and U8 age-groups where the focus of the game is about learning to play without the pressure of full-time scores. 'For older age groups, there are no rules or FA guidelines which indicate that the final score should be changed.'","All results recorded as 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 as league refuses to record thrashings .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 10:07 PM on 12th October 2011 . Police are hunting for a serial fancy dress robber who has targeted bookmakers all over the country in at least 11 different disguises. Martin Joseph Reilly, 53, dons wigs, hats, false moustaches and special outfits before robbing the shops at gunpoint or with a knife. He has dressed as Elvis Presley, a tramp and a labourer before stealing from the bookies. Sussex Police said today he is believed to have targeted stores in their county, as well as in Hampshire, Surrey, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Essex and most recently London, travelling between them on trains. Target: CCTV footage of Martin Joseph Reilly shows him wearing various disguises while committing armed robberies . Detective Inspector Ian Still, from Brighton CID, said: 'We hope that by publicising Martin's name and photograph for the first time it may prompt members of the public who know him or recognise him to come forward. 'What is distinctive about him is that he uses fancy dress disguises - wigs, hats, false beards, moustaches and sideburns - to alter his appearance and to hide scarring on his cheeks, particularly horseshoe-like scarring on his left-hand cheek. 'We are linking the 11 robberies and attempted robberies from each of the counties due to the use of disguises and his modus operandi - almost always striking just as the shops open up and arming himself with a knife or gun to threaten staff. Attack: Reilly, 53, walking into a Ladbrokes in Eastbourne, pulling his balaclava down at the last minute . 'It is not known if the gun is imitation or real. 'Master of disguise': Reilly has worn different disguises for his betting shop heists across the South East - including Elvis Presley and a comedy beard and horror mask . 'We believe Reilly is using the rail network or other public transport to reach stores just as they are opening up. 'Fortunately to date, Reilly has not harmed staff or members of the public during any of the robberies but we would still advise people to not approach him but to contact police immediately should they see him.' The Association of British Bookmakers has offered a reward of up to £10,000 for information that will lead to Reilly's arrest and conviction. Neil Harris, divisional security and safety manager for Ladbrokes Betting and Gaming, said: 'We have been working closely with Sussex Police and other police forces in an attempt to find Martin Reilly. 'We are hoping that by providing Sussex Police with various CCTV images from our stores and putting up a reward that someone will recognise Reilly before he strikes again. 'This has been a very frightening experience for our staff but fortunately no-one has been injured.' Reilly is described as white, 6ft 1in and of medium build, with blue eyes, a shaven bald head and scars on each cheek. Scruffy: Sussex Police have released CCTV of him wearing a disguise while committing armed robbery at William Hill in Hove . He has at various times lived in both Corby and Kettering in Northamptonshire and has connections to London, having previously lived in the Croydon area and is known to frequent Kilburn. He is also known to use different names such as Martin McAuley, Martin Anderson and Martin O'Reilly. Anyone with information concerning Reilly should contact Sussex Police on 0845 60 70 999, quoting Operation Shelley, or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Wigs, moustaches and hats are used to hide the identity of Martin Joseph Reilly and his distinctive scars .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 10:38 AM on 21st September 2011 . A university student who was harassed by an internet stalker for three years - which turned out to be her own boyfriend - says he has 'wrecked her life'. Ruth Jeffery, who confided in Shane Webber during the horrific ordeal, contemplated suicide after being bombarded with sexually explicit photos and videos. She also suffered the indignity of having naked images of herself posted on adult websites and distributed to family and friends, including her parents. Ultimate betrayal: Shane Webber's online harassment made girlfriend Ruth Jeffery so ill she was prescribed anti-depressants . 'Stressed': Ruth Jeffery was badly affected by her boyfriend's online abuse campaign . When police eventually uncovered the . identity of her tormentor, 22-year-old Miss Jeffery was sickened to . learn it was her own boyfriend. School drop-out Webber launched his twisted campaign because he was jealous of Miss Jeffery’s life at Loughborough University. He is now facing jail after a court heard how he also went online posing as  Miss Jeffery. He contacted men saying she was . sexually attracted to them and gave them her university address. One man . turned up at her student house and had to be turned away. Unemployed Webber, 22, continued his evil campaign despite knowing he was making his girlfriend ill. She was prescribed anti-depressants, . developed symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder and even stopped . eating at times. The abuse affected her so badly that she had to retake . exams for her computer science course. Clue: Miss Jeffery eventually realised that some of the detail in the messages could only be known to Webber . Online campaign: Images of Webber and his girlfriend. He hacked into her email account and sent a naked picture of her to her contact list, including her father . Webber pleaded guilty to causing . harassment, alarm or distress at Southampton magistrates’ court, and . will be sentenced next month. Yesterday Miss Jeffery said she was still trying to have some of the naked pictures of her he posted on the internet taken down. ‘I want him to be put in prison because he has wrecked the past three and a half years of my life,’ she said. ‘We were really close. We did everything together. I would tell him everything.’ The couple met at school when they were both 11. Evil campaign: Webber continued to stalk his girlfriend despite knowing that it was making her ill . They were teenage sweethearts but split up before reuniting in 2007, when Miss Jeffery was in the sixth form. But Webber had dropped out of school . at 14 and Miss Jeffery believes he may have been trying to stop her from . obtaining a degree because he had no qualifications himself. He began his campaign of abuse by . setting up multiple fake email addresses to pose as former . schoolfriends. He used these to send sexually explicit photos and videos . to Miss Jeffery. He then began impersonating her and distributing photos of her to family and friends, as well as online. Miss Jeffery added: ‘It made me feel sick and so stressed because it was happening every single day. ‘There were times when I phoned up my mum and said, “I don’t want to be alive any more”. 'Possessive': Miss Jeffery believes jealousy could have been behind Webber's motive for harassing her. She is studying for a degree while he dropped out of school at the age of 14 . ‘I just didn’t want to do anything. The whole time I felt a person was watching me and finding out what I was doing.’ At one point Miss Jeffery became . suspicious that her boyfriend was the culprit as only he had access to . the photographs and certain information used in the emails. But Webber, of Nottingham, convinced . her that they had been stolen from his computer by a friend. Miss . Jeffery reported the friend to police and his computer was seized. When no trace of the emails or photos was found Webber came up with more lies about how they could have been taken. He was eventually caught when police traced an email to his computer. Miss Jeffery said: ‘Throughout the . whole relationship, he was a bit controlling and possessive. If I . didn’t go to see him the  moment I had some free time, he would . complain. ‘I want people to realise it has not . been me sending the photos and messages, and I want the case to put . other people off from doing the same thing.’","Shane Webber sent naked pictures of girlfriend to friends and family .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 5:24 PM on 13th October 2011 . A Labour councillor who campaigned with Harriet Harman is facing jail after he today admitted sending a '15-year-old schoolgirl' graphic online messages. John Friary begged the man he thought was a teenager for racy pictures and arranged to meet 'her' for sex after she contacted him on the internet. The 53-year-old thought he was exchanging explicit . online chat with a teenager called 'Hannah' but was really the victim of a . scheming blackmailer who planned to extort money from him. Labour campaigner: Councillor John Friary campaigned with Harriet Harman. He was facing jail after admitting attempting to groom the '15-year-old girl' Friary, who was head of community safety at Southwark Council, has also canvassed with Tessa Jowell in elections. The politician promised 'Hannah' he would be her 'father figure', 'look after' her and told her their chat was getting him 'turned on'. He even agreed to pick 'Hannah' up from a tube station in central London and take her to his home in Camberwell, south London, for a night of passion. But Friary was really exchanging the lurid emails with a plotting adult male who has since been jailed for blackmail. He pleaded guilty today to attempting to arrange a meeting with a child following sexual grooming between January 10 and January 14 last year. Facing jail: John Friary, pictured arriving at court today, was remanded in custody ahead of his sentencing, for sending inappropriate messages to the 'schoolgirl' Following his arrest he was sacked as the cabinet member responsible for community safety at Southwark Council and resigned as a councillor. A judge at Isleworth Crown Court was told how on January 12 last year, 'Hannah' sent Friary an online chat message saying: 'Hi John, I am looking for a father figure as my real dad left home when I was five. 'I live with my mum and dad now, but I am looking for someone older I can have fun with. I am also a bit shy until I have had a couple of Bacardi Breezers.' Friary replied: 'Hannah, I would love to be your father figure. You look so beautiful. Tell me about yourself, and what you are into sexually - you know what I like.' Andrew Vout, prosecuting, told the court: 'This 53-year-old defendant came to be in email contact and online chat contact with an individual whom he believed to be a 15-year-old girl by the name of Hannah. 'In fact the individual that he communicated with was an adult male whose intention was in fact to blackmail him. The blackmailer has since been convicted of that offence and sentenced. 'In an email to 'Hannah' on January 9 the defendant introduced himself and very quickly is suggesting that they meet for sexual contact.' In the messages read to the court he said he was excited by her - and described her as a 'gorgeous girl'. He asked: 'Do you have any sexy pictures for me? Do you want me to be your dad?' Friary believed 'Hannah' lived with her parents in Barnet, north London. He told her 'I bet you look hot naked' and added 'I can meet you anywhere and bring you back here'. Before any attempt to extort money from Friary was made, the blackmailer was arrested. Judge Phillip Matthews remanded Friary in custody while pre-sentencing reports are carried out. Friary had represented Camberwell since 1994 but resigned following his arrest. He was also a governor at a Camberwell primary school. He is due to be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court on November 11.","John Friary had campaigned with Harriet Harman .

"By . Jaya Narain . Last updated at 12:32 AM on 14th October 2011 . With his shirt stained with blood and a nasty gash above his left eye, Paul Merson makes his way home after a stay in hospital. The former England footballer said he was lucky to be alive following his 70mph motor- way smash in the early hours  of Wednesday. But now Merson – whose addictions to gambling, drugs and alcohol drove him to the brink of suicide – is at the centre of a police investigation after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson was pictured leaving Warwick Hospital yesterday after sustaining cuts to his head following a crash on the M40 . Merson claims he fell asleep at the wheel of his car before the collision occurred . The ex-England and Arsenal star was pictured at a Children In Need charity gala, just hours before his early morning crash yesterday . The 43-year-old was breathalysed at . the side of the M40 near Warwick after his £40,000 black Mercedes 4x4 . collided with a Ministry of Defence lorry just after 3am. The Sky Sports pundit, who had  been . driving home to Sutton  Coldfield in the Midlands from a charity gala in . Battersea, South London, told officers he had fallen asleep at the . wheel and careered into the central reservation before smashing into the . lorry. The father of five was taken to . Warwick Hospital in the early hours of Wednesday, where he received . treatment for facial injuries and provided a blood sample. Merson could face prosecution if it proves positive for too much alcohol. He was allowed home after six hours, . and was photographed leaving the hospital with blood  on his white shirt . and stitches on his forehead. The driver of the lorry – a 45ft-long MoD freight carrier – was treated for whiplash. Merson famously celebrated after the 1993 Coca-Cola Cup final by pretending to down drinks . Merson celebrates with Paul Gascoigne during their time together at Middlesbrough. Merson claims he left the club because of its 'drinking culture' Merson said: ‘I fell asleep and just . hit the central reservation. I banged my head on the windscreen and the . car is a write-off. I’m very lucky to have survived. ‘I managed to get out by myself and . the emergency services were brilliant. Now I want to get home and have . some rest.’ Twice-married Merson, who won two league titles with . Arsenal, has fought a well-documented addiction to gambling, alcohol and . drugs for more than two decades. The former England star was driving a black Mercedes SUV, like the one pictured, when he crashed . Merson, 43, played for England 21 times and now works as a Sky Sports pundit .

Wall Street bankers are enjoying an average salary more than five times higher than the rest of the private sector in New York City, a report says. The average salary last year in the city’s securities industry - in which financial workers deal in debt, equities and derivatives - was $361,330. Comparing this to the average of $66,120 in the rest of the private sector will only fuel the outrage of Occupy Wall Street protesters. Disparities: The average salary last year in the city's securities industry was $361,330, compared to the average of $66,120 in the rest of the private sector . Average salaries in the securities industry 30 years ago were only double those in the rest of the private sector, reported the New York Times. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli’s report came as city protestors continued to push for the state to extend a tax on millionaires. Total bonuses paid to workers in the city’s securities industry fell last year by eight per cent to $21billion following a 27 per cent rise in 2009. But wages - including bonuses - went up by 14 per cent last year to $58billion, although they remained below the 2007 record of $74billion. Last year almost a quarter (24 per cent) of all private sector wages were in the securities industry, even though it has just 5 per cent of the jobs.

The average securities salary grew last year by 16 per cent to $361,330. The salary gap peaked in 2007 before falling for the next two years. The average compensation for S&P 500 CEOs was $11.4million last year - almost 350 times the median pay of U.S. workers ($33,190). The gap has risen around eightfold since 1980 and is still only 25:1 in Europe, reported LiveScience. But the report added: ‘In 2010, the disparity between the securities industry and other employment sectors widened. ‘The average salary in the securities industry in New York City was also much higher than in such jobs in the rest of New York State ($209,500). ‘The higher salaries in New York City reflect a greater concentration of the most highly compensated positions in the industry.’ One in three of the city's jobs lost in the recession was in finance - and 10,000 more in securities could go within 14 months, reported the New York Times.","Report on salary gaps by New York State Comptroller .

The 'cheeky' Chilean miner who faced the wrath of his wife by asking both her and his mistress to greet him on reaching the surface has revealed he is dying. Yonni Barrios said he has developed lung disease silicosis - from dust in his lungs - a year to the day since he was one of 33 trapped miners winched to safety after 69 days underground. But astonishingly the 51-year-old has revealed he is still seeing both women - and now lives with mistress Susana Valenzuela but stays at his wife Marta Salinas' nearby home whenever they argue. He said: 'It's a complicated situation.' Speaking about his illness, he told the Sun: 'I am very sick. My lungs have become clogged and it is difficult for me to breathe. 'The doctors say I have silicosis and there's little they can do to help me. I've become very depressed. My lungs are permanently damaged and I have to accept this disease could kill me.' Millions across the world were glued to their television sets on October 13, 2010, as the 33 trapped men were rescued one by one from the San Jose copper mine through an escape capsule. Mr Barrios, who lives in the poverty-stricken district of Copiapo city, was dubbed the 'doctor' because he treated his colleagues medically. Lovers: Yonni Barrios's mistress Susana Valenzuela (left) and wife Marta Salinas (right) both kept a vigil when he was trapped in the mine . He used knowledge gained from looking after his diabetic mother to work with medical teams on the surface to diagnose and help the men trapped with him. But very soon he became even better known for something rather less noble. His wife and another woman were both holding a vigil for him in Camp Hope. Marta Salinas, 59, whom he married 29 years ago, reportedly almost came to blows with Susana Valenzuela, 51, when they faced off in the mine’s dining area. The pair had to be pulled apart. As his wife began to get involved in his affairs on Camp Hope, he instructed teams on the surface to deal with his lover instead. Relief: Yonni Barrios (left) hugs his mistress Susana Valenzuela (right) after being brought to the surface from the San Jose mine . And as the day of the rescue finally approached, he asked for both of them to wait for him as he emerged from the borehole. In the end he was greeted by his mistress, his wife choosing to stay away. He looked calm as he gingerly walked towards her, who gave him a long hug, crying on his shoulder and occasionally pulling back to look at him as if to make sure the reunion was really happening. After he emerged, his wife, who has three sons from an earlier relationship, said she was over Barrios and did not feel 'anything in particular'. A year on from the rescue and he has moved in with Susana. But he still has a room at his wife's house nearby, to where he runs after rows with his mistress. Mr Barrios, who sees a psychologist three times a week,  said he also suffers flashbacks about the days following the mine collapse in northern Chile. He added: 'Ever since I left the mine, I have been messed up. I cannot sleep at night. I stay up until five in the morning, my mind racing. 'When I finally do get to sleep, I have nightmares that I am back in the mine. My dream is always the same - I am trapped and trying to escape. I wake up screaming, in cold sweats.'",Yonni Barrios now lives with mistress... but sleeps at wife's home if they argue .
"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 4:09 PM on 11th October 2011 . An Asian primary school teacher who cost taxpayers £300,000 after being off sick on full pay for six years lodged a complaint about stress just two months into her job, an employment tribunal heard today. Anna Yerrakalva, 58, said her fellow teachers were racist, copied her Indian accent and gossiped about her almost immediately after she started work. She told the Sheffield tribunal: 'During this time I was the only Asian or black employee at the school. As soon as I started working at the school I began to experience hostility towards me. Anna Yerrakalva was off work from Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton upon Dearne, South Yorkshire, for six years on full pay . 'This involved hostile behaviour such as ignoring me, isolating me, whispering behind my back and mimicking my accent. This continued throughout the time I was employed at the school.' After 14 months off sick with stress, she returned to work where two months later her teaching assistant had an epileptic fit and fell on top of her, pinning her to the floor. She claimed to have suffered chest, neck and spine injuries as a result. Mrs Yerrakalva, who had worked at Dearne Carrfield Primary School in Bolton upon Dearne, South Yorkshire, since April 2002, again went off sick after that alleged accident in November 2003. She briefly returned, only to be struck by a bus in June 2004, and she has never worked since. She was on full pay of about £30,000 a year until she was suspended last year – and was finally sacked in January 2010. The teacher, who is reckoned to have cost the taxpayer a total of £300,000 in pay and legal costs over the six years, has taken her education authority to an employment tribunal, claiming victimisation and unfair dismissal. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council told the tribunal that Mrs Yerrakalva was fit enough to play badminton and go swimming despite receiving a disability living allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions. But Mrs Yerrakalva, who uses a stick, told the hearing that her sporting prowess was a 'misunderstanding' and she could only walk a maximum of 50metres and was unable to negotiate stairs. She insisted she be provided with a high table, special chair and interactive white board before she could return to teach the five-to-seven-year-old pupils. The widow, who owns a second home in India, alleges unfair dismissal and is demanding 25 days extra pay from the local education authority after she withdrew an earlier accusation of race discrimination against the council. She complained of racial discrimination in June 2002, and head teacher Stephen Poxton promised to investigate her complaints, but she went off sick with work related stress and didn't return until 11 September 2003. Mrs Yerrakalva continued: 'In November 2003, I suffered an injury at work when my classroom assistant fell on me. I was as a result unfit to work.' She told the head that she suffered chest, neck and spinal injuries after being crushed for 15 minutes beneath the classroom assistant. Mrs Yerrakalva was referred to the Occupational Health Service and returned to school in April 2004, after she was deemed fit enough to work. She told the tribunal: 'It was clear to me at that investigation meeting Mr Poxton did not believe my account of the accident.' The tribunal previously heard that Mrs Yerrakalva claimed disability living allowance and industrial injury benefit in 2006 and 2007 saying she was severely disabled, yet at the same time she told her employers, Barnsley council, she was fit to return to work. In a list of ailments detailed in her benefits claim forms, she said she suffered from dizzy spells and a lack of awareness and concentration. She had frequent blackouts, a tendency to become confused and had fits of anger, often throwing things about. The teacher claimed to have a problem with communicating and said she stumbled on a daily basis. She needed help with feeding, clothing and going to the toilet. Mrs Yerrakalva also claimed she was unable to cope with the slightest changes in routine and quickly became aggressive when challenged. To add to her list, she said she suffered from learning problems, panic attacks and a difficulty in filling in forms. Head Mr Poxton pointed out to the tribunal these were hardly ideal attributes for a teacher. He said: ‘Her claims caused a considerable amount of time, money and aggravation for the school and an irreparable breakdown of confidence. I could not trust this teacher with children.’ Mrs Yerrakalva, from Sheffield, argues she should have been allowed back to work. The hearing continues.","Anna Yerrakalva, 58, estimated to have cost taxpayers £300,000 after being off sick on full pay for six years .

A woman accused of drugging her husband before cutting off his penis with a kitchen knife and grinding it up in a garbage disposal after a row over house guests faces life in prison. Catherine Kieu, 48, is said to have made her 60-year-old husband dinner at their California home on Monday night and put an unknown poison or drug in the food to make him pass out.

Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to MPs ahead of a crucial confidence vote. Berlusconi, 75, is currently involved in four trials - including one for having sex with an underage prostitute - and will attempt to rally MPs and reassure them he is still capable of running the country, which is teetering on the edge of a financial meltdown. In-party squabbling between members of his ruling right-wing coalition meant that many failed to turn up for a crucial vote on the state of the country's public accounts earlier this week - a vote that Berlusconi lost. No way out? Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi will be fighting for his political life tomorrow when he speaks to MPs ahead of a crucial confidence vote . Berlusconi will speak to parliament in Rome at 11am on Thursday morning - just 24 hours after Italy's president Giorgio Napolitano called for ''credible answers' from the country's government. The confidence vote will take place on Friday and, if he loses, Berlusconi - whose reputation has come under scrutiny following revelations of his sordid 'bunga bunga' sex parties - will have no option but to resign. This would mean a general election ahead of the scheduled 2013 ballot. Following the defeat in the Italian lower house earlier this week there were chants from opposition benches of 'resign, resign' and even some of his own allies were questioning whether he could still remain in power after such a public humiliation which dominated TV and newspaper headlines. Put up or shut up: The confidence vote will take place on Friday and, if he loses, Berlusconi will have no option but to resign . A front page editorial in La Repubblica newspaper headlined 'The Duty of Resigning' said that the defeat for Berlusconi in the vote was a 'devastating and defining politically' for him and his centre right coalition. However, Berlusconi remained upbeat . with sources saying he was confident of carrying the confidence vote - . one of several he has faced in his political career - and that he would . be stressing in his speech how it was 'irresponsible' of the opposition . to try and topple the government when the country is facing an economic . crisis. Fabrizio Cicchitto, . leader of Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in parliament, said: . 'The prime minister will address the House on Thursday and will then ask . for their confidence on Friday. 'The vote is the only way of measuring the relationship between Government and parliament. 'The . opposition are making a mistake if they think the loss earlier this . week was a sign of no confidence in the Government - there is a . difference between a vote of confidence and a no confidence vote.' Political . commentators say the chances of Berlusconi losing the vote are slim as . he and party whips will ensure the 30 or so MPs missing from the vote . earlier this week are in attendance. Nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug (left) and escort girl Patrizia D'Addario have been named in connection with . sex parties allegedly held by Berlusconi . Opposition leader Pier Luigi Bersani, . of the Democratic Left, said: 'This is the 53rd vote of confidence that . has been called and it is now becoming a joke - the only clear position . is his resignation.' Italy - the third largest economy in the Eurozone - has a debt of more than £1trillion or 120 per cent of its GDP. Despite . introducing a belt tightening 53billion euro austerity package earlier . this summer there are fears the country is heading the same way as . neighbour Greece. Financial . ratings agencies and commentators say the lack of strong leadership . from Berlusconi and the internal squabbling indicate that he is not . strong enough to carry through policies and reforms to save the . country's economy. Besides . the underage sex case which resumes next month, he is also on trial for . corruption and abuse of office and one commentator said he was spending . more time 'talking to his lawyers then governing and should be talking . more to Jean-Claude Trichet the head of the European Bank.'","The 75-year-old will speak to MPs tomorrow ahead of confidence vote on Friday .

'I've been watching YouTube videos of her but I find it very difficult to do real dialogue as her voice as it's such a particular sort of voice, it's very strange because it's very soft, then very strident so it's difficult.'

Good Morning America viewers got a fruity surprise to go along with their cereal today when Nicki Minaj suffered a rather disastrous wardrobe malfunction on air. The 28-year-old Moment 4 Life singer fell out of her tight crop top during a live performance for the  GMA Concert Series. The Super Bass singer's double-sided tape failed her in a time of need and she popped out of the tiny green tank she wore on stage in Central Park. The embarrassing moment aired live on the East Coast of the U.S. but was edited out for other time zones. Wardrobe malfunction: Nicki Minaj slipped out of her crop top live on Good Morning America today . Over-exposed: The singer was obliviously to her costume disaster . Unfortunately for Nicki, she was so immersed in warbling Where Them Girls At that she didn't seem to notice the slip. But viewers certainly did - and immediately took to Twitter to comment on the over-exposure. Caught on camera: The moment aired live on the East Coast, but was edited out of broadcasts in other time zones . 'Two special guests on Good Morning America today, Nicki Minaj AND her nipple,' tweeted one user. And the Parents Television Council was quick to blast the TV show, noting that it it could have been avoided if a five-second delay was implemented. 'For the umpteenth time in recent . memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for . children and families,' PTC president Tim Winter told TMZ. 'Instead of asking for forgiveness, . they need to stop apologizing and implement the five second delay that . so many Americans have been calling for.' A . spokesperson for the network insists there is a delay in place, but . producers didn't notice the slip-up until it was too late. Spilling out: The singer's flimsy outfit failed to contain her cleavage . The representative said: 'Although we had a five-second delay in place for the Nicki Minaj concert on GMA , the live East Coast feed of the concert regrettably included certain fleeting images of the performer that were taken out of later feeds of the broadcast in other time zones.' 'We are sorry that this occurred.' Nicki was wearing a typically outrageous outfit for the performance, which also included a clear, pink-trimmed plastic skirt, leopard print Wellies and newsprint leggings. Her huge yellow hoop earrings were almost as big as her head, as were the multi-coloured bangles she wore. Loving the attention: Nicki re-tweeted this complimentary message from a fan after her performance . Hot pink lipstick, a keyboard ring and a massive head of frizzed-out blonde wig completed her zany look. She used a turkey leg as a prop for no apparent reason and took a gigantic, satisfying bite before discarding it. She jumped up and down while rapping into her pink, jewel-encrusted microphone while dancers in tutus swirled around her. What just happened? The Super Bass singer looks a little shell-shocked. Was it because of her wardrobe malfunction? Nicki then thanked the crowd for pushing her aptly-titled album Pink Friday to platinum status since its release. 'I grew up in New York City. I never . imagined myself playing in Central Park with a bunch of beautiful . people like this. I am New York to the fullest,' she told the audience.

Marc and Janina Leibowitz had the perfect wedding in Pittsfield, Vermont, on Saturday - then awoke to find the river in front of their bridal cottage was washing away the only road leading out of town. They got out over a bridge, which then collapsed and left some of the guests behind at the inn. The groomsmen later rigged up ladders to cross the stream - but 60 guests are still trapped in the town. Hurricane interruption: Marc and Janina Leibowitz are pictured after their wedding at Riverside Farm in Pittsfield, Vermont. The couple remain stranded with 60 of their wedding guests in the town on Tuesday . Damage: This photo by Marc Leibowitz shows a partially submerged home in Pittsfield, Vermont, close to where he married his bride at Riverside Farm on Saturday . At least a dozen . wedding guests were airlifted by helicopter from Pittsfield on Tuesday after Hurricane Irene struck two days earlier on Sunday, . turning rivers into roiling flood waters. ‘It was getting dicey,’ said Scott Redler, 38, of Jersey City, New Jersey, who contracted one of the helicopter trips because his mother, a breast cancer patient, was running out of medication. The helicopter ferried out Mr Redler, his mother and father, his wife, and their three-year-old child. ‘The town was in really, really bad shape,’ Mr Redler said. ‘It was its own island, where you couldn't get anything in and couldn't get anything out. Houses were washed away.’ Mr Leibowitz, 31, and Mrs Leibowitz, 28, were in Germany, snowed in last Christmas when they got engaged and planned a wedding. Now they were stranded again, with 60 of their wedding guests. Taken apart: A house was destroyed about one mile south of Pittsfield, Vermont, by Hurricane Irene and remains along the river, before National Guard helicopters rushed food and water to a dozen towns cut off . Irene's legacy: This photo by Marc Leibowitz shows destruction along Route 100 in Pittsfield, Vermont . ‘Basically we had an unbelievable wedding,’ said Mr Leibowitz, an artist from Brooklyn, New York. 'It was getting dicey. The town was in really, really bad shape. It was its own island, where you couldn't get anything in and couldn't get anything out. Houses were washed away' Wedding guest Scott Redler, 38 . ‘She told me on Saturday night it was the most perfect dream wedding she could have imagined. And then on Sunday morning - the weather changed.’ The group expected heavy rains but thought the brunt of the storm would miss the tiny town in the Green Mountains. Many of their friends thanked them for getting them out of New York City, the projected storm target, and into Vermont. ‘And then it hit,’ Mr Leibowitz said. Stuck: A house rests in mud after it was destroyed by Hurricane Irene on Sunday in Pittsfield, Vermont . Write-off: A car sits submerged in mud, rocks and fallen trees on what was once Dover Road in Williamsville, Vermont, during severe flooding from Irene . The small Tweed Creek that ran in front of their bridal cottage at Riverside Farm bed-and-breakfast rose rapidly on Sunday and flooded the bridesmaids' studio apartment below with 5ft of water. 'Basically we had an unbelievable . wedding. She . told me on Saturday night it was the most perfect dream wedding she . could have imagined' Marc Leibowitz, 31, groom . Mr Leibowitz and his Brooklyn bride decided they needed to get to the farm's other inn, where relatives - many of Mrs Leibowitz's from Germany and in the U.S. for the first time - were staying. The couple rushed to finish brunch with some of their bridesmaids, despite the owners' warning that the road was giving way and that they should move up the mountain. Their four-wheel drive rental car was able to make it over the bridge to the Amee Farm. ‘After we passed, the bridge collapsed,’ Mr Leibowitz said. Inspecting damage: People stand where the Route 30 bridge over the West River in Jamaica, Vermont, was completely washed away during Irene . Ruined: Damaged homes from flooding are seen in Bethel, Vermont, after what is expected to be the worst flooding in Vermont since the epic flooding in 1927, after 8.3 inches of rain fell in less than 24 hours . All of the groomsmen and one of the bridesmaids were left behind at the inn, cut off from the road. 'A couple of people have been freaked out and others have been really scared. But we're trying to keep people calm' Marc Leibowitz, 31, groom . On Monday morning, some of the groomsmen rigged up ladders to cross the stream and the remains of the bridge so they could hike in and out and from inn to inn, about a mile over the ravaged road by walking and climbing. ‘We were hiking in supplies, food and water,’ he said. The newlyweds had planned to leave on Thursday for their Hawaiian honeymoon. But they have been told that it could be seven to 10 days before Route 100 that goes through town is repaired. To pass the time, the couple and their wedding guests have pitched in around town, shovelling mud from homes and getting supplies to elderly residents living in the hills. Slippery: Workers start to clear the mud, water and debris off of Flat Street in Brattleboro, Vermont, after severe flooding from Irene . Closed: A restaurant is seen in floodwaters from the Passaic River, which overflowed its banks following Irene in Paterson, New Jersey . They have also been working at the Original General Store, which has become the central gathering place in town. 'There's 60 of us in a town of 400 and we're becoming a major drain on their resources' Marc Leibowitz, 31, groom . Mr Leibowitz said the general store's owners have been cut off from their own home and have been staying at the store overnight. By Tuesday, guests were picking vegetables from the farm to prepare for dinner. Townspeople, who didn't have electricity or phone services, were encouraged to bring perishable food to the general store, where it could be stored in a generator-powered refrigerator. Going nowhere: A sport utility truck is seen in a sink hole in Kinnelon, New Jersey, after rains from Hurricane Irene washed out a section of Kinnelon Road . Vehicle damage: A farm truck and snowmobile moved by the flood waters from Irene sit in the middle of a farmer's corn field along Route 30 in Schoharie, New York . ‘There's 60 of us in a town of 400 and we're becoming a major drain on their resources,’ Mr Leibowitz said. Another 60 guests were able to leave safely before the storm worsened. To keep spirits up, they have been playing charades, and some of their musician friends who entertained at the wedding have been playing music at night. ‘A couple of people have been freaked out and others have been really scared,’ Mr Leibowitz said. ‘But we're trying to keep people calm.’","Marc and Janina Leibowitz, of New York, got married in Pittsfield, Vermont .

"By . Jaya Narain . Last updated at 12:18 PM on 8th October 2011 . A clear mandate has been handed down to householders allowing them to use whatever force is necessary to defend their homes and families from intruders. The unequivocal message came as wealthy businessman Vincent Cooke, 39, was told he would face no charges for stabbing a burglar to death. The married father was arrested on suspicion of murder last month after he knifed career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, during a terrifying armed raid. Released: Vincent Cooke, left, was told by . the Crown Prosecution Service that he will face no further action after . Raymond Jacob was stabbed to death at his home . He is the third householder this year to kill an intruder and be told he will not face prosecution. The decision sends out an emphatic message that victims of aggravated burglary will be given the support of the British legal system. And it paves the way for the new Justice Bill to put beyond doubt the right of homeowners and shopkeepers to use force to protect themselves, their families and their property without fear of prosecution. Yesterday lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service ruled that 39-year-old Mr Cooke acted within the law. Nazir Afzal, chief prosecutor for the North West, said: 'It is clear to me that Mr Cooke did what he honestly and instinctively believed was necessary to protect himself, his home and his family from intruders. 'The law is clear that anyone, who acts in good faith in using whatever force they honestly feel is necessary to protect themselves, their families or their property, will not be prosecuted.' Two men burst into Mr Cooke's £350,000 detached home in the village of Bramhall, Cheshire, last month. Mr Cooke's home: His case is the third in Greater Manchester this year involving suspected raiders being killed and the CPS ruling individuals had acted in self-defence . They marched him upstairs at knifepoint hunting for money but as they ransacked the house, Mr Cooke's wife, Karen, 34, and son Anthony, 12, returned home. Mr Cooke shouted at them to run for safety and grabbed a kitchen knife before struggling with the intruders. During the scuffle Jacob suffered multiple stab wounds and bled to death on the doorstep from a leg wound. The family have been forced to leave their home over fears underworld associates of Jacob may seek revenge. Mourning: A friend of Jacob is comforted by another as she lays flowers at the scene of the stabbing last month . Yesterday Mr Cooke, the boss of a courier firm, spoke of his relief that he would not face prosecution but said the incident had left him traumatised. He said: 'I'm still suffering flashbacks and having nightmares every night. I will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life. 'I would like to convey my utmost thanks for all the people who have supported me throughout this horrible experience.' Mr Cooke received wide-ranging support across the political spectrum after his ordeal and more than 6,000 joined a Facebook campaign. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'The law is very clear: you have every right to defend yourself, your home, your property, your family.' Michael Thorpe, 33, has been remanded in custody charged with aggravated burglary at Mr Cooke's home. In July, 59-year-old Peter Flanagan, of Salford, who was accused of stabbing to death suspected burglar John Bennell, 27, escaped charges. And last month the CPS decided no charges should be brought against florist Cecil Coley, 72, who was arrested after a gang of armed robbers – one with a handgun – smashed their way into his shop in Old Trafford, Manchester. Armed robber Gary Mullings, 30, suffered fatal wounds when Mr Coley picked up a knife used for cutting flowers and stabbed him during a frantic struggle at the shop.","Vincent Cooke was 'acting in self-defence' says CPS .

James Kennedy, 54, denies murder . A convicted rapist strangled a woman to death but was not arrested for 12 years after sending police anonymous letters blaming two black men for the crime, a court heard. James Kennedy, 54, was charged with murder after he was stopped for drink-driving in July 2010 and  police took a DNA sample from him. It matched saliva found on Nijole Siskeviciene, 44, whose body was discovered beside a garage in Wembley, north London, in October 1998, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled with a ligature, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said. Kennedy lived two doors away from the mother-of-one at the time and denied knowing her when interviewed by police in house-to-house inquiries. A week after the murder police received two anonymous letters from someone claiming to have seen two black men carrying out a girl from a house. When he was arrested at his home in Weston-Super-Mare in January this year, Kennedy - who now walks with a stick - said 'Oh my God' and was 'visibly shaken', the court heard. His DNA was found to match that on the letters and police found the same stationery in his home during a search, the hearing was told. Mr Bennetts said Nijole 'had marks to her body consistent . with having been held by her attacker about the throat and wrists and . injuries were consistent with a hand being placed over her mouth. Her underwear was inside out. 'Together with evidence of DNA upon her body and clothing, that evidence . is clear, say the prosecution, and consistent with there having been . sexual activity prior to, or at the time of her death.' The court heard that Kennedy was previously jailed for raping two women in his home town in Ireland in 1978. Then aged 21, he offered a 19-year-old a lift in his car and raped her and tightened a ligature around her neck until she passed out. He then threw her into a lake and when she tried to reach the shore threw rocks at her. His 23-year-old second victim was attacked a month later, and was raped while Kennedy held his hands around her throat. He pleaded guilty to the two rapes in 1979 and was jailed, the jury was told. Kennedy, who changed his name to Citro in 2003, denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice by sending the two letters to police. Mr Bennetts told the court: 'The prosecution case is based upon circumstantial evidence - DNA, differing accounts given by James Citro and letters written by him to divert attention from him. 'Why else would he write the letters?' The trial continues.","James Kennedy was charged with murder after being stopped for drink-driving and having DNA sample taken .

Sporadic outages of BlackBerry messaging and email today spread to the U.S. and Canada - as problems with the smartphone stretched into the third day for Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. U.S. users were reporting that their BlackBerrys weren't getting email on Wednesday morning, as widespread problems added to the woes of Canadian manufacturer Research In Motion. RIM yesterday admitted a crucial link in its infrastructure had failed - and a backup didn't work either - with the under-fire company now working as quickly as it can to get through a backlog of traffic. Issues: U.S. users were reporting that their BlackBerrys weren't getting email on Wednesday morning, as widespread problems added to the woes of Canadian manufacturer Research In Motion . This isn't the first time Research in Motion has suffered messaging outages with BlackBerry. Its BlackBerry Messenger service went offline in Canada and Latin America last month and a massive disruption hit North America in 2007. But these disruptions are usually contained within one continent or region - whereas in the latest outage they have hit four continents. RIM has not yet said when the outage will be fully resolved or how many people are affected. The firm is suffering from slowing sales and a tablet that has been a dud, while its shares are approaching a five-year low. But there are still about 70 million BlackBerry users around the world. Analysts now estimate that . up to half of them may be affected. ‘The resolution of this service issue is our number one priority right now and we are working night and day to restore all BlackBerry services to normal levels,’ the company said today. In the United Arab Emirates, the two biggest phone companies said they would compensate their BlackBerry users for the mishap by giving them at least three days of free service. Matthew Willsher, chief marketing officer for Etisalat, the country's biggest telecom, said it was acting in response to the 'exceptional and unprecedented circumstances'. Fix required: A Blackberry sign stands outside offices of Research in Motion in England. Sporadic outages of BlackBerry messaging and email service today spread from Europe to the U.S. and Canada . Unlike other mobile phone makers, RIM handles email and messaging traffic to and from its phones, so when it encounters a problem, millions of subscribers are affected at once. Attempts to solve the problem are focusing on a ‘core switch’ failure at BlackBerry’s data centre in Slough, Britain. The core switch is the backbone of the service. It operates like a hi-tech postal sorting office, receiving millions of emails and messages every minute and directing them to the correct recipient. When it fails, a back-up system should kick in, but that did not happen. With every hour, a huge backlog of data builds up - and that is causing the company huge problems. One of the big attractions of the . BlackBerry for overseas users is the BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, which . works like text messaging but doesn't incur extra fees. But BMM was . affected by the outage. The . problems could not have come at a worse time for RIM as Apple is today . releasing software for its iPhones that works like BBM. Apple is one of . the chief causes of RIM's diminishing fortunes. Veteran British entrepreneur Alan Sugar, . who founded electronics company Amstrad in 1968, said he has never seen . anything like it. ‘In all my years in IT biz, I have never . seen such an outage as experienced by Blackberry,’ Lord Sugar tweeted. ‘I can't understand why it's taking so long to fix.’ Former political spin doctor Alastair . Campbell added: 'Some free advice. Explain while you fix. Apologise when . you have. Recompense after.' 'In all my years in IT biz, I have never seen such an outage as experienced by Blackberry. I can't understand why it's taking so long to fix' Veteran British entrepreneur Alan Sugar . RIM shares fell $0.46, or 1.9 per cent, . to $23.95 in morning trading in New York. One joke making the rounds on . Twitter said: ‘What did the one BBM user say to the other? Nothing.’ Matt Bath, technology editor of British magazine Which, said: 'BlackBerry should be doing more to keep customers informed about the ongoing problems with its service. 'In some cases, customers have heard about the issue from their mobile network provider but have heard nothing from BlackBerry itself. That's not great customer service.'","Cruical link fails in infrastructure of manufacturer Research in Motion .

The Silver Phantom is customised to include a colourful umbrella, reminiscent of flashy Penelope Pitstop from classic cartoon Wacky Races. The unusual addition was ordered by Krishna Raja Wodeyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore, to shield his servants from the sun. Pricey: This 1911 Rolls-Royce Silver Phantom owned by the Maharaja of Mysore, right, is set to fetch £400,000 . Luxury Rolls-Royces were popular among Indian rulers because their sturdy construction equipped them to negotiate the tricky terrain. The maharaja who ordered this model in 1911 called it 'Victoria'. He was one of the world's wealthiest men, being worth the equivalent of £35billion at his death in 1940. He was so keen on Rolls-Royces that he used to order them in batches of seven. Within the company, 'doing a Mysore' became a shorthand for placing bulk orders. Krishna IV was the 24th ruler from the Wodeyar dynasty, which ruled Mysore in south-west India from 1399 to the country's unification in 1947. He was called 'Rajarshi' - 'Saintly King' - by Mahatma Gandhi. Colourful: The custom-made car includes an umbrella to keep the sun off the Maharaja's bodyguards... ...but some might say the decor is more suitable for Penelope Pitstop from TV's Wacky Races . His Silver Ghost 40/50hp Six Cylinder . car is being sold by a private collector, and will be auctioned by . Bonhams at the Goodwood Revival meeting on September 16. A spokesman from the auction house said: 'The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost was the origin of the company's claim of manufacturing the ""best car in the world"". 'Rolls-Royce began building their 40/50hp Six Cylinder model in 1907, and it quickly became known as the ""Silver Ghost"". This was a reference to the company's own silver-painted trials car, which earned the name for its pace and silence in operation. 'Such was the evolution of the model, with improved technical details each year and often many times within the year, that it has long been the desire of car collectors to acquire what they consider to be a ""full set"" of pre-war Silver Ghosts, one from each production year.' A second Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, dating from 1908, is also being sold at the same time. It is one of only four surviving examples from that year and was restored in the 1990s.","Krishna Raja Wodeyar, who was worth £35billion, bought SEVEN Rolls-Royces in one go ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:20 PM on 14th October 2011 . In true Clarkson style, the sat nav features the presenter barking: ¿Turn right. Turn RIGHT. You missed it! For the love of ¿!¿ . The BBC has made a humiliating U-turn after breaking its own editorial guidelines in the marketing of a satnav system voiced by Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson. Bosses at BBC Worldwide, the Corporation’s commercial arm, were so keen to rush out the gadget in time for Christmas that they forgot to check their own rules, which dictate that the programme must not promote or endorse any motoring products. Halfords had signed a deal with the BBC and satnav specialist TomTom to stock the product, which costs £180. Some 54,000 are already on the shelves, but once the existing devices have sold out, no more will be produced. BBC Worldwide will now donate the proceeds to Children In Need. In true Clarkson style, the sat nav features the presenter barking: ‘Turn right. Turn RIGHT. You missed it! For the love of …!’ He told The Sunday Times: ‘It is mostly about the tone of voice I use. ‘There’s a tone of voice I use when . ordering people to do things, so, “I said left, left, I said left”, you . know, that kind of thing. ‘It’s not a gentle sat nav voice, put it like that.’ Putting the brakes on: TomTom had already produced 54,000 sat navs featuring Clarkson's voice before the deal had to be scrapped . Actor Brian Blessed is one of the latest celebrities to lend his voice to sat navs following a Facebook campaign. TomTom will also let you download John Cleese, Billy Connolly and Star Wars characters Darth Vader, Yoda and C3PO. Comedian Eddie Izzard has recorded directions in his trademark rambling style, and gravel-voiced Bob Dylan admitted he was considering following suit, before concluding: ‘I always end up at one place — on Lonely Avenue.’ According to the BBC’s conflict of interest rules, presenters ‘must take particular care not to endorse any product or service which could be covered in the programmes on which they work'. Clarkson, who was not involved in setting up the deal, will not receive any money from the sales. A BBC Worldwide spokesman confirmed the U-turn, and said additional charitable donations would be made by TomTom. He added: 'Launch plans were too advanced to prevent the physical product going on sale in retail outlets', by the time the problem was identified. A source said the costs in terms of compensation to TomTom incurred by BBC Worldwide had been 'negligible'. It is understood the electronics firm will talk to Worldwide about further voice deals. Halfords has exclusive rights to sell the product which was launched last week. A spokesman said: 'We are disappointed with the decision by the BBC on behalf of our customers who told us they loved the product. It was proving hugely popular. 'While we have plenty of stock at the moment we will not be able to replace them when they are gone, so the strident tones of voice of Mr Clarkson will be appearing in Halfords for a limited time only and after that he will be silenced, at least on a sat nav.' The Go Live Top Gear edition had a Stig mode, which rendered the device instantly silent, Clarkson's direction and selected points of interest including race tracks and locations relating to the series.","Ruling too late as 54,000 TomToms go on sale in time for Christmas ."
"If Russia ordered the assassination of Litvinenko on British soil it could badly damage diplomatic relations . By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 7:40 PM on 13th October 2011 . The widow of murdered Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko today welcomed a coroner's pledge to question the secret services over his killing. Dr Andrew Reid today ruled there should be a full 7/7-style inquest into the death of the 43-year-old from radiation poisoning. Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said the . decision was 'very important' to her because it meant the inquest would . examine allegations that the Russian state was involved in the killing. If the inquest finds that Russia had ordered the assassination on British soil, it could have huge ramifications on diplomatic relations between the two countries. Relief: Marina Litvinenko, the murdered dissident's widow, pictured today, said she was pleased the inquest would look at Russian involvement in the death . Dr Reid, the St Pancras Coroner, also announced he would ask the Metropolitan Police and intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 to carry out further inquiries. He said he would decide at a later date whether he would hold the inquest himself or ask for a senior judge to be appointed. Former KGB agent Mr Litvinenko, 43, fell ill shortly after drinking tea during a meeting at a West End hotel with former contacts and died in London's University College Hospital on November 23, 2006. Prosecutors have named fellow ex-KGB agent Andrei Lugovoy as the main suspect in his murder, but the Russian authorities have repeatedly refused to send him to face trial in the UK. Under British law, a dead person's family has . the right to an inquest into a suspicious death. This often goes beyond . the medical cause to examine more widely the circumstances of how the . death occurred. An inquest was . opened and adjourned in 2006, but it has been claimed that said the British Foreign Office and . police officials tried to discourage Marina from reopening it . because they feared, respectively, that it would further damage . relations with Moscow and reduce the already remote prospects for a . trial. Last month, Russia said it was prepared to investigate the murder but wanted it to be in a court in their country not in Britain. A leaked U.S. document also showed a Russian official said shortly after the death they had been tracking the assassins but Britain had stopped it. Ben Emmerson QC, for Mrs Litvinenko, told the court the full hearing must consider whether it was a state-sanctioned murder - and also look at the role of the British security services. He said: 'Did Russia murder Litvinenko . is a question that this inquest, if it is going to do anything in the . public interest, has got to be in a position to answer. 'Did MI5 and MI6 have material in . their possession which could have saved him and failed in their duties . is also a question that it must be in a position to answer. 'Finally, it must dispel the insulting . suggestions of suicide and the involvement of the British security . services that are being raised by Mr Lugovoy as a smokescreen to hide . his guilt.' Murdered: Alexander Litvinenko, pictured left before the poisoning and right in his hospital bed, died from radiation poisoning in 2006 . Mr Emmerson said the poisoning of Mr . Litvinenko using radioactive polonium-210 was a case of 'nuclear . terrorism on the streets of London'. The barrister also told the hearing in north London that 97 per cent of the world's legally produced polonium-210 came from a site in Russia. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev insisted during a visit to Moscow by Prime Minister David Cameron last month that suspect Mr Lugovoy - now a Russian MP - would never be extradited to Britain. Mr Lugovoy, who denies all involvement, suggested through his lawyer today that Mr Litvinenko may have killed himself. Jessica Simor told the hearing on his behalf: 'The scope should be wide. It should enable and allow the coroner to investigate the relevant issues so as to dispel the numerous allegations of Mr Lugovoy's involvement. 'In particular the inquest should be able to consider all other possibilities, including death by misadventure and suicide. 'We do not accept that there is an indisputable verdict of unlawful killing in this case.' Probe: A police cordon is put up outside Alexander Litvinenko's north London home following the poisoning five years ago . Neil Garnham QC, for the British Government, argued in favour of a narrower remit for the inquest. He told the coroner: 'There is simply nothing before you to suggest that the bringing of polonium-210 into this country or its use on Mr Litvinenko was something that any public authority here might have prevented.' Dr Reid said it seemed 'inconceivable' that Mr Litvinenko, as a former member of the Russian security services who was granted first asylum and then citizenship by the UK, was not 'on the radar' of MI5 or MI6. Mr Garnham said he could neither confirm nor deny whether the British intelligence services held any relevant documents. Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mrs Litvinenko said she was pleased the coroner would carry out a broad investigation into the death. 'I was waiting for this almost five years since my husband died. Today I actually received a very important decision,' she said. 'The coroner has said there will be a wide inquest into my husband's death. It will therefore include an investigation into the involvement of the Russian state in his murder, which is exactly what I want.'","If Russia ordered the assassination of Litvinenko on British soil it could badly damage diplomatic relations .

A chef who made a hoax phone call claiming his estranged wife was about to board a transatlantic flight with a bomb was jailed for 12 months today. Kevin Flynn, 31, told police that the device was being taken on a New York-bound aircraft by Kerensa Flynn at either Heathrow or Gatwick airports. He made the anonymous call from a phone box in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, on July 31 after the couple had decided to end their relationship and she was to fly home to the U.S. Prosecutor Ed Hand told Chichester Crown Court: 'His motivation was to get her stopped and humiliated.' He said the pair had been having problems in their four-year marriage for some time and they had decided to go their separate ways. Flynn had agreed to give her some time alone to pack her things, but when he returned home found that she had damaged some of his belongings including clothing and photos, the court heard. He called police with the allegations of the damage from their home, before making the hoax 999 call from a phone box some hours later. A transcript of the brief call was read out in which he told the operator: 'I'm only going to say this once, it's an anonymous call. 'There's a Kerensa Flynn or Kerensa Romara-MacMahan currently boarding at Heathrow or Gatwick with a bomb in her bag.' The court heard that police quickly made the connection with Flynn's earlier call about his wife from his home and officers were dispatched to his address in Bognor. At first he denied making the call but on further questioning admitted he had and that it was a hoax. Meanwhile, officers from Sussex Police and the Met Police were sent to Gatwick and Heathrow airports where Ms Flynn was intercepted, with no disruption being caused to other passengers at either site. Mr Hand said that during questioning Flynn told officers about their relationship breakdown. 'Things had come to a head after a period of trouble between the two. 'He said his anger was raised. He had visions of her laughing at him as she was on her plane.' During mitigation, Gareth Morgan, for the defence, said that Flynn's marriage woes had led to problems with alcohol and he had also been badly affected by witnessing the death of his best friend's father in the months leading up to the incident. The court heard he had nine previous convictions for a range of offences including theft and burglary. Judge William Wood QC said he gave Flynn credit for having pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. He went on: 'I take the view that this kind of behaviour in which police resources may have to be wasted to prevent any threat coming to fruition and when there is a chance of large-scale disruption or evacuation of buildings or aeroplanes and airports, this class of misconduct is so serious there is no possibility to do anything but impose an immediate custodial sentence.' Flynn, of Durrington, West Sussex, looked shocked as the one-year sentence was passed.","Kevin Flynn, 31, made anonymous call after couple ended four-year relationship .

On Wednesday, he told the court that . the underwear bomb was a 'blessed weapon to save the lives of innocent . Muslims', and issued his plea in a court outburst. 'The United States should be warned . that if they continue to persist and promote the blasphemy of Mohammed . and the prophets... the United States should await a great calamity that . will befall them through the hands of the mujahedeen soon,' Abdulmutallab said. 'If you laugh with us now we will laugh with you later on the day of judgement,' he said. Abdulmutallab said he was 'guilty . under U.S. law, but not under Islamic law,' and stated his belief that . 'committing jihad against the United States is one of ’the most virtuous . acts' a Muslim can perform.' Prior to his admission, prosecutors' evidence was stacked high. Abdulmutallab was badly burned in a plane full of witnesses. The government said he told FBI agents . he was working for al Qaeda and directed by Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical, . American-born Muslim cleric recently killed by the U.S. in Yemen. Case: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, left, listens as Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Tukel presents opening arguments in U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds today . Bomb: These are the remains of the underpants with the explosive used on a failed plot to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009 . There were also photos of his scorched . shorts as well as video of Abdulmutallab explaining his suicide mission . before departing for the U.S. In September 2010, Abdulmutallab . suggested he wanted to plead guilty to some charges. But he didn't, and . instead dropped his four-lawyer, publicly financed defense team and . decided to represent himself. He said relying on others wasn't in his . best interest. Born in New Mexico in 1971, al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen but the family returned to their native Yemen in 1978. In 1991 al-Awlaki came back to . America to study civil engineering at Colorado State University, then . education studies at San Diego State University and later doctoral work . at George Washington University in Washington. Authorities note that he was arrested in San Diego in 1996 and 1997 for soliciting prostitutes. Al-Awlaki's family is well-known in Yemen. His father is a former agriculture minister, Nasser al-Awlaki. The terrorist was a former imam of mosques in Denver, San Diego and Falls Church, Virginia. Two of those mosques were attended by some of the September 11, 2001, hijackers. In 2004 he travelled to Yemen, . where he taught at a university before he was arrested and imprisoned in . 2006 for suspected links to al-Qaeda and involvement in attacks. In December 2007 he was released . because he said he had repented, a Yemeni security official said. But he . was later charged again on similar counts and went into hiding. Last year U.S. administration authorised operations to capture or kill al-Awlaki. 'Al-Awlaki is a proven threat,' said a U.S. official at the time. 'He's being targeted.' His lawyers at the time said they had . talked to prosecutors about a possible plea deal. Abdulmutallab had . asked the judge what he needed to do to plead guilty to some charges. She referred him to Chambers. Passenger Lori Haskell, 34, of . Newport, watched Abdulmutallab's plea in an overflow room Wednesday. She . called his statement in court 'chilling,' but not surprising. 'I'm just really relieved that it's done with,' Haskell said. The court heard yesterday dramatic . details of how passengers screamed in terror at the young Nigerian . accused of attempting to detonate a bomb in his underwear to bring down a . jetliner. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan . Tuckel described Umar Farouk Abdulmattab as an alleged al Qaeda member . who calmly attempted to blow up the plane and then sat expressionless . while his underwear burned because he had fully accepted his mission of . martyrdom. Meanwhile, shocked passengers aboard the Christmas 2009 Northwest Airlines Flight 253 shouted at him, 'Your pants are on fire!' His mission, his goal, was to blow it . up,' Mr Tuckel said during his opening statement at the trial in U.S. District Court. 'It had to be blown up over U.S. soil.' 'There was a loud pop... smoke... a fireball... the fireball was on the defendant... he was engulfed,' the prosecutor said. Michael Zantow a passenger aboard the . flight who was seated one row away from Abdulmutallab said people were . alarmed by the initial loud pop of the device. He said someone yelled, . 'Hey man, hey dude, your pants are on fire.' 'This guy’s pants is on fire,' another passenger yelled, according to Zantow. Zantow said that passengers struggled . to get Abdulmutallab’s seatbelt off and lifted him out of his seat and . laid him down on the floor with his pants down to his knees and the . device smoldering. Decision: Judge Nancy Edmunds listens to Opening arguments in the trial of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. He has now pleaded guilty to charges relating to the attempted terror attack . Plea: In this courtroom drawing, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab appears in court accused of trying to bring down a jetliner . 'It was bulky and they were burning,' Zantow said. 'It looked like my son’s Pampers.' Zantow echoed Tuckel’s statement in . his opening arguments that Abdulmutallab sat expressionless as he was . enveloped by the flames. 'I never saw any reaction at all,' Zantow said about the 24-year-old Nigerian who faces terrorism charges . for the attempted bombing and conspiracy allegedly organized by Al . Qaeda. Abdulmutallab made numerous trips to . the bathroom and prayed and went through rituals before allegedly . depressing a plunger on a syringe, setting off a chemical reaction of . two high explosives, Tuckel said. In the plane's bathroom, 'he was engaging in rituals. He was preparing to die and enter heaven,' Tukel said. 'He purified himself. He washed. He . brushed his teeth. He put on perfume. He was praying and perfuming . himself to get ready to die.' After returning to his seat, . Abdulmutallab pushed a small plunger on the chemical bomb in his . underwear, an action that produced the 'pop,' the prosecutor told . jurors. The bomb didn't work as planned but . Abdulmutallab was engulfed in flames, said Tukel, who displayed the . flight's seating chart on a screen to show jurors where things happened . on the plane. Abdulmutallab, whose handcuffs were . removed before the jury was seated, sat quietly watching the proceedings . wearing a gray and yellow dashiki and a skullcap.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:32 PM on 28th September 2011 . A woman is accusing Ashton Kutcher of cheating on wife Demi Moore, the same weekend as the couple celebrated their six year wedding anniversary, according to Radaronline. The entertainment website claims the liaison happened last Friday in San Diego, California, after a alcohol-fuelled night out at Fluxx bar with his former That '70s Show co-star Danny Masterson. The  23-year-old woman, who has not been identified, has reportedly hired a high powered Hollywood attorney and has gone into hiding. Cheating scandal: A new report claims Demi Moore's husband Ashton Kutcher hooked up with a 23-year-old woman last weekend . Radar Online says it received the information from 'multiple friends of the woman.' According to one unnamed source: 'She is due to meet with an attorney tonight (Tuesday). She is freaking out.' The Two and a Half Men star's wedding anniversary was on Saturday, September 24, one day after the alleged encounter happened. Sign of trouble? The actress posted this message about 'anger' the night before spending her wedding anniversary apart from her husband . 'Ashton didn't look like someone who was celebrating a wedding anniversary,' one club goer told RadarOnline. Bad timing: The scandal has erupted just one week after Ashton's high profile debut on Two and a Half Men . Moore seemed to hint at trouble on her Twitter page by sharing a quote from Greek philosopher Epictetus. On . September 23, she wrote: 'When we are offended at any man's fault, turn . to yourself & study your own failings. Then you will forget your . anger.' The scandal . also comes as Star magazine, a sister publication of RadarOnline, . released an explosive new report claiming the marriage between Ashton, . 33, and Demi, 48, is 'officially over.' According to Star: 'Ashton and Demi have separated and the marriage is over.' MailOnline contacted Ashton's representatives, but so far they have not responded. A . source close to the pair reportedly told Star magazine: 'The . relationship ended because of Ashton's serial cheating. It's a painful . time for Demi.' In . September 2010, as Mailonline previously reported, Ashton was rocked by . another cheating scandal after Star reported that he had had a fling . with a 21-year-old woman named Brittney Jones. The young woman told the magazine she had sex with the actor inside the Beverly Hills home he shares with his wife. The . magazine also claimed that Ashton was so worried that the alleged . affair would be exposed that he made her delete their text messages, but . Star reported that she didn't remove all of them. Frail: Demi looked more slender than usual and preoccupied on Monday night at a screening of the  new Lifetime movie Five in New York City . Brittney . told Star: 'He looked over the texts and said he wanted me to delete . all the messages from him,' she revealed. 'He then told me he wanted me . to delete the texts I had sent to him. He said they could hurt him.' Despite . the explosive report, Ashton and Demi brushed off the allegations with . Ashton making sure to express just how he felt by taking his Twitter to . make a statement. He said, 'I think Star magazine calling me a 'cheater' qualifies as defamation of character. I hope my lawyer agrees. 'STAR magazine - you don't get to stand behind ""freedom of the press"" when you are writing fiction.' Kutcher's representative also denied the story, while his wife of nearly five years came out in support of her husband. 'Excellent point my love!' and 'No question!' she wrote in response to Kutcher's comments.",Moore hints at trouble with Twitter message about 'anger'

Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were arrested a few . days after Miss Kercher's body was discovered in a pool of blood in .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 10:20 AM on 14th October 2011 . For someone who had an affair with her husband's brother, Natasha Giggs should really stop her mudslinging. Especially when it's directed at the woman she betrayed - that woman being her sister-in-law Stacey. After a blazing row in the street between Natasha, Stacey and her Manchester United player husband, Natasha took to her Twitter page to make horrible comments about his long-suffering wife. Twitter insult: Natasha (left) called Stacey a 'lapdog' on her page on the social networking site after they argued as they ran into each other for the first time since Giggs' cheating was exposed . Natasha, who is estranged from husband Rhodri, Ryan's younger brother, wrote that Stacey was a 'lapdog', presumably in reference to the fact that she has decided to stick by her cheating husband after news of his affairs broke. She wrote: 'That awkward moment when you bump into the one person you never thought you would see again... with his lapdog!!' And Natasha, who revealed her affair . with Giggs after it was alleged he cheated on his wife with former Miss . Wales Imogen Thomas, continued: 'Had a blazing row in the street he is . such a t*t!!!' Online brawl: The scathing row continued on twitter with Natasha branding Giggs a 'tit' and his wife Stacey a 'lapdog' Earlier this week, Ryan, Stacey and Natasha bumped into each other outside a . Manchester restaurant andit soon turned into a public slanging match. Eyewitnesses, who said it was like a scene from Shameless, said drivers stopped their . cars to look at the blazing row as the Manchester United player's wife . screamed 'you s**g' at her former sister-in-law, The Sun reported. Giggs shot back at Natasha: 'You do realise I never cared about you, it was just sex to me', The Sun reported. Tirade: Ryan Giggs, pictured at Manchester airport on Tuesday, went berserk after running into his former lover Natasha . As the argument outside Tung Fong Chinese . restaurant in Worsley, Greater Manchester, continued Giggs, 37, told . his wife Stacey, 34, to wait in the car as he lambasted Natasha for . selling her story. Natasha, 29, who was married to . Ryan's younger brother Rhodri, laughed and just told the footballer she . used the six-figure sum to pay for breast implants, according to the paper. The trio had not seen each other . since June, when news of the affair - including how mother-of-two . Natasha aborted Giggs's child - broke. Betrayal: Natasha was married to Giggs brother Rhodri . They . had carried out their affair, which began in 2003 - the same year Giggs . married wife Stacey Cooke, 32 - in a string of hotels and worked it . around the Premiership fixtures list. The risky behaviour meant the pair were . almost caught by their spouses and family and friends became suspicious . about the nature of their relationship. Two weeks after Natasha claims she had her termination she married Rhodri, 34, in Las Vegas. Gagged: Big Brother star Imogen Thomas was slapped with an injunction by Giggs as he tried to hush up their affair . The newly married couple then threw a belated reception in September for family and friends in Manchester. Ryan was not invited because of an ongoing feud with Rhodri.

"By . Damien Gayle . Last updated at 10:05 AM on 14th October 2011 . Armed with an angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver, the pair stole this gold and bronze cross. The glass-fronted centrepiece holds the relic . A holy relic said to have been taken from the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified has been stolen from an Irish monastery. The miniature artefact brought to Holy Cross Abbey in Thurles, Co Tipperary, in the late 12th century, was taken by two masked men in a brazen daylight raid. Armed with an angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver, the pair stole a gold and bronze cross about 12in high with a glass-fronted centrepiece used to hold the relic. It had been stored securely in a steel-bound display case. Father Tom Breen, parish priest of Holy Cross Abbey, said the relic has been the source of devotion and pilgrimage for the last 900 years. 'I would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic - just leave the artefacts in some church and they will eventually come back to me or we will use a third person,' he said. 'It is impossible to put a value on it commercially or an intrinsic value, and from religious and emotional point of view it's immeasurable. The 'Relic of the True Cross', as it is referred to by the Archdiocese, was given by Pope Paschal II to the O'Brien Kings of Thomond in recognition for their support for the Catholic Church. It was they who founded the abbey which was first consecrated by Cistercian monks in about 1180. The Cistercian Order protected the relic until the monastery was suppressed during the Reformation. In 1801 it was given to the Ursuline Sisters in Blackrock, Co Cork, by Bishop Francis Moylan before being returned to Holy Cross after restoration in 1975. 'I would in my heart feel that the thieves had no real appreciation of what it is they were taking. I would hope that they didn't have any ulterior motive.' Archbishop Dermot Clifford, Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, added his voice to appeals for the cross and relic to be returned. 'The high profile of Holy Cross Abbey rests primarily on its possession of this relic. The unlawful removal of this relic is regarded as an outrage by the people of faith who value its spiritual and historic importance,' he said. 'The faithful are extremely upset at the loss of this irreplaceable and sacred relic. 'While it is not of great material value, it holds significant spiritual meaning for the faithful of the Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly and beyond. 'Holy Cross Abbey will never be the same again unless and until the relic is returned.' The cross housing the relic is known as a monstrance, which sits on a small base and contains a transparent case normally used for holding the communion host. It was housed in a steel-framed display which the thieves used the angle grinder, hammer and screwdriver to break open. The thieves also took a 14th-century silver holy cross, again about 12in high, which had been hanging from a chain and contained two crosses and two dark stones. Three sets of keys had been stolen from the church sacristy in recent weeks. The priests subsequently took precautions to call in locksmiths and change up to ten locks where important artefacts are housed. Father Tom Breen outside Holycross Abbey in Tipperary, where the artefacts were stolen in broad daylight . Father Breen: 'I would like to appeal to the thieves in the strongest possible terms not to damage the relic' The . veneration of relics has been a central part of the Catholic faith . since the fourth century when three crosses were discovered at the hill . where Jesus is said to have died. According . to legend, a sick man was brought to touch each of them in turn. After . touching the third he was miraculously cured, proving its provenance as . the true cross. The cross . was divided up into hundreds of smaller relics, some no more than . splinters, which were sent to churches and monasteries across Europe . where they were venerated. By the Middle Ages, the trade in fakes had become common. So . many forgeries were thought to be in circulation that Erasmus, the . Dutch philosopher, quipped that Christ must have been crucified on a . 'whole forest'. Two women, who had been seen around the church, are suspected of involvement in the theft of the keys. Gardai . said two men who carried out the theft both had their faces covered and . openly carried the tools into the church. A parishioner passed the two . men in the church before the theft. The pair left within a few minutes and fled in a red or wine-coloured VW Touareg jeep which was later found burned out. Gardai . said a third person had been waiting in the getaway car, which had the . partial registration number 06 OY or 06 LK, and went in the direction of . Yellow Lough. The . car was discovered a short time later about two to three miles from the . scene at the Yellow Lough, Thurles, where it had been set on fire. A dark-coloured saloon car was seen in the vicinity of where the VW Touareg jeep was burnt out, travelling at high speed. Gardai in Thurles have appealed for witnesses. The tiny relic was originally brought to the monastery when it was first consecrated by Cistercian monks in about 1180. It is believed to have been a gift from Donal Mor O'Brien, King of Munster, who founded the abbey.

They are the innocent victims of a crazed gunman, brutally killed while visiting an upmarket beauty salon in Orange County, California. Police last night named the eight people who tragically lost their lives in the Seal Beach massacre - a group which includes young mothers, a newlywed and a hard-working business owner, all of whom simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Former marine Scott Dekraai, the ex-husband of one . of the victims, allegedly went on the shooting spree at Salon . Meritage, just blocks from the Pacific Ocean in the seaside . resort of Seal Beach, California, after losing custody of his child. Innocent victims: The eight people who were shot dead in and outside a hair salon in Seal Beach, California, on Wednesday. Clockwise from top left: Laura Elody, Michele Fast, David Caouette, Lucia Kondos, Michelle Fournier, Christy Wilson, Victoria Buzzo and Randy Fannin . Hands tied: Police officers stand with Scott Dekraai following his arrest near the salon on Wednesday . The terrifying attack happened on Wednesday afternoon, the day after Dekraai is said to have been served a . restraining order by his former wife Michelle Fournier after she won . custody of their son Dominic, seven. Ms Fournier, who claimed in court . filings that Dekraai was unstable and physically abusive to her during . their marriage, was murdered, along with salon owner Randy Fannin, . newlywed Laura Elody and Michele Fast, a young mother of two teenage daughters. David Caouette was killed by a shot to the head as he sat in his Land Rover outside the salon. Also murdered were Victoria . Buzzo and Christy Wilson, while Hattie . Stretz, 73, is in a serious condition in hospital. Stretz is the mother . of Laura Elody. At 65, Lucia Kondas was the oldest person killed at the salon. After Wednesday's shooting - the deadliest mass killing in Orange County . history - authorities rushed to the scene and seized Dekraai in a traffic stop half a mile away. He is thought to have been wearing . body armour during the attack. When officers raided his car they found . multiple weapons. As . the town struggled to come to terms with the shocking killing spree, . witnesses said the gunman was embroiled in a domestic dispute over . custody with his ex-wife who worked as a stylist at the salon. Dekraai . is said to have moved to the area two years ago after being honourably . discharged from the military because of a work-related leg injury. He worked on tugboats after . being discharged by the military and walked with a limp . after a boat accident. He allegedly remarried Mindy Miguel, his rehab nurse, who is currently assisting detectives with their investigations. Candlelit vigil: Hundreds of mourners last night gathered in front of the salon to pay their respects to the victims . Devastated: The small community in Seal Beach is struggling to come to terms with what happened . Coming together: Seal Beach is a quiet beach-front city of approximately 25,000 residents located 30miles south-east of Los Angeles . The small community in Seal Beach has . come together to mourn the horrific tragedy, which has claimed the . lives of many of its local personalities. Even Dekraai's friends now insist, if charged, he must face severe punishment. One of his oldest friends, a fisherman named Steve, told ABC News he should face the death penalty if found guilty. 'After what he's put people through - the sorrow and all the people he's hurt - I have to say yes,' he said. Salon owner Mr Fannin died in the shooting after he is said to have confronted the gunman. The murderer shouted 'shut up' as he started to fire, witnesses said. Wife: Dekraai's ex-wife Michelle (left) is among those killed.

Christy Wilson (left) is said to have been a close friend of Michelle Fournier - both died in the shooting. Michele Fast (right) was a 'soccer mom' whose husband coached their daughter's team . A middle-aged . woman called Cindy was having her hair done by Mr Fannin when the gunman . opened fire. She was so unsuspecting that she at first thought it was an early Halloween prank. When eventually she realised what was happening, fear took over. 'He just didn’t stop,' she said. 'Anybody he saw he was shooting. It went boom, . boom, boom. I was afraid he was going to shoot everybody.' 'I could still smell gunpowder in the . air,' witness Riley Riggs, 27, told the Los Angeles Times, adding that the . gunshots were followed by an 'eerie silence' for several minutes. Bodies of the killed and the wounded were scattered throughout the salon, officers said. A police spokesman talks to the media about the shooting outside the community's beach-front police HQ . Grief-stricken: A woman is reflected in the window of Salon Meritage as she wipes away a tear . Mr Fannin's family released a statement following his death describing their 'overwhelming loss'. 'On . the heels of what can only be described as a senseless and unspeakable . tragedy, our family is struggling to not only make sense of Wednesday's . events, but also doing our best to process the overwhelming loss we've . all experienced,' it read. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to the . victims and their families; we humbly ask that the public and press . respect our need for privacy during this trying time.' Kari Salveson of Los Alamitos, who . attended a service for the victims at SeaCoast Grace Church in Seal . Beach, said she had known Michelle Fournier for several years. She said she was aware that she and her ex-husband were involved in a bitter custody dispute over their son. 'She could gab away. She was one of . those girlfriends you could never get enough of. She made you smile and . she made you laugh,' Salveson said. Distress: Onlookers react near the site after the crazed gunman shot dead eight people on Wednesday . Distraught: People gather at a site for friends and relatives of the victims of the deadly shooting . One of Michelle's best friends, Christy Wilson, who is married, also died. Mrs Wilson was reportedly in court with Ms Fournier on Tuesday to testify on her friend's behalf during her custody case. Her . husband Paul said she was always there to stand up for her friend . because she believed helping her win custody from her former husband was . the right thing to do. Victoria Buzzo, 54, was killed just a few months after the death of her father. Her recently widowed mother, Ann Li . Mandri, told the Orange County Register: 'Everybody who knew her loved . her. She was the most wonderful, heart-giving person put on this earth.' Victoria was married to David, her high school sweetheart, and had two sons. Li Mandri added: 'She was very athletic. She was the picture of health.' Battle: Documents relating to Ms Fournier's custody feud can still be seen in the back of her car parked outside the salon . Family: Jackie Hoss and her son Zachary leave after placing flowers in front of Salon Meritage . Yesterday, local youth soccer team Beach Futbol Club sent . out a message to its members announcing that Michele Fast, who is a . mother of one of the players, had died in the shooting. Ms Fast has two . teenage daughters. A message on its website read: 'It is . with great sadness that we write to let you know that one of the . victims in the senseless Seal Beach tragedy was Michelle Fast, wife of . Patrick Fast who manages our Girls U16 White team, and mother of Lisa . Fast a player on that team. Please keep the Fast family in your prayers.' Also killed was newlywed Laura Elody, whose elderly mother, Hattie, was also shot in the salon but is recovering in hospital. Mrs Elody, who was also known by many as Laura Webb, turned 46 this month. She got married just nine months ago. She is said to have been styling her elderly mother's hair when she was . killed.

Controversial Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi today scraped through a crucial confidence vote and lived to fight another day after a razor thin win in parliament. If the no confidence vote had gone through, the 75-year-old premier would have had to resign immediately. Mr Berlusconi, needed 309 votes to secure victory - with a defeat meaning he would have to step down - but he managed to pull the political cat out of the bag with 316 MPs in his favour compared to 301 against him. Ahead of the vote the media tycoon . had predicted a win and there were loud cheers from his majority ruling . centre right coalition, while the opposition jeered and whistled. However it was the 53rd vote of . confidence he has faced since coming to power in 2008 and political . commentators say he cannot last in office for much longer - especially . as he is currently involved in four trials. Professor . James Walston, a lecturer in Italian politics at the American . University of Rome, said: 'It is a zombie government, not clinically . dead but close to being brain dead, lurching from one crisis to another, . golem-like and out of control. 'Worse, actually, because Berlusconi is very much alive to his own appetites and aversions.' Professor Walston added: 'The chances . that this government will run its full term to 2013 are decreasing by . the minute. Spring elections are more and more likely and the overall . prospects are not good.' Immediately . after the vote Mr Berlusconi said he would 'transfer his main working . office inside parliament' to show that he meant to solve Italy's . problems and he added: 'We have managed to beat off the attempted . assassination by the opposition.' Opposition . MP Dario Francheschini of the Democratic Left, said: 'It's evident they . are losing pieces - every time there is a confidence vote their numbers . go down. We have to keep trying and we are not far off.' Vote: Berlusconi won by a narrow margin. He would have had to resign immediately if he had lost . Joker: The Italian PM is involved in four separate court cases . Mr Berlusconi . was under intense pressure after his coalition was defeated in . parliament earlier this week during a vote on the state of the country's . public accounts - as Italy teeters on the edge of an economic crisis. The . sleazy politician - who is currently involved in four trials including . one for having sex with an underage prostitute – had urged parliament to . give him its confidence and added:''This must be done because of the . risks the country is running.'' The . vote came ahead of a massive demonstration planned in Rome for Saturday . with 200,000 protesters expected to vent their anger on how Mr . Berlusconi and his government are failing to deal with the economic . crisis that is threatening to topple Italy. Organisers said the slogan for the rally . would be 'Change Italy to Change Europe' and similar protests were . planned in other cities across the country and extra police have been . drafted in for added security around banks and public buildings.

"By . Rebecca Camber and Rebecca Evans . Last updated at 9:42 AM on 10th July 2011 . The stepson of notorious former gangster Dave Courtney has been shot dead in a suspected gangland assassination over a drugs debt. Genson Courtney, 23, was ambushed as he got into his VW Golf outside his girlfriend's home in Greenwich, south-east London. The victim, whose stepfather has written books about gangland violence, was blasted by a lone gunman in the head and shoulder before his assailant fled on foot. Genson Courtney, left, the stepson of self-styled gangster Dave Courtney, was shot dead in Greenwich, south-east London . A policeman stands at the scene in Greenwich where Genson Courtney was shot in a black VW Golf. Officers are looking for a male suspect seen fleeing shortly after the shooting . Dave Courtney was born in Bermondsey, London, in 1959. The 52-year-old has made a name for himself through his supposed affiliation with famous hardmen such as Reggie Kray. He was only nine when the Krays were jailed, but claims to have arranged security for Ronnie Kray's funeral in 1995. Courtney became infamous as a knuckle-duster wielding debt collector, and claims to have been shot, stabbed and had his nose almost bitten off. He claims to have been found not guilty in 19 separate trials but in January 2009 he was given an 18-month conditional discharge at Bristol Crown Court, on a charge of possessing live ammunition without a firearms certificate. In 2004 he was cleared of attacking his wife Jennifer Pinto over an alleged lesbian affair. Four years earlier, he walked free from the Old Bailey after he was cleared of being part of a plot to plant cocaine on an innocent woman. During the trial he was named as a registered police informant using the alias 'Tommy Mack'. But Courtney insisted he simply took advantage of the system to disguise a relationship with a corrupt detective. 'I have never been a grass,' he said. He is also known to have spent time in Belmarsh prison. In recent times he has become something of a celebrity figure, making a living from appearances in numerous television documentaries and a number of low-budget British gangster films. He also starred in, directed and produced his own film, Hell To Pay. Courtney has published six books - including titles such as Dodgy Dave's Little Black Book - and recorded a version of 'I Fought The Law' with Scottish pop-punks Mute. He refers to himself as Dave Courtney OBE – 'One Big Ego' - and has a painted depiction of himself as a knight in his south London house (pictured above). He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 3.43am. The . street where Genson, a cagefighter, was killed is a five-minute walk from the terraced . house used in a 1990 film based on the lives and crimes of the Kray . twins, in which his stepfather starred. It is also only a short distance from London's O2 Arena. Police suspect a major drugs baron owed thousands of pounds by Genson ordered his execution just before 11pm on Sunday. There is also a theory he could have been lured to the area after being caught up in an ongoing feud between gangs. Yesterday his 52-year-old stepfather said he was ‘shell-shocked’ by the murder. The self-styled gangster spoke . outside the family home in Plumstead, South London, which is named . ‘Camelot Castle’ and decorated with Union Jack flags and a large painted . depiction of himself as a knight with a large knuckle-duster. Courtney said: ‘I’m shell-shocked. Police have been here all day and they are inside now so I don’t want to . say anything other than I’m devastated.’ He then told The Sun: 'He (Genson) was a proper little solja and I was proud of him. 'If anyone needed an advert to say crime doesn't pay then let Genson be that advert. 'We were close - and even shared a cell when we were both in jail earlier this year.' He pleaded for calm as police feared a gang war could erupt over the killing. A family friend said the victim’s mother Jenny, a singer, was inconsolable. She said: ‘The family are in bits. Jenny is talking to the police now and there have been a lot of tears. 'I don’t know what could have brought this on. ‘Genson was such a nice boy, always going to the gym.’ Police were investigating last night whether the victim knew his killer. Officers were quizzing his family and friends about his last movements. Neighbours told yesterday how they . saw two black men speeding in a black VW Golf in the area . moments before the victim was shot dead in the same vehicle, believed to . be a hire car. Detectives fear that the killing may unleash a wave of ‘tit-for-tat’ retribution attacks. Genson's stepfather, known as ‘Dodgy . Dave’, revels in his image as a violent hardman and claims to be the . inspiration behind Vinnie Jones’s role as the debt collector in the . movie, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. The former debt collector has written . a number of books about his underworld exploits in which he claims to . have been shot, stabbed and had his nose bitten off. Courtney, who was jailed in the . Eighties for attacking five men with a meat cleaver, also boasts that he . has been involved in assault and murder. He often focuses on his links with . Reggie Kray and the infamous criminal Lenny McLean and is said to be a . central figure in a loose collection of villains who refer to themselves . as The Firm. Grief: Dave Courtney - pictured here with Genson's mother Jennifer attending the premiere of Mr Nice last year - said tonight he was 'shell-shocked' by the shooting . Mr Courtney, 52, celebrating with his partner Jennifer after being acquitted on charges of perverting the course of justice at the Old Bailey in 2000 . Celebrity-gangster figure Courtney claims to have been involved in assault, murder and debt-collecting, for which he gained a reputation for using a knuckle-duster . This year it was reported that the . author, who refers to himself as Courtney OBE which stands for ‘One Big . Ego', had landed a £15million deal to star in three Hollywood movies. Like his father, Genson was no stranger to police. His father’s website reveals how at . the age of 15, Genson was forced to live rough on the streets when his . parents briefly split up around 2004. The troubled teenager, who attended . Eaglesfield School in Woolwich, committed a number of offences before . moving back in with his stepfather a year later. Yesterday friends and . family left flowers at the scene. One friend said: ‘He was a gentle giant - the nicest bloke you could ever meet’. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Gower . from the Met’s gun crime unit, Trident said: ‘At this early stage it is . believed a male suspect may have run from the scene in the direction of . Christchurch Way, SE10, shortly after the shooting. ‘I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact the police. ‘I would like to reassure anyone . concerned about contacting the police that Trident has great expertise . in protecting witnesses and there are a huge variety of measures that . can be put in place to protect you.’ The street where Genson was killed is a five-minute walk from the terraced house used in a 1990 film based on the lives and crimes of the Kray twins, which his step-father starred in .","Murder scene a five-minute walk from set location of film about The Krays .

"By . Luke Salkeld and Ryan Kisiel . Last updated at 2:38 PM on 13th October 2011 . The first prosecution witness in the Joanna Yeates murder trial is due to take the stand this morning, just one day after jurors were shown her home and nearby final resting place. The jury visited the four-room garden flat where the 25-year-old was strangled on Wednesday. They were greeted by poignant scenes . as, although the carpets have been stripped out by police, there are . clear signs that home has been turned into a crime scene. Much of it is as it would have been . when Miss Yeates arrived back there for the last time, in the run-up to . Christmas last year. Shortly afterwards, it is alleged, she was murdered . by her next door neighbour, Vincent Tabak. Final resting place: The road and verge where Joanna Yeates' body was found dumped on the outskirts of Bristol on Christmas Day last year . Trial: Vincent Tabak has admitted manslaughter but denies the murder of Joanna Yeates last Christmas . The yellow-painted hallway is dotted . with tiny red markers indicating detailed analysis by forensic . specialists, and the white tiles of the bathroom are covered in black . dust used to look for fingerprints. Jurors . examining the home she shared with boyfriend Greg Reardon had been told . to pay special attention to the window above the kitchen sink, from . where, it has been said, Miss Yeates first saw her killer on the night . she died. Mr Reardon has returned to the property to collect his possessions, but Miss Yeates’s clothes, belongings and furniture remain. The . landscape architect’s body was found on Christmas Day, and preparations . for the festive season were clearly on view at the flat. The jury saw a . roll of wrapping paper under a table, an unopened box of Christmas . crackers, and tinsel twisted around a lamp stand and hanging above the . drawn curtains. Getting ready for Christmas: The sitting room in Joanna Yeates's flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol, with tinsel still hanging over the curtains . Miss Yeates's running shoes and snow boots in the hallway of her flat, where Tabak killed her . Normal life: The shoe rack in the hallway beside two litter trays for the pet cat Miss Yeates kept with her boyfriend Greg Reardon . Everyday items left in the flat . include her size five running shoes, a multi-coloured cycle helmet, and . two litter trays for the couple’s pet cat Bernard. On . the shelves in the living room were puzzle games and memorabilia from . the sitcom Red Dwarf, including a picture montage with cast members and . personal messages to ‘Jo and Greg’. Other . items seen by the jury of six men and six women were a bowl of Love . Hearts sweets, a ring-binder full of architecture notes, a box of pain . killers, and letters from a bank. The couple’s double bed and duvet remain . with two wardrobes full of clothes and a bedside table adorned with . perfumes, make-up and cuddly toys. Miss Yeates’s hair dryer and . straighteners lie close by. Untouched: Joanna Yeates' still made bed and the room littered with her belongings as seen by jurors today . Another photograph taken yesterday shows Miss Yeates' bedroom with her personal items on display . Possessions: Beauty products toys and even a drink is left as it was found when she was murdered . A half-used pink bottle of Lacoste scent, and other toiletries – such as Imperial Source Japanese Spa shower gel and Aussie hair shampoo – have been left, next to a packet of face wipes, body lotion and four bottles of pink and red nail varnish. As well as all the signs of Miss Yeates’s life before she was killed, the jury also saw evidence that the flat has remained unoccupied for ten months. Plants have died in the hanging basket outside Miss Yeates’s blue front door and a dead cactus sits on the window sill. The . jury had travelled to the flat in the affluent area of Clifton in . Bristol as part of a ‘site-visit’ during the trial of 33 year-old Tabak. The Dutch national did not take part in the visit, which also took . jurors along the journey Miss Yeates made after leaving work on the . evening of December 17. Making a case: The bathroom in the flat is covered in police finger print dust. A loofah and bottles of shampoo have been left . Front door: The view of the entrance to the flat that she lived in, in Clifton, Bristol . Room: Miss Yeates' kitchen is covered in fingerprint dust while kitchen paper and a sponge are left out . Travelling in a bus with blacked out windows, they were briefly shown the pub she went to with colleagues, and then, accompanied by police, walked to the shops where she purchased a pizza and two bottles of cider, and then the short distance onwards to Flat 1, 44 Canynge Road. Tabak’s QC William Clegg had asked the jury to consider the time it would take to walk the distance from the Hophouse public house – which has CCTV images which the court has been told show Miss Yeates walking home – and her £200,000 flat. The jury was shown Tabak’s flat next door before spending more than 20 minutes inside Miss Yeates’s home. They also visited No 53 in the same street, from where, the court has already heard, witnesses heard screams at the time Miss Yeates was attacked. Mr Clegg had told jurors on Tuesday: ‘We would like you to go there and have in mind whether in your judgment you think it possible that the scream that was made inside the flat of No 44 could possibly be heard if you are standing outside No 53?’ Proximity: A rear view of the house shows Tabak's entrance door on the right and his bedroom window in the centre. The window on the left is that of Miss Yeates' bedroom . He added: ‘The defence are going to suggest it was by no means certain the scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the distance involved.’ The jury later travelled on to Longwood Lane where Miss Yeates’s body was discovered by dog walkers on Christmas Day. A yellow line showed the spot her body was found. Miss Yeates suffered 43 injuries after being attacked by Tabak inside the flat, prosecutors claim. She was said to have suffered a slow and painful death. The jury heard Tabak then put her body in the boot of his car and drove to Asda, where he shopped and sent text messages to his girlfriend saying he was bored. Tabak has admitted manslaughter and denies murder. The trial continues. Memorabilia: Mr Reardon has collected his possessions but Miss Yeates's things remain on the sitting room shelves . Items: A set of Christmas crackers to be used that year and a photo lay on a shelf . Pet lover: The feeding area of her flat where she left cat food, just as jurors saw it today . Mr Clegg also asked the jury to cross over Canynge Road to No 53 and stand by the front door. 'We . would like you to go there and have in mind, having already been to No . 44, whether in your judgment you think it possible that the scream that . was made inside the flat of No 44 could possibly be heard if you are . standing outside No 53? 'The . defence are going to suggest that it was by no means certain that the . scream that was heard was connected to this event at all because of the . distance involved.' Finally, . Mr Clegg asked jurors to walk the short distance to Percival Court, . which is adjacent to the rear of Miss Yeates's flat at 44 Canynge Road. Discussion: Police guard the area around Canynge Road, Bristol, as the jury in the Joanna Yeates murder trial are shown the locations pertinent to the case . Court case: Journalists are yesterday led by police as they retrace Miss Yeates' steps on the night she died . Prosecutors claim Tabak, 33, kept his crime secret for more than six weeks before confessing to a prison chaplain. Nigel Lickley, prosecuting, told the court yesterday that . Tabak pinned down 5ft 4in Miss . Yeates by her wrists as he used his height advantage to overpower his . neighbour. ‘Her neck was held for long enough and . hard enough to kill her,’ the QC said. ‘There was a violent struggle by . Miss Yeates to survive. ‘Death . was not instantaneous. It took sufficient force to kill her. There was . no sign of a use of a ligature. He might have let go but he did not. He . knew that Miss Yeates was in pain and struggling to breathe. Despite . that Vincent Tabak continued to hold and squeeze her neck to kill her.’ Crime scene: Miss Yeates was killed at her flat (left) and her body was hidden in Longwood Lane (right) Mr . Lickley added that a fracture to her nose and bruising to her head . ‘could have been as a result of a forcible contact with the floor or . other object’. Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney concluded Miss . Yeates died of compression of the neck, probably using two hands. The . jury also heard that when Miss Yeates’s body was found eight days later . on Christmas Day, covered by snow beside a country lane, her T-shirt . and bra had been pushed up to partially expose her right breast. Tabak’s . DNA was later discovered on her chest, while police also uncovered . clothing fibres and blood spots linking Miss Yeates to his silver . Renault Megane car. The . 33-year-old university graduate is said to have killed his next-door . neighbour within minutes of her returning to the garden flat she shared . with boyfriend Mr Reardon.","Jurors retrace the steps of landscape architect .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:13 PM on 13th October 2011 . Saying it's time to stop letting convicted killers 'get off that easy,' a Florida state lawmaker wants to use firing squads or the electric chair for those on death row. Rep. Brad Drake, 36, filed a bill this week that would end the use of lethal injection in Florida executions. Instead, those with a death sentence would choose between electrocution or a firing squad. 'I say let's end the debate. We still have Old Sparky. And if that doesn't suit the criminal, then we will provide them a .45-caliber lead cocktail instead,' Drake said. Florida state Rep. Brad Drake (R) has introduced legislation to bring back the firing squad for executions, an idea he came up with sitting at a Waffle House last month . 'There shouldn't be anything controversial about a .45-caliber bullet,' he told the Florida Current. 'If it were up to me, we would just throw them off the Sunshine Skyway bridge and be done with it.' Drake, a Republican, said the idea came to him after having a conversation with a constituent at a Waffle House over the legal battles associated with the September 28 execution of Manuel Valle. Valle's lawyers tried to stop the execution by arguing that a new lethal drug cocktail would cause him pain and therefore constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Courts, however, rejected that argument and let the execution go forward. But Drake said the person at the restaurant questioned why death row inmates should even be allowed to die by lethal injection. Drake said he agreed and decided to sponsor the bill that would mandate a switch. The GOP-controlled Florida Legislature will consider the bill during the 2012 session that starts in January. 'There shouldn't be anything controversial about a .45-caliber bullet,' Drake said of his plan, even though Florida has never used a firing squad before . He said government is spending too much . time listening to advocacy groups and instead should put in place a . death sentence that forces convicted murderers to contemplate their . fates. The execution of Manuel Valle, 61, killed by the new lethal injection cocktail, started Drake thinking about 'cruel and unusual punishment' Lethal injection just allows a person to die in their sleep while a firing squad or electrocution would force death row inmates to think about their punishment 'every morning,' Drake said. 'I think if you ask a hundred people, not even talking to criminals, how would you like to die, if you were drowned, if you were shot, and if you say you were put to sleep, 90 percent of some of the people would say I want to be put to sleep,' Drake said. 'Let's put our pants back on the right way.' Florida first began using the electric chair in 1924. Before then, most executions were carried out by hanging. Florida has never used firing squads. But the state switched to lethal injection in 2000. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush and the Republican-controlled Legislature pushed through the change after several botched electrocutions raised concerns that the state's death penalty would be declared unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court had agreed at the time to hear a challenge to the use of the electric chair. Drake also advocates using Old Sparky, the Florida electric chair seen here. Florida stopped electrocuting inmates in 2000 and has never used a firing squad . Since the state made the switch, a total of 26 people have died by lethal injection, including Valle and serial killers Danny Rolling and Aileen Wuornos. The last state to use a firing squad was Utah, which executed inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010, the first death by firing squad in the United States in 14 years. The state has stopped using firing squads. Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said Drake's legislation would just cause embarrassment for Florida if it were adopted. 'Just when you thought that public policy in Florida couldn't get worse, along comes a state rep who develops proposed legislation from what he overhears at the Waffle House,' Simon said. 'Given all that former members of the Florida Supreme Court and the American Bar Association have said about Florida's broken death penalty system, including the nation's highest number of exonerations, this would be embarrassing – if our legislature were capable of embarrassment.' But Drake said that those who caused suffering and grief for families should get their day of reckoning. 'I just don't think they should be able to get off that easy,' he said.",Brad Drake penned legislation advocating 'lead cocktail'

A solicitor told yesterday how her boyfriend jumped from a 32nd floor balcony during a drunken row, telling her ‘I’m going’. Louise Botham wept as she described the moments before Ryan Guest, 24, leapt 300ft, dying instantly as he landed on a roof below at their luxury beach-front apartment block in Dubai. An inquest heard that minutes earlier, she had gathered up all the presents he had bought her, including teddy bears, and thrown them over the railings, threatening to leave him. Mr Guest, an expatriate engineer, had then stepped out onto the balcony, climbed on a table and turned to Miss Botham, 30, to utter his last words. The successful oil worker had been downing ‘strong cocktails’ with glasses of double rum and coke while also behaving ‘erratically’ when out with friends that evening. She said the couple began to argue as they returned to their £400,000 home and the row continued inside, becoming violent. Miss Botham, from Widnes, Cheshire, had jokingly thrown something at him and he angrily snatched her mobile phone. She said she locked herself in the bathroom as Mr Guest banged on the door and attacked her as she tried to leave. ‘He pinned me down on the sofa and punched me in the arm,’ Miss Botham said. ‘I pushed him off and threw a glass at the TV in anger. ‘I said I was leaving, I hated him. He had hit me and he was never going to see me again. ‘I went into the bedroom and collected up all the presents he had given me, like teddies, and went on to the balcony and threw them all off. He went out on to the balcony, stood on the table and said “I’m going” and then jumped. He just said “I’m going”.’ Tragedy: Ryan Guest jumped on a table, tried to close the patio doors behind him and leapt from the 32nd floor of the luxury flat . Tragedy: Ryan Guest, 24, had just spent a month working on an oil rig when he threw himself from the flat . Fall: The Bahar Tower in Dubai which the geologist jumped from . Miss Botham, who still lives and works in Dubai, said the couple had never rowed before that night in July 2008. She believed alcohol was a ‘primary . factor’ in Mr Guest’s death. ‘He was very impulsive and if he had been a . little bit less drunk, this would never have happened. ‘When other people are drunk they pass out or whatever but Ryan never did. He would get drunk and be totally awake. ‘I think the alcohol was a  primary . factor. I do not think he meant to happen what happened.’ Miss Botham . said her boyfriend was a ‘typical binge drinker’ who used alcohol as a . ‘massive stress relief’ from the pressures of work. She had only recently flown out to live with Mr Guest, from Kendal, Cumbria, after they met in North Wales. He worked for Dubai Petroleum and had been there only a few months after living in New York, Oslo and Latvia. A post-mortem said he died from multiple injuries, the inquest in his home town heard. Miss Botham was arrested by police in . Dubai but later released without charge. Mr Guest’s tearful mother . Frances, from Kendal, told the hearing: ‘He did not mean this to happen. ‘This was not him at all. He would not have given it much thought. We will never know what he was really thinking.’ She said her son was ‘full of life’ and moved at a fast pace, doing everything for fun. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner .

The young male dog - who has since been named Neon - is thought to have been stolen, attacked and them dumped. The bull terrier's jaws were been tied together before he was daubed with pink and purple paint. Paint attack: The two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier had his jaw tied shut before being sprayed with pink and purple paint. He was found in Coventry . Police discovered the animal, aged around two or three, wandering the streets in Coventry. He was handed over to a dogs' home where he has been cleaned up. Darren Calveley, manager of Birmingham Dogs' Home where he is being looked after, said: 'The poor animal has been through so much . caused by pure cruelty and abuse but has remained good natured and will . require rehoming once his wounds have healed and has been given the all . clear by our vet.' He added that the dog - who is still not completely clean - was in a good condition despite the mis-treatment. 'The dog has been assessed and is . understandably nervous at first, but once reassured he is extremely . friendly and loves a fuss,' he said.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 3:21 PM on 22nd September 2011 . Families camped illegally at Dale Farm are still being paid thousands of pounds in housing benefits by the council that is in an ongoing legal battle to have them evicted. Basildon Council pays as much as £53,625 a year for 25 families at the 51-pitch site which the authority says they are entitled to, even though they have not got planning permission. Leader, Tony Ball, said two years ago that benefits for mobile home rent paid to families on the illegal site had been stopped but yesterday it was confirmed that was not the case. Controversial site: Basildon Council pays up to £53,625 in annual housing and council tax benefits to 25 families on the illegal site at Dale Farm . Barricades: Travellers staying illegally at Dale Farm are due to be evicted from the Essex site . Mr Ball said, however: 'I don’t remember saying . all claims had stopped, but was advised a number of claims were . stopped. If I did say that, it was based on the information I was given . at the time and said in good faith. 'Of course if payments are stopped . individuals can appeal or new claims be made and I would not necessarily . be notified.' Travellers at the site can claim up to £25 a week in housing benefit and £845 in council tax - the equivalent of a band B property. The eviction at Dale Farm was due to start on Monday but was stopped by a last-gasp High Court injunction over a technicality. Basildon Council is due to argue its case on Friday and hopes to continue with the site clearance later that day. Council leader Tony Ball had previously said the authority had stopped paying benefits to Dale Farm residents . The heavily fortified gate at the only entrance was opened yesterday to comply with health and safety regulations about access for emergency vehicles. It is understood it will be replaced with a mobile barrier of vans. A dozen caravans entered the site shortly after a pneumatic drill had been used to smash the concrete that was keeping the 30ft barrier in place. Travellers claimed families were returning as they now felt it was safe for children to stay at the camp. But others said the vehicles were returning from nearby empty legal pitches. A source said: 'They broke into the plots on the legal side on Saturday and they are worried about what the owners will do to them if they come back and find their plots occupied. 'There is a feeling that they would rather take their chances with the bailiffs than risk all-out war with the English travellers who own plots on the legal side.' The traveller in the first van to return said: 'I am not leaving again. Not until [council leader] Tony Ball has lost his job and [outspoken local resident] Len Gridley is dead in a coffin.' Cllr Ball said: 'I am extremely disappointed by this latest development – it is irresponsible for the travellers that had previously left the site peacefully to return. 'No efforts have been made to take the main barricade at Dale Farm down either – the gates have simply been opened to allow travellers to return. 'The fact that this main barricade has not yet been removed and is unlikely to be shows a blatant disregard for the law and the obligations of the injunction. 'We must not forget that the travellers have used the law to their advantage at numerous times over the past decade and most recently on Monday, yet they seem to want to pick and choose what parts of the law they obey. 'These actions clearly go against the court order. We have done our bit, and I would continue to urge the travellers to do theirs.' Families have been pitching up at Stockwood Park in Luton since Monday . Dozens of travellers from the site started arriving at Stockwood Park in Luton this week and set up an illegal camp in a public park. Residents have said their disregard for other people was 'disgusting'. One, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'I'm lucky to have a view of trees and a field but I pay taxes to do so. I'd like to know what these people are paying for the privilege. 'There are plenty of places they could go – legal and illegal. Why do they have to be in everyone's faces here?' Bedfordshire Police said they were not involved because it was a civil matter but confirmed patrols had been stepped up in the area. A spokesman added: 'It's council land and it is for them to deal with.' Luton Borough Council said the 'standard legal procedure for eviction' was begun on Monday. A spokesman added: 'We expect to move them on very soon. The target is seven working days, assuming that there are no other complications.'","25 families given £53,625 a year despite having no planning permission .

A lucky ticket holder from Britain has come forward to claim the £101 million EuroMillions jackpot, Camelot has revealed. The life-changing sum is the third-biggest UK payout ever in the European lottery. The winner has not been named, and it is unknown at this stage whether it is an individual or a syndicate, but it will catapult them into the top 1,000 richest people in the land. Jackpot jubilation: Biggest-ever EuroMillions winners Colin and Chris Weir, who scooped £161m in July . A spokesman for Camelot said: 'Nothing more will be released about the win until Monday. 'At that point they [the winner] can decide whether they want to go public or remain anonymous, and all our checks will have been carried out and the win verified.' The jackpot instantly makes them the 703rd richest person in the country – on a par with David Bowie. They will move ahead of celebrity couples such as Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who have fortunes of £95million and £48million respectively. The jackpot had been building up after five draws produced no winners. In July, Colin and Christine Weir won the biggest UK prize in the EuroMillions – an incredible £161millon. The Scottish couple, who had been married for 30 years, are now almost as rich as the Beckhams. 'Mr Scotland' Jordan Steele and model Emily Shakarji pictured in Glasgow in the lead up to last night's huge draw . Scottish couple Colin and Chris Weir scooped the biggest-ever EuroMillions jackpot of £161million earlier this year. The latest lucky British winner may look to the husband and wife from Largs for inspiration on how to spend their fortune. Mr and Mrs Weir decided to buy homes for son Jamie, 22, and 24-year-old daughter Carly, a photography student. They also modestly aimed for driving lessons for them both and said Jamie would probably quit his job at a call centre. The loaded pair also intended to . start their own charity and travel to Cambodia, Thailand and Australia, . where Mr Weir wanted to visit mystical Ayers Rock. Mr Weird jokily said he wanted to keep his 'reliable' Suzuki SX4 and six-year-old Suzuki Ignis. But Mrs Weir insisted she wanted a Lexus Prius Hybrid.‘We’ve got the champagne on ice and look forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into the National Lottery millionaires’ club. A National Lottery spokesman said: ‘This is amazing news – we are absolutely delighted. 'This is the third-biggest winner this country has ever seen and follows hot on the heels of the Weirs. ‘As well as making big winners, . EuroMillions contributes to the more than £30million raised every week . by The National Lottery for Good Causes here in the UK.’ Lottery bosses said demand for tickets peaked between 5pm and 7.30pm before the draw as punters rushed to try their luck. Before . the Weirs, the largest lottery winner in the UK was an anonymous player . who scooped £113million in the EuroMillions last October. The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May. In . February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, . broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest . prize in the history of EuroMillions. The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. Subject to checks, the prize can be paid out as early as Monday morning when the banks open their doors. The millionaires will now be able to buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each. Cash bonus: Nigel Page and Justine Laycock scooped £56million in the EuroMillions last year . Or they could treat themselves to 720 pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie. They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000. For a party to celebrate the win, they could easily afford Barbadian singer Rihanna, who charges £500,000 for a performance. But if they wish to avoid long-lost family members who are no doubt set to come out of the woodwork, the winners could escape to their own private island, such as £100million Rangyai near Phuket in Thailand.

She was sporting a stunning sapphire and diamond ring on her wedding finger today, but Elizabeth Hurley and Shane Warne chose not to comment on the reports he had popped the question when they appeared together at the Dunhill tournament today. Now, the couple have confirmed their engagement by thanking fans for their well wishes over their Twitter accounts. 'Thanks for all your congratulations,' Hurley tweeted, adding a picture of the couple which she said was taken just before the dinner last night at St Andrews where Warne, 42, proposed. Surprise! Elizabeth Hurley and her soon-to-be fiance Shane Warne pictured last night before his proposal at the Dunhill dinner in St Andrews . The Estée Lauder model presumably had no idea that her boyfriend of ten months was about to ask her to marry him as they posed happily for a picture inside the exclusive Old Course Hotel. Miss Hurley was wearing a strapless nude bandage dress and heavy smokey eye-make-up while the Australian cricketer wore a sharp suit and purple tie. The sportsman grinned mischievously at the camera, clearly excited about his plan. And we all know what Elizabeth's answer was to be, as she flashed her stunning ring as she cheered her new fiance on at the tournament again today. Well wishes: Both Elizabeth and Shane tweeted their thanks to fans for their congratulations . The happy couple: Newly-engaged Elizabeth Hurley and Shane Warne posed for photos alongside her nine-year-old son Damien at the Alfred Dunhill Links championship this afternoon . Bling: Hurley proudly flashed her sapphire and diamond engagement ring . The stunning ring, which features a huge square sapphire and two diamonds on either side, looked right at home on Hurley's left hand. The Estée Lauder model, 45, went for a casual look in a pair of navy jogging bottoms, jumper and scarf as she took to the golf course with Warne, who opted for a baby blue jumper and beige trousers. Damien, nine, clutched on to his mother's arm as he posed up for a photo with Hurley and Warne, who will soon be his stepfather. Warne is believed to have proposed in a restaurant at the exclusive Old Course Hotel in St Andrews following a romantic meal. Warne, 42, made the declaration in . front of stunned VIP guests in the hotel’s fine dining Road Hole . Restaurant, sources said. The source said: ‘Shane proposed over . dinner and it was fairly public, not a private affair. 'It was a VIP . crowd in there this evening. It was residents only, including Dunhill . past players. ‘He didn’t get down on one knee, but when it was announced the other guests in the restaurant stood up and applauded. ‘Everyone there was absolutely delighted.’ A spokesman for the Scottish hotel said they were unable to comment on the news. Liz Hurley's impressive sapphire engagement ring (right) bears more than a passing resemblance to the one Prince Charles gave to Princess Diana in 1981, pictured left. That 12-carat oval sapphire, surrounded by a cluster of 14 diamonds, cost £28,500 from Garrard of Mayfair at the time. It was, of course, presented to Kate Middleton by Prince William on their engagement in November last year. Jewellers have reported a rush for similar-looking rings ever since. But sapphire has long been a popular choice for engagement rings as it has come to symbolise love, truth and commitment. In the 12th Century, crusaders would present their wives with sapphire rings to test their fidelity, believing the vivid colour would fade if a woman was unfaithful. Romantic: The pair kissed as they were photographed on the windy golf course today . Happier than ever: While the pair have only been dating for ten months, they seem to be very much in love . Speculation has been rife . Warne was planning to propose to the 45-year-old model and . mother-of-one. They have been dating for only ten months. Warne was divorced in 2006 after ten years of marriage to wife Simone. Hurley divorced textiles heir Arun Nayar in June. Talk of the proposal swept St  Andrews last night.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 4:28 PM on 7th October 2011 . A market trader has been banned from selling a 'morale-boosting' anti-Taliban T-shirt by council bosses who fear it will offend people. The T-shirts, which feature the words 'Taliban Hunting Club' around a target set behind a skull and two guns, have become popular with soldiers on the front line as well as their relatives at home. However stall holder Mark Brown, who runs a military goods pitch a Louth market in Lincolnshire, has been told to stop selling the product by East Lindsey District Council. Controversial: The 'Taliban Hunting Club' T-shirt which was withdrawn from a market trader's stall following a complaint . Today is the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Afghanistan. The authority acted after it received a single complaint from a member of the public about the T-shirts, which were described as 'politically sensitive and offensive'. Mark removed the items from his stall immediately, but he has started a debate on social networking site Facebook to find out if his customers think they are distasteful. He said: 'This T-shirt is worn by troops as a morale booster and by their families and supporters back home. 'I think East Lindsey Council are being somewhat insensitive towards the troops serving out there. 'Everyone has their own point of view on the subject. Decade of war: Today is the 10th anniversary of the beginning of the conflict in Afghanistan . 'East Lindsey told me they had received a complaint and said it was politically sensitive and offensive and I voluntarily withdrew it on Wednesday. 'If people do find it offensive on the Facebook site I will withdraw it from the website.' So far, Mark has sold the t-shirts - unchallenged - at a number of events and market stalls in the area, including the Sandingham Game Fair. Alan Grant, a fellow Lincolnshire stall holder who runs a greeting cards pitch, believes the product should be allowed back on the market. He said: 'I can't see the problem, if it was pornographic I would understand. I think it is too much political correctness.' However other traders have disagreed, with some saying the t-shirt could give the market a bad reputation. Andy Nisbet, who runs a musical instrument stall, said: 'It could be interpreted as racist. It is a very sensitive issue and you should not make fun out of it. 'I doubt it could be sold on a market in a more multi-cultural city so why should it be any different in rural Lincolnshire?' A spokesman from East Lindsey District Council said: 'We are aware people have differing views, but the council received complaints from local people and responded accordingly. Mr Brown agreed to withdraw the product.'","Items are popular with front line soldiers and their supporters back home .

"By . Stephanie Darrall . Last updated at 4:39 PM on 14th October 2011 . A schoolgirl was raped after police failed to act on two phone calls from a former Met officer who saw the victim being attacked, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has ruled. Paedophile Colin Riddall pounced on the teen outside the gates of her school in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, as she walked home from a friend's house. Riddall, 44, gagged and blindfolded his victim and drove her to a quiet lane where he beat her up. This CCTV image shows Colin Riddall loitering at the gates of a school in Quedgley, Glos, moments before snatching the teenager and raping her. The IPCC has upheld complaints against the police over their handling of the case . The attack was witnessed by an . ex-Metropolitan Police officer who called 999 - but police at . Gloucestershire Police graded the call a 'Category Two' incident, . meaning it only required a response within the next four hours. Colin Riddall pleaded guilty to snatching the child from the street and then raping her . The former policeman followed . Riddall's car and again phoned 999 less than 15 minutes later, this time . giving Riddall's registration. But . officers still graded the call a Category Two, despite Riddall's . registration being linked on police computers to another suspicious . incident just four months earlier. An . IPCC spokesman said yesterday: 'There was intelligence indicating that . the vehicle had been seen in suspicious circumstances, apparently . following a group of young girls in June 2010. 'This intelligence report was not viewed and the incident was therefore not re-graded. 'At . 8.19pm the same evening, a 999 call was made to the police reporting . that a 13-year-old girl had been kidnapped by a man in a white car and . seriously sexually assaulted. 'It was later confirmed that this was the same vehicle and driver that had been reported in the two earlier 999 calls.' Riddall - who had no previous convictions - snatched his victim on October 16 last year. He . was jailed indefinitely in February after admitting kidnap, false . imprisonment, sexual assault and assault causing actual bodily harm. Tim Beer, 54, the former policeman who witnessed the attack taking place said he had felt compelled to chase Riddall to get his car registration. Mr Beer, who lives in Cornwall but was visiting relatives at the time of the offence, said: 'I was just having a drive in the country when I passed this car, parked up in Elmore. 'As I looked in I could see a female being frenziedly assaulted by a male. I couldn't see her face, so didn't know at the time how old she was. 'I parked up around the next corner, dialled 999 and told them what I'd seen. This was about 5.40pm. 'I thought I should try and get his number plate so told them I'd go back, which I did. 'But by this time, he'd gone. I sped around looking for him, but was certain I'd lost him, so I went back to Elmore. 'To my surprise, there he was again, parked up near the original spot. 'As I drove past he turned his face away from me, but I could see the girl looked terrified - her face was all red and crumpled as though she'd been crying. 'I turned around again, but as I got close to his car he put his foot down and sped off. 'I've been trained in pursuit, but we were doing 60mph down country lanes and it was getting silly. 'In the end, I memorized the number plate, gave up the chase, and called 999 again with the car's make and registration. 'I . left it to the police to do their job. If I'd known this guy had a . young girl in the car with him, I'd have forced him off the road without . a second's thought. I do feel bad now that I let him go.' Astonishingly, . police only alerted their Automatic Numberplate Recognition cameras to . Riddall's car after his victim called them hours later. She was dumped half naked by the side of the road and stumbled to a friend's house where she raised the alarm. Car valeter Riddall was spotted by police later that night in Wales after fleeing to Aberystwyth, and was arrested just after midnight. Beads from his victim's top were found in his car. And after he was confronted with CCTV images of him loitering outside the school gates he led detectives to the scene of his attack where they found his victim's phone and shoes. Her mother said yesterday she felt  'betrayed and abandoned' by the authorities. The woman, now living in London with her daughter, said the findings of the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission meant nothing to her family. 'The simple fact is the police should have come out when they got that call - they had a witness saying someone was being attacked in a car. How serious does it have to be before they go and check? 'Yes, they've admitted they've made mistakes and they've now made some changes, but that's not good enough. I'm disgusted with the whole system, we feel completely and utterly abandoned.' IPCC Commissioner Rebecca Marsh said: 'We will never know whether a much earlier response to the first 999 call would have been able to partially prevent this assault. But it is clear that the errors in the initial grading of the first call meant that this incident did not receive the appropriate response and led to it being viewed with a misguided lack of urgency by those who subsequently dealt with it.' The IPCC ruled the 999 calls were not dealt with efficiently and resources were not deployed to the incident, but said the calls made no reference to the victim being a child. 'The control room staff were clearly unaware of her age and vulnerability,' said a spokesman, adding that two inspectors, one sergeant and five control room staff were subject to performance advice for their individual inaction in handling the initial 999 call.","Despite calls, IPCC report reveals officers graded call a 'Category Two' incident, meaning it only required a response within the next four hours .

"By . Luke Salkeld and Andy Dolan . Last updated at 12:10 AM on 15th October 2011 . Joanna Yeates’s killer wept in the dock yesterday as harrowing images of her dead body were shown to a court. Photographs were displayed of the landscape architect’s snow-covered corpse lying in a ‘foetal position’ by the side of a country road. Vincent Tabak, 33, who admits manslaughter but denies murder,  covered his eyes and broke down in tears as dozens of pictures of his victim were revealed on screens. In the dock: Vincent Tabak, drawn sitting at Bristol Crown Court today, showed emotion during today's evidence . Jurors, who had been warned of the grim content in advance, were shown 43 separate areas of injury on the 25-year-old victim’s body, including a scratch on her breast and bruising to her neck muscles and wrists, where they were told she had been gripped. Tears: Joanna Yeates dead body was shown to the court today, which caused the accused Vincent Tabak to weep . Forensic pathologist Russell Delaney said Miss Yeates died as a result of compression of the neck, adding: ‘She did not die instantaneously. She would have experienced difficulties in breathing and I would have been expecting her at some point to be in pain. I would have expected her to struggle.’ The pathologist added there were ‘injuries to all four quadrants of the neck, front and back, left and right’, which he said indicated the position of the killer’s hands changed during the ‘dynamic’ attack. Miss Yeates’s parents, who have previously been seated just feet away from the man who has admitted killing their daughter, did not attend court yesterday, as the jury also heard a detailed account of how the body was discovered and then removed from a roadside. A pair of dog-walkers noticed the ‘lump’ on a grass verge as they led their chocolate labrador along a Somerset country lane early on Christmas morning last year, the court was told. After noticing a patch of denim poking through snow, exposed skin, and the waistband of underwear, they called police and guided officers to the body. Miss Yeates had been dead for eight days when she was found lying on her right-hand side, parallel to the road with her knees pointing towards a quarry wall, it was said. As the pictures were shown to Bristol Crown Court, Dutch engineer Tabak, Miss Yeates’s former neighbour, sat next to a female interpreter who helped with translation of scientific terms. He regularly placed his hands across his face, stared at the ground, and removed his spectacles to rub his eyes and cheeks. Body found: Police scenes of crime officers at the spot in Longwood Lane, Failand, after Joanna Yeates' body was found by a dog walker . In the first series of pictures, Miss . Yeates’s body was thickly covered in snow and leaf debris and only small . areas of her body were visible. A police forensic officer then . explained to the court the process by which Miss Yeates’s body was . removed from the scene, including the use of a broom handle to pass . straps underneath her so she could be lifted on to a stretcher.  More . images shown to the court illustrated the progress of post-mortem . examinations carried out by Dr Delaney later that day. The positioning of Miss Yeates’s . clothes were also highlighted,  with her pink T-shirt riding up  her . torso. She was also wearing jeans which remained fastened. David and Theresa Yeates laying flowers at the spot where their daughter's body was found on Christmas Day . The court heard there was no evidence to show Miss Yeates had suffered ‘direct sexual violence’. Pointing out bruising above her right eye and injuries to her nose, Dr Delaney told the court: ‘Bruising only occurs when the heart is beating, so the injuries occurred during life.’ Tabak is said to have ‘squeezed the life’ out of his victim in a ‘desperate’ struggle at her flat in Clifton, Bristol, on December 17 last year before bundling the corpse into his Renault Megane. The trial continues. Pub: Miss Yeates is seen leaving the ladies' toilets in the Ram where she was having Friday night post-work drinks with colleagues .
