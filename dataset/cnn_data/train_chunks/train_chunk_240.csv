"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military is pounding Taliban targets in the country's Swat Valley, trying to clear militants who control parts of the district's main city, military officials said. Pakistani army trucks transport cannons for the military operation against the Taliban. The Pakistani forces had killed 35 militants in Wednesday's fighting, the officials said. The officials said there are reports of some civilian casualties in Wednesday's fighting -- which has been concentrated in Swat's district capital of Mingora -- but they denied local media reports that 35 civilians died. An eyewitness said he saw the bodies of 15 civilians were being taken from a village near Mingora on Wednesday. Twelve of the dead were children. Taliban militants have laid siege to Mingora, looting banks, attacking army headquarters, the police station, and the main power grid station, the officials said. They are also occupying civilian houses and government buildings in the city center, according to the military.  See a map of Taliban-controlled areas » . The fighting has trapped 80 boys inside an orphanage in the city, according to Muhammad Ali, the director of the facility. Another 20 staffers are also holed up inside the four-story building, and they only have enough food for two more days, Ali said. Local government officials issued an evacuation order for the Swat area Tuesday, ahead of the military operation. An estimated 40,000 people have fled Mingora, according to Khushhal Khan, district coordination officer. Government officials warn that the fighting could lead to the exodus of 500,000 civilians.  Watch as thousands flee military offensive » . For the last two weeks, Pakistani troops have battled Taliban fighters in Buner and Lower Dir, two districts bordering Swat. Army generals claim to have killed scores of militants. Fighting continues in those two districts, and the operations are ""progressing smoothly,"" the military said Wednesday. Militants struck a girls' college in the area with rocket fire, partially damaging the building, the military said.  Watch conditions in a refugee camp in Pakistan » . Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley, in exchange for an end to fighting. The government began its military operation after Taliban militants moved into the Buner district and refused to disarm, in violation of the agreement. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari will meet with U.S. President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Wednesday in Washington. Obama is hoping to build an enduring regional alliance with both countries, enlisting them as full partners rather than treating them as battlefields for U.S. soldiers to fight extremists. Last week, Obama said Pakistan's government appears to be ""very fragile"" and argued that the United States has ""huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable"" and doesn't end up a ""nuclear-armed militant state.""

"(CNN) -- Picture this scene: You're just digging into your restaurant meal, the wine is flowing and the ambiance is perfect -- and then, bam! Your dining companion swats away your hand, scolding you for touching the appetizer before she could take a photo. Sound familiar? The trend of photographing one's food, brought about in large part by apps like Instagram, can seem obnoxious on many levels. But Mark Hill, director of photography at Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., says it's all about preserving memories. ""Meals are special times for people ... the picture of the food is a representation of that moment,"" he said. ""Food is very fleeting in our lives. It's on our plate and 20 minutes later it's gone and we have an empty dish."" Those meals become even more special when they are being enjoyed while traveling. Looking back on a photo of a meal eaten overseas can conjure up the sights, sounds, scents and tastes of the trip. This spring, chef and author Anthony Bourdain will take his adventure-seeking appetite -- and CNN viewers -- along on a journey of cultures and cuisine from around the world on his new show, ""Parts Unknown."" Bourdain's tasty excursions may not be something we can all do for a living, but from the coastal piers of New Jersey to the mountainous terrains of Northern Africa, you've experienced amazing off-the-beaten-track meals, too. Here are some of your favorite food photos and the stories behind them. Getting the local fixings . It was early January of this year when Caroline Cheung and her fiance decided to escape the grind of their Torrance, California, lives and head down to the Galapagos. While traveling through Tortuga Beach, they were greeted with sunshine, warm waters and the faint sound of salsa music playing in the background. The music caught Cheung's attention, but it was the incredible aroma of food that drew her closer. ""We watched three ladies prepare and cook fresh fish in a makeshift kitchen with a portable stove and mini-fridge,"" she said. ""It was not really a restaurant, but more like an outdoor public space by the pier with a few plastic tables and chairs, and many local people standing by, waiting for their turn to have a seat,"" she said. Intrigued, she decided to stand in line, where she learned the place offered one dish. ""It was a whole fish that was previously marinated, then dipped in a batter and deep-fried to crispy perfection,"" she said. ""It was served with pickled, spicy onions, fried plantains and rice."" To her surprise, she says the fish, served on a simple Styrofoam plate, was one of the best dishes she tried during her trip. ""It was such a simple dish, served without fanfare, yet a real delight."" Eating with the city . A low-key dinner can sometimes be the most appetizing; at least Gary Ashley thinks so. After days of hiking through the Grand Atlas Mountains, Ashley and his travel partner, John, decided to take a much-needed rest at their riad in Marrakech, Morocco. A riad is akin to a Western-style bed and breakfast. They could have gone to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their trip and John's birthday, but instead they decided to dine on the rooftop of their riad, which overlooks the city. They ordered the Marrakech chicken, which is widely served across the country. The dish consists of chicken slow-cooked as a stew in a tagine -- a traditional Moroccan cooking vessel -- and flavored with whole green olives, preserved lemons and Moroccan spices. It was served on a fluffy bed of couscous. ""It was exceptionally tender and moist and flaked from the bone. The spices were quintessentially Moroccan, and the preserved lemon is something not commonly used here in the West,"" he said. But it wasn't just the dish that he says was the best part of the meal. It was the ambiance of their dinner as well. ""The Riad Siwan had a beautiful rooftop dining area from which we could see most of the city,"" he said. ""The sun was setting and evening calls to prayer were coming from the minarets of the nearby mosques. It was John's birthday and the food, the atmosphere were perfect. Photographs were in order."" Crossing state lines for a tasty getaway . For Pennsylvania resident Cherie Capostagno, there are no mountains to cross to find a delicious dish. In fact, her favorite food is just across state lines. The drive to Belmar, New Jersey, always brings feelings of nostalgia and hunger for her and her husband, Vince. They slip away from home -- and work -- to escape the occasional stresses that build up from their jobs. A few times a year, they make their way to the New Jersey coast to visit their favorite restaurant, Klein's, which she says is known for its delicious lobster dishes. But besides the tender lobster meat steaming fresh out of the shell, she says the seafood joint is simply inviting. ""The restaurant has a fish market in the front and you can watch the guys shuck fresh oysters or you can buy fish at the market if you'd like,"" she said. If the market isn't your ideal setting, you can walk onto the restaurant's deck, overlooking Shark River Inlet. ""We like to sit on the deck and watch the gates open to let the boats go through or watch people paddle-board by,"" she said. But it's the little gems that bring delight to their meals, like seeing swans, like Sammy, swim up to the restaurant. ""Sammy the swan adopted the place as his home and the staff goes down to the dock to play with him,"" she said. ""He swims right up to the tables and at first you aren't sure, but then you realize that Sammy is a regular."" Finding a homemade meal in a new place . Whether it's trekking through the mainland of China or swimming in the waters of Tonga, traveling is a way of life for Natalie Montanaro, who works for the Peace Corps Reserve. So that means she is always trying new dishes. But the South Carolinian said her favorite dish is nothing luxurious. Instead, it's a fresh fish salad called 'Ota 'ika. 'Ota 'ika is a Polynesian dish made with raw fish that is marinated in lemon juice for several hours before it is smothered in a rich coconut milk and mixed with an array of veggies. Montanaro heard people raving about it while she worked as a teacher in Tongatapu, Tonga. ""At first I was skeptical since I'd never eaten any raw fish other than in sushi,"" she said. ""But the seafood here is top rate and it's so fresh you almost want to eat it right out of the water."" The tropical climate and fresh fish was enough of a reason for her to muster up her courage and give the Polynesian dish a try. ""I was completely won over by the lovely taste and texture,"" she said. She adored the dish so much she even learned how to make it. ""But it will never be the same without the local fish and coconuts along with the Tongan company and atmosphere, of course.""","Anthony Bourdain's new CNN show ""Parts Unknown"" inspires others to share dishes from their travels .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed a two-month extension of the payroll tax cut Friday, ending what had been a heated political stalemate and sealing a hard-fought win for Democrats on an issue -- taxes -- that has historically favored the GOP. Earlier in the day, the measure cleared the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives by unanimous consent, a procedural move allowing the measure to pass even though most members of Congress were already home for the holidays. ""This is some good news just in the nick of time,"" Obama said shortly before departing the White House for Hawaii. But ""we have a lot more work to do. This continues to be a make-or-break moment for the middle class in this country."" Among other things, the $33 billion bill also includes a two-month extension of emergency federal unemployment benefits and the so-called ""doc fix,"" a delay in scheduled payment reductions to doctors who treat Medicare patients. Congress will consider a longer extension of all three measures when it reconvenes in January. Obama also signed a separate appropriations bill funding the government through September 2012, wrapping up a legislative year marked by repeated partisan brinksmanship and declining public approval of a seemingly dysfunctional Congress. Political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday extension has eroded Republican strength on the party's core issue of lower taxes. While GOP leaders first questioned the merit of the tax holiday and then complained that a short-term extension would be more trouble than it's worth, Obama used the standoff to portray the Republicans as defenders of the rich with a callous attitude toward the burdens of the middle class. The episode also called into question Speaker John Boehner's control over the House Republican caucus. The speaker, according to multiple accounts, initially favored the two-month extension, which had passed the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. He was then apparently forced to retreat from that position last weekend in the face of a tea party-fueled revolt in which freshman conservatives in particular demanded an immediate 12-month extension. In a virtual party-line vote, the House on Tuesday passed a measure calling for the creation of a House-Senate conference committee to consider ways to pay for an immediate year-long continuation. But congressional Democrats and administration officials, noting previous legislative maneuvering over the issue and a looming December 31 deadline, called the House's terms unrealistic and refused to budge. Top Senate Republicans were also enraged by the actions of their House counterparts, believing that House GOP leaders had backed out of a deal to support the temporary two-month plan. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was among those who ultimately called for House Republicans to relent. Facing rising Republican establishment fears that the GOP was squandering its political advantage on taxes, the speaker again reversed himself on Thursday, this time essentially consenting to the Senate's terms. According to GOP sources, Boehner held a conference call Thursday afternoon with his fellow House Republicans in which the speaker refused to allow any members to ask questions or raise objections. One Republican House member on the call described the speaker as ""tired and ticked off."" Boehner, in announcing the deal to reporters later in the day, insisted the House GOP's prior opposition to the Senate plan was the right thing to do, even if it turned out to be politically questionable. ""It may not have been politically the smartest thing in the world,"" the Ohio Republican conceded, but the end result was ""we were able to fix what came out of the Senate."" Boehner also acknowledged the pressure he was under, saying: ""I talked to enough members over the last 24 hours who say we don't like the two-month extension and if you can get this fixed, why not do the right thing for the American people even if it's not exactly what we want."" The final bill is virtually same Senate proposal House Republicans rejected earlier this week. House Republicans were given slim political cover through the addition of legislative language designed to ease the administrative burden on small businesses implementing the plan, as well as a commitment to continue negotiations on a one-year extension of the tax cut and other benefits. Under the deal, the payroll tax will remain at the current 4.2% rate instead of reverting to the 6.2% rate it was at before the cut enacted last year. Without congressional action, the higher rate would have returned in 2012, meaning an average $1,000 tax increase for 160 million Americans. The typical worker's take home salary would have been reduced by about $40 per pay period without the tax cut. Analysts said Boehner had little choice but to back down. ""It became increasingly obvious he had to fold,"" said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, using poker terminology. Boehner was under ""intense pressure from senior Republicans"" over a situation that ""became so botched,"" he said. Darrell West , the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the issue has worked in the favor of Democrats because they had Republicans ""seemingly willing to accept a tax increase"" by opposing the Senate extension of the payroll tax cut. The conservative Wall Street Journal, in an editorial earlier this week, warned that House Republicans had lost the political advantage of advocating tax cuts to Obama and the Democrats. Some tea party Republicans, however, are now livid that Boehner backed down. ""The House has caved yet again to the President and Senate Democrats,"" freshman Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, said in a written statement. ""We were sent here with a clear set of instructions from the American people to put an end to business as usual in Washington, yet here we are being asked to sign off on yet another gimmick. No wonder the American people are left with a bad taste in their mouths when it comes to Congress."" Asked about Boehner's performance, Huelskamp later told CNN he was ""disappointed in our entire leadership team."" While the congressman told Wolf Blitzer he didn't anticipate a conservative revolt against Boehner, he did expect ""a lot of discussion"" about what the GOP stands for. A number of Republicans have said the party should have declared victory after winning an agreement by Obama -- as part of the larger tax cut package -- to make a decision within the next 60 days on whether to proceed with the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Republicans and some Democratic union leaders say the controversial pipeline will create thousands of new jobs; critics question its environmental impact.

"(CNN) -- With Thursday marking exactly a year to go until the Winter Olympics at Sochi, U.S. ski star Lindsey Vonn faces a race against time to make the Games. The 28-year-old suffered a season-ending injury at the women's super-G in Austria Tuesday and faces surgery on ruptured knee ligaments and a lateral tibial plateau following a dramatic crash. Vonn, who won the downhill gold at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, received 12 minutes of treatment on the slope before being flown to hospital by helicopter. Vonn injures knee in race crash . Expected recovery times from ruptured knee ligaments vary from between six to eight months, but Vonn is adamant she will be back in action ahead of next year's event in Russia. ""First off I want to say thank you to the amazing medical staff that cared for me,"" she said. ""I plan on returning to Vail (Colorado) as soon as I can to have the necessary surgeries. ""I am also grateful to my fans for the outpouring of support, which has really helped me stay positive. ""I can assure you that I will work as hard as humanly possible to be ready to represent my country next year in Sochi."" Vonn has emerged successfully from past injuries, coming back from a shocking crash in downhill training at the 2006 Olympics, which left her with a badly bruised back. In 2007, her season was brought to an abrupt halt with a badly twisted right knee in slalom training at the Are world championships. Victorious Vonn closes on World Cup record . She also suffered a broken finger at the 2010 Olympics, an event which she competed with a shin injury. And with Sochi on the horizon, U.S. teammate Ted Ligety, who won the men's super-G Wednesday also offered Vonn his support. ""That was tough, that was a brutal-looking crash,"" Ligety said. ""Hopefully, I'm sure she'll be strong again next year and fight back and she'll be back to where she was. ""Ski racing is a sport where you have so many teammates get injured and it's such a huge part of the sport that if an athlete ever let that get to them they would never do good ever. ""Because it's such a dangerous sport, it's something that's such a norm having teammates get injured that you can't worry about it because you need to worry about yourself and try to hammer hard and be safe yourself.""

"(CNN) -- Last night's shooting rampage at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, was a nightmare. Authorities have already arrested a suspect. Four weapons were recovered in the shooting scene, including a shotgun and two handguns. Twelve people have been killed, with many more injured. According to law enforcement officials, the weapons were purchased legally by the suspect in the last six months. The shooting was senseless. And it makes us think once again about how we can address the horrific problem of gun violence in America. The first task is conceptual -- can we figure out what will work? The second task is political -- can plausible solutions be implemented legislatively? Opinion: Gun control won't stop mass murder . The conceptual problem is immensely difficult, especially in a society that is already as gun-saturated as America is today. The political problem borders on the impossible. Gun policy in this country is made by the National Rifle Association, and no serious effort at gun control can currently get past its veto. Even when legislation passed during the Clinton years in the form of the Brady bill, requiring background checks at the time of gun purchases, or the assault weapons ban, the NRA succeeded in injecting gaping loopholes into the laws. Who needs to go through a background check at Walmart when you can get your gun without one at the local gun show or from some shady figure on a street corner? The assault weapon ban only prohibited the manufacture of new guns (it grandfathered in a huge cache of pre-existing weapons) and gun manufacturers easily redesigned their guns to circumvent the ban. The NRA then trumpets how ""gun control"" doesn't work. But it can. Commenters debate guns, 'what if' Consider what happened in Australia after a crazed gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996. The Australian federal government persuaded all states and territories to implement tough new gun control laws. Under the National Firearms Agreement (NFA), firearms legislation was tightened throughout the country. National registration of guns was imposed and it became illegal to hold certain long guns that might be used in mass shootings. The gun ban was backed up by a mandatory buy-back program that substantially reduced gun possession in Australia. iReporter: 'AK-47 a weapon for war' The effect was that both gun suicides and homicides (as well as total suicides and homicides) fell. Importantly, while there were 13 mass shootings in Australia during the period of 1979--96, there have been none in the sixteen years since. In 1996, then-Prime Minister John Howard stated that the ""whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make Australia a safer place to live."" The Australian attorney general praised the cooperation and responsibility of Australian firearms owners with the gun controls and buy-back, saying, ""they have been paid cash for their firearms - giving our nation a welcome Christmas gift by removing unnecessary high-powered firearms from the community. It offers all of us the real chance of a safer festive season and New Year."" Opinion: Can we feel safe in a crowd anymore? Of course, the Australian gun control law in 1997 enjoyed an extremely high level of public support and was not hampered by any domestic gun industry (since Australia did not have any). Such would not be the case in the United States where pro-gun political views and NRA power create a very different climate. In the wake of another tragic massacre of innocent lives, we should look carefully at the Australian experience to see if the American public will ever rise up as one against gun violence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John J. Donohue.","A gunman went on a shooting rampage in a movie theater in Colorado .
John J. Donohue: Our gun policy is made by the NRA .
Look to Australia in formulating an effective gun control policy, he says .
Donohue: The question is, will our country ever unify against gun violence ."
"(CNN) -- The Olympic flame is about to start the longest journey in the history of the Winter Games after the torch was passed from Greece to Russia on Saturday. The Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee took possession at the official Lighting Ceremony in Athens ahead of its 123-day journey across Russia, which will encompass 65,000 kilometers until the competition begins in February. ""We are proud to receive the Olympic flame, an important symbol of the Olympic Games,"" said Dmitry Chernyshenko, President of the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee. ""The countdown to the Games starts here! During this relay, the flame will visit over 3,000 towns and cities in across Russia. We want to ensure that all residents of Russia will feel involved in the Olympic celebrations and the unifying power of the flame."" As well as the conventional means of travel -- running -- Chernyshenko said the torchbearers will use Russian troikas, dog sleds, deer-drawn sleighs, snowmobiles, air-balloons, aircraft and trains, according to a report by the state-run Voice of Russia. It said the Olympic torch will be taken under water in Lake Baikal, and to the top of Europe's highest peak, Mount Eblrus. It will also go to the North Pole on a nuclear-powered icebreaker and leave Earth to visit the International Space Station. The Sochi 2014 relay website said that 130 million Russians -- some 90% of its population -- will have the chance to watch or participate directly in the relay, which begins in the Black Sea resort on Monday. Some 14,000 torchbearers will carry it through 2,900 settlements of 83 regions of the country, finishing in Sochi on February 7. The flame was lit last Sunday in Greece, the birthplace of the ancient Games, and made its way through 33 towns before the ceremony in Athens. Greek figure skater Panagiotis Markouizos lit the torch cauldron and passed the flame to a Russian party led by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak. On Sunday it will travel to Moscow accompanied by six-time Olympic speed skating champion Lidiya Skoblikova. The biggest torch relay in the history of the Olympics is the 137,000 km trip around China for the 2008 Beijing Summer Games, which required 21,880 bearers.","Greece hands over the Olympic flame to Russia ahead of Sochi 2014 Winter Games .

"(CNN) -- Malcolm has an intense gaze. He speaks haltingly, at times pausing, haunted by the memories of the past. ""I used to try too hard to dress like a girl to impress people, but still they would ask are you a girl or a boy,"" he remembers. ""I used to pray. I used to pray to God to change me."" Malcolm is transgender. He was born female, but identifies more as male. God didn't change him, couldn't help with his sexual or gender identity turmoil, but others decided they would. ""It's painful because it has been mostly done by my family,"" he says softly, staring off into the distance. ""They wanted to teach me how to behave like a woman. They raped me."" Malcolm was 17 at the time. ""All the people I ran to were just blaming me. I thought maybe my dad would understand, but instead he said 'I have been telling you to behave, to behave like a woman.' He was like maybe I deserved whatever I went through,"" he says, his voice cracking. ""That experience made me hate my family. It made me leave them, and I went and stayed with my grandmother, but unfortunately she also died,"" Malcolm says, dropping his head into his hands. His chest heaves, he cries softly. ""I don't want to talk about that. It's so hard when the people you expect to be near you are just the people who are hurting you the most."" The pain of the memory, of the rejection, the isolation so deep it's almost too much for him to bear. Many are leading a double life . Malcolm is not his real name. Like the vast majority of Uganda's LGBT community, he leads a secret, double life. Kasha Nabagasera peers warily from behind the slightly cracked gate to her home. ""People don't know I live here,"" she explains, smiling half-heartedly. ""I've been kicked out of so many apartments, this is the longest I have stayed in one place, a year. It's rented in someone else's name."" Nabagasera is one of the few gay rights activists who speaks in public in Uganda, a deeply conservative Christian nation that is rabidly homophobic. Evidence of that is everywhere. At Christmas Mass a few hours earlier, Anglican Archbishop Stanley Ntagali praised the country's Parliament for passing the anti-homosexuality bill. ""We love everybody. The homosexuals, the lesbians are children of God. We want them to repent."" He preached to the congregation as it broke out in applause, his voice growing increasingly animated. ""But to say we accept and then tomorrow you begin to see a man bringing a man. Can you imagine that?"" Nabagasera, like many other members of the LGBT community, rarely goes to church, and it's not because she's lost her faith. ""For me it's about love, but now it's about hate being preached in church,"" she explains. So she stays away and prays at home. Nabagasera was just a small child when she received her first beating. ""My class teacher is the one who told me about the word lesbian. I didn't know. It was a big word for me. I was 7 years old."" Since then, she was repeatedly expelled from schools, and worse. ""I escaped rape thrice. I've been beaten on so many occasions I can't remember. I think my stubbornness helped me a lot to go through all of this."" she says. And she's incredibly lucky. Her family didn't shun her. ""My family was there. Most of my friends became school dropouts because their family wouldn't support them. But, sometimes, I would just sit in my room and cry a lot. Why am I being told I have demons? Since I was a child I was told I have demons."" The widespread belief is that homosexuals are possessed by the devil, or victims of sexual deviance brought in by the West. ""Maybe in your country you understand,"" Ntagali lectured us earlier. ""Here it is a new thing, a new idea that is not from here. Someone is imposing it on us. Another kind of colonialism."" The irony, gay rights activists say, is that it was a small group of American evangelicals who came to Uganda speaking out against homosexuality, which was already illegal, that took the persecutions of the LGBT community to an entirely new level. ""They said that the gay movement has a blueprint that has reached Uganda, and if we are not careful we are going to take over the country,"" Nabagasera recalls. But, she says, it didn't stop there. ""They went to Parliament and advised them to change the law. They went to universities and told students we are recruiting them into homosexuality, that we have a lot of money, that they should be careful,"" she says. ""Then they went to parents and told them that we are recruiting their children."" Legislation drops the death penalty . The first draft of the anti-homosexuality bill included the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality,"" defined as homosexual acts with someone who is HIV positive, a minor, or repeated homosexual acts with a consenting adult. ""That wasn't the only shock,"" Nabagasera remembers. ""The other shock was that some members of Parliament said the death penalty by hanging was very weak. They proposed a firing squad. At one point, I posted on my Facebook page and said maybe I am not really Ugandan, because the Uganda I have grown up in cannot be this cruel. Even if I have gone through hardships, it can't really reach to murder."" The bill that just passed through Parliament drops the death penalty, replacing it with life in prison. It also makes anyone who is viewed as a promoter of homosexuality -- like Nabagasera -- a criminal who can be jailed. ""The aim is to protect the institution of marriage and stopping the promotion of homosexuality in our country,"" the architect of the bill, Parliament member David Bahati says. If homosexuality were to be eradicated in the process, it would be a good thing, he says. ""I don't think that homosexuality is a human right,"" he says. The bill, which is still waiting presidential sign off, has been heavily criticized by Western governments and international organizations. The U.S. government has responded by saying, ""As Americans, we believe that people everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality -- and that no one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or whom they love. We join those in Uganda and around the world who appeal for respect for the human rights of LGBT persons and of all persons."" Amnesty International called it ""a grave assault on human rights .... It makes a mockery of the Ugandan constitution."" The United Nations said ""if signed by the President, this new law would reinforce stigma and prejudice, and institutionalize discrimination."" That is already happening. Nabagasera says she's received an increasing number of threats, not taken lightly in a community where so many have a horror story of being beaten and abused. In recent years, Ugandan tabloids have taken to ""outing"" homosexuals. In 2011, after being named in a popular paper under a banner that read ""hang them,"" David Kato was bludgeoned to death. Activists called it a blatant hate crime. ""I would condemn him,"" Kato's mother says, saying she didn't know he was gay until he was murdered. ""I would hate him, but I would counsel him."" Despite that view, she's stigmatized by society because of her son's sexuality. 'Our movement needs a face' Nabagasera says she would rather go to jail than be driven out of her own country. ""I am not going to allow someone to push me out without a fight,"" she says. ""The other thing is our movement needs a face. I don't want them to think they have won because the battle is just starting now. ""It's not that I want just to stay here to be a hero. I want to stay here because my family is here. I want to stay here to visit my mom's grave."" So many just want to be accepted for who they are -- by their nation and by their families -- no matter their sexuality. Even Malcolm, despite what he's been through. ""I hate him,"" he says of his father. ""He only wants to talk to me when he wants money. Sometimes I give it to him, when I have. I don't know where I get that mercy of giving him money."" And Malcolm is adamant that he is going to confront his father. ""I want to tell him to accept me, but he needs to accept me not as a daughter, but as a son."" U.S., Richard Branson slam Uganda's anti-gay bill .

"(CNN) -- What color underwear did you wear on New Year's Eve? Your choice may say something about your culture and your hopes for 2012 -- as might whether you decide to ring in the new year by smashing dishes, respectfully bowing to your elders or feasting on everything from cabbage to sticky rice soup to black-eyed peas. As they do every December 31, revelers around the world spent Saturday-into-Sunday ushering in the new year in distinctive ways. One of the most common was by watching fireworks light up the nighttime sky, though this was just one of many ways people found to celebrate and do all they could to ensure that the next 12 months proceed as they wish. And yes, underwear is one way to state your intentions -- at least in many South American countries, including Brazil and Argentina. If you wore yellow, that supposedly enhances your chances for abundance and reaping in more money. If it was red, then you'll more likely find love in 2012. And if you were sporting white underpants, preferably new and clean, then peace was your top priority for the coming year. One New Year's theme that resonates across borders, ages and ethnic groups is feasting on foods in an effort to boost your prospects for the future. But the menu varies from place to place. Cabbage represents money and sauerkraut is for living a long life for some of Northern European ancestry, for instance. People in Spain and many Latin American countries down 12 grapes, one each to ""guarantee"" a month of happiness. In parts of the American South, year-round favorites black-eyed peas, ham and collard greens carry special importance over the New Year's holiday. People in the nation of Georgia don't count on a chef for good luck. Rather, they rely on the first person to come through their home's door after midnight -- a person who, theoretically, will bring them fortune for the following year. Snacking on candy on New Year's Eve is another way, in the former Soviet territory, to ensure that 2012 is likewise sweet, and not bitter. Brazilians try to optimize their prospects for the coming year by jumping waves or, if they are not near the beach, eating lentil soup or handing out money. Besides raucously banging together pots and pans, Filipinos eat round fruits to bring good fortune. Some New Year's traditions have nothing to do with luck. A front stoop littered with broken plates in Denmark, for instance, suggests that the person inside has a lot of friends since, each New Year's Eve, people throw their old dishes at the doors of their friends' homes. The agenda for fun in Canada depends on where you are, from partying at a ""reveillon"" in Quebec to imbibing Screech rum in Newfoundland to savoring ""beaver tail"" -- a Canadian fried dough treat-- in Ontario. Still, for all those who partake in grand New Year's events, there are many more who make their own traditions. It may be a small gathering of family and friends, watching the Times Square ball drop on TV, or loudly running through the neighborhood. Some may simply go to sleep early, so they can be energized for an early New Year's Day hike -- perhaps while wearing underwear that suits their mood, and wishes, for 2012. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, George Kazarian, Kenneth Ernhofer, John Sanders, Peter Kaplan, Shruti Pant, Guilermo Arduino, Rafael Romo, Jane Lee, Bonnie Turner, Talia Kayali, Sara Yeglin and Armie Jarin-Bennett contributed to this report.","People worldwide celebrate New Year's in different ways .

"Washington (CNN) -- Whatever you think of his politics, House Speaker John Boehner has a great sense of humor. So perhaps he won't mind the question framed this way: What happened, in the course of just one week, to make Speaker Boehner the Miss Emily Litella of immigration reform? (If I have lost you already, take a moment and search the Web to understand the reference -- you won't regret it.) ""Never mind,"" was the trademark closing line of a character the late Gilda Radner made famous as a cast member on ""Saturday Night Live."" And ""never mind,"" is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014. ""Listen, there's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws,"" Boehner told reporters, suggesting White House executive actions to change provisions of the health care law had many conservatives worried the administration wouldn't feel bound by any immigration legislation passed by Congress. Citing that trust deficit, the Speaker added: ""It's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes."" There is without a doubt deep mistrust of the Obama White House in the Republican congressional ranks. But is that mistrust any greater than just a week ago? Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate: . ""This problem has been around for at least the last 15 years, it's been turned into a political football. I think it's unfair, so I think it's time to deal with it."" To be fair, the Speaker a week ago was candid about the disagreements and skepticism within the Republican ranks -- and among Republican base voters critical to 2014 midterm success. ""That's why,"" he said a week ago, ""doing immigration reform in a common sense, step by step manner helps our members understand the bite size pieces and helps our constituents build more confidence that what we're doing makes sense."" But to that point, again just a week ago, the word from House GOP leadership aides was that Boehner wanted to try to see if the House could act this year. And President Obama tried to create some space for compromise, angering some liberals by telling CNN's Jake Tapper he would not prejudge the final product -- opening the door to accepting a measure that provided legal status, but not a fast track, to citizenship for the estimated 11Â½ million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Now, it appears testing that spirit of compromise will have to wait until 2015 or beyond. What changed in a week? Nothing, say key Boehner lieutenants. They insist people, primarily immigration activists and the media, read too much into what the Speaker said a week ago. ""Nothing 'happened' per se,"" a top Boehner aide said in an e-mail exchange. ""We just got started and getting started requires taking a sober view at the challenges that we face. All he did today was outline the challenges we need to overcome."" Those challenges -- the trust deficit as outlined by the Speaker -- are most unlikely to be overcome in a heated election year. Veteran GOP strategist Alex Castellanos, who for years has been urging the GOP to act on immigration, said the politics behind Boehner's shift were easy to understand. ""Nothing the House would do would ever become law,"" Castellanos said -- meaning that even if the House passed something, it was unlikely that differences with the Senate could be worked out this year. So a House debate now, Castellanos said, ""would divide Republicans and become a political weapon Democrats could use against Republicans in 2014."" There is no doubt a vocal slice of the House GOP conference was against acting on immigration this year -- arguing their biggest priority is turning out conservative base voters, many of whom view even legal status as amnesty. And on the Senate side, GOP leader Mitch McConnell had already served notice he had little appetite for revisiting the issue in that chamber before the election. Not only does McConnell face a tea party primary challenge but, as we illustrated last Sunday on ""Inside Politics,"" most GOP strategists see action on immigration this year -- whatever the long-term good it might do Republicans -- as potentially harmful to GOP prospects this year. The raw politics behind that view: In the 11 states where Senate seats now held by Democrats that are top GOP 2014 targets, conservative turnout is critical and the Latino population tiny to small. (West Virginia is lowest with just a 1% Latino population; North Carolina is the highest at 9%.) ""McConnell saying it wasn't going to get done -- burst the balloon,"" said GOP strategist Ana Navarro, another voice who consistently stresses the urgency of acting on the immigration issue, yet sees the short-term political rationale of waiting. So does Castellanos, again despite his longer-term worries about the GOP and the Latino vote. ""Right now, the spotlight is center stage on the Democrats, the President and Obamacare,"" said Castellanos. ""And the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration.""","A week ago, House Speaker Boehner said he wanted to try to act on immigration .

"(CNN) -- ""She has an incredible legacy,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard tweeted. The Labor leader wasn't talking about Britain's Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher, whose funeral on Wednesday was dominating headlines around the world -- she was referring to a race horse. Accolades have been streaming in for Australia's champion mare Black Caviar as the horse was retired after an impressive undefeated 25-win career. ""It's emotional, a lot of people are in shock,"" co-owner Colin Madden told CNN. ""She's a remarkable horse with a remarkable career and it just seemed that the time was right."" ""In my lifetime, she's certainly the greatest race horse I've ever seen."" The six-year-old sprinter, worth almost $8 million in prize money, bowed out after claiming her quarter century victory at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes on Saturday. It marks the end of a record-breaking career for the ""Wonder from Down Under"" who transcended the sports pages to become one of the country's most beloved sporting celebrities. The super mare wasn't just a powerhouse on the track -- she was a treasured personality who appeared on the cover of Vogue, launched a best-selling biography and was named Sportswoman of the Year by Sydney's Daily Telegraph. Unsurprisingly, the retirement of the world's top-rated racehorse led news bulletins in Australia, with Gillard tweeting: ""We've never seen anything like Black Caviar before and may never again. She has an incredible legacy."" Similarly, Australian Liberal opposition leader Tony Abbott tweeted: ""Congratulations Black Caviar. You've done Australia proud, both here and overseas. A remarkable racing career."" The mare's retirement ensured journalists rushed to the stables of Melbourne trainer Peter Moody. ""At the end of the day we believe she's done everything we've asked her to do and she could possibly have done no more,"" Moody told the media throng. ""It's a job well done, and something we can all be extremely proud of. She really gave her all and we thought what else can we achieve? She's been a great shining light for racing."" Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, an air of mystique has followed the world champion thoroughbred. The wonder mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 25 of her races -- with the exception of Britain's Royal Ascot she has won them by staggering margins -- destroying world-class fields to become one of the world's top-rated race horses. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Black Caviar will now enjoy around three weeks to ""take it easy,"" said Madden, before embarking on the next lucrative chapter of her career. ""She'll spend some time in a grass paddock under the sun and the stars,"" he said. ""This is the end of her racing career and the start of her new life as a breeding mare."" ""We'll make a decision sometime in the next two months but at this stage it's most likely she'll stay in Australia."" There had been speculation Black Caviar would mate with champion British thoroughbred, Frankel. The colt, who wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot with an unblemished 14-win record, has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. Madden didn't rule out the possibility of a ""Brangelina"" courtship for the racing supercouple, saying ""He's an extraordinary horse and it could be a wonderful match -- but nothing's been decided and it's something we're still assessing."" One thing however, is for certain -- in her four-year career the unbeatable horse with a luxury name cemented her place in the record books and the hearts of a nation. BBC racing journalist Frank Keogh perhaps summed up her appeal best: ""Built like a bulldozer, performed like a ballerina - Black Caviar is a racing champion who became a cover star.""","Australian super mare Black Caviar retires after undefeated 25 wins .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham stressed his desire to launch a new Major League Soccer franchise on Wednesday, as the former England captain revealed his passion about becoming a future club owner. The former L. A. Galaxy star's potential interest in Miami was leaked on Tuesday, but the footballer-turned-global-icon refused to confirm or deny the reports when speaking at a launch for his new book. ""I'm passionate about staying in football and being an owner of a team is something I'm passionate about,"" the 38-year-old said on a show broadcast live on Facebook to his 30 million followers. ""Miami is one of the places we looked at, and we've looked at others too."" Included in the ground-breaking contract he signed with Galaxy in 2007 was the option to create a new MLS team for $25 million, a right that the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Milan star is now aiming to exercise. ""When I signed my contract six, seven years ago, my manager Simon Fuller actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career and obviously now I've stopped playing,"" Beckham added. Full details have yet to emerge of how the expansion and its funding may come about in a city whose only previous MLS team -- Miami Fusion -- was closed in 2002, after just four years in the league. Yet there is renewed belief that Miami, with many local football fans and a handful of suitable stadiums, could be ready for a new team. Indeed, Italian financier Alessandro Butini is behind a potential rival bid, having created a website -- MIA4MLS.com -- earlier this year to drum up support and suggest designs for a new stadium. Major League Soccer currently has 19 teams, and a 20th club -- New York City FC -- is set to launch in 2015. ""It's going to get better and bigger,"" said Beckham. ""Since I moved there, 11 to 12 teams have come into the league. I have seen the excitement of the people talking about soccer or football."" Ferguson Row . Despite being slammed for a preoccupation with fame by Alex Ferguson in his recent autobiography, Beckham refused to slate the former Manchester United manager as he conducted an innovative digital book-signing session. Instead, he seemed to be half-joking and half-serious when he said he had been hoping to lure the retiree back into the dug-out. ""I'm not going to sit here and be negative about a man who gave me a chance to play for my boyhood team, who I always dreamed of playing for,"" said Beckham, who won six Premier League titles and one Uefa Champions League under Ferguson. ""He believed in me and believed in the rest of the young lads who came through this with us. ""The funny thing was I'm involved in the MLS and bringing my own franchise into the league and actually he was one of the first in my phone book to contact as the manager!"" Beckham conceded that such a prospect was no longer likely and further increased the odds when praising Roy Keane, who was once Ferguson's right-hand man on the pitch but who has since been engaged in a lengthy feud with the 71-year-old. ""For me, Roy Keane is the best captain I've ever played under,"" said Beckham. ""He had two career threatening injuries and he set the example for us young kids. He was the most dedicated and driven player."" Keane has since stepped into the world of football management, with limited success, but Beckham is adamant he will not be following what is a well-trodden path for many former footballers. ""You should never say never, because something may happen in 10 years' time which may make me think I should be a manager but I don't think so,"" he explained. ""It's not something I'm really passionate about. To do something well you have to be passionate about it. I love coaching kids -- my own kids and other kids too -- but management is something that does not float my boat."" During his playing career in the United States, Beckham won two MLS titles with Galaxy, prior to joining French side Paris Saint-Germain in January this year. He played his final game as a professional in May and conceded that his retirement in a match against Brest did not finish in the way he had hoped, as emotion got the better of him. ""As soon as I announced my retirement, I knew the day was going to be tough -- but I didn't think it would be as difficult as it was,"" he revealed on Wednesday. ""I spoke to (coach) Carlo (Ancelotti) before, who told me he would bring me off about 80 minutes. 65 minutes came and all of a sudden I couldn't breathe. ""I got short of breath and I had a real struggle controlling my emotions. I broke down. It was not something I wanted to do, but I couldn't control it."" Images of his final game form part of Beckham's new book, one that takes a pictorial journey through his two decades in the game - even if a whole new chapter looks set to be needed soon.","Beckham says he is 'passionate' about being a club owner as he admits interest in MLS franchise .

"(CNN) -- It is a horse that most certainly meets with Royal approval but for now the Queen is happy for her filly Estimate to luxuriate in the grounds of her Sandringham estate. But even while the four-year-old puts her feet up after a hectic year on the track she is still winning prizes -- adding the prestigious Cartier Stayer Award to her impressive haul of trophies. Estimate's most notable triumph was victory at the 2013 Gold Cup, as a thrilled looking Queen cheered it home from the Royal Box at Ascot. Ridden by Ryan Moore, Estimate stormed to victory in the prestigious Group One race in June, the first time in its 207-year history that the British monarch had owned the winner. But that is not the extent of her exhaustions. Estimate has also won four other English Classics -- the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas, The Oaks and St. Leger -- meaning that only the Epsom Derby eludes her. The Queen received the award at Buckingham Palace on Monday and the footage was shown to around 330 guests who attended the ceremony at London's Dorchester Hotel. The 87-year-old said: ""Thank you very much indeed and it's very nice to accept the award on behalf of Estimate, who did all the work. That's very kind. ""Estimate is sitting in a field at Sandringham now having a rest and watching the deer and things like that. Perhaps she'll come back into training next year. ""I shall be thrilled to keep that (the Cartier Award trophy) and have it as a memento. I was just looking at it and thinking it could join all the trophies we have at Ascot. ""We have all the trophies. I have actually managed to win the Gold Cup, which is unusual."" Horse racing has long been a love of the Royal family, the Queen's father King George VI passing on his love of the sport to his daughter Elizabeth. The Queen Mother also had a passion for steeplechase racing and when she died at the age of 101 in 2002, she could boast 449 winners in her royal colors. ""She adores breeding racehorses,"" the Queen's racing manager John Warren told CNN. ""The British bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the Queen."" Said to name all her own horses, the Queen has Royal studs at Sandringham and Wolferton in Norfolk and Polhampton in Berkshire, with around 25 horses racing a season. The Cartier Horse of the Year gong went to unbeaten three-year-old French filly Treve, who won this year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. She also claimed the French Oaks and Prix Vermeille crowns, emulating the feat of Zarkava in 2008 who also won all three titles in a season. Treve was purchased at auction by the Qatar-based Al Shaqab Racing for Â£50,000, a snip considering its value after winning the $6.25 million Arc.","The Queen's horse Estimate wins the Cartier Stayer Award after a stellar year .

"(CNN) -- U.S. military commanders would no longer be permitted to overrule a court-martial judgment in sexual assault cases under reforms approved by the Senate late Thursday. That and other steps to combat sexual assault in the armed forces were included in legislation outlining military priorities for the fiscal year ending September 30. President Barack Obama said he was giving the military one year to implement reforms in preventing sexual assaults, saying the armed forces need to ""step up their game"" in dealing with the issue. ""If I do not see the kind of progress I expect, then we will consider additional reforms that may be required to eliminate this crime from our military ranks and protect our brave service members who stand guard for us every day at home and around the world,"" the President said in a statement issued Friday. The National Defense Authorization Act passed on a 84-15 vote. It now goes to the White House for the President's signature. The sweeping measure that reconciles a similar bill passed by the House last week also includes a compromise to ease limits on transferring terror suspects held at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to other countries. Obama wants to close Guantanamo, which began housing detainees after the 9/11 attacks. It has been a lightning rod for criticism from civil libertarians and others and the site of high-profile hunger strikes by inmates protesting their treatment. Veteran confronts rape, suicide . The legislation would continue to prohibit transfers to the United States. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted the new flexibility for detainee transfers overseas and said the Pentagon anticipates that it would ""continue this effort"" and ""I think we're making good progress toward that objective."" The Pentagon has recently revived transfers from the facility, including two announced on Thursday to Sudan. Guantanamo now houses 158 detainees. Another centerpiece of the bill enacts reforms and policy changes aimed at combating sexual assault in the military. A Pentagon report earlier this year revealed a troubling increase in the number of military sexual assault cases. The number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30% over the past two years, according to the report released in May. The Senate bill included more than 30 provisions or changes to military law, including one that would take away the long-held authority of commanders to dismiss a finding by a court-martial. It also establishes minimum sentencing guidelines, requires that sexual offenses be included in military personnel records and eliminates the yearlong statute of limitations on rape and sexual assault. Congress did not adopt a proposal pushed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, to remove sexual assault prosecution from the chain of command.","NEW: Obama tells military to ""step up their game"" or he'll consider other measures .

"(CNN) -- Match-fixing is a ""disease"" that could kill football, a top official at the sport's world governing body told CNN on Wednesday. Earlier this month FIFA handed lifetime bans to 41 South Korean players who had been involved in prearranging matches. It followed December's suspension of the president of the South African Football Association ahead of an investigation into match-fixing in the country prior to it hosting the 2010 World Cup. ""I really think that it's a disease and a threat which is on a worldwide basis,"" FIFA's general secretary Jerome Valcke told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""It's not just about Africa. It is in Asia, it is in Europe, it is in North America, it is in Canada, it is in South America. It's all around the world that this match-fixing, or match manipulation, is active."" Valcke was speaking after European football chief Michel Platini branded match-fixing the greatest threat to the future of football in an interview with a French radio station. Platini had warned that football is ""dead"" if the outcome of matches is prearranged, a statement Valcke echoed by saying the appeal of the sport lies in its unpredictability. ""If you know the end of the party, of the game, then definitely football is dead,"" he said. ""That's the beauty of the game, you never know who will be the winner. ""It can be the team you think would win, but it can also be the other team, the opponent who can make it because it's just played on one goal. So that's why we have to protect football as much as we can."" Valcke warned that the fight against the highly lucrative match-fixing business could take 10 years, and urged anyone with knowledge of such activity to come forward. In May 2011 FIFA announced it would donate over $25 million to Interpol over 10 years -- the largest grant the world police organization had ever received from a private body -- with a view to tackling corruption. ""When I was in Rome where we had this meeting with Interpol and 50 of the 53 of the European associations, I heard that the business of match manipulation per year is around 100 billion. I don't know it is in Euros or U.S. (dollars), but whatever, it is 100 billion, it's an amazing figure,"" Valcke said. ""I think it will be a very, very long fight and it will be very difficult to win. And if we want to win, it is all together. Also I told some media in South Africa, if you are aware of anything you should tell us. We have to fight all. ""All the people who love football should be together towards match-fixing. But it will not be a fight of one day as we have other fights which have been there already. And match manipulation will be another fight that will be there for the next decade."" Former Interpol director Ralf Mutschke replaced FIFA's former head of security Chris Eaton -- who joined a Qatar-based sports security consultancy -- in June last year, tasked with tackling the scourge of match-fixing. In the past FIFA's own governance has been questioned. Corruption watchdog Transparency International cut its ties with the body in 2011 when two of its recommendations -- that the investigator charged with overseeing FIFA would be compromised if he was paid by FIFA and that he should be allowed to investigate old corruption scandals -- were dropped. ""There is no limit in what we have to do in order to make sure we can eradicate match-fixing one day in our game,"" Valcke said. ""Or at least to make sure that match-fixing is not a threat anymore to our game.""","FIFA's Jerome Valcke says match-fixing is a disease which could kill football .

"LONDON, England (CNN) --   Bread. For Egypt's middle classes it is breakfast, lunch and dinner. In Egyptian Arabic it is known as ""aish"" which means both bread and life. Bread is the staple food of Egypt's poor -- 40 percent of whom live on around $2 per day . For many Egyptians the flat, round bread is also becoming a symbol of the country's inequalities. Rocketing global commodity prices and failing domestic supplies have made this staple food unaffordable for 20 percent of the country's 76 million inhabitants. The Middle East's most populous country is not alone in these problems. The UN warned economic turmoil could hit many of the world's poorer countries as global inflation spirals -- but with 40 percent of the population living near the poverty line, the price rise has struck particularly hard. Earlier this week, in the gritty industrial city of Mahalla al-Kobra, northern Egypt, a teenager was killed during two days of violent clashes between residents and police. The protesters, who are enraged by low wages and rising prices, also tore down a billboard of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Prime Minister, Ahmed Nazif, rushed to the city to try to head off any further escalation in the civil disturbances and workers were promised bonuses and concessions. But for many Egyptians, these moves are too little too late. On the streets, the popularity of Mubarak's regime is at an all time low. The riots in Mahalla al-Kobra are the latest in a series of flares in social unrest. Read CNN Correspondent, Ben Wedeman's blog about the Egypt crisis . Despite a growing economy and billions of dollars in international investment, average wages remain low and the gulf between the country's tiny elite and the majority of workers grows ever wider. The doubling of prices over the past year and an acute shortage of government subsidized bread has acted as a catalyst to the population's smoldering discontent. All Egyptians can buy the cheap government subsidised bread under a decades old socialist-inspired system that also provides subsidies for public transport and gasoline. As unsubsidized bread -- which can sell at 10 to 12 times the cost of government bread -- becomes unaffordable for a portion of the population the demand for government bread is growing. At the same time the supplies of subsidized bread have also decreased. The population is jaded and many people believe that corruption is behind the shortages. Rumors circulate that subsidized bakeries would rather sell their flour on the black market than use it to produce bread. People have no choice but to wait in line to buy government bread. ""I've been standing here for hours, and we are not close to getting bread yet,"" Mohammed el-Deeb, a manager at a medical company told the Associated Press, ""Of course I need to stand in the line, I can't afford the other bread."" In recent weeks, two people were stabbed and killed when fights broke out over government bread. Five others died from exhaustion caused by hours spent standing in line. There are fears the unrest could emulate the 1997 bread riots in which 70 people were killed after the government raised the price of bread and other subsidized foods. The government is facing a political crisis and has ordered the army -- which normally only makes bread for employees -- to increase production and distribute it to the public. The army opened 10 large bakeries in Cairo and set up 500 kiosks to sell bread to the public, according to the government. Read John Defterios' blog about the Egyptian food crisis . Egypt grows about half the wheat it consumes every year and buys the rest from the world market. Egypt's Finance Minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali says this is what is causing all the problems: ""The price rise is being driven by what is happening in the international markets. The local component is very little."" He also believes the international investment and economic growth needs time to trickle down through the whole population, ""It's not enough. There are 77 million of us. For the 77 million to feel it we need at least five, six, seven years plus of growth,"" he said. But that won't give much relief to the country's citizens, many of whom currently live on $2 a day.  E-mail to a friend .","Bread is the staple food of the Middle East's most populous country .

"(CNN) -- It's a recent Thanksgiving custom as traditional as turkey, stuffing or collapsing on the couch while watching NFL football: the Apple Store's annual announcement of Black Friday discounts. Except that this year, there aren't any, exactly. Instead of marking down prices on Macs or iPads, Apple is giving out Apple Store gift cards to purchasers of various products. The cards are worth an estimated 10-15% of the price for certain Apple devices, and more for accessories. Online and in its North American retail stores, Apple was offering gift cards of up to $150 for the purchase of a Mac, up to $75 for an iPad and up to $50 for an iPod. No gift cards were being offered for iPhones or the new iPad Mini, which went on sale earlier this month. In its European stores, Apple was offering modest discounts on products instead of gift cards. Online sales in the United States began after midnight Pacific time on Friday. Many brick-and-mortar Apple Stores opened at 6 a.m. Some of Apple's competitors are sticking with more traditional Black Friday discounts. A number of items at the Microsoft Store are on sale, and the Sony Store also has a number of Black Friday deals. Last year the Apple Store offered discounts of about 10% for expensive items and up to 40% for cheaper products.

"New York (CNN) -- One person died and at least seven others were injured Sunday after a three-alarm fire broke out in a New York City high-rise, authorities said. Daniel McClung, 27, was remembered by a close friend as a brilliant and beautiful person, inside and out. McClung was a playwright, a deep thinker with incredible wit and an appreciation for art and great music, said friend Dave Brown. He said McClung married his husband this past summer in Boston and that they were very much in love. The couple had recently moved into the high-rise. McClung died after being trapped in a stairwell, said a spokesman for the Office of Deputy Commissioner. The spokesman said a second victim was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. The 32-year-old man is in stable condition, according to police. Fire crews gained control of the blaze, which began on the 20th floor of the high-rise in midtown Manhattan, around noon, according to New York City Fire Department spokesman Danny Glover. The fire was ruled accidental and was caused by pieces of electrical equipment that were plugged into a power strip through several extension cords, Frank Dwyer, a fire department spokesman, said Monday. Witness video obtained by CNN showed flames shooting out of the building and a large plume of black and white smoke. Glover confirmed everyone had evacuated the building. He was unsure of when residents would be able to return. According to Glover, another six people showed signs of possible smoke inhalation. Fire crews received a call around 11 a.m. alerting them to the fire. 2nd body found in Minneapolis apartment building's charred remains .

"(CNN) -- Anyone who climbs a high-security fence at an airport and scurries onto a runway would have to be drunk, on drugs or desperate, one might think. Two men -- at two separate airports in Newark, New Jersey, and Phoenix, Arizona -- did just that on Christmas day. One showed ""indications of possible drug and alcohol impairment."" The other was wearing woman's clothing and was not interested in anything at the airport -- instead he was seeking safety from someone who frightened him, police said. Both men were charged with trespassing and released. The breach at Newark exposed a failure of a $100 million system designed to protect New York City area airports. The Phoenix fence hop was the fifth in a decade at that airport, CNN affiliate KPHO reported. Fleeing in woman's clothing . When Siyah Bryant, 24, allegedly mounted the barrier at Newark Liberty International Airport, it went unnoticed for a day. On Thursday, a review of security camera footage revealed his ascent, according to Port Authority police. The cross-dressed suspect then ran across two runways to get to Terminal C, two police sources said. Nobody saw it, but he was literally on the screen at the time. The security apparatus in the Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) made by Raytheon Co. combines radar with video cameras, motion detectors and ""smart"" fencing, according to the maker's website. The technology part worked. Someone else may not have. Cameras captured images of the intruder and an alarm went off. Police are investigating the actions of the person who monitors the images. An airport employee nabbed the suspect, Port Authority Police Chief Louie Koumoutsos said in a statement. He wants to know ""why it took an unacceptably long time for officers to locate and take into custody a suspect who was being held by an airport employee."" A law enforcement official, who is not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said Bryant told detectives he got spooked while in a car with someone and tried to get away, the official said. The fright was apparently enough to drive Bryant over two big barriers. He allegedly scaled an eight-foot exterior fence and then a 10-foot, high-tech fence equipped with motion sensors and CCTV cameras, said Paul Nunziato, a spokesman for airport police officers. Phoenix drunken folly? Also on Christmas Day, police in Phoenix arrested 49-year-old Robert Bump after he allegedly ran onto the tarmac at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, police said. Tower officials saw a man climb over a fence and run onto the tarmac and taxiway, where he headed for a Southwest Airlines plane, Phoenix police spokesman James Holmes said. The pilot shut down the plane's engines when told the man was approaching. The suspect, who appeared intoxicated, struck the plane's engine with his hands before heading toward the terminal, where he was arrested. Deborah Ostreicher, deputy aviation director at the Phoenix airport, said Sky Harbor some years ago decided against installing PIDS fencing because it was costly and unproven. ""The technology was not something we felt was worth investing in,"" she said. ""It was extremely expensive and not something we felt was warranted."" The airport instead relied on layers of security, including barbed-wire fences, cameras and the eyes of airport workers. Failures in PIDS, at Newark . The Newark breach marked the pricey system's second recent flub. A union official said the system did detect an intruder who scaled a fence at John F. Kennedy International Airport last week but the suspect wasn't apprehended until 10 minutes after being detected by PIDS. ""If the system worked properly we would have caught the guy as he's climbing the fence,"" Nunziato said. The PIDS system generates many false positives and some cameras don't work properly in dark areas. ""Sometimes when it rains, when the wind blows,"" he said, ""the system shuts down."" In August 2012, the PIDS at JFK airport failed to notice a man who walked onto a runway, authorities said. The man, who was arrested after being spotted by an airline employee, told police he was on a Jet Ski on Jamaica Bay adjacent to the runway and became stranded, according to the Port Authority. The man climbed onto the tarmac from the water, but the airport's security system did not detect him. Nunziato said the authority resumed regular police patrols along the perimeters of airports after that breach. Jeff Price, an aviation expert and professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said the intrusion detection technology has been used around prisons and military bases for a long time but was relatively new to airports. ""In this case, you've got older technology that's proven in certain areas, but now you've put it into a new environment, a new dynamic,"" he said. There are no fixed standards for the systems because the federal Transportation Security Administration doesn't require them, Price said. Security in and around airports, as opposed to gates and planes, is handled by local authorities, not the national Transportation Security Administration. All airports, however, report their security plans to the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2012, the TSA was criticized for failing to report, track and fix other types of airport security breaches adequately, according to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general. The agency's report said the TSA ""does not have a complete understanding"" of breaches at the nation's airports. The report was requested by the late New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg after a series of breaches at Newark, including a knife bypassing TSA screening, passengers walking around security checkpoints and a dead dog transported without being screened for explosives. The TSA took action to fix only 42% of the security breaches documented at the Newark airport, according to the report. When compared with other airports studied in the report, Newark was the lowest-scoring when it came to fixing vulnerabilities. 3 things that really happened at an airport .

"(CNN) -- Efforts to rescue a research crew aboard a ship stuck in ice off Antarctica stalled Thursday after sea ice conditions made a key element of the rescue plan risky, Australian maritime officials said. The rescue plan called for a helicopter to ferry the passengers from the MV Akademik Shokalskiy to a Chinese vessel, where they would then board a barge to take them to an Australian icebreaker, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said in a written statement. But the shifting ice conditions prevented the barge from being able to reach the Chinese vessel, the statement said. ""Alternative measures to complete the rescue operation are now being investigated by AMSA and the ships involved,"" the statement said. The news is the latest chapter in a saga that began Christmas Eve after the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in 10 feet of ice. Even if the rescue begins Friday, it will still be weeks before the research team will make it to Hobart, Australia, John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. ""Mid-January is our best guess,"" Young told reporters on a conference call. The rescue plan called for the helicopter, which can transport 12 people each trip, to ferry the ship's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the Chinese icebreaker called the Snow Dragon, or Xue Long, the maritime agency said. The 22 Russian crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, it said. The passengers are then to be transported by barge from the Chinese ship to the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis. That's because the Chinese helicopter can't land on the Australian icebreaker because of load restrictions, and ice conditions make it unsafe to land it next to the ship, AMSA said. ""The preferred option is to wait for conditions that will allow the rescue to be completed in a single operation to reduce unnecessary risk,"" the maritime agency said. The master of the Akademik Shokalskiy has decided to keep the crew members on board until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows the ship to move again, Young said. The vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for ""a very long time,"" he said. Failed rescues . The planned helicopter rescue follows a failed attempt by the Chinese icebreaker, which made it six nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by the ice. That was followed by an effort by the Australian icebreaker, which was forced Monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The Aurora Australis got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back. Over the weekend, an effort by the French icebreaker Astrolabe was called off by the maritime agency. In preparation for the helicopter rescue, members of the research team as well as the crew of the Akademik Shokalskiy marked a makeshift helipad on the ice where the helicopter can land. Video clips posted online by the research team showed people, with arms locked, walking to tamp down the snow. ""As we understand, the helipad was suitable yesterday and will be suitable today,"" AMSA's Richard Wallace said. Once the passengers are safely aboard the Aurora Australis, the ship will complete a resupply mission to Casey Station, an Australian base in Antarctica, before making its way to Hobart, the maritime agency said. Viral sensations . The exploits of the research crew have gone viral, thanks in large part to Twitter and YouTube posts by those aboard the stranded vessel. Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, has tweeted photos of the stranded ship, the crew and penguins, who he said -- according to one post on Twitter -- ""to check out what's going on."" ""The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,"" said Alok Jha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360. ""There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other."" Turney has said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes, Jha and Turney said. The group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer. ""We're the A, A, E who have traveled far, having fun doing science in Antarctica!"" a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on YouTube. ""Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice! ""Really good food and company, but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here! Ice cold, cha cha cha! Ice cold, cha cha cha!"" Spirits strong among passengers on ship stuck in Antarctic ice .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, has been honored in a ceremonial funeral service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. The bells of the landmark domed cathedral rang half-muffled as pallbearers carried Thatcher's coffin to a hearse, ahead of a private cremation and burial. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip were among the more than 2,000 mourners who attended the service. At least 170 countries were represented among them. Mourners included Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid-era president of South Africa. Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger attended but Nancy Reagan -- the widow of Thatcher's ally and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan -- was unable to attend and sent a representative in her place. Live blog: Funeral of Margaret Thatcher . Thatcher died of a stroke on April 8, aged 87. She was accorded a ""ceremonial"" style funeral with full military honors, similar to those of Diana, Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother. The funeral was organized in line with the wishes of Thatcher herself and those of her twin children, Mark and Carol. Serving UK Prime Minister David Cameron and Thatcher's granddaughter Amanda both gave readings, while the Bishop of London, the Right Rev. Richard Chartres gave the address. The bishop noted that the service was a funeral rather than memorial. ""At such a time, the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician; instead, this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling,"" he said. Chartres paid tribute to Thatcher's ""courtesy and personal kindness which she showed to those who worked for her, as well as her capacity to reach out to the young and often also to those who were not, in the world's eyes, 'important.'"" ""Perseverance in struggle and the courage to be were characteristic of Margaret Thatcher, "" the bishop said. ""In a setting like this, in the presence of the leaders of the nation, it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb."" As a mark of respect, the chimes of Big Ben, as the bell and clock tower by the Palace of Westminster are commonly known, were silenced for the duration of the proceedings. The flag at 10 Downing Street flew at half staff. Rewriting history: How UK might have been without Thatcher . A horse-drawn carriage earlier carried Thatcher's coffin through the heart of the British capital to St. Paul's on a procession route lined with British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel. Thatcher's coffin had lain overnight at a chapel at the Palace of Westminster and was taken by hearse to the Church of St. Clement Danes -- the Royal Air Force Chapel -- on the Strand, before being transferred to the gun carriage. As it traveled through the streets, both cheers and boos were heard from bystanders, reflecting the divisive legacy of the politician known as the ""Iron Lady."" Protest threat . The threat of demonstrations -- on top of fears that dissident Irish Republicans may try to act -- heightened security concerns around the funeral and more than 4,000 Metropolitan Police officers were placed on duty for the event. Roads near St. Paul's Cathedral closed and buses were diverted from early Wednesday as part of the security operation. Many Britons blame Thatcher for creating soaring unemployment but supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the British economy. Thatcher: Revered and reviled, in death as in life . By 8:30am local time, supporters had crowded by the railings of the cathedral, some with folding chairs, and police stood on every few yards down the road to the cathedral. At Ludgate Circus, a crowd of about 50 protesters waved Socialist Worker placards, a sign reading ""Anarchists Against Thatcher"" and rainbow-hued ""Peace"" flags. Another held a sign demanding 'Where was her respect for Goldthorpe and the miners?' referring to Thatcher's campaign against the power of coal-mining unions. Protester Hilary Jones said Thatcher had been strident in her beliefs ""and her beliefs were so at odds to a large chunk of the population."" ""There was nothing for many of us to feel proud of during her time,"" she said. But Conservative Party activist Lionel Voke said he credited Thatcher with the success of his business. 'We're here out of respect - to us, she was wonderful. I accept that not everyone sees it the same way, but it's the same if Tony Blair died -- I wouldn't necessarily come, but I'd expect him to be treated with respect, and I'd want him to rest in peace."" Ian Twinn said he had traveled from New York to mark the life-changing impact Thatcher had on him. ""I was a boy in the 1980s. Rightly or wrongly she changed the landscape of the UK forever, and she made me feel I could do anything,"" he said. Thatcher, who led the Conservative Party from 1975 until she was forced to resign in 1990, remained involved in British politics for the next decade or so. She was named Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven after leaving office and served in the House of Lords. She retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several smaller strokes after that.

"(CNN) -- Three weeks ago, Teleka Patrick disappeared. The 30-year-old doctor in residency failed to show up for work on December 6 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The night before, police 100 miles south in Indiana found her car abandoned but not crashed in a ditch off busy I-94. Investigators searched but came up empty. ""We looked everywhere,"" Sgt. Rick Strong of the Indiana State Police told CNN. Now investigators have more potential evidence, about 20 minutes worth. Videos provide clues . Surveillance and home videos uploaded to YouTube provide clues about Patrick's movement in the weeks, days and hours before she vanished. In a different context, the YouTube videos might be considered sweet or romantic. They feature Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown. Patrick's mother told CNN she wasn't aware of any romantic relationship her daughter may have had. But the videos have an intimate feel to them. ""Hi, baby,"" Patrick says in one. ""I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."" In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes. ""If you were here, this is what would be your plate,"" she coos. The two videos were posted in early November. It's not completely clear why they only drew attention now. A third video to surface comes from a local hotel in Kalamazoo. That's where Patrick went on the night of December 5, just hours before police found her car in that ditch. At a little past 7:30 p.m., Patrick, dressed all in black, showed up at a Radisson hotel not far from the hospital where she worked. She spent around 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left. There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room. But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus. Those images provide the last known picture of Patrick. Friends, family shocked . Patrick's disappearance has, from the beginning, drawn shock from many corners. Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida. Her colleagues called her ""part of our family of medical professionals."" And CNN's audience posted by the droves on iReport asking for coverage in the hopes that more information and coverage would propel the case forward. The young doctor was described in comments as ""wonderful,"" ""beautiful"" and ""talented."" The newly discovered videos add to the swirl of questions surrounding this case. Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary. Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators the 30 or so feet out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the trace went cold. ""We have scoured, searched and looked at everything we could possibly look at -- all the exits, all the businesses, all the hotels,"" Strong said. ""We posted fliers; we talked to neighbors (who live near the highway). We did a full-blown, on-the-ground search in the wooded area north of where the car was."" Carl Clatterback, a private investigator hired by Patrick's family, told CNN that investigators are looking into the videos. A central question: Who is Patrick talking to in the videos and does that person know anything about what happened to her? CNN's Tiffany Campbell contributed to this report.","The 30-year-old doctor in residency failed to show up for work on December 6 .

"(CNN) -- After 13-year-old Jahi McMath had a tonsillectomy, she suffered cardiac arrest and loss of blood flow to her brain. Her doctors pronounced her ""brain dead."" But what happened next tragically exposed the challenges and confusion in American medicine over defining death. Is it when the brain stops functioning, or when circulation stops? By California law, if the brain is dead, the person is dead. According to the law in all American jurisdictions, it doesn't matter how death is measured. Doctors who persist in calling patients ""brain dead"" are asking for trouble. These doctors have gotten it. Jahi is on a ventilator. Her parents wanted a second opinion on whether she met the standard tests for the death of the brain. After the second physician confirmed that the criteria were met, the normal next step would have been to pronounce her dead and stop ventilation. But her parents continued to fight, and another extension on turning off her machines was granted. They are scrambling to move her to a facility that will treat her before the court-imposed deadline of January 7. Now the family of Terri Schiavo has joined the battle. Schiavo's case was another high-profile example of the devastation that happens when there are differences on whether someone is alive and whether to keep that person on support. Terri Schiavo, who was not brain-dead but was severely brain damaged, died in 2005 after her feeding tube was disconnected. Her parents fought for years to keep her alive against her wishes, as expressed by her husband. The standard tests for the death of the brain are fairly straightforward. It is not a vegetative state -- it is absence of brain activity, and constitutes a legal measure of death in all states. And no law prohibits continued ventilation of a dead body. We do it routinely to preserve organs for transplant. Jahi's parents have decided to try to continue ventilation -- if you call it life-support you are taking a stand on whether she is dead -- so the issues become who will provide the treatment and who will pay. A significant minority in the medical profession continue to believe people with dead brains and beating hearts are still alive. Believers include some of our wisest minds -- a Harvard professor, an National Institute of Health theorist, a chief of neurology at UCLA, and the former chair of the U.S. President's Council all reject brain-based death pronouncement. They agree with Jahi's parents that death is linked to circulatory loss. Others take a position more liberal than the standard law that defines brain death. They favor pronouncing death in some cases even when some parts of the lower brain are still functioning. I have defended that view since 1973. Why, then, does American law continue to force one standard of death on Jahi's parents and others who have plausible alternative definitions? Once one realizes that the choice among the options is not a cut-and-dried matter of medical science, why not let people have some choice based on their personal religious and cultural views? This is a ""conscience-based"" approach to defining death. We need to have a default public policy -- the brain-based definition currently in law -- but people like Jahi's parents should have the option to record their conscientiously held positions and allow pronouncements of death to be based on those beliefs. That's the law in New Jersey and Japan. That would mean Jahi could be classified as alive if that is what her parents choose. That, of course, doesn't end the controversy. Just like it is not illegal to provide medical support for dead people, it is not necessarily illegal to stop life-support on someone who is still alive. We do that every day, particularly for those who are permanently unconscious. The trouble arises when physicians want to stop life-support, perhaps because they believe the case is hopeless, and the patient or family insist that life support continue. We call this the ""futile care problem."" I defended in court the mother of a severely brain-damaged baby referred to as Baby K who wanted life support to continue even though her doctors wanted to stop. Society should show sympathy for mothers who want their children to be kept alive. If preserving life requires high-tech support like a ventilator, doctors are the ones who should provide it. The costs shouldn't be borne by the hospital. The health insurance company or Medicaid shouldn't pay. But if the family can raise the funds, like Jahi's parents are doing, and the patient is beyond feeling pain, no harm is done by continuing, especially if they can find a facility willing to take the case. Whether this right to medical support should extend to those considered dead by one standard, but alive by another is the question we face with Jahi McMath. If the patient does not suffer, and private funding is available, people should have the right to make this decision for their loved ones. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Veatch.","Jahi McMath has been declared brain dead but parents want her to remain on ventilator .
Robert Veatch: Some define death when brain stops, some say it's when circulation stops .
Veatch: Tragedy shows the confusion around defining death; we need a public policy .
Veatch: Parents should be able to keep her on support if it can be privately funded ."
"(CNN) -- The late House Speaker Tip O'Neill once said, ""All politics is local."" Certainly there is some truth to this in the Roman Catholic Church. Most practicing Catholics experience the church through the parish they attend, and its sacramental life through the priests who minister there. Those priests are ordained for a particular diocese that exists, along with others, within a particular geographic area administered by its local bishop. That bishop is named by the Pope, but it is the Vatican Congregation for Bishops in Rome that has major influence in determining who is selected as a bishop and where he is assigned to administrate. And this is where Pope Francis is making his agenda felt this week. By removing the American Cardinals Raymond Burke and Justin Rigali from the Congregation for Bishops and appointing Cardinal Donald Wuerl, he is signaling the most radical kind of change -- one that will affect the church's hierarchical structure from top to bottom. It is bishops who determine the tenor and emphases of local church communities. The Congregation for Bishops is being peopled by a different kind of person, who will implement Francis' vision of a church governed as much by compassion as by orthodoxy. This is a big deal. While Burke champions traditional marriage, condemns abortion and cherishes fine vestments, Rigali appeared less sensitive to the gravity of the priest-pedophilia tragedy, positions associated with Roman Catholic conservatives. By removing these men, Francis is shifting emphasis and establishing different priorities. But Wuerl is hardly a liberal. While the new bishop of Pittsburgh deviated from his predecessor's practice of washing only men's feet and included women at the Holy Thursday service, a gesture associated with Jesus' serving his disciples, he also accepted Rome's request to serve as coadjutor of the Diocese of Seattle when its bishop expressed views regarding homosexuality, divorce and the priesthood that Rome considered too liberal. He also was executive secretary of a papally mandated study of U.S. seminaries. So he is not so easily pigeonholed as either liberal or conservative. He takes pastoral initiative, seeming to believe that ""authentic power is service,"" as Francis has said, but he is also a loyal son. Described in a 2013 National Catholic Reporter article as ""dead center of the bishops' conference,"" he is reported as saying, ""In the pulpit we're supposed to present the teaching with all of its unvarnished clarity, but when you step out of the pulpit, you have to meet people where they are and try to walk with them."" Francis has reconstituted the Congregation for Bishops beyond the replacement of two American prelates. All of his new appointments to the congregation, we may be sure, accord with his perspective: Compassion and solidarity are at the forefront. He prioritizes the hopes and the anguish of the people he seeks to serve rather than abstract right teaching. Consistent with Francis' own witness to date and his efforts so far to renew the Curia (the Vatican bureaucracy), this appointment of carefully selected men to the Congregation for Bishops, men who share his priorities, may well be the most powerful tool available to him to effect far-reaching and sustained change -- in every parish throughout the entire world. In his book ""Pope Francis: Why He Leads the Way He Leads,"" Chris Lowney begins each chapter with a quotation from Francis. These speak eloquently to why Burke and Rigali have been replaced, not for anything bad they have done but because of the new emphasis Francis desires to bring to his papacy. Introducing ""The New Leader"" chapter: ""Today's world stands in great need of witnesses, not so much of teachers but rather of witnesses. It's not so much about speaking, but speaking with our whole lives."" Perhaps this is why Francis shared his birthday breakfast Tuesday with four homeless men. For Chapter 4, ""Washing Feet: Authentic Power Is Service"": ""This is a symbol, it is a sign. ... Washing feet means, 'I am at your service.' As a priest and as a bishop I must be at your service."" Was it not at an Italian prison that Francis washed feet last Holy Thursday, including the feet of Muslim girls? A third and telling quotation is taken from Francis' address to Brazilian bishops in July: ""(U)nless we train ministers capable of warming people's hearts, of walking with them in the night, of dialoguing with their hopes and disappointments, of mending their brokenness, what hope can we have for our present and future journey?"" No doubt Francis wants to guarantee that those who are appointed bishops are in accord with this perspective. Francis, as he has presented himself, is neither conservative nor liberal. He is not about ideology but about the Gospel. Matthew 25 comes readily to mind: Feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, welcome the stranger, cloth the naked, care for the sick, visit those in prison -- as do the admonitions in Matthew 7:1: ""Judge not, that you may not be judged,"" and 1 Colossians 3:13: ""As the Lord has forgiven you, so you must also do."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alice L. Laffey.","Alice Laffey: Pope signals radical change by upending Congregation of Bishops .

"(CNN) -- Serena and Venus Williams reached the finals of different tournaments for the first time since 1999 Friday as the most famous sister double act in sport warmed up for the opening grand slam of the season. Top-ranked Serena continued her domination of the women's game with a straight sets win over arch- rival Maria Sharapova to reach the Brisbane final, while 33-year-old Venus has reached the title match in Auckland. She benefited from a walkover when fifth seed Jamie Hampton was forced to withdraw before the start of their semifinal with a hip injury. Venus, herself blighted by Sjorgen's Syndrome and other injuries since 2011, will play Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in a battle of former No.1s. Ivanovic showed glimpses of her old form with a 6-0 7-3 win over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens to set up a dream final for the organizers. Likewise in Brisbane, Serena will play second-ranked Victoria Azarenka, who needed over two hours to get past fourth seed Jelena Jankovic, 1-6 6-3 6-4. After a slow start, Azarenka from Belarus, was able to get on top, racing to a 5-1 lead in the decider and then repelling a late Jankovic rally. ""It wasn't the best execution, but she was playing some really good tennis out there today,"" she told the official WTA Tour website. Williams was also extended by third seed Sharapova, who is returning to the WTA Tour after shoulder problems. She took the opener 6-3 but had to recover from 3-1 down in a marathon 68-minute second set to win the tiebreaker 9-7 and progress to the final. 17-time grand slam champion Williams said she was looking forward to locking horns again with Azarenka after splitting four meetings last season. ""She's so intense on court, and off court she's so cool,"" she said. ""When you step on the court I don't know her and she doesn't know me, and we fight like crazy. When it's over, it's over. There's a lot of mutual respect there,"" she admitted. Williams will be looking to wrest the Australian Open title later this month from defending champion Azarenka so Saturday's title match will be an important marker. She and Venus contested eight grand slam finals between them in their heyday, with Serena winning six of them, as the pair dominated the women's game in the early years of the century.","No.1 Serena Williams reaches Brisbane final .

"(CNN) -- Hungary has been warned it could suffer its worst floods ever, as record levels are expected over the next three days from the surging River Danube, which has already inundated parts of Germany, Austria and Slovakia. Read more: Swollen rivers bring more flooding in central Europe . The river is expected to peak near the border with Slovakia, in Nagybajcs, on Saturday morning and in the capital, Budapest, on Monday, according to the European Commission's emergency response center. ""In both areas, the highest-ever-measured water levels are expected,"" it said. Hungary's Water Management Authority said a new record, 20 centimeters (nearly 8 inches) more than the previous high, had already been set at Nagybajcs as of midday Friday. New all-time highs have also been recorded downriver at Komarom, it said. The mayor of Budapest, Istvan Tarlos, said he expects a record of 895 centimeters (almost 30 feet) in the capital but he believes its flood defenses should keep the city safe with about a foot to spare. Nearly 400 people have been evacuated so far, from a number of villages and an old people's home, according to the Interior Ministry's disaster management directorate. About 70 communities have been hit by flooding. The country's military is working on dams along the river's length and is preparing to deploy helicopters and amphibious vehicles if needed. One village, Kisoroszi, is already unreachable by road -- although food and help can be brought in by boat and helicopter -- and is expected to remain cut off for at least a week, authorities said. Roland Farkas, a Hungarian university student, is among the volunteers who've been filling sandbags day and night in the town of Gyor, near the Danube, to be deployed at vulnerable points. He told CNN iReport Friday he feared the country's defenses would fail to hold back the floods in the face of forecast storms. Concern is also growing that the surging Danube might break into a reservoir containing toxic waste in Almasfuzito, near Komarom, potentially leading to water pollution. Environmental campaign group Greenpeace said in a statement that although the dams should in theory withstand the rising water, a report published by the Hungarian Academy of Science last year suggested some toxic sludge could be washed into the water system through the ground water. The reservoir is being closely monitored but the government remains anxious about its safety, the statement said, citing comments by Hungary's prime minister. Evacuations along the Elbe . Meanwhile, the swollen Elbe River menaces the state of Saxony-Anhalt in eastern Germany, where thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes a day after the flow peaked in Dresden, in Saxony. Flood defenses saved the center of the historic city from serious damage. But aerial footage taken by CNN showed swaths of the outlying areas and beyond under feet of muddy brown water. Industrial containers are among the debris swept up by the torrent, prompting further concerns over safety. The cost of damage to homes, businesses and agriculture is likely to run to hundreds of millions of euros. German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised 100 million euros ($132 million) in emergency aid Tuesday. The water is still rising in the Elbe as it makes its way toward the North Sea, according to the European Commission, and it is expected to peak in Saxony-Anhalt on Tuesday. Residents are being evacuated from the cities of Halle and Bitterfeld in the state. In the state of Saxony, to the south, many areas remain under water, the European Commission said, and transport, electricity and water supply are still disrupted. As of Friday, about 12,000 people had been evacuated from their homes in Saxony, it said. The cresting Danube, which flooded parts of Bavaria in southern Germany and Austria earlier this week, passed through Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, Thursday without causing significant damage, according to the European Commission. An extreme flood alert is still in effect in the western part of Slovakia, including Bratislava, it said. Water levels in the Danube and its tributaries in Bavaria are now falling except in the area around Passau, a town that experienced the worst flooding in five centuries this week. The flooding has caused at least 15 deaths across the region since last weekend. Eight deaths were reported in the Czech Republic, where some 700 communities have been affected by flooding and about 20,000 people evacuated. As river levels drop, attention is now turning to the clean-up, said Czech fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova. ""The main focus is on draining flooded areas,"" she said. All the country's large-volume pumps are in use, so offers of help with equipment and manpower from Poland and Slovakia will be taken up, she said. Army units have also been deployed to help with the clean-up, she said, with almost 300 troops sent to the affected areas. Three deaths occurred Saturday in southwestern Germany, the Interior Ministry for the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said. Four people are reported to have died and three are missing in Austria, the European Commission's emergency response center said. The floods follow heavy rain in the region last weekend, after a wet spring left the ground saturated. Scattered showers are likely over the coming day, according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. CNN's Ivana Kottasova, Matthew Chance and Nicole Saidi, and journalist Csaba Faix contributed to this report.","An environmental group raises concerns over toxic waste reservoir by Danube .

"(CNN) -- They are the little known Moroccan champions who have decimated the dream of Brazilian great Ronaldinho. Raja Casablanca, playing in FIFA's Club World Cup by virtue of Morocco being hosts, will now face European Champions Bayern Munich on Saturday in a bid to be crowned the globe's finest club team. They beat Brazil's Atletico Mineiro 3-1 in Marrakech to become only the second African side to make the showpiece final, and in the process deny Ronaldinho perhaps his last shot at landing the prestigious crown. The 33-year-old has a host of titles to his name, including the 2002 World Cup with Brazil, and spoke of his desire to break into their squad before his home country host the next installment, in 2014. But though he got on the scoresheet with a brilliant, trademark free kick to level the game at 1-1, his side couldn't hold out and conceded two late goals. Ronaldinho was a losing finalist with Barcelona in 2006 and will now have to make do with a match against Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande to determine who finishes third in the tournament that pits the champions of each continent against each other. The former PSG and Flamengo star is rumored to be leaving Mineiro when his contract runs out and could be a target for Turkish club Besiktas. When his curling free kick cannoned off the post and into the net just after the hour mark to make it 1-1, Ronaldinho could be forgiven for dreaming of adding the Club World Cup to his maiden Copa Libertadores triumph with Mineiro. It canceled out Raja Casablanca's opener, scored when Mouhssine Iajour drilled a low shot into the bottom corner from outside the penalty area. Despite a flurry of pressure after they scored Mineiro then shot themselves in the foot as Rever brought down Iajour inside the area, Mohsine Moutouali converting from the spot. As Mineiro pressed hard for a second equalizer, Vianney Madibe made the game safe to spark wild scenes of celebration in Marrakech in front of 35,000 fans. After spoiling Ronaldinho's night Raja will aim to do the same to Bayern on Saturday, as the Germans go for their fifth trophy of a remarkable year.","Moroccan champions Raja Casablanca deafeat Brazil's Atletico Mineiro 3-1 .

"(CNN) -- If Manchester United rallies to win the English Premier League, it might look back at Thursday's Boxing Day clash at Hull as a turning point. United trailed 2-0 within 13 minutes against a side that had lost only one home game in the league all season but Wayne Rooney inspired a comeback and the Red Devils prevailed 3-2 for a fifth straight victory in all competitions. Rooney set up Chris Smalling, scored a stunner to make it 2-2 in the first half and was on hand to pressure James Chester as the defender headed the own goal winner in the second half. Chester -- briefly a United player -- had opened the scoring and was thwarted in injury time by keeper David De Gea as Hull pushed forward in the dying stages. United finished the game with 10 men after Antonio Valencia's late red. Defending champion United, once 13 points off the pace in the Premier League, moved to within five of leader Liverpool ahead of Thursday's later kickoffs. ""We had some poor results at the start of the season and we're showing some real quality in the last few weeks,"" Rooney told Sky Sports. ""We're having a go. We're fighting for each other, we're working hard and we're ready for the challenge. ""Hopefully we can surprise a few people."" Chester took advantage of slack marking in the United box on a corner to lash a shot into the roof of the net in the fourth minute and United defender Jonny Evans failed to clear in the 13th, allowing David Meyler to double the lead on a low effort that deflected off the Northern Irishman. ""It was my fault for the first one,"" said Rooney. But Rooney's perfect delivery teed up Smalling in the 19th minute and the England striker scored his 150th Premier League goal for Manchester United with a volley in the 26th minute. Alex Bruce -- the son of Hull manager and former United defender Steve Bruce -- struck the crossbar as United's defense wobbled again in the 63rd minute before Chester's gaffe from Ashley Young's dangerous cross in the 66th. Hull had more than a few opportunities to equalize in the final 10 minutes. Danny Graham's tame header went straight to De Gea, the Spaniard's poor punch led to panic and following Valencia's second yellow for kicking the ball away in the 90th minute, De Gea stopped Chester with his legs.","Manchester United beats Hull 3-2 for a fifth straight win in all competitions .

"(CNN) -- They are four American friends and seasoned travelers who were hiking through Iraq's Kurdistan region before three of them crossed the unmarked border with Iran, where they were detained by Iranian authorities. Ahmed Awa, on the border of Iraq and Iran, is where police saw and warned the American hikers Friday. Kurdish officials identified the detained hikers as Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Joshua Fattal, CNN confirmed Sunday. The fourth hiker, Shon Meckfessel, stayed behind in Iraq. ""My husband and I are eager for the best welfare and conditions for our son, Josh, and for the other two companions he's with,"" Laura Fattal of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, told CNN Radio. ""And that is our only concern, his welfare and the best conditions for him."" Meckfessel was identified by his grandmother, who told CNN that he stayed behind because he felt sick. Meckfessel is at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ""My grandson has asked me not to talk to the media,"" said the grandmother, Irene Meckfessel of Carmichael, California, before hanging up Saturday. Iran's state-run media reported that Iranian security forces arrested the three Americans Friday for illegally entering the country from Iraq's Kurdistan region and that the matter is under investigation. U.S. State Department officials say the Swiss ambassador to Tehran is seeking information about the case on behalf of Washington. The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. Friends of the travelers told CNN that the three who were detained have spent time or have lived in Western Europe and the Middle East. Sandy Close, executive director of the nonprofit Pacific News Service, described Bauer -- a photographer whose material was occasionally posted on her Web site in the past -- as a ""gifted linguist and photographer with wanderlust for travel and a student of Arab cultures. He's a remarkably talented guy."" Shourd described herself as a ""teacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East"" on a profile listed on a travel Web site. Fattal shared his friends' love of travel and learning, and was described as ""fiercely intellectual"" by his friend, Chris Foraker, who spoke to CNN affiliate KVAL in Eugene, Oregon. Foraker said he met Fattal during a study abroad program in 2003, and the two worked together at the Aprovecho sustainable living research center in Cottage Grove. The four travelers spent the night at the Nirwan Hotel in Sulaimaniya on Thursday, said Mudhafer Mohammed, the owner of the hotel. Bauer, Shourd and Fattal left early Friday in a taxi for Ahmed Awa, a Kurdish town near Iraq's border with Iran, planning to hike in the mountains there, according to Peshrow Ahmed, spokesman for the security manager of Sulaimaniya. Ahmed Awa police spotted the hikers at one point Friday, Ahmed said, and warned them that they were near the border with Iran -- which is not marked in the area -- and that they should be careful. The group was in contact with Meckfessel in Sulaimaniya until about 1:30 p.m. Friday, when they reported they were ""surrounded by Iranian soldiers,"" Ahmed said. No further communication was received. Mohammed, of the Nirwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe, saying they were considering a trip to Ahmed Awa. But, he said, he advised them against it. ""I warned them many times,"" Mohammed told CNN. ""When they told me that they are planning to go to Ahmed Awa, I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border,'"" he said. Meckfessel left the hotel about 4:30 p.m., Mohammed said, asking him to take care of their luggage and saying he would not return. Later, he said, Sulaimaniya security forces took the luggage from the hotel.

"(CNN) -- It may not be comparable to Gilligan's Island, but the plight of the 74 members of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, aboard a research ship stuck in ice for more than a week at the bottom of the world, appeared anything but grim as 2014 approached. ""We're the A, A, E who have traveled far, having fun doing science in Antarctica!"" a dozen or so of them sang on a video posted on YouTube. ""Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice!"" The rhyme scheme then fell apart, but the festive mood did not: ""Really good food and company, but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here! Ice cold, cha cha cha! Ice cold, cha cha cha!"" It was not all fun and games aboard the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy. After bad weather led the crew of the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis to suspend efforts to reach the expedition Monday, less than 10 nautical miles short of its goal, more than two dozen of those aboard the research vessel ventured onto the surrounding ice, locked arms and proceeded to stomp on the snow to mark a spot where a helicopter from the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, can land. The helicopter, which can carry 12 people at a time, is expected to take the ship's 52 passengers -- including the research team and journalists -- to the Xue Long. The Australian icebreaker that tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel will send a barge to pick them up from the Xue Long. The 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. But the timing of the rescue remained uncertain as weather Tuesday remained bad. The failed attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Xue Long, which made it to within 6 nautical miles of the trapped vessel when its path was blocked by ice. It returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority. The Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved since Christmas. Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, told CNN that there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes. The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal. But by New Year's Eve, those aboard were showing few signs of distress. ""Up in the air, the Chinese came, flew around once and left again!"" they sang. ""The French dropped by, but couldn't get near. Bloody great shame we're still stuck here!""

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the collapse of a roof at a supermarket in Latvia's capital, Riga, climbed Friday to 51, the mayor said. Between five and seven people are still believed trapped in the debris from Thursday's collapse at the Maxima supermarket, in western Riga, Mayor Nils Usakovs told CNN by telephone. Latvia's national news agency LETA said police were using surveillance camera recordings to try to pinpoint the likely locations of victims under the rubble, the State Fire and Rescue Service of Latvia said on Twitter. By Friday afternoon, 47 bodies had been recovered from the collapsed structure, LETA said, quoting a state police spokesman. The supermarket collapse is the Baltic state's deadliest accident since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the LETA news agency reported. Latvia's previous most deadly accident was a nursing home fire that killed 26 people in 2007. At least 48 people were injured in the collapse, Usakovs said. Three firefighters were among the dead. Latvia's Interior Ministry said their families would receive 50,000 LVL ($95,600) in compensation. Treatment for rescue workers injured in the operation would also be paid for, it said. Search teams continue to comb the rubble for more bodies, Rescue Service spokeswoman Viktorija Sembele said. ""The firefighters are still working to find people. They are putting away the constructions and still approximately 600 square meters of this collapsed area should be searched through,"" she said. Sembele declined to speculate on the cause of the collapse. ""There are a lot of versions, a lot of stories. The real cause of this tragic accident will be investigated by state police and other authorities once the rescue is finished,"" she said. Usakovs told CNN that authorities think building materials stored on the roof caused it to collapse. Latvia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said some of the victims of the collapse had not yet been identified. ""Police (are) currently working at the scene to identify the dead; for victim identification, police officers are also cooperating with relatives who gather on the site,"" a ministry statement said. It asked relatives of anyone missing to call emergency services. It said a condolence book has been opened in its embassy in Russia, which has received flowers and messages of sympathy. European Commission President Jose Barroso issued a message of condolence after the collapse. ""I am deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy,"" he said. ""Please convey my expression of deepest sympathy and solidarity to the families of the victims and those who lost their lives in rescuing people as well as to all those affected by this tragic accident.""

"(CNN) -- The man in the picture has his back to the camera. He's desperately clawing at a subway platform, looking right at the train that's bearing down on him as he stands on the tracks. It's a terrifying, heart-wrenching image, and it's generating a lot of criticism for the newspaper that used it on its front page -- the salty, sensational New York Post. Why didn't the photographer help? Why did the newspaper publish the photo? ""NY Post should be ashamed of its misuse of humanity for its cover photo of a man about to be killed by a subway train,"" one person wrote on Twitter. ""When does cruelty end."" ""Snuff porn,"" another user labeled it. Opinion: Why the outrage over subway death photo . A freelance photographer captured the image Monday after someone shoved the man, 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han, from a subway platform near Times Square. Seconds after photographer R. Umar Abbasi captured the images, the train fatally struck Ki. He died at a New York Hospital, leaving behind a wife and daughter. A man officers were questioning ""implicated himself"" in the incident, police said Tuesday night. Police gave no other information on the suspect and this news may do nothing to quell the ongoing debate about the controversial photo. ""Doomed,"" the headline read. ""Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die."" In its story on the incident Tuesday, the Post reported Abbasi was waiting on the platform when he saw the man fall onto the tracks. He said he ran towards the oncoming train, firing his camera's flash to warn the driver. ""I just started running, running, hoping that the driver could see my flash,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""In that moment, I just wanted to warn the train -- to try and save a life,"" the Post quoted him as saying. Some critics, however, questioned Abbasi's motives. One Twitter user questioned why someones first instinct would be not to help the man, but instead to ""snap a photo of him about to die and sell it to the NY Post."" Reached by CNN, Abbasi was adamant that he would talk to the network only for pay. The Post declined to comment. Media observers wondered Tuesday if the newspaper had gone too far this time. ""Even if you accept that that photographer and other bystanders did everything they could to try to save the man, it's a separate question of what the Post should have done with that photo,"" Jeff Sonderman, a fellow at journalism think tank the Poynter Institute, wrote on the organization's website. ""All journalists we've seen talking about it online concluded the Post was wrong to use the photo, especially on its front page."" Kenny Irby, Poynter's senior faculty member for visual journalism and diversity programs, said what the paper did wasn't necessarily wrong. ""It was not illegal or unethical given that ethical guidelines and recommendations are not absolute,"" he said in an e-mail. But he also thought the Post could have used another photo because this one crossed the line of dignity. ""This moment was such for me -- it was too private in my view,"" he wrote. ""I am all for maximizing truth telling, while minimizing harm, which can be done by fully vetting the alternatives available and publishing with a sense of compassion and respect."" The Post is no stranger to walking up to the lines of journalistic ethics, and sometimes crossing them, with its pithy, often lurid, coverage of crime and other news in the Big Apple. ""HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,"" the newspaper once famously shouted from its cover. The Post shot is hardly the first news photo to generate ethics concerns. An Agence France-Presse photo that won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize generated controversy for its depiction of a girl in Afghanistan crying amid a number of bloody bodies. Also this year, the New York Times published a graphic image showing blood streaming from the body of a victim following a fatal August shooting at the Empire State Building. At the time, Poynter quoted a Times spokeswoman as saying the image was ""a newsworthy photograph that shows the result and impact of a public act of violence.""

He added that he was ""working overtime"" to win the Australian Open in January -- which leads us to the first of five burning questions looking ahead to the 2014 tennis season. Can Roger Federer win another grand slam? The numbers, so often in favor of history maker Federer, were less kind to the Swiss in 2013. He failed to reach a grand slam final for the first time since 2002, his grand slam quarterfinal streak ended at 36 and his year-end ranking of No. 6 was his lowest in 11 years. Federer only won one tournament, on grass in Halle, Germany -- though he was bounced from Wimbledon a few weeks later in the second round after claiming the title at the All England Club a record seven times. Longtime coach Paul Annacone was axed months later. His back problems returned, with Federer saying it was a mistake to keep playing at the BNP Paribas Open in March when the back flared up. It was indeed a slump -- well, for Federer. But Federer says he is now fit, which helped the 32-year-old finish the season on a high. ""My self-confidence has also returned,"" he told the website of one of his sponsors, Credit Suisse, in late November. ""By the end, everyone around me was talking positively again. The mood was much better than in the summer. ""That boosts my morale for the coming year, and it's a big relief. The fun has definitely returned."" Federer said he would like to win ""about"" five tournaments in 2014 and play in ""great finals."" The majors are what matter to Federer most, and if he was to claim the Australian Open he would become the second oldest man -- behind Andre Agassi -- to bag a singles grand slam in the last 40 years. Federer probably needs to beat two of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray to collect an 18th major but his recent record against the trio is underwhelming. He has lost four straight to Nadal, three straight to Djokovic and fell to Murray in an absorbing Australian Open semifinal last January. No matter what happens to Federer in 2014, though, he'll still be a major talking point. Can anyone stop Rafael Nadal at the French Open? Statistically, Nadal became the best player ever at the French Open when he won an unprecedented eighth title on the red clay at Roland Garros. Only once has he failed to win in Paris in the spring, when Robin Soderling, Nadal's wonky knees and the then split of the Mallorcan's parents made for a combination too powerful to overcome in 2009. Since then he has captured four in succession. But Nadal came within an inch of likely losing at the French Open this year to Djokovic. The Serb led by a break 4-3 in the fifth set of their semifinal when he touched the net before a point ended at deuce. It was an easy put away that Nadal had no chance of reaching. Djokovic lost the point, Nadal broke back and he won 9-7 in the fifth. Only two months prior, Djokovic snapped Nadal's 46-match winning streak, dating back to 2005, at the clay-court Monte Carlo Masters. If anyone is to get the better of Nadal at the French Open next year -- assuming he is healthy -- Djokovic, who has appointed Boris Becker as the head of his coaching team, is the lone serious candidate. Who can derail Serena Williams? Serena Williams compiled a 78-4 record in 2013 for the best winning percentage on the women's tour since 1990 and she took home nearly $12.4 million in prize money -- the most ever for a female tennis player in a season. Williams was stunned by Sabine Lisicki at Wimbledon in one of those four losses but weeks earlier lifted the French Open trophy for the first time since 2002. When she triumphed at the U.S. Open in September, the American climbed to 17 majors to approach Chris Evert -- once her critic -- and Martina Navratilova. Unlike her fellow 32-year-old Federer, Williams doesn't have as many roadblocks in front of her so she could keep on collecting grand slam titles in bunches. World No. 2 Victoria Azarenka has yet to win a grand slam outside Australia and Maria Sharapova is returning from another serious shoulder injury. They're Williams' two main rivals. Williams' first order of business is to end Azarenka's two-tournament reign in Melbourne after injuries hampered her Down Under in 2012 and this year. How will Andy Murray recover from his back injury? Murray missed the last two months of the season following back surgery and all eyes are on the Scot to see how he'll rebound in 2014. As the likes of Federer, Agassi and Murray's coach, Ivan Lendl, can attest, back problems are difficult to shake. He is due to return to action at an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi on Boxing Day against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and might also face Djokovic and Nadal. ""It's exactly the test I need to see where my game is at,"" Murray was quoted as saying by ESPN UK online. Thankfully for Murray he was able to end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion at Wimbledon -- before the back forced him off tour -- when he toppled Djokovic in July. Prior to Nadal re-emerging on the circuit in February, Djokovic and Murray contested two straight grand slam finals. Murray wants to make more history, said mom Judy. ""Andy's goal is to win more grand slams and try to achieve that end-of-year world No. 1 ranking,"" she was quoted as saying by the Scotsman newspaper this week. Can anyone new win a major? With the men's Big Four around, unearthing a new grand slam champion in 2014 figures to be difficult. Since the spring of 2005, only one man not named Federer, Nadal, Djokovic or Murray has won a grand slam -- Juan Martin del Potro at the 2009 U.S. Open. Recent years, however, tell us it could happen on the women's tour. For four straight seasons a debutante has come through at a major, Marion Bartoli being the most recent at Wimbledon. Bartoli was the first to admit she benefited from a nice draw, with Williams, Sharapova and Azarenka all exiting before the quarterfinals.","Roger Federer hopes to win ""about five"" tournaments in 2014 and play in ""great"" finals .

"(CNN) -- Chicago police continued to search Friday for a suspect in the brutal rape of 15-year-old girl who was walking to school near one of the city's Safe Passage routes for children. Meanwhile, as the crime put national attention again on Chicago's violence, police Superintendent Garry F. McCarthy made a surprise visit to a community meeting Thursday night, where residents expressed anger and outrage over the crime. The 15-year-old girl remains hospitalized, with a head injury suffered in the assault. ""The young lady is still on the fence, if you will, as far as how she's doing,"" McCarthy told the gathering of parents and other residents in the Belmont Cragin neighborhood on the city's northwest side. ""We're going to make sure that we catch this monster. We're going to make sure that it doesn't happen again in this community or in any other community in the city of Chicago,"" McCarthy added. The 15-year-old girl was walking to her high school in predawn darkness when an assailant hit her on the head, dragged her between two houses to a yard and raped her, police said, with the assault taking place just a half-block away from one of the city's ""Safe Passage"" school routes especially for students. Just this fall, local officials pledged that an expanded Safe Passages program -- with its big yellow signs above sidewalks patrolled during key times by paid, trained workers -- would be a sanctuary for children walking to and from school. The initiative came as Chicago became the nation's homicide capital of America in 2012, according to FBI statistics. This school year, city and school officials doubled the number of Safe Passage routes to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $1 billion budget shortfall. About 12,000 students are attending new schools this year because of the budget crisis, and many of them must walk through some of Chicago's most violent neighborhoods. This week, local authorities noted that the 15-year-old victim was walking to school Tuesday morning a half-hour before her nearby Safe Passage route was staffed with patrols. A resident found the girl half-naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway at the side of his home. She lay for about two hours in the cold before she was discovered. She was conscious but barely moving when she was found, authorities said. ""Just opening up the door, and take a morning sweep of the sidewalks and to find something like that is just shocking,"" said Michael Klockowski, the resident on the city's northwest side who found the schoolgirl. The snow outside his home was still stained Thursday. CNN's George Howell and Bill Kirkos reported from Chicago.","Chicago detectives are still searching for the assailant in a 15-year-old girl's rape .

"(CNN) -- Whose side are you on? A: I don't like hockey. (""I can't see the puck."" ""Too many fights."" ""I don't get the rules."" ""I can't name a player except that Wayne what's-his-name. Gatsby."") Or: . B: I like hockey. (""A lot better in person than on TV."" ""Baseball's SO slow."" ""Basketball's all guys 8 feet tall."" ""I wouldn't watch soccer if you paid me."") Me, I am B. Hockey and I are old friends. I grew up in Chicago, right now the hottest town on ice. I also lived in Detroit, the self-named ""Hockeytown, USA."" I now reside in Los Angeles, current home of the game's Stanley Cup. (That's the trophy that goes to the championship team, for those of you who wouldn't know a Stanley Cup from a sippy cup.) The Chicago Blackhawks have been in the news. Why? Well, that's a good question. Because they win a lot? Uh, kind of. Because they don't lose? Er, technically, no. I will try to explain it if you've got a couple of minutes to kill. (Which is also a hockey thing ... killing a couple of minutes while a guy's in a penalty box.) Chicago's record is 21-0. That's how it looks in the National Hockey League's standings, at least. W 21, L 0. Are the Blackhawks unbeaten? Um, no. Bleacher Report: Top 25 all-time Chicago Blackhawks . It's a little complicated. A hockey game no longer can end in a tie. It uses an overtime period to break a tie. If that doesn't work, a ""shootout"" is held, similar to soccer's. One-on-one vs. a goaltender until someone wins. As a reward for extending a game to overtime, a team is given a bonus point by the NHL. So, even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the Blackhawks have -- you didn't ""lose."" Already knew that? Hey, you obviously know your hockey! (Quick trivia question: A team in Ohio is called the Columbus Blue Jackets. True or false?) If you are into pucks, you might be aware that the Blackhawks put together a pretty cool 30-game streak over a span of two seasons without being defeated in three 20-minute periods. Chicago is aware. Chicago's on fire. The team is the talk of the town. Cubs, schmubs. On national TV's sports news, the two smokin'-hot teams have been basketball's Miami Heat (beating almost everybody they play) and hockey's Blackhawks (kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play). I suppose you have heard of Miami's basketball star. His name is LeBron James. He grew up in Ohio, where he never once wanted to grow up to be a Blue Jacket. But he did tweet that the Blackhawks are AWESOME. I do not know if you know who Chicago's hockey stars are. One of them is Jonathan Toews, which is pronounced ""Taves,"" not toes, not tweeze. He went to the University of North Dakota, as most great athletes do. (OK, maybe not ""most."") Another one is Marian Hossa, which is pronounced ""Ho Sa,"" not hoss sa, not hah sa. He is from Stara Lubovna, Slovakia, where everybody probably watches him on CNN with no clue who LeBron James is. A definite one is Patrick Kane, as in Citizen. He was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, where a boy is so lucky because he can play ice hockey outdoors 10 to 11 months a year. Bleacher Report: Why the 2013 Chicago Blackhawks will go down as one of the best teams ever . Together with some sharp teammates, not the least of whom is Patrick Sharp, these guys have got Chicago rocking and rolling. From the time tenor Jim Cornelison operatically belts out our national anthem (or Canada's) to the times they pump up the volume to ""Chelsea Dagger"" by the Fratellis to celebrate a Blackhawk goal, a home game at the United Center is usually loud, usually SRO and usually bigger than Bieber and Beyonce rolled into one. If I exaggerate, sue me. I checked with Jay Blunk to find out just how big things there are. Jay is the team's executive vice president . ""We've been very fortunate to experience unprecedented television ratings,"" he told me Wednesday. ""Merchandise sales have accelerated. The NHL announced that Jonathan Toews' jersey sales were the number one-selling jersey in the country for the month of February. We also just passed the 200 consecutive-game sellout mark. Tickets have become some of the hottest regular season tickets in history."" If he exaggerates -- and I doubt it -- don't sue me. I'm enjoying this too much. You see, it wasn't so long ago my boyhood favorites the Blackhawks were skating on (insert ""thin ice"" cliche here). They looked as dead in the water as a cruise ship. A great organization had become disorganized. A popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar. A team born in 1926 had turned into the Walking Dead (on skates). Chicagoans lost interest. They had Ditka's Da Bears, followed by Jordan's Da Bulls, followed by a 2003 Cubs team that could have won the World Series and a 2005 White Sox team that did. I moved back there in 2003. The bad Blackhawk team of 2003-04 played in 74 games and won 20. ESPN the Magazine ranked it 119th of 120 franchises in all of sports, in terms of ownership, fan relations, players, coaching, intangibles such as ""bang for your buck,"" ahead of only the Houston Texans, a new pro football team with zero dark history. Home games weren't even shown on TV. On the nightly news, sportscasters gave time to highlights from games of the Chicago Wolves, a minor-league team, almost as much as they did the Blackhawks. Hey, if I liked minor-league hockey, I'd live in Rockford. I seldom saw anybody in a Blackhawk jersey go out in public anymore, except maybe Mike Myers from ""Wayne's World."" The 2004-05 season didn't happen. A union war broke out, and the NHL's whole season was wiped out. Chicago basically yawned. The Blackhawks hadn't won a Stanley Cup since 1961. That was their first since 1938. Bleacher Report: How will history view this team? I was a hockey guy. I wasn't just familiar with old-time hockey names such as Bobby Hull. I knew Kenny Wharram and Ab McDonald and ""Moose"" Vasko and Bill Hay. I thought of them as other Chicago sports fans might think of a Dick Butkus or an Ernie Banks. So you can see, almost as exciting as winning 2010's Stanley Cup was, why the 2013 superstart of the Blackhawks is a sight to behold. Los Angeles finally cracked the ice ceiling in 2012 with the Kings' first championship, which was a pleasure to watch. I have a daughter who recently asked whether I could get her hockey tickets. She didn't want One Direction or Lady Gaga. She wanted Kings versus Red Wings. I was so proud. Hockey isn't for everybody. It's just for us cool people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","The Chicago Blackhawks are on a winning streak .

"(CNN) -- While some architects compete over height, others compete with shape. After China's ""Donut"" Hotel (aka the Sheraton Huzhou Hot Springs Resort) hit monitors earlier this month, another eye-opening hotel design has just been announced -- also with a massive hole in the middle of the building. Designed by Spanish architecture firm OOIIO, the Unbalance Hotel (the project's working title) resembles a tilted photo frame at the edge of a high cliff in Lima, Peru. ""Lima hasn´t got a representative iconic building that brings the more than 8 million inhabitants of the city to be well known worldwide,"" OOIIO director Joaquín Millán tells CNN. ""We wanted to create something radical, strong. A landmark, a building that makes you think, a shape that shakes your imagination. ""We know that as soon as you do something that radical on such a dominant location there are going to be a lot of people hating it. And some of them also loving it. ""This is what we want -- make people talk about architecture, and what to do and not to do with Lima's urban landscape."" Bold purchase . Hugging a space between the Pacific Ocean and the city, the unique shape of ""Unbalance Hotel"" ensures people behind the building won't have their views out to the ocean blocked. The bold dream, however, will be fulfilled only with the help of an equally bold investor. Fortunately for OOIIO, a private Latin American investor, who the company won't name, is said to be pleased with the design. ""We were not sure if he was going to react OK to such a strong proposal,"" says Millán. ""Actually we had a B option ready just in case, but we never had to show it. ""After a long silence he started to say nice things about the project, and he sees the economic potential of such a building design. Now he is in love with it!"" The design is still in its development stage and nothing has been confirmed, so no construction or opening dates were given. If approved, the ""Unbalance Hotel"" is meant to serve as both a hotel and congress center, consisting of 125 rooms, restaurants, conference rooms and an exhibition space. The interior design will include ""some spaces with non-vertical facades, and very spectacular hall and rooftop restaurants,"" says Millán. Other outrageous designs from OOIIO include Miraflores-Barranco Footbridge, a spiky footbridge that looks like Peruvian crystal, and Valer Church, a wooden church that doubles as a public space in a small Norwegian village.","Spanish design firm OOIIO has an imaginative design for its upcoming hotel project in Peru .

"(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus. Robin Thicke. Blake Shelton. New Year's Eve 2013 on TV looked a lot like the year itself. Celebs were all over TV ringing in 2014 with performances. It wasn't a ""Wrecking Ball,"" but Cyrus sang before the ball dropped on ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest "" on ABC. Clad in a gold sequined outfit and a furry coat, Cyrus joked that ""This is the most clothes I've been in in 2013."" She was joined on the show with Thicke, who also performed, as well as several other musical acts including Icona Pop and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. ""The View's"" Jenny McCarthy co-hosted with Seacrest on the show that after more than 40 years has been a New Year's Eve institution. Earlier Seacrest joked that he'd be watching Cyrus and her crazy antics. ""This is a ball she cannot touch,"" Seacrest said. ""This one she cannot. She's not allowed to. But she can be standing under it when it goes down, when it drops."" Over on NBC, ""The Voice"" judge Blake Shelton teamed up with that show's host, Carson Daly, for ""New Year's Eve With Carson Daly."" Shelton was one of the performers joining a roster that included ""American Idol"" judge Mariah Carey. CNN once again featured the antics of Anderson Cooper and comedienne Kathy Griffin, live from Times Square in New York City. Before the festivities, Griffin had sent Cooper a topless pic of herself, threatening to also appear that way on the show. While that didn't come to pass, she offered plenty of ribbing of her co-host, including teasing Cooper that Ryan Seacrest was so rich ""He could come up here and purchase you right now."" ""You do realize you'll never live up to your mother, right?"" Griffin told Cooper, referring to his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt. ""I just need to say that."" Cooper got off a few zingers of his own, telling Griffin, ""I roll deep. I know Mackelmore."" Other networks that also offered programming to ring out 2013 included the Mario Lopez-hosted ""New Year's Eve Live"" on Fox where rapper J.Cole and Panic! At the Disco performed and ""BET: 106 & Party: New Year's Eve 2013"" which featured Trey Songz and ASAP Rocky.","There were plenty of celebs on TV New Year's Eve .

"(CNN) -- We often walk past them without a second thought, but most murals tell a story about the communities in which they live. And yet, as features of our public spaces, they mean something different to each of us when we view them through our own individual filters. For our first CNN Instagram community assignment we invited followers to photograph murals or street art in their communities and tell us about them. We were thrilled to see more than 300 submissions from all over the world and hear the many stories behind them. Below are just a few highlights. Check out all of the submissions by searching the #CNNMuralStories tag in Instagram. Erica Firpo: Rome, Italy . Erica Firpo captured the latest mural by renowned Italian street artists Sten and Lex, whose stencil art has appeared in cities worldwide. This mural on the side of a building in Rome's Garbatella neighborhood was completed in December. ""This abstract landscape (a deviation from their usual pointillist portrait) was entirely locally crowd-funded and chosen by the neighborhood to be a permanent public work, blurring the lines between street and fine art,"" Firpo noted. Ragheeb Faatih Moazzem: Chittagong Port, Bangladesh . Ragheeb Faatih Moazzem's Instagram depicts a portrait of 20th century Bengali statesman Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the movement that led to the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971. Rahman later became the first president of the Bengali state. Found on a wall near Chittagong, the country's largest seaport, the portrait commemorates a historic speech by Rahman that called for liberation from Pakistan, Moazzem said in his Instagram post. ""If it hadn't been for Bangabandu (friend of Bengal) Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his historical and emotional speech, we would to this day be the victims of oppression and torture. We are forever in his debt."" Jorge Quinteros: Brooklyn, New York . Jorge Quinteros came upon this work in progress in Brooklyn. The artists told him they'd been working on this mural of Nelson Mandela for three days. They told him that they owned the wall and typically used it as advertising space. ""We had a little spare time from work and we wanted to pay tribute to this amazing man."" Kimber Kirton: Miami, Florida . Kimber Kirton documented a mural created this year by Evoca1 for 2013 Art Basel Miami Beach. The South Florida-based artist aims to ""merge art and humanity together for a timeless collection"" through his art and Sketches for Mankind, a collective whose work includes outreach to Miami's homeless population. This mural is based on sketches the artist created from photographs of two homeless men. Word has it that the artist brings his subjects to the completed walls and shows them these beautiful interpretations, Kirton said. ""I can only imagine their emotional response, for even mine changed when I took a second glance at it after learning its backstory."" Julian Castaneda: Uppsala, Sweden . Jullian Castandea showed off his pride in his small city in Uppsala, Sweden, and its coffee roasting plant ""Lindvalls Kaffe."" Located near the plant, the mural proudly proclaims ""En BÃ¶nas VÃ¤g,"" which means ""The Road Of The Bean,"" Castaneda said. ""We may be a little city, but at least we can be proud to say that the best coffee -- 'Lindvalls Kaffe' -- is done right here."" Mike Gutkin: New York, New York . Mike Gutkin captured an authentic 20-foot section of The Berlin Wall in its current residence in a plaza in Midtown New York. Commercial real estate developer Tishman Speyer acquired the graffiti-sprayed wall in the 1990s. It ""was crazy standing next to this awesome piece of history,"" Gutkin said. Emily Rippe: Toledo, Ohio . Emily Rippe documented the Carter family in front of a mural in Toledo, Ohio, known as ""Juleeon's mural."" This public art is the result of a partnership between Art Corner Toledo and Food for Thought, a social justice organization dedicated to feeding the hungry. ""The Carters are just one of many families combating hunger on a daily basis. Amidst the struggle, 11-year-old Juleeon maintains a smile that could span the Midwest. His mural stands for hope and change in cities and towns across the county,"" Rippe said. Jeremiah Cowan: Atlanta, Georgia . Jeremiah Cowan captured this piece by Atlanta muralist HENSE on the side of Westside Cultural Arts Space building. ""This mural inspires me because of its pop of color in a gray area of town. I feel like this mural brings life to the Atlanta community,"" he said. Keith Weaver: Atlanta, GA . Keith Weaver met Kenny, an Atlanta resident, while exploring historic Auburn Avenue, the home of Martin Luther King. Jr. He has lived in Atlanta longer than Weaver has been alive. They talked about Kenny's life, the history of the area and the community played in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Weaver took his portrait in front of a wall created by artist JR that commemorates the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. ""This wall and this portrait remind me of the struggle citizens of my country went through for equality, opportunity, and freedom,"" Weaver said.","Photographers share stories of their favorite murals for CNN's first Instagram challenge .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire on peaceful protesters in Thailand early Saturday, killing one and wounding three, national security chief Paradon Patthanathabut said. Police do not know who the gunmen are. Protesters had gathered in the government district of Bangkok this week to demand the ouster of the country's prime minister and threatened to shut the city down for a month in January. At a protest earlier this week, one police officer died and scores of people were injured, according to police. In all, eight people have died from injuries sustained during the protests that began almost two months ago, according to the Bangkok emergency agency Erawan. U.S. Embassy warning . The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok issued an emergency notice urging caution near the site of protests. ""Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. You should avoid areas of demonstrations, and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations,"" the embassy said. ""Be alert and aware of your surroundings and pay attention to local news media reports."" The unrest came as demonstrators hoped to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office. In a bid to cool tensions, the prime minister dissolved the nation's parliament this month and called for new elections, to be held February 2. But the move has done little to appease protesters, who remained on the streets. Thursday's protests, in which nearly 2,000 anti-government demonstrators gathered at locations across the capital, turned violent. Police reported 129 people were injured, including the 25 police officers. A police spokesman had previously reported 35 officers had been injured, but some of the injured had been counted twice. Call to postpone elections . The national Election Commission urged the government to postpone elections. ""The current violence that just took place, it is something that we have already signaled to those who are responsible that it could happen,"" the commission said. ""We urge the government to postpone the election until a joint agreement from both sides is reached."" But Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkarnchana said a delay wasn't possible. ""The election cannot be postponed as it is against the constitution. The reform process can be done simultaneously with coming elections,"" he said. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Eight people have died from injuries in protests since they began nearly two months ago .

"(CNN) -- Egyptian student protesters who back the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of torching the cafeteria of a Cairo university, state media reported. The protesting students allegedly stormed the colleges of trade, engineering and science at Azhar University on Saturday and set fire to its cafeteria, according to the official MENA news agency. Authorities arrested 60 students, the Ministry of the Interior told state-run Nile TV. The protesters were armed with Molotov cocktails and other weapons, the ministry said. One student was killed in the violence, the Muslim Brotherhood said in a statement. The Brotherhood said security forces, ""in an attempt to silence any voice of opposition,"" fired tear gas, live bullets and birdshot at the protesting students. Students at the university have been on ""strike"" following the killings of students and professors by security forces, the Muslim Brotherhood said. The clash at the university is the latest in a string of incidents between security forces and backers of the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government this week declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization, an Islamist group which helped propel ousted President Mohamed Morsy to power. Morsy, the nation's first democratically elected president, was forced out of office in July by the nation's military and arrested following widespread protests and petitions calling for his removal. Detractors said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. Supporters called his removal a coup and a blow to the democratic movement that toppled former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. In clashes in Cairo on Friday, at least three people died and 265 were arrested. CNN's Ian Lee contributed to this report.","Officials say student protesters set fire to a cafeteria at a university .

"(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday they are assisting in the investigation of a newborn baby who died of a rare bacterial infection that could be linked to powder-based infant formula. The two agencies are also investigating the case of another baby who survived after being infected by the same bacteria. Both cases happened in Missouri within the past month, but it was not clear whether they are connected. Late Wednesday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced it had pulled from its outlets nationwide all cans of Enfamil Newborn powdered formula that matched the size and lot number of the formula involved in the fatal case. The retailer said it removed the product ""out of an abundance of caution"" during the investigation, because it has still not been determined whether the formula caused the baby's death. ""We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family as they try to come to grips with their loss,"" said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. ""As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation."" The maker of Enfamil, Mead Johnson Nutrition, said it is working with health authorities ""to identify the source or cause of the infant's infection,"" though it remained ""highly confident in the safety and quality of our products."" The formula involved is Enfamil Newborn Formula in 12.5-oz. cans, with the lot number ZP1K7G. Consumers who have purchased formula with that lot number should discard the product or return it to the store, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which is in charge of the investigation. The infant died of an invasive Cronobacter sakazakii infection, Missouri health officials said. The bacteria is ubiquitous in the environment, but the source of infection is still unclear. Because of a growing number of Cronobacter infections among newborns, however, there is compelling evidence that milk-based powdered infant formulas are the source of infection, Missouri health authorities said. The bacteria has been detected in other types of food, but only powdered infant formula has been linked to outbreaks of disease, they said. The FDA has collected samples of powdered formula, both opened and unopened, from the home of the deceased infant and the Walmart store, located in Lebanon, Missouri, FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said. The FDA has also collected samples of the water used to reconstitute the formula, which in this case was bottled water, not from the tap. Test results are expected sometime next week, DeLancey said. CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said the agency is conducting separate tests of similar samples. DeLancey warned against jumping to conclusions in the case. ""There hasn't been a connection found with infant formula at this time,"" she said. ""We are investigating and the samples are still pending. We don't have lots and lots of cases, we have one case, and we're investigating this one very tragic case."" DeLancey said the FDA investigates between four and six cases of Cronobacter infection in infants every year. Because powdered infant formulas are not commercially sterile, the FDA recommends the following steps to reduce infection in newborn babies: . -- Prepare only a small amount of reconstituted formula for each feeding so as to reduce the amount of time the formula is held at room temperature. -- Do not hold reconstituted formula for longer than two hours without refrigeration. -- Minimize the time reconstituted formula is held in the refrigerator before it is fed. The World Health Organization has guidelines for the safe preparation and handling of powdered infant formula, which include washing hands with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in hot, soapy water, and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a time. CNN's Miriam Falco, Christy Lenz, Saundra Young, and Philip Cantor contributed to this report.","The baby died of a rare infection that has previously been found in formula .

"(CNN) -- If it's cold outside and you have electricity, consider yourself lucky. Thousands of people in the Northern United States and southeastern Canada have endured at least four days without power because of ice-related outages. And for some, the heat might not come back on until this weekend, utility companies said. More than 127,000 customers were without power in below-freezing temperatures Friday in parts of Michigan and northern New England and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick. The winter weather has also turned deadly. At least 24 people have died in weather-related incidents since Saturday. Nineteen of those deaths were in the United States; the majority died of carbon monoxide poisoning, emergency management officials said. Carbon monoxide poisoning often occurs when people run generators inside their homes. Another five people died in Canada from carbon monoxide poisoning, including three in Quebec and two in Toronto, officials said. The frigid weather will spread across the United States this weekend, with temperatures expected to fall 10 to 15 degrees below normal in the Midwest on Saturday. On Sunday, the chill will move into the Plains. Snow may hit New England on Sunday or Monday. In areas near Toronto, where officials said the storm was one of the worst to hit the city, more than 32,000 were without power Friday. While that's down from 300,000 at the peak, utility officials there declined to estimate when the last outages would be fixed. Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said his biggest concern now is the possibility of high winds in the evening. ""It's taking long because we haven't seen a storm like this in our history,"" Toronto Hydro spokeswoman Tanya Bruckmueller told CBC News. ""The amount of damage to both our equipment due to the trees coming down is slowing us down, as well as this morning we've got snow coming, which is much heavier on the branches and is now covering a lot of what we need to be repairing."" Toronto resident Vic Baniuk told CBC on Thursday his family hasn't had power for five days, and they were using a fireplace and a cast-iron stove to stay warm. ""We're sitting in the dark and cold, and I feel that everybody has ignored us,"" he told CBC. A tree branch pierced his roof, making a bad situation worse. ""This is not an inconvenience. This is an emergency, a disaster,"" Baniuk said. The temperature in Toronto isn't expected to rise above freezing until Saturday, with a forecast high of 3 degrees Celsius (about 37 degrees Fahrenheit). Another 5,800 people were without power Thursday elsewhere in southern Ontario; 19,000 had no electricity in New Brunswick, and another 2,200 still had outages in Quebec province, utility companies said. Power to the people . Power crews were working around the clock and called in reinforcements from other states to help them wrangle electric lines back into place. In Michigan, ice could finally start melting Saturday when temperatures could reach the high 30s or lower 40s. But Michigan power company Consumers Energy warned the thaw could cause more outages by allowing tree branches to snap and crash into power lines. Consumers Energy said it expected to have most outages fixed by the end of Saturday. About 330 customers had no power in parts of Vermont on Friday morning. Roughly 12,500 people still were without electricity in Maine. With no power in her Litchfield, Maine, home on Wednesday afternoon, Mary Beth King cooked her family's Christmas dinner -- seafood chowder -- on an outdoor grill, CNN affiliate WGME-TV in Portland reported. Friends and family find shelter . But many of those who lost power found generosity and new friends after turning to shelters to stay warm. More than 200 people took refuge Thursday in Red Cross shelters in Michigan and Maine, according to the group's online shelter tracker. Bonnie Libby told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan, that after living with shelter mates for three days, she now describes them as ""friends and family."" The outage was a cure for loneliness on Christmas Day for Larry Sutherland. If not for it, he said, ""I would be spending it alone, and my Christmas dinner would be a microwave meal."" CNN's Mayra Cuevas, Stephanie Gallman, Kevin Conlon, Carma Hassan and Matt Daniel contributed to this report.","At least 24 people have died in the U.S. and Canada since Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The Iraqi army shelled Falluja on Saturday in an effort to clear out al Qaeda-linked fighters amid dueling claims by the terror group and government forces about just who was in control of the flashpoint city in the Anbar province. The fighting in the Sunni province in recent days has posed a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government, raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. Conflicting reports have the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), formerly the group commonly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, in partial control of Falluja, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents during the Iraq War. Al Qaeda on the rebound, experts say . The al Qaeda-backed group proclaimed it was in control of the heart of the city, with its flags planted on some government buildings and police stations, while two police officials and two tribal leaders told CNN that the vast majority of the city -- including government institutions and police stations -- was in the hands of Sunni tribesmen fighting alongside security forces. At least seven people were killed and another 31 were wounded in the shelling, according to medical officials at Falluja General Hospital. Fierce street-to-street fighting, between the insurgents and Sunni tribesmen aligned with police, also was reported in the provincial capital of Ramadi. Police say a number of casualties have been reported in the city, but did not offer a specific number. The al Qaeda militants in Ramadi warned al-Maliki and tribesmen to withdraw from the area or face violent consequences. In a video posted on YouTube, militants wearing masks warned al-Maliki's supporters in Ramadi that they must stop helping ""al-Maliki commit crimes in Anbar or you will face harsh punishments."" Al-Maliki has vowed to crush the insurgency in Anbar province, where the Sunni insurgency -- al Qaeda in Iraq -- flourished following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. ""There will be no withdrawal,"" al-Maliki said in a speech Saturday carried by Al-Arabiya. Fresh fighting . Dozens have been killed and more than 100 wounded in fighting that broke out late last week following a raid on the home of prominent Sunni lawmaker Ahmed al-Alwani, a prominent supporter of anti-government protests. Al-Alwani's brother and five of his bodyguards were killed during the raid, during which at least 16 other people were wounded, authorities said. That was quickly followed by a move to close two protest camps that were established last year as part of ongoing demonstrations against the Shiite-led government, which protesters have said has marginalized the country's minority Sunni population. Since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011, Iraq's minority Sunnis have become increasingly marginalized. They have accused al-Maliki of trying to consolidate power by carrying out mass arrests of Sunnis. Even so, a number of Sunni tribal leaders struck a deal with the government this week to fight alongside Iraq's security forces against al Qaeda forces. The deal the government made with the Sunni tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 U.S. pact that saw Sunnis turn on al Qaeda, siding with American and Iraqi forces to bring about an end to the terrorism. Violent flashback . The fighting between Sunni militants against Shiite-dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the Iraq war in 2006 and 2007, when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf dismissed suggestions that the United States has abandoned Iraq following its withdrawal from the country in 2011. ""Let's be clear who's responsible for the violence -- It's the terrorists who were behind it,"" she told reporters in Washington on Friday. ""That's why we are partnering with the Iraqi government very closely to fight this shared threat. At the end of the day, we can certainly help them fight it, but we also want to help them build their own capability to do so themselves."" The United States is sending weapons, including Hellfire rockets and drones, to aid in the campaign against terrorism, officials have said. Harf said a number of American officials in Iraq and in Washington ""remain in touch with all of the different parties in Iraq.""

"(CNN) -- The man suspected of robbing banks and killing a police officer was convicted of threatening President Barack Obama in 2010, the Secret Service said Sunday. A nationwide manhunt for the suspected bank robber -- identified as 40-year-old Mario Edward Garnett by Phoenix police -- ended when a Phoenix police detective shot and killed a man after a new bank robbery on Saturday. Secret Service spokesman Max Milien said that Garnett is the same individual arrested in 2010 in Oklahoma City for threatening the President. Court records show Garnett pleaded guilty to those threats, was sentenced to eight months in federal prison and ordered to get mental health care upon his release. He was not allowed to own a gun. Garnett admitted that he wrote a rant on the official White House website that included this line: ""If you order a strike on Iran, I'm going to come up there and blow your brains out on national TV,"" the documents said. His prison term, including three years of supervised release, ended in July, records show. Garnett's last heist took place Saturday morning in Phoenix. After leaving the bank with a bag and gun, Garnett was approached by a police officer and started shooting. The officer retreated, but an undercover detective was nearby and shot Garnett in the upper body, said Phoenix police spokesman James Holmes. ""This is a situation where we had a detective on the street doing a follow-up on an unrelated incident who heard a radio call. He was close by, so he responded."" Holmes said. Garnett was pronounced dead near the scene. ""It chills me to think what might have happened had he not responded, based on the information we have now,"" Holmes added. Using cell phone records, the FBI confirmed that Garnett was in the area of two other holdups. Garnett apparently started his crime spree across the country nearly a week ago when he tried to rob a bank Monday in Atlanta but failed and ended up robbing a customer at the bank's ATM. Hours later, authorities believe, Garnett robbed a bank about 300 miles away in Tupelo, Mississippi. That robbery escalated to a gunfight with police, and two officers were shot. One of those officers, Gale Stauffer, died. After hearing the news of Garnett's death, Stauffer's wife, Beth, said: ""We can truly begin the healing process."" Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre said Stauffer's death may be the first in the department's history. The second officer shot, Joseph Maher, is recovering in a Tupelo hospital. CNN's Alison Harding, Stephanie Goggans, Janet DiGiacomo, Scott Thompson and Adam Shivers contributed to this report.","NEW: Records show Garnett was not allowed to own a gun .

"(CNN) -- In the movie ""Back to the Future,"" the year is 1955 when Marty McFly introduces the song ""Johnny B. Goode"" to a high school dance. That was three years before this tune was actually written, but McFly knows it well because he's from the future. It would stand to reason that in real life, time travelers from a future era -- or who had at least visited the future -- might give themselves away by mentioning events that haven't yet occurred. They might even do so online. I mean, you'd obviously take to social media to broadcast your foreknowledge of world events, right? Scientists at Michigan Technological University wanted to see if they could catch any such slips by residents of the future. So Robert Nemiroff, professor of physics, and graduate student Teresa Wilson conducted a whimsical study in hopes of identifying accurate predictions of future events. They are presenting their study at the American Astronomical Society Meeting on Monday. The online platform that allowed them to look most comprehensively for prescient posts was Twitter, because the social network doesn't allow back-dating. Facebook users can alter timestamps on posts, and the popular search engines Google and Bing were not as helpful as Twitter in looking for ""prescient information,"" the authors found. Study authors focused on two major search terms they believe will have lasting significance for years to come: Comet ISON and Pope Francis. They looked for mentions of these from January 2006 to September 2013. Before the identification of comet ISON in 2012, there were no mentions that the researchers could find of this icy space rock. Similarly, before Jorge Bergoglio took on his papal name in 2013, the phrase ""Pope Francis"" did not appear in the researchers' search results, except for one person's blog, which appears to have been speculating -- not remembering something from the future. It appears that no one posted about his or her neighbor or acquaintance declaring the name Pope Francis early, either. ""It's not proof, but it's an indication to me that it's not possible,"" Nemiroff said, referring to time travel. There are, of course, several reasons why this technique might not detect any time travelers. Nemiroff and Wilson may have missed them by using the wrong search terms. Temporal adventurers might avoid posting to social media altogether, or even using the Internet, for fear of being found out. Or, you know, it might be physically impossible to travel to the past. ""It's the largest database ever searched for that kind of information. It (evidence of time travel) might have been there,"" Nemiroff said. The idea for the study came about in discussions during poker games with his students, he said. Don't worry, that's not all they're doing; Nemiroff studies other more substantial topics such as gamma-ray bursts, and helped create NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day website. Others have tried in the past to lure time travelers into exposing themselves, Nemiroff and Wilson note in their paper. A convention for time travelers was held in May 2005 by then-graduate student Amal Dorai at MIT, but no one living among us from the future showed up, although the event attracted 450 guests, according to Nature. Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, similarly, said in a July 2012 interview that he had thrown a party for time travelers, sending out invitations after the party occurred. Sadly, no one came. Similarly, no one answered the study authors' calls to tweet on or before August 2013 using the hashtags #ICanChangeThePast2 or #ICannotChangeThePast2, indicating whether the time travelers believed they could alter history. Sean Carroll, a physicist at California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study, said physicists who have studied the question of time travel into the past -- taking into account Einstein's theory of general relativity -- have concluded that we can imagine time travel, but it's probably not possible in real life. ""We don't have an airtight proof, but at the very least it would involve manipulating astrophysically significant amounts of matter and energy in unheard-of ways,"" he said in an e-mail. ""And even if you built a 'time machine,' it would let travelers from the future go back to the moment you built it, but you wouldn't ever be able to visit any moments before you built it. Since we don't think anyone has built one already, I think we're safe from time travelers for the time being."" Still, Carroll said, Nemiroff's paper represents a fun, clever idea. ""To be clear, there was essentially zero reason to believe that they were going to find any evidence for time travelers, but since it didn't exactly cost a lot of money to perform the study I'm all in favor of it,"" Carroll said. So, if you are from the future and reading this, you secret is probably still safe -- for now.","New study uses Twitter to look for predictions of the future .

"(EW.com) -- In a remarkably tight race, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug held onto its gold at the box office this weekend, earning $29.9 million over the three-day frame and taking the top spot. The fantasy epic's domestic total is now $190.3 million after three weeks, a robust number that still trails last year's The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which had already earned $221.6 million at the 17-day mark. Peter Jackson's earlier Tolkien epic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, had made a princely $290.4 million by its third weekend in 2003, headed toward a final gross of $377.8 in the states and $1.119 billion worldwide. Smaug looks likely to end up below Unexpected Journey's total haul of $303 million, whereas each of the Lord of the Rings films managed to outgross its predecessor. The Hobbit: There and Back Again, the trilogy's final film, is slated for release on Dec. 17, 2014. The prize for Most Improved this week goes to Frozen, which jumped a remarkable 46.9 percent in its sixth weekend — despite actually playing at 205 fewer theaters. Disney's animated musical made $28.9 over the three-day weekend, raising its total to $248.4 million. It's already the seventh highest-grossing film of 2013 and looks likely to overtake Gravity ($254.6 million) and Monsters University ($268.5 million) in the weeks to come. Disney's last princess tale, 2010′s Tangled, had a similar box office bump in 2010, when it jumped 52.5 percent during the post-Christmas weekend, although the movie's total at that point was just $167.8 million on its way to a $200 million cume. Box office update: 'Frozen' ices 'Hobbit' and 'Wall Street' on Friday . In its second weekend, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues earned $20.2 million for a total $83.7 million. (Worldwide estimated gross for the $50 million comedy is $108.2 million.) That's a slightly faster clip than the original Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, which had earned $57 million total by its second weekend in 2004. Its domestic total was $85 million — a number the sequel should surpass by midweek. Even more promising is the fact that the original Anchorman made just $5.3 million at the foreign box office, while Anchorman 2 has already earned $24.5 million. Riding a wave of critical acclaim, American Hustle earned $19.6 million over the three-day weekend for a running total $60 million. The Weinstein Co. production has been in wide release for two weekends, following a debut weekend in limited. Last year's Silver Linings Playbook — which was also directed by David O. Russell and costarred Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert DeNiro — didn't really go wide until its 10th weekend. Thanks to huge critical kudos (including Lawrence's Oscar win for Best Actress) that movie eventually grossed $132.1 million — a number that's certainly in American Hustle's sights considering the film's intense Oscar buzz and guaranteed exposure at the Golden Globes, where it's nominated for seven awards, including Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. Christmas box office report: 'The Hobbit' beats out 'Wolf of Wall Street' in a tight race . Making money might've been easy for Jordan Belfort, the wildly successful white collar criminal played by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. But his biopic is having a slightly tougher time. The Martin Scorsese drama, which cost just shy of $100 million to make, cashed in $18.5 million over the three-day weekend, bringing its five-day total to $34.3 million. Wolf predictably played to an older male audience, drawing a crowd that was 54 percent male and 90 percent over the age of 25. The movie's box office future is uncertain: While its straight-C CinemaScore doesn't imply good word-of-mouth, Wolf stands to get plenty of free publicity at upcoming awards events. (The movie has already garnered Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy and Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy). DiCaprio had much better luck at the holiday box office last year. Like Wolf, Django Unchained opened on Christmas Day. But the Tarantino film made $15 million on the 25th alone, and had racked up a solid $63.4 million tally by the end of the weekend. Earlier this year, the actor's The Great Gatsby made $50.1 million in its opening weekend in May. And Scorsese and DiCaprio's last pairing, Shutter Island, opened to $41.1 million in February of 2010. 1. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - $29.9 million . 2. Frozen - $28.9 million . 3. Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues -- $20.2 million . 4. American Hustle -- $19.6 million . 5. The Wolf of Wall Street -- $18.5 million . Outside the top five, the weekend's biggest story was Universal's 47 Ronin, the long-delayed, $175 million Keanu Reeves samurai epic that grossed just $9.9 million over the three-day weekend, bringing its five-day total to $20.6 million. Universal has announced that it will take a write-down to absorb the movie's failure, although the studio is still having its best year yet thanks to giant hits like Despicable Me 2, Fast & Furious 6, and Identity Thief. Ronin's audience was 62 percent male, and the movie earned a not-bad B+ CinemaScore. Fox's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, starring Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig, made $13 million this weekend at 2,909 theaters for a $25.6 million five-day gross. The movie reportedly cost $90 million and received a B+ CinemaScore. Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom added 971 theaters in its fifth weekend, boosting the movie to a $2.4 million weekend and a $4.7 million total. In the big-screen showdown between Robert DeNiro and Sylvester Stallone, the loser was.... their movie Grudge Match, which took in just $7.3 million this weekend for a $13.44 million total. But the weekend's lowest scoring wide-release belonged to Justin Bieber, whose concert doc Believe took in a mere $2 million. The film's reported budget is only $5 million, so that's not a huge loss — although it pales in comparison to the $29.5 million debut of Bieber's last pic, 2011′s Never Say Never. The weekend also had a few notable specialty releases, including the Meryl Streep-Julia Roberts dramedy August: Osage County, which took in $179,500 from five theaters for a healthy per-screen average of $35,900. Universal's military thriller Lone Survivor, starring Mark Wahlberg and Taylor Kitsch, earned $92,000 from two theaters in a qualifying run, leading up to a planned nationwide expansion on Jan. 10.

"(CNN) -- As 2013 comes to a close, the conventional wisdom is grim: Immigration reform is dead. Expectations ran high; this was supposed to be the year. The President promised action, and the 2012 elections drove home the political imperative. But then, after struggling mightily, Congress failed to get it done -- again. It hardly matters whether you blame the President, House Republicans or the immigration-reform movement. There's still nothing to show for the year. â€ŽBut once again, as so often with immigration, the conventional wisdom is wrong. Politics isn't baseball. The end of the year isn't the end of an inning, wiping out all gains that don't deliver a man across home plate. Passing landmark legislation is more like long-distance running: Momentum builds over the long haul, and progress is cumulative. From that perspective, 2013 was a banner year for immigration reform, and we could still win. Congress could pass a far-reaching immigration overhaul -- in 2014. Start with the progress made in 2013. Most important was the sea change in the Republican Party. It started with the 2012 election and the difference Latino voters made for President Barack Obama, but the ferment spread and deepened as the truth sunk in among party regulars over the course of the year. Marquee figures like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie showed that the GOP can appeal to Latinos. He won 51% of their vote is his reelection bid in November. Many, if not most, Republicans in Congress now grasp that they need to be part of the solution on immigration -- for the good of the party and the country. Just look at pronouncements in recent months by House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House GOP favorite Paul Ryan and many others, including some of Congress' most conservative Republicans. The pro-immigration-reform movement also looks completely different today than it looked just 12 months ago. A Who's Who of American business leaders has come forward to endorse change: from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg to the Wall Street Journal's blue chip CEO Council. Unlike in years past, when most employers hid from the debate, or at best worked the issue quietly behind the scenes, many companies are now eager to link their names with immigration reform: well-known national companies like Caterpillar, Marriott and State Farm Insurance, but also local mom-and-pop businesses like the 100 small business owners from Clark County Washington who organized this summer to post pro-reform flyers in their shop windows. Along with business, there has been an outpouring of support from evangelical ministers. One Washington-based group, the Evangelical Immigration Table, claims to have more than 200,000 Christian ""prayer partners"" lined up nationwide. The broader immigration-reform movement doesn't always act in its own self-interest: why, for example, the recent Capitol Hill protest aimed at Eric Cantor -- one of the leading Republican champions of an immigration overhaul? But together, business and faith voices make a powerful case for reform that combines the economic rationale with a moral imperative. Most important, neither of these changes -- in the Republican Party or the pro-reform movement -- is reversible. This is a shifting of tectonic plates. When much of the national GOP, the business establishment and the evangelical movement want something done, it's probably going to get done eventually. The question isn't if, it's when. So what's blocking reform? The obstacles have little to do with immigration. The problem is the same-old-same-old that's been blocking virtually all movement in Washington this year. It falls under the general rubric of partisan gridlock, but the real sticking points are more localized: bitter mistrust between House Republicans and the White House, and a divide within the GOP driven by a relatively small handful of lawmakers and outside groups who oppose compromise of any kind on any issue. The good news is that this month's budget deal suggests that the logjam may be breaking up. Together, Speaker Boehner and Rep. Ryan defied the ""Hell no"" holdout wing of their party and delivered a compromise budget, even at a time of peak Republican mistrust and antipathy for the president. This doesn't mean the GOP divide has healed -- there were plenty of Republicans who opposed the budget deal or went along despite their better judgment. But the vote has raised hope among immigration reformers. Can Speaker Boehner and Rep. Ryan pull off a similar deal next year on immigration? Many signs suggest they could, including what's going on behind the scenes among House Republicans. It's well known that two different GOP lawmakers are working, separately, on bills that would create a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, the ""Dreamers."" And several other Republicans are working on proposals that would grant legal status to the Dreamers' parents. In other words, more than a half dozen GOP congressmen are preparing to sponsor -- or compete to sponsor -- what many in the party would once have called ""amnesty"" bills. Some caveats: House leadership is not going to pass immigration reform over the heads of conservative Republicans. It will pass it only with them -- with their support. The House is not going to take up the Senate immigration bill. Any movement in the House will be piecemeal, smaller measure by smaller measure, each addressing a different aspect of what's wrong with the immigration system. Leadership is not going to waive what's known as the Hastert rule, under which every bill that passes must command a majority of the majority -- at least 118 Republican votes. And there will be no path to citizenship for most unauthorized immigrant adults -- it's going to be enough of a stretch for the House to deliver a path to legal status that stops short of citizenship. Even this will be difficult in an election year. The windows to act will be narrow. Members will be even more cautious and calculating than usual. And getting reform over the finish line will be a test for Democrats as well as Republicans. The challenge for the GOP will be to pass a package of bills out of the House. The challenge for Democrats, in Congress and the White House, will be coming together for a deal on legal status rather than citizenship for most unauthorized immigrants. It's going to be a long year. Nothing is guaranteed. But what makes me optimistic is a growing sense of momentum. It's still slow and low-key, more apparent behind the scenes than in public or in the media. But there's no question: Momentum is building in the House -- 2014 could be the year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby.","Tamar Jacoby: At 2013 end, immigration reform seems dead, but it's not .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese icebreaker that sent out a helicopter on Thursday to airlift dozens of passengers from a ship stuck in the Antarctic ice is now beset by ice and unable to move, according to Australian Maritime Safety Agency (AMSA). The captain of the Xue Long told AMSA that his ship is safe, has plenty of food and supplies and will not need assistance at this time. The Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis, which is carrying the rescued passengers, was placed on standby in case the Xue Long needs help. But the captains of both the Xue Long and the Russian-flagged MV Akadmik Shokalskiy agreed they no longer need the Aurora Australis. They said they will be able to provide mutual support to each other. AMSA released the Aurora Australis from search and rescue and the vessel now continues to make its passage with the freed passengers to the Casey base to complete a resupply. The Chinese ship plans to try to get out of the thick ice early Saturday at a point when tidal conditions are most favorable, according to AMSA. The Chinese vessel's struggle comes the day after its helicopter ferried all 52 passengers from an ice-locked Akadmik Shokalskiy to the Aurora Australis. The Akademik Shokalskiy had been trapped in unusually deep ice since Christmas Eve with scientists, journalists, tourists and crew members on board. The rescued passengers, most of them Australians, will still have a lengthy wait before they return home. Officials say they estimate the Aurora Australis will get the group back to the Australian mainland by mid-January. The 22 Russian crew members remain on the Akademik Shokalskiy, waiting for the ice to shift and allow the ship to break free.","NEW: Xue Long icebreaker is beset by ice and can't move .

"London (CNN) -- What do artificial whiskers and coffee-filled balloons have in common? The answer is that they are both tools on experimental robots -- but they are also being put forward as possible ideas to help future planetary explorations. ""Shrewbot"" is the latest in a line of robots developed by teams at the UK's Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) that aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot find its way around. Inspired by the Etruscan shrew -- one of the world's tiniest mammals -- scientists wanted to find out if a robot could explore its environment using touch instead of vision, just as rats, mice and shrews find food in the dark. Team leader Martin Pearson, who works at the Biotact project, said the research was primarily to assist biologists in their understanding of how an animal's touch sensing works. But he added: ""Future robotic applications for this kind of sensing could be in search-and-rescue robots operating in smoke filled buildings or for sub-sea pipeline inspection robots in the murky depths of the sea."" The idea has also been suggested as a way to explore planetary surfaces where there is limited vision. Speaking at a space conference at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, robotics expert and co-founder of the BRL, Alan Winfield, identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions. ""I was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around,"" he told CNN. ""It may be that certain types of geology would be helped if you could, for instance, run the whiskers across the rock sample because you can get texture from whiskers. ""You can also imagine planets with thick, heavy atmospheres where vision would be completely useless. One of the beauties of whiskers is that the whisker can get damaged but still works -- all the sensing is done at the root."" Winfield also pointed to research carried out by Cornell, the University of Chicago, iRobot Corp and Liquidia that produced a robotic gripper using coffee granules and a latex party balloon. It exploits the way vacuum-packed coffee is rigid until the seal is broken and then the coffee granules can flow, adapting to the shape of an object it is pressed against. The vacuum can then be restored and the balloon 'jams' solid to form a grip. Watch how the gripper works at Cornell Creative Machines Lab . In 2010 ""jamming gripper"" researcher Heinrich Jaeger described in the Cornell Chronicle how the project had ""opened the door to applications none of us had originally thought about."" One of those applications, Winfield suggested, is a potential alternative for gathering samples on a planetary rover mission. ""Almost any planetary exploration robot is likely to need a gripper to pick up or collect rock samples for analysis or collection,"" he said on his blog. ""Something like the Jaeger-Lipson coffee balloon gripper would -- I think -- provide a much better solution. This soft gripper avoids the hard control and computation because the soft material adapts itself to the thing it is gripping."" Speaking to CNN, Jaeger said it would be exciting to work with space scientists. ""It's wonderful to see engineers and researchers come up with new ideas based on granular jamming. ""The main advantage of the jamming gripper is that it can deal effectively with very irregularly shaped objects and needs to cover only a fraction of the sample's surface in order to hold on to it. ""Perhaps even more importantly for a rover mission on Mars -- there are no mechanical parts that can get clogged up by dust. ""A third advantage is that the gripper is exceedingly gentle. It will put very little stress on the object to be gripped because it distributes the holding force over a large contact area that very closely conforms to the object's shape."" Winfield said this new field of ""soft robotics"" could be well suited to space exploration, explaining that the BRL is now working on touch sensors for robots. ""It's easy to see that giving planetary robots touch sensing could be useful, but there's another possibility ... the potential to allow Earth scientists to feel what the robot's sensor is feeling,"" he told CNN. Looking further into the future, Winfield believes so-called swarm robots -- large groups of simple robots that work together like social insects -- ones that can self-assemble and adapt to the environment in the way living creatures do, could also aid scientists exploring new worlds. ""Imagine that robots can actually remake parts of themselves -- we can't even do that in the lab yet -- but in theory you can imagine robots that can adapt their physical shape as well as their behaviors to meet a particular environment ... it's almost like evolution except these are mechanical devices,"" he said. However, he also believes that this technology -- along with fully autonomous robots that can think for themselves -- is a long way off. ""This field is very much a concept that we are developing in the lab -- I wouldn't expect these swarms of robots in space any time soon,"" he said.","""Shrewbot"" aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot navigate .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide attack at the offices of the World Food Program in Islamabad killed five employees and wounded several others Monday, an agency official said. Pakistani police commandos stand in front of a U.N. office after a suicide blast in Islamabad on Monday. Four Pakistanis and an Iraqi national died at the U.N. humanitarian agency, according to authorities. The suicide bomber, who also died in the attack, was in his 20s and wore a vest containing about 15 pounds (7 kg) of explosives, said Ben Yamin, a senior Pakistani police official. The explosion took place in a storage area at the offices. It was not immediately known how the bomber gained access.

"(CNN) -- A Chinese investor who had just bought a French vineyard is feared dead in a helicopter crash that killed his son and is thought also to have claimed the lives of an aide and the vineyard's previous owner. Lam Kok had completed the purchase of Chateau de La Riviere in the Aquitaine region of southwest France on Thursday, the vineyard's marketing manager, Thierry Disclyn, told CNN. On Friday, Kok introduced himself to all the employees, and at about 5 p.m. local time decided to tour the estate by helicopter, Disclyn said. The helicopter, which was also carrying the vineyard's previous owner, James Gregoire, Kok's 11-year-old son Charles, and a representative of Lam Kok, Peng Wang, crashed into the Dordogne River. Police have recovered the body of Charles Kok but are still searching for the other bodies, Disclyn said. According to the local Sud Ouest newspaper, about 30 police officers and a team of divers are engaged in the search, which resumed at 8 a.m. local time. Lam Kok is the head of the Brilliant group, which specializes in the luxury hotel market, Sud Ouest said. Kok wanted to turn the spectacular chateau building into a high-end resort and spa catering to wine enthusiasts, the newspaper said. The 60-hectare Chateau de La Riviere estate, in Fronsac, east of Bordeaux, had belonged to James Gregoire since 2003. It was the largest of three vineyards owned by the Gregoire family in the region.","Chinese investor Lam Kok is feared dead in a helicopter crash in southwest France .

"(CNN) -- 2014 marks an exciting new year for ""Downton Abbey"" fans. The show's fourth season kicks off on PBS on Sunday, and 1922 promises to be another scandal-filled time for the Crawley family and their busy staff. The season just ended in the UK, but now American fans will have their chance to get wrapped up in the latest drama brewing within those British walls. Season 3 brought us tragic deaths, new additions to the family and staff, and Shirley MacLaine. What will the next set of episodes hold? Here are the five things we are looking forward to over the next eight weeks: . 1. How will Lady Mary move on from tragedy? Season 3 ended with a bang. Hours after Lady Mary gave birth to a son, her husband, Matthew, was killed in a car crash. Season 4 picks up six months after the accident, and we will find out how the eldest of the Crawley siblings is handling life as a widowed mother. Is she still in mourning or working to find the perfect suitor? Mary's biggest plight in the series has been her search for the right man, and now she's got to consider picking it up again, this time with a small piece of baggage. Perhaps she will devote all her time and energy to her new son. Or will she resent the child as a constant reminder of her lost love? Matthew was in the midst of making changes at Downton to help the Abbey regain its financial footing, and now his wife must take on those duties. Our guess is, the warmth brought out by Matthew has since frozen over. Expect to see the cold, emotionally closed-off Mary we knew so well at the beginning of the series. Also, we will almost certainly see Mary don nothing but black. She is in mourning, after all. 2. Diversity at Downton! That's right, after three seasons, we will finally see a person of color on the show! Downton has never been known for its diversity, but viewers know social change is on the horizon. It was only a matter of time before it creeps into those hallowed halls. While Diddy's casting may have been nothing more than a Funny or Die joke, season 4 will in fact include the show's first recurring black character. Gary Carr has been cast as a charismatic jazz singer and will hopefully give us a glimpse into the characters' feelings about the changing face of race in the 1920s. With Cousin Rose's penchant for jazz clubs revealed in the finale, it's a safe bet the two will cross paths this season. 3. Will this be the last we see of Cousin Isobel? With Matthew gone, what does that mean for his dear mother? Isobel has played a major part in the series since her son's introduction in season 1. Now that we must get used to life without Matthew, how much longer will we get to spend with the family he brought with him? Fans will surely get a glimpse into Isobel's grieving period since the huge loss. It will be interesting to see whether she remains a lead character on the series with only a grandson connecting her to Downton. With Mary inevitably trapped in a state of depression, perhaps it will be Isobel who comes to her rescue and helps raise the newborn heir. 4. How much time will we have to spend with Cousin Rose? Viewers were introduced to Lady Rose at the tail end of season 3, and the rebellious teen didn't make the best impression. She had been invited to stay at Downton while her parents travel to India. If the previews are anything to go by, we're going to see much more of the troublemaker in coming episodes. With a dark cloud still hanging over the Abbey after the shocking deaths of both Matthew and Lady Sybil, Rose might provide a much-needed bright spot to the house. 5. What's next for Downton's downstairs? Season 3 wrapped with most of Downton's downstairs players riding cloud nine. Bates and Anna have become the show's most loving pair since the former's release from prison. Daisy, Alfred and Ivy became involved in an innocent love triangle. Even the conniving Thomas made peace with those he's wronged. The finale gave the staff a chance to get out of their uniforms and spend some time bonding in the sun. Expect some major changes within the hard-working team in the new season. A major player will be taking time away from Downton, making room for a few shakeups. Since Branson's been living as a widower for nearly two years, the former chauffeur may have to pay special attention to the latest addition. And with Molesley now jobless, Matthew's former butler and valet will be in search of new work. Did we mention fans can expect both special guest star Paul Giamatti and another helping of Shirley MacLaine in the roles of Harold Levinson and his mother, Martha? There's nothing we look forward to more than one-liner standoffs between Martha and the Dowager Countess. There's never a dull moment at Downton!","""Downton Abbey"" is back for a new season on Sunday .
Expect grief and some cast additions .
Shirley MacLaine will return as Martha Levinson ."
"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama on Monday, urging Americans to reject what he called the Bush administration's legacy of ""incompetence, negligence and failure."" In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president. ""Americans simply cannot afford to continue the policies of the last eight years for another four,"" Gore, the party's 2000 presidential nominee, told Obama supporters at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. Perceived as a senior statesman in the Democratic party, Gore brings a certain force to Obama's campaign, political analysts have said. Monday marked Gore's debut in the 2008 election; he had not weighed in while Obama was still battling Sen. Hillary Clinton. Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation. The former vice president turned Nobel Prize winner playfully said he recalled one Republican nominee wondering out loud whether his Democratic rival for president was ""naive and inexperienced."" ""And yet another said the United States cannot afford to risk the future of the free world with inexperience and immaturity in the White House,"" said Gore. ""Who were they talking about? Every single one of those quotes came from the campaign of 1960, when the the Republicans attacked John Fitzgerald Kennedy for allegedly lacking the age and experience necessary to be president."" Richard Nixon was the Republican nominee in 1960. Joining Obama in the midst of the candidate's two week swing through the nation to talk about his plans to revitalize the economy, Gore praised  Obama as someone who could mobilize people, young and old, who had never before taken part in politics. Gore went on to praise the nominee's vision on the environment, domestic and international issues. Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has ""inspired"" him. ""I feel that same spirit in this auditorium tonight, building all over this country this year,"" he said.  ""Take it from me, elections matter,"" Gore said. ""If you think the next appointments to our Supreme Court are important, you know that elections matter. If you live in the city of New Orleans, you know that elections matter. If you or a member of your family are serving in the active military, the National Guard or Reserves, you know that elections matter. ""If you are a wounded veteran, you know that elections matter. If you've lost your job; if you're struggling with a mortgage, you know that elections matter.""  Watch Gore say Americans must let Washington know that they want a change » . Gore cited concerns about the environment, lead-painted toys and food safety -- even pet foods -- as other reasons to vote for the Democrat. ""After the last eight years, even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter,"" Gore said, adding, ""After eight years of lost jobs and lower wages, we need change. After eight years of incompetence, negligence and failure, we need change."" Gore said the Bush administration has ""dishonored and disrespected"" the Constitution and led the nation through ""eight years of the most serious foreign policy mistakes in the entire history of our nation."" The Tennessean newspaper noted Obama was among the few senators in either party who argued against the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq prior to the invasion Gore called a ""blunder."" He called for Americans to move beyond partisanship and select in Obama a leader who can ""solve the climate crisis and create a bright future."" GOP spokesman Alex Conant reacted to Gore's criticism of President Bush. ""This election isn't about changing the past, it's about changing the future,"" he told The Associated Press on Monday evening. Calling attention to the fact that Gore's 2000 running mate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, has since left the Democratic Party to become an independent and is backing Sen. John McCain, he said, ""It's telling that half of the 2000 Democratic ticket endorsed John McCain early in the campaign, while the other half waited until Barack Obama had been the presumptive nominee for weeks.""","In front of thousands of cheering supporters, Gore made his '08 election debut .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The alleged chief of an al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group who was arrested by Lebanese authorities this week has died in custody, the Lebanese army said Saturday. The Lebanese army issued a statement ""confirming the death of detainee Majed Al-Majed this morning at the central military hospital after deterioration in his health."" A Saudi national, Al-Majed is accused of heading the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, a Sunni jihadist group that has claimed responsibility for several bombings. News of his death, which comes only a day after the Lebanese army announced his arrest, has prompted questions in Lebanon over exactly what happened. No details of his health issues have yet been released. Al-Majed was captured a few days ago by Lebanese army intelligence agents, Lebanon's state-run National news Agency said. The army said Friday that Al-Majed, whose identity was confirmed by DNA testing, had been on Saudi Arabia's most wanted list since 2009. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades recently took responsibility for a pair of suicide bombings targeting the Iranian Embassy in Beirut that left more than 20 people dead. The group warned that more attacks would come unless Hezbollah, a Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed Shiite militia, stopped sending fighters to support Syrian regime forces. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades has previously claimed responsibility for a failed attack on U.S. warships docked in Jordan and for bombings of Egyptian beach resorts in 2004 and 2005 that killed more than 100 people. The United States declared it a terrorist group in 2012, saying it was responsible for a 2010 attack on a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and had expressed interest in attacking Western interests in the Middle East. The group formed in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and has battled Lebanese government troops before. U.S. to Americans in Lebanon: 'Exercise extreme caution' CNN's Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","Detainee Majed Al-Majed died after his health deteriorated, Lebanon's army says .

"(CNN) -- Less than two months before the world focuses on Russia for the Sochi Olympics, President Vladimir Putin is handing out ""get out of jail free"" cards. A new amnesty law introduced by Putin allowed two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot to leave prison on Monday, two months before the end of their two-year sentences for a performance critical of the President. In addition, 30 Greenpeace demonstrators could go free under the amnesty law passed by Russian lawmakers last week that could affect 25,000 prisoners. Putin also pardoned former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. It all is part of a public relations offensive by Putin, who has solidified his political dominance in Russia and now seeks to improve the country's image ahead of the Olympic Games that begin February 7 in the Black Sea city of Sochi. The amnesty law and the Khodorkovsky release ""are to a certain extent tied to the upcoming Olympics,"" said CNN Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty. Russia's international image has suffered from an anti-gay law passed under Putin, with threats of protests and boycotts at the Olympics over its bans on ""homosexual propaganda."" In addition, the jailing of Khodorkovsky harmed foreign investment in Russia because it smacked of political repression, Dougherty noted. ""Russia wants to improve its image and increase investment in the country,"" she said, adding that Khodorkovsky's imprisonment ""caused some businesses to think twice about"" getting involved in Russia. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of ""selective prosecution"" and abuse of the legal system. He became both a political and economic threat to Putin by wanting to create a commercial oil pipeline that would break the government monopoly on the industry and by funding opposition politicians, Dougherty said. Khodorkovsky, who was due for release next year, wrote Putin a letter from prison that asked for early release because his mother was ailing. He insisted the letter contained no admission of guilt, and Putin said the pardon was on humanitarian grounds. Upon his release, Khodorkovsky left the country and has said he won't continue his political activities against the Russian government. ""Putin really believes that he's basically crushed the opposition, that he doesn't have to worry about them anymore,"" Dougherty said, calling the move a commentary on Russian society that now has relative political stability after major anti-government demonstrations in 2011. ""He may well think that he's had some victory over the opposition."" The government linked the new amnesty law to the anniversary of the 1993 adoption of Russia's post-Communist constitution. However, the Pussy Riot performers, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, called it a publicity stunt aimed at improving Russia's image ahead of the Sochi Games. ""President Putin obviously used this amnesty option to (brighten) up his image before the Olympic games,"" said Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of Tolokonnikova. ""Two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much,"" he said. ""So the effect of this amnesty for Maria and Nadezhda is not really felt."" Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a ""punk prayer"" at a Russian Orthodox cathedral criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time. The musicians were found guilty of hooliganism. According to Russian media, Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova qualified for amnesty under the new law because they have young children. The Pussy Riot case made headlines around the world, as did the anti-gay law passed in July that banned ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."" It bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it -- and has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. Critics say it is so vague that wearing a rainbow t-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex could bring prosecution. Last week, Putin defended the new law as necessary to defend the conservative Russian society from ""values which are received in a difficult way by our citizens."" Asked about the issue by CNN's Dougherty at a news conference, Putin said the law wasn't about criticizing anyone, but instead involved ""protecting us from rather aggressive behavior from some social groups who, in my opinion, are trying to impose their points of view in a rather aggressive way."" In an apparent jab at the anti-gay laws, the United States announced last week that its delegation to the Winter Olympics will include openly gay athletes such as tennis legend Billie Jean King and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. No member of President Barack Obama's family or current Cabinet will attend. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Diana Magnay, Alla Eshchenko, Laura Smith-Spark, Jason Hanna and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Pussy Riot band members go free under new amnesty law .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Volunteering in your community can be rewarding for many reasons -- you get to help others, give back to your community and hopefully enjoy some personal growth along the way. Volunteering may help with professional growth as well -- by gaining new experiences and meeting new people, you may just end up with a new job. ""Anyone who's interested in taking charge of their career, whether they are currently employed or not, should volunteer,"" says Marsha Egan, career coach and workplace productivity expert. ""It is perhaps one of the best kept career development secrets. Not only is it a great opportunity to network, but it's a wonderful chance to learn how to motivate in a positive way, become a leader and fine-tune organizational skills. The fact that you are giving back to [the] community and going to feel good about it -- that's an amazing bonus too."" 3 reasons why volunteering can help with your job search: . It adds to your résumé. A volunteering stint is a great addition to your résumé. It can help round out your experience and show that you not only have built professional skills but interpersonal ones as well. It can also help fill a gap in your résumé -- if you've been out of a job for a while, you can speak to how you took advantage of that time to help others in your community. It allows you to develop new skills or foster existing ones. Jim Feldman, author of ""Shift Happens! No Job, No Money, Now What? Reinvent Yourself Using Innovative Solutions,"" notes that when volunteering, you'll meet others, obtain new experiences and learn new job skills. Feldman suggests that you talk to the volunteer coordinators about what skills you have or you'd like to develop, and they'll usually provide some training to get you off the ground. Even if the skills you learn don't exactly transfer over to a potential job opportunity, it'll show prospective employers that you are up for trying new things and taking on new challenges. It helps you meet new people and network. Volunteering allows you to meet people you probably wouldn't have otherwise met and expose you to others with different backgrounds and perspectives. When volunteering for or attending charity events or fundraisers, strike up conversations with other volunteers or attendees. If appropriate, give out your contact information or ask for theirs. Sure, it might take you a bit out of your comfort zone, but you never know where it might lead. 3 tips for turning a volunteer opportunity into a potential job opportunity: . Be strategic about where you volunteer. Want to work in public relations? Volunteer at a public relations trade organization or offer to handle the publicity for a charity event. Choosing an association or volunteer role that matches up with your background will not only help you hone your skills, but it'll also allow you to meet people in that particular industry. Jeff Diana, chief people officer at SuccessFactors, an HR and business execution software company, stresses it's also important to be passionate about and interested in the cause for which you're volunteering. That enthusiasm will show when asked about it during a job interview. Diana recommends checking out sites such as Get Involved! and Volunteer Match; these sites can match you up with opportunities based on your interests. Don't make it all about the job search. While volunteering can help connect you to new people and potential career opportunities, it shouldn't be the sole reason why you choose to give back. If you go into it purely thinking about what's in it for you, not only will you lose out on the sense of accomplishment and enrichment it can bring, but others will likely see right through your intentions, which could cause a potential negative reaction. Treat everyone you meet as a potential influencer or employer. Mike Jaffe, career design and transition coach and founder of professional training and coaching company Jaffe Life Design, recommends treating everyone you volunteer with, or for, with respect.""Always strive to be professional, reliable, effective and courteous,"" says Jaffe. ""You never know who someone knows, and their impression of you, good or bad, can become an asset and create new possibilities as they share their experience of you with others. Conversely, if they share a negative view of you with others, it could come back to bite you."" So if you're out of a job, or even have a job but want to expand your horizons, consider volunteering.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The daughter of former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz says an appeal will probably do nothing to stop her father's death sentence. ""I don't think he has any hope of coming out"" of prison, said Zainab Aziz. Tariq Aziz, one of the best-known faces of the Iraqi government for more than two decades, was sentenced to death Tuesday by the Iraqi High Tribunal for his role in eliminating religious parties during Saddam Hussein's regime. His family was shocked by the verdict, the daughter told CNN. The family had no idea he was going to be sentenced Tuesday, Zainab Aziz said from Amman, Jordan. ""Until last week, they were hearing new witnesses in this case,"" she said, criticizing both the verdict itself and its timing. ""My father served his country for more than 22 years. He delivered himself to the U.S. Army [after the fall of Hussein] because he wasn't afraid. He didn't do anything wrong. He served his country,"" she said. ""He has been wronged,"" Zainab Aziz said. Badi Arif, an attorney who used to represent Aziz, said there is a political motive behind the death sentence. ""Mr. Aziz used to always tell me, 'They'll find a way to kill me, and there is no way for me to escape this,'"" Arif told CNN. ""But from a legal perspective, this sentence is wrong; this is illegal and this is unexpected."" In March 2009, Aziz was sentenced to 15 years in prison in connection with the 1992 executions of 42 merchants. Aziz was deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003, also holding the post of foreign minister for part of that time. Amnesty International urged Iraq not to carry out the sentences on Tuesday, even as it acknowledged the brutality of Hussein's regime. The Vatican also released a statement on Tuesday. ""The position of the Catholic Church on the death penalty is known. It is truly hoped therefore that the sentencing against Tariq Aziz not be carried out, precisely to favor the reconciliation and reconstruction of the peace and justice in Iraq after the great suffering it has gone through,"" spokesman Federico Lombardi said in a statement. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","He did nothing wrong and the trial was unfair, his daughter tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- A 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck Saturday in the Mediterranean Sea, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) south southwest of Avsallar, Turkey, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Aaron Carter filed a bankruptcy petition to shed more than $2 million in debt, mostly taxes owed from when he was making tons of money as a teen sensation. ""This is not a negative thing,"" Carter publicist Steve Honig told CNN. ""It's actually very positive. It's him doing what he needs to do to move forward."" The U.S. government is Carter's biggest creditor, according to the petition. He owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.3 million in back taxes from his income in 2003, when Carter was just 16. ""The bulk of the debt is from over 10 years ago when he was a minor and not in control of his finances,"" Honig said. ""This has happened to a lot of people who had fame at such at a very early age."" Carter is left with very little to show for his early success, according to his bankruptcy petition. He had just $60 cash in his wallet and $917 in his checking account when he signed the petition last month. His bank savings account held just $5. His personal property includes a 61-inch flat screen TV and his cell phone, all valued at just $500. He does wear a $3,750 Breitling watch. Clothing, two laptops, a guitar and a Louis Vuitton backpack put his fortune at just $8,200. Carter owns the publishing rights to the songs he wrote -- ""Saturday Night"" and ""One Better"" -- but he doesn't currently get any royalties from them, the filing said. Still, Carter is going ""in the right direction"" and ""really working his ass off,"" Honig said. He acted in more than 400 performances in the off-Broadway cast of ""The Fantasticks"" last year. He's currently on a 75-city tour of the United States, but the petition said he's only earning about $2,000 a month for those performances. That money ends when the tour ends in December. Carter's expenses are just $2,000 a month since he's living with a relative in Port Richey, Florida, when he's not on the road, it said. He dealt with substance-abuse issues, but Carter's been ""completely clean of quite some time,"" Honig said. He spent time in drug rehab two years ago.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- The death toll of a twin car bombing at a hotel in Mogadishu rose to 11 Thursday, with many of the victims security force members, a police spokesman said. At least 40 other people were injured. ""The death toll has hit 11 people, including three attackers and five security personnel, while the rest were civilians,"" said Gen. Mohamed Yusuf Omar Madale, a Somali police spokesman. At least four people were killed in the first attack Wednesday, Madale said. A half-hour later, another car bomb exploded just few meters from the scene of the first blast, killing at least seven people, mostly security officers. Police official Yusuf Ali said Wednesday that the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, and the second blast came as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured. At the time of the Mogadishu blasts, there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the hotel. It is believed the injured guards were part of the government officials' security detail. Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed condemned the attack Wednesday night. ""The terrorists started 2014 as they finished 2013 with indiscriminate violence & killings. Will only serve to unite Somalia against them,"" his official Twitter account said. A statement posted to a website associated with the Al-Shabaab terrorist network Thursday morning reads: ""The mujahideen forces carried out the attacks and they will intensify their attacks against the government of Somalia and the African Union troops in the country."" Last month, another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded, a government spokesman said. A car bomb went off on November 8 outside Hotel Makkah Al-Mukarama in central Mogadishu, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, the African country's interior and national security minister, told local media. Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali, the Somali government's former acting envoy to Britain better known as ""Dhub,"" said Abdirahman Omar Osman, a presidential representative. Other Somali violence has been traced to Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group and that was behind the deadly siege this fall of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall. A U.S. military drone strike in southern Somalia in late October killed two suspected Al-Shabaab members, U.S. officials said. And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group. In September 2012, Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, escaped an apparent assassination attempt at the Jazeera Palace Hotel, just two days after being selected as the troubled country's new leader. According to a presidential media officer and several journalists at the scene, early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the hotel, where the president was having high-level meetings. At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in that attack, according to journalists at the scene. The Jazeera Palace Hotel is near Mogadishu airport and it is frequented by government officials and diplomats. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu, and CNN's Ray Sanchez wrote this story from New York. Journalist Mohamed Nor contributed to this report.","Double car bombs explode near a Somali hotel .

"(CNN) -- Lebanese authorities have arrested the chief of an al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group that has previously claimed terror attacks in Lebanon, Egypt and elsewhere, the Lebanese army said Friday. The suspect is Saudi national Majed Al-Majed, who is accused of heading the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, the army statement said. He has been on Saudi Arabia's most wanted list since 2009, the statement said, adding that DNA tests had confirmed his identity. The Sunni jihadist group recently took responsibility for a pair of suicide bombings targeting the Iranian Embassy in Beirut that left more than 20 people dead. It warned that more attacks would come unless Hezbollah, a Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed Shiite militia, stopped sending fighters to support Syrian regime forces. The Abdullah Azzam Brigades has previously claimed responsibility for a failed attack on U.S. warships docked in Jordan and for bombings of Egyptian beach resorts in 2004 and 2005 that killed more than 100 people. The United States declared it a terrorist group in 2012, saying it was responsible for a 2010 attack on a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and had expressed interest in attacking Western interests in the Middle East. The group formed in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and has battled Lebanese government troops before. Beirut was shaken Thursday by a large car bomb blast in a residential neighborhood known as a Hezbollah stronghold. At least four people were killed and 77 injured in the explosion, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.","Saudi national Majed Al-Majed is thought to be head of the jihadist Abdullah Azzam Brigades .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer said he was ""pleased"" with his switch to a new racket as he began his 2014 ATP Tour campaign with a straight sets victory over fellow 32-year-old Jarkko Nieminen in Brisbane Wednesday. Federer used the larger-headed racket in a doubles match the night before, but this was his first significant test with the new equipment. Finn Nieminen was admittedly ideal opposition, he had lost 13 previous encounters with the Swiss star, and slipped to a 6-4 6-2 defeat in 69 minutes in the second round match. Federer is playing in Australia in the opening week of the season for the first time since 2000 and is proving a big draw in Queensland. He slipped to No.7 in the rankings in 2013 and has hired Stefan Edberg to his coaching team to help restore his fortunes. There has also been the introduction of a 98-inch racket head, an experiment he briefly tried after going out early at Wimbledon last summer. Federer is satisfied with the results and lost only five service points in the second set against Nieminen. ""I had a much longer time to get ready for this swing than I had last time around, after Wimbledon, before the American summer,"" he told the ATP Tour official website. ""So I'm not thinking about it when I'm going out there, which is a great thing. I'm hitting the ball really well, so I'm very pleased with the racquet."" He is competing in the doubles with Nicolas Mahut to ramp up his preparation for the opening grand slam in a fortnight. ""Now I have doubles tomorrow and the singles the next day, so it's really good for rhythm and good for your game. ""I expect myself to play a bit better in the next match, even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks, to be honest, and against Nieminen who can play very good tennis. Particularly here in Australia."" In the women's singles in Brisbane, second seed Victoria Azarenka scored an impressive second round success over Australia's Casey Dellacqua. The reigning Australian Open champion served notice she will battle to keep that title with a 6-3 6-1 win over the local hope to reach the quarterfinals where she will play unseeded Swiss Stefanie Voegele. A title match-up is looming against top seed Serena Williams, who is also into the last eight after beating Andrea Petkovic on New Year's Eve. Serena's elder sister Venus has reached the same stage of the WTA event in Auckland, New Zealand. The 33-year-old Williams trailed by a set and looked set for an upset defeat to Yvonne Meusburger before a typical rally. She won 10 out of 13 games to clinch a 4-6 6-3 6-2 victory. Later Wednesday, there was a shock defeat for Wimbledon champion Andy Murray at the Qatar Open to German Florian Mayer. Murray is playing his first competitive matches since back surgery last autumn, but looked well in control when he led by a set and 3-0. Mayer, ranked 40th in the world, refused to give up and proceeded to win 11 of the last 14 games for a 3-6 6-4 6-2 victory. Top seed Rafael Nadal survived a scare against another German, Tobias Kamke, dropping the second set in Doha before prevailing 6-3 6-7 6-3.","Roger Federer kick starts 2014 campaign with straight sets win .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Online retailer Amazon has said a system error caused it to remove a number of gay and lesbian-themed books from its sales charts. American novelist Gore Vidal has long been known as a liberal intellectual. On Sunday, a number of distinguished writers, including Gore Vidal, Annie Proulx and E.M. Forster, suddenly lost their best-seller ranking -- which is the number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells compared with another. As a result, famous novels such as Proulx's ""Brokeback Mountain"" and Vidal's ""The City and the Pillar"" were unranked Tuesday morning. However, Playboy: The Complete Centerfolds"" by Chronicle Books, which features pictures of over 600 naked women, remains ranked. Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith told CNN partner Web site CNET News that the ""glitch"" was being fixed, but declined to elaborate. ""This is an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection,"" she wrote in an e-mail statement. ""It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles -- in fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual Medicine, and Erotica,"" the statement said. ""This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazon's main product search."" Craig Seymour, author of gay memoir ""All I Could Bare,"" wrote in his blog, ""craigspoplife,"" that his sales rank was dropped earlier this year, only to be restored after a month. Amazon said his book had been classified as an ""adult product."" ""I brought this to the attention of my publisher, and they started looking into it,"" Seymour wrote. ""I also did some snooping around and it turned out that the only books I could find without a ""sales rank"" had gay content like mine."" Thousands of users have voiced their concerns online, with many accusing the retail giant of blatant censorship. This prompted Amazon to deny the move was part of a strategy to make the chart more ""family friendly."" It said the changes were caused by a ""glitch"" in the system. The ranking removal appeared to depend on how Amazon originally categorized each book. According to the Guardian newspaper, a paperback edition of British broadcaster and actor Stephen Fry's autobiography ""Moab Is My Washpot,"" which Amazon tags as ""gay,"" is unranked, whereas the original hardback, filed under ""memoir,"" is. The issue quickly became a hot topic over the weekend among Twitter users. In conversations under the hash tag ""#amazonfail,"" people tagged hundreds of titles affected by the apparent glitch. Others simply mocked the e-tailer. Share your views here . ""Looks like Amazon did a government style u-turn. Of course it was an error, yes,"" was the sardonic response from Jonnyp. Houseinrlyeh, meanwhile, said ""apologies work best when they contain an actual apology and not just an explanation."" Nara Filippon was one of the many outraged Facebook users to make their feelings known on various discussion boards. After describing herself as a loyal customer she said: ""Unfortunately your new policy to ban LGBT books has disappointed me and I won't be buying anything else from your Web site from now onwards."" Wendy Sumner Winter, who described herself as a straight college professor, said: ""I am sickened to see that the powers-that-be have de-ranked some of my favorite authors and their books, including James Baldwin (are you serious!?), Mark Doty and Paul Lisicky.""","Amazon: Move was caused by ""embarrassing ham-fisted cataloguing error""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan authorities have found the bodies of two foreigners who appear to have been shot during a picnic on a beach west of Tripoli, media officials said Thursday. The bodies were discovered on Tallil Seyahi Beach on the outskirts of the coastal city of Sabratha, according to the Sabratha Media Center. The identities and the nationalities of the two, described only as a man and a woman, have not been released. The UK Foreign Office and the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they were looking into whether the dead were citizens of Britain and New Zealand. ""We are aware of reports that the bodies of two foreign nationals have been found in Libya, and we are urgently seeking further information from the authorities,"" said Sinead Keller of the UK Foreign Office. An official at the New Zealand foreign ministry said it was working with ""relevant authorities to confirm this."" ""The bodies have not yet been formally identified and the next of kin have not yet been informed,"" the ministry official said. The two foreigners were reported missing, and police were actively searching for them when the bodies were discovered, the Sabratha Media Center said. It was not immediately clear from the media center how long the two were missing before their bodies were found. An initial police investigation shows the two were having a picnic in a somewhat remote area near a partially built resort. A photo posted on the Sabratha Media Center Facebook page purports to show the man and woman, who are lying face down in the sand. Near the bodies is a blanket that is spread out, with food and drinks strewn about. A backpack sat nearby. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the photo, which the Sabratha Media Center said it obtained and posted to its Facebook page. According to an initial police investigation, there are tire marks in the area. Investigators are looking for possible motives behind the killings, officials said. In recent weeks there has been a rise in crime in the area, including a Libyan man who was killed during a reported carjacking, according to the media center. The beaches in and around Sabratha are among some of the most developed on Libya's western coastline. They were a popular destination for picnics and swimming among foreigners before the 2011 uprising that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Jomana Karadsheh reported from Tripoli, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","The bodies were discovered on Tallil Seyahi Beach on the outskirts of Sabratha, media officials say .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's oil reserves may have been grossly overestimated and its capacity to continue pumping at current capacity exaggerated, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable sent from the kingdom in 2007. The cable, obtained by WikiLeaks and published in the British newspaper The Guardian, cited the views of Sadad al-Husseini, who had been in charge of exploration and production at the Saudi state-owned company Aramco for 12 years until 2004. Saudi Aramco dominates exploration and production in the kingdom. ""According to al-Husseini, the crux of the issue is two-fold,"" the cable says. ""First it is possible that Saudi reserves are not as bountiful as sometimes described and the timeline for their production not as unrestrained as Aramco executives and energy optimists would like."" Al-Husseini is quoted as disagreeing with his former company's estimate of total reserves in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer. ""He believes that Aramco's reserves are overstated by as much as 300 billion barrels of 'speculative resources.' He instead focuses on original proven reserves."" Al Husseini forecasts ""a plateau in total output that will last approximately fifteen years,"" meaning that soon after 2020 ""a slow but steady output decline will ensue and no amount of effort will be able to stop it."" The former Aramco executive's forecast was based on Saudi Arabia's stated goal of producing 12.5 million barrels per day by 2009. Industry commentators say it has fallen short of that goal because of the global economic slowdown and insufficient global refining capacity. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Saudi Arabia produced 8.4 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2010, and around 1.8 million barrels per day of natural gas. But less was available for export because of rapidly increasing domestic demand. And as global demand recovers, driven by India and China, the price of crude oil has risen sharply. In the long term, Al Husseini sees an ""underlying reality that global demand has met supply,"" according to the cable. ""Due to the longer-term constraints on expanding global output, al-Husseini judges that demand will continue to outpace supply and that for every million-barrels-per-day shortfall that exists between demand and supply, the floor price will increase by $12 (per barrel),"" the cable says. Oil industry observers say that while there have been significant finds of crude in recent years -- especially off the coast of Brazil and West Africa -- some fields are in deep water and will be difficult to recover. And they are not big enough to alter the fundamental picture with ""super-fields"" like the Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia beginning to decline. However, new reservoir technologies may allow producers to exploit reserves that are currently inaccessible. In Saudi Arabia's case, that amounts to an estimated 360 billion barrels. Oil industry analysts point out another variable: the use of alternative energy sources. A U.S. cable from 2009 says the Saudis want to develop renewable energy sources, including nuclear power, to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity. That could have the effect of reducing the need to divert crude from exports to fuel domestic electricity generation. The 2009 cable says analysts believe ""a civilian nuclear program ... is the only possibility the Kingdom has to generate sufficient electricity to meet projected demand from economic and population growth and increasing affluence without wastefully burning large quantities of fuel oil."" Last year Saudi Arabia announced plans to built two nuclear power plants.","U.S. cables from Saudi Arabia in 2007 were released by WikiLeaks .

"(CNN) -- About 200 demonstrators in Egypt clashed with security forces and local residents, leaving two dead in the country's second-largest city Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. A crackdown by authorities on Muslim Brotherhood rallies in the coastal city of Alexandria left two demonstrators dead and two policemen wounded, according to the Interior Ministry. ""During the demonstrations, protestors cut off roads, threw Molotov cocktails, set fires, damaged private cars, and fired birdshot pellets, and clashed with local residents,"" the Interior Ministry said. The Muslim Brotherhood, which was recently designated a terrorist organization by Egypt's military-backed government, claimed security forces had opened fire on demonstrators, killing two, including a college student, and wounding several others, according to a statement on the official Muslim Brotherhood website. Social media video, posted by supporters of the now banned Islamist organization, shows a chaotic scene with youths throwing fireworks at police vehicles and small fires smoking near residential apartments and local businesses. The overthrow of President Mohammed Morsy, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, in July 2013 spurred a deadly crackdown on Egypt's most organized opposition group. The group was recently banned by a court. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. But the interim government blames the group for a series of coordinated attacks, including a recent bombing on a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured.","Two people were killed and two police officers hurt in Alexandria, Interior Ministry says .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- More than half of children taking antiviral drug Tamiflu suffer side-effects such as nausea, insomnia and nightmares, UK researchers have said. Anti-viral drug Tamiflu caused nausea, insomnia and nightmares among some children studies show. Two studies from experts at the Health Protection Agency (HPA) showed a ""high proportion"" of British schoolchildren reporting problems after taking the anti-viral drug. Data was collected from children at three schools in London and one in south west England who were given Tamiflu earlier this year after classmates became infected. The studies by HPA experts were carried out in the early stages of the epidemic between April and May, when everyone sharing a classroom with a child who developed swine flu was given the drug, even if they showed no symptoms. Their research, published in the Eurosurveillance scientific journal, looked at side-effects reported by 11 and 12-year-old pupils in one school year in a secondary school in south west England. A total of 248 pupils took part in the study; their school was closed for 10 days after a pupil there contracted swine flu during a holiday in Mexico, researchers said. Seventy-seven percent of these children took the full course of Tamiflu, according to researchers. The report said: ""Fifty-one percent experienced symptoms such as feeling sick (31.2 percent), headaches (24.3 percent) and stomach ache (21.1 percent)."" One of the studies found that evidence of side-effects prompted UK ministers to change the policy so only confirmed or suspected cases were prescribed Tamiflu. The second study, also published by Eurosurveillance, looked at 103 children. The research found that 53 percent of children at three London schools had one or more side effects. The most common side effect was nausea, with 29 percent of the pupils complaining of this. Another 20 percent of those questioned by researchers complained of stomach pain or cramps, while 12 percent had problems sleeping, the study found. Almost one in five (18 percent) of the children reported a ""neuropsychiatric side effect,"" such as poor concentration, inability to think clearly, problems sleeping, feeling dazed or confused, bad dreams or nightmares and ""behaving strangely,"" researchers said. The UK's Department of Health said in a statement: ""The European Union regulatory position remains that no causal association between Tamiflu (or Relenza) and an increase in neuropsychiatric events has been established."" Reports from Japan, where Tamiflu has in the past been widely-used against seasonal flu, has linked the drug in rare instances with unusual neurological and psychiatric disturbances in children, according to media reports. Japan is now advising against prescribing Tamiflu to youngsters aged 10 to 19 after its own studies revealed people reporting psychiatric symptoms, according to media reports. A spokeswoman for pharmaceutical company Roche, which manufactures Tamiflu, told CNN: ""Abnormal behavior is recognized to occur in patients with influenza virus infection including those taking and not taking antiviral drugs. ""Following extensive investigations, no mechanism has been identified by which Tamiflu could contribute to such events. Following a review by an FDA advisory committee in the US, the labels for both Relenza (zanamivir) and Tamiflu have been updated to inform physicians that influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioural symptoms.""","Researchers say more than half of children who took Tamiflu suffered side-effects .

"(OPRAH.com) -- For more than 20 years, actress Christina Applegate has kept audiences laughing. ""It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse,"" Christina Applegate says. ""I cry at least once a day."" During her teenage years, she lit up the small screen as Kelly Bundy on the hit sitcom ""Married with Children."" After 11 hilarious seasons, Christina's career branched out to the big screen and Broadway. In 2007, Christina landed the starring role on ""Samantha Who?"" an acclaimed comedy series. After receiving Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance, it seemed that nothing could stop Christina's triumphant return to TV. Then, in April 2008, shocking news silenced the laughter. At 36 years old, Christina was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, Christina says she lived quietly with the disease. ""It's hard to live quietly,"" she says. ""I went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life."" Now, Christina is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they're at risk. As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, Christina says she's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old. In 2007, doctors recommended extra precautions. ""My doctor said that the mammograms weren't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts,"" she says. ""He suggested that I get an MRI."" Christina went in for her first MRI screening, which produced disturbing results. ""They found some funky things going on [in one breast],"" she says. Doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy. Then, the excruciating waiting game began. Christina continued to work and promote her sitcom, but the impending results were never far from her mind. A week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads. ""[The doctor said], 'It came back positive,'"" she says. ""Right now I'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment."" Doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast, and thankfully, they caught it at an early stage. Christina says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode. The day after her diagnosis, Christina says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon. ""I'm a Sagittarius,"" she says. ""We need things done now. So, for me, I had to get in now, and I wanted to have my surgery now."" Within a week, Christina had her first lumpectomy. Doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hadn't spread. Since the cancer was caught early on, Christina was told she'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy. Then, she received more life-changing news. A test for the BRCA gene -- also known as the ""breast cancer gene"" -- came back positive.  Oprah.com: Should you get tested for the gene? ""That sort of changed everything for me,"" she says. ""Radiation was something temporary, and it wasn't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast. I sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point."" Christina was given two options... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed. Christina made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. ""It came on really fast. It was one of those things that I woke up and it felt so right,"" she says. ""It just seemed like, 'I don't want to have to deal with this again. I don't want to keep putting that stuff in my body. I just want to be done with this.' & I was just going to let them go."" Before she went in for her surgery, Christina says she staged her first -- and last -- nude photo shoot. ""I made sure that I have close-up photographs of them from every angle so I can kind of remember them,"" she says. Christina's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon. ""I met with my doctor, and I told him that was my decision,"" she says. ""He brought the surgeon in, and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and I lost it."" Oprah.com: Going through a double mastectomy surgery . In July 2008, Christina went through with the surgery, which has left physical and emotional scars. ""It can be very painful,"" she says. ""It's also a part of you that's gone, so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process."" Before she went under the knife, Christina says the only mastectomy she'd ever seen was the one her mother received. ""[Her surgery] was in the '70s, and they didn't do a very good job back then,"" she says. ""So in my own mind I'm thinking, 'My God, I'm going to be butchered, and it's going to be horrible. I'm never going to love that part of me again.' & But I did a lot of research, and they can make some pretty boobies."" Currently, Christina says she has saline expanders in her body, which will make way for the new implants. Though she's proud of her proactive decision, she says she's reminded of her loss every day. ""It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse,"" she says. ""I cry at least once a day about it because it's hard to overlook it when you're standing there in the mirror. When you look down, it's the first thing you see... So you're reminded constantly of this thing -- this cancer thing that you had."" On the bright side, Christina says she won't have to wear a bra ever again. She also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer. ""I have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life,"" she says. ""For that, I'm really grateful."" Days after her diagnosis, Christina says she reached out to family and friends, including Melissa Etheridge, a Grammy winner and breast cancer survivor. Melissa shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life. ""The first thing she said to me is: 'Christina, this is a blessing that's happened to you in your life. Right now, you get to start over, and right now you get to change everything -- the way that you deal with things in life, the way that you react to things. Fear can hurt you. Stress can hurt you. This is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat... everything you do,'"" Christina says. Christina now looks at her health scare as a blessing. ""I am a 36-year-old person with breast cancer, and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s,"" she says. ""This is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as I can for early detection."" As she's learned, early detection may not come from a mammogram. Christina says she will fight for women to have access to MRIs and genetic testing, which many insurance companies won't pay for.

"(CNN) -- One week after Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" shattered art auction records, Mark Rothko's ""Orange, Red, Yellow"" has broken the price ceiling for a work of contemporary art. The 1961 painting, described by auction house Christie's as arguably the most important work by the Russian-Amerian artist to ever appear at auction, sold for almost $87 million Tuesday. The previous record was held by Francis Bacon's Triptych at $86.2 million. ""This was an historic event in the auction world, with three major records set in the space of a few short hours,"" said Brett Gorvy, Chairman and International Head of Post-War and Contemporary Art in a press statement. The entire auction raised a record $388.5 million, surpassing the previous record set in May 2007, also at Christie's, by some four million dollars. Feverish bidding also produced the highest price for a collection sold at auction, for 13 works from the Pincus Collection, described by Christie's as the ""most important and comprehensive ensemble of Abstract Expressionism ever to come to auction."" The Pincus lots were part of an impressive catalog of post-war art collected over 50 years by former clothing manufacturing boss David Pincus and his wife Gerry before his death last December. The collection included the record-breaking Rothko, bought by Pincus in 1967, which was sold to an anonymous phone-bidder after a seven-minute volley of more than 50 bids, Christie's said. ""The art market is ignoring European woes,"" Randy Slifka, a New York collector and money manager told Bloomberg. ""People feel comfortable buying prime works by world-class artists."" Of the top 10 works sold, eight buyers were listed as ""anonymous,"" while two were attributed to private buyers from Europe and the U.S. Jon Reade, the managing director of Art Futures Group in Hong Kong, says there's a good chance the money flowing into the Christie's New York auction room Tuesday came from Asian investors looking to diversify their portfolios. ""A lot of it's from China, new wealth from China. They're buying property, they're buying cars and they're looking for new asset classes to get involved with,"" he said. ""Of course it's like a knock-on effect, one Chinese billionaire buys an artwork and makes money from it, tells his friend, and it's just reverberating around the whole world art market at the moment."" Reade said the Chinese started emerging as major buyers in the art market in 2009 and 2010, coinciding with strong growth in the Chinese economy. A 2011 report by auction sales analysts Artprice said that sales that year ""confirmed China's domination of the art market, with the economic health of Asian collectors generating higher price levels than anywhere else in the world."" Reade said: ""The Chinese art market has been strong for the last two years and is getting stronger and now some of the big global players are coming on board as well."" Of the 59 works offered by Christie's at the New York auction, 56 were sold including more than a dozen for record prices for their respective artists. Jackson Pollock's Number 28, 1951, a riot of black enamel and silver-grey paint, sold for just over $23 million, a new world auction record for the artist, Christie's said. And at $36 million, Yves Klein's FC 1 (Fire-Color 1) set a new record for the French artist who created the work just weeks before his death in 1962. Reade, whose firm encourages investment in art, said that he expects demand to continue to rise as investors look for returns beyond traditional and poorly performing markets. ""At the moment property in Asia, not just in Hong Kong, has just topped out in a way. Stocks have obviously been very volatile over the last few years to say the least so people are looking to put their money in new asset classes,"" he said.","Mark Rothko's ""Orange, Red, Yellow"" sells for almost $87 million .

"(CNN) -- Why the hell would anyone drink two liters of beer at 6 in the morning before running with wild animals through the streets of a strange city? This was the first of many questions I posed to myself upon dusting off a journal from 1997, the year I (kind of) ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. I went looking for the journal after photographer Clint Alwahab and I were assigned to cover a rendition of Pamplona's famed Festival de San Fermin in Conyers, Georgia. This wasn't Pamplona. That was apparent as soon as we arrived at Conyers' Georgia International Horse Park, a far cry from Pamplona, where the ""encierro"" is run on a half-mile of cobblestone streets through town. There's a good deal more pageantry in Pamplona, as you might expect, with the rockets, or txupinazo, counting down to the running, the Giants and Big Heads Parade and afternoon bullfights. Conyers had free beef jerky. But was it ever going to measure up? Relying on a journal from a seemingly constantly inebriated 22-year-old, I realized that outside of bulls and beer, the events are nothing alike. (Author's note: Many of the revelations in the aforementioned journal were long forgotten by the writer until it was discovered in his home office last week. Unless otherwise noted, all quotes are from the journal.) The purpose . The Great Bull Run is nakedly a for-profit event. It will visit nine more cities between now and August before returning to the Atlanta area in October 2014. Upcoming locations . To merely spectate cost $10, while running alongside the bovine herd cost anywhere between $45 and $75. Those enchanted by the experience could run again for $25. This isn't to say Pamplona isn't a moneymaker. There just isn't a fee for anyone bold/dumb enough to get in the street with bulls, but the encierro is still a major cash cow for Pamplona (terrible pun intended). Pamplona's infrastructure is so unequipped to handle its San Fermin visitors, which can quadruple the city's population, that makeshift shops and beer stands pop up all over town. The hotels are booked far in advance, so my cohorts and I ""walked down to the park (Vuelta del Castillo) and found a nice corner under a tree where we'd reside for the weekend."" The park was packed with revelers, most of them charming, but one who ""was sniffing cocaine off of a paper plate"" and another ""bastard who tried to pick (my pal's) pocket while we were sleeping."" Taking in all the revelry was great fun, but sleeping in the park took its toll, as washing up in a plaza fountain over a long weekend left me feeling ""like I'd been dipped in mayonnaise."" But I digress. The purpose, as it were, for the festival is to honor the patron Saint Fermin. It dates back to the Middle Ages, as opposed to 2013 for Conyers, and many locals told us at the time that Fermin was killed and dragged through the streets of Pamplona by bulls. It appears he was actually beheaded. Which also sucks. Getting there . Traveling to Conyers involved driving 25 miles east of the city in a Saturn. Done and done. Pamplona, however, required a hellish trek after a language barrier resulted in us showing up two hours late for the express train. The slow train took 10 hours to make the 250-mile trip from Salamanca, where I was attending school. Fortunately, it had a bar car where we imbibed Cruzcampos and Carlsbergs before returning to our train car for a siesta. We continued our naps in the Castejon train station, where during a two-hour layover, I awoke to find ""a guy with a Mohawk and a safety pin through his cheek who had decided to micturate on the floor of the train station."" On the last leg, we hopped a ""train full of ... Spaniards who sang all the way to Pamplona,"" then caught a bus downtown to find ""(expletives) partying like it was Dec. 31, 1999."" The bulls . The Conyers bulls were pansies. This isn't merely my observation. Not only did they have the ends of their horns shorn off (the tips of a Pamplonan bull's horns resemble pitchforks), but they're also a good deal smaller than the Spanish species. ""More like running with goats,"" said a man named Frankie, laughing and beer in hand. ""I think if a bull hits me, I might do more damage to him."" Glenn Gentle, 72, a retired Navy diver who has been to Pamplona eight times since 2000, told me a bull broke three of his ribs in 2004. ""I just was in the way, I guess,"" he said. ""It's hard to escape over there."" After the Conyers run, Gentle seemed unfazed that the bridge of his nose was bloody and most of the skin was missing from one of his elbows. He said he didn't know whether a bull or the crowd ran him over -- ""it was awful hard"" -- but he expressed relief he'd taken a tumble on a horse track rather than Pamplona's cobblestone streets. Still, the ""adrenaline junkie"" was unimpressed with the Conyers bulls' ferocity. ""In Pamplona, those bulls are bred at a special place in the south of Spain to be mean and aggressive. The bulls there will look for you and run you down,"" he said. The actual running . As the bulls and their white-and-red-clad entourage galloped toward Pamplona's Plaza del Toros, the streets trembled. Wooden fences separated the bulls from spectators, and Red Cross paramedics were stationed along them to tend to injured runners. As the bulls neared -- and I saw how big these beasts actually were -- I chickened out and sought refuge behind the fence, the crowd erupting in glee as they thundered past. Once the bulls and runners blew by the clock tower where I was catching my breath, ""I jumped the fence to find my amigos. All of a sudden, everyone screamed and darted for the fence. A wee bit dazed, I turned around to see a million-pound bull standing 20 feet from me."" The sight apparently conjured my Catholic upbringing as ""I hit the wall of people like a battering ram, asking God's forgiveness for all my sins, as I desperately tried to swim over the people and the Red Cross fence."" Where Pamplona's streets were narrower, offering few options for escape, the Conyers event was run on a wide, dirt track with several nooks in the steel gating. I jogged on the fringe of the Conyers running, experiencing virtually none of the raw fear that had possessed me 16 years before. As the bulls neared, I dipped into one of the nooks and watched, amused, as the cattle passed. The grand finale . The Conyers running was capped by an enormous tomato fight, which is reminiscent of another Spanish festival, La Tomatina in BuÃ±ol. I've never been. They basically dumped 50,000 pounds of tomatoes in a parking lot and let attendees have at it. It was hilarious watching participants emerge, covered in seeds and red tomato excrement. The Pamplona running happens every morning for eight days and culminates in a series of bullfights. The runners and bulls spill from Calle Estafeta into the stadium, where the bulls are corralled. Runners scramble around the bullfighting ground tussling with smaller bulls, which were described to me as babies. ""These were NOT babies. The baby had a three-foot rack and was flipping full-grown humans through the air with ease."" After watching the spectacle for about 20 minutes or so, we left the stadium and ""found a nice plot of grass in front of the stadium to take a nap. When we woke up, we made our way to one of the makeshift bars and drank Aguila."" Conversely, in Conyers, Clint and I hopped in the Saturn and drove back to Atlanta. I made it home just in time for the Auburn game. Sober. Follow Eliott C. McLaughlin on Twitter: @CNNWriters .","Conyers, Georgia, holds first in series of bull runs, kicking off nationwide tour .

"(CNN) -- Olivia Wise, a teenager who refused to let an inoperable brain tumor kill her spirit, died Monday. Olivia gained fame in the last weeks of her 16-year-long life when a Katy Perry song she recorded in a Toronto studio in September became a viral hit online. ""She died peacefully in her home surrounded by the extraordinary love of her family,"" a family statement sent to CNN said. The teenager said that she didn't want people crying at her funeral, but that they should celebrate her life, her mother wrote in a letter to CNN. Her version of Perry's hit ""Roar,"" which she recorded in September after learning there were no more treatments available, drew the attention of Perry after it was published on YouTube in October. ""I was very moved and you sounded great,"" Perry told her in a video posted on YouTube. ""I love you. A lot of people love you and that's why your video got to me. It moved everybody that saw it."" Perry concluded with: ""Keep roaring!"" The international attention drew more than a million viewers to Olivia's song and helped raise $77,000 for the Liv Wise Fund that was started in her name in support of brain tumor research. The video shows OIivia sitting in a wheelchair in the middle of the studio, singing softly at first and struggling with her breaths. ""'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar."" Her energy grows and she smiles as she sings ""I got the eye of a tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire."" ""Olivia is a fighter and has gone through the fire,"" her cousin wrote in the post under the video posting on YouTube. ""In fact, she was going through the fire while she recorded this song, but you wouldn't know it, because she was dancing right through it."" Her family posted another song video on YouTube just days before Olivia's death. She wrote ""Simple Girl"" -- a song about how she wanted to live life -- when she was 11. The only time she sang it was on September 6, during the same session in which she recorded ""Roar."" Teen featured in viral video dies . ""In many ways, Olivia has lived a shortened, but full life,"" her mother wrote in the letter to CNN.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two tropical cyclones have made landfall in eastern China, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from coastal areas as the Philippines and Taiwan assess the damage that one of the storms left in its wake. Tropical Storm Saola plowed into the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian on Friday morning, after the torrential rain and strong wind it brought to parts of the Philippines and Taiwan had left more than 40 people dead. Saola arrived hours after Typhoon Damrey had reached the Chinese coast farther north in Jiangsu Province. The last time two powerful storms struck China in such quick succession was in 2006, according to CNNI Meteorologist Jennifer Delgado. In Fujian, the authorities relocated more than 300,000 people to ""safe places"" ahead of Saola's arrival, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported, citing the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters. The authorities warned of potential floods and mudslides resulting from the storm's heavy rain. Saola's winds had weakened by the time it hit the Chinese coast. They had been at typhoon strength when the storm slammed into Taiwan on Thursday morning, reaching more than 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph) near its center. When Saola moved away from Taiwan on Thursday night, it had killed five people, injured 15 and left two missing, according to Taiwan's Central Emergency Operations Center. More than 6,700 people had to be evacuated from affected areas, the center said. One of the deaths was filmed by a closed-circuit camera in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. Video from the camera showed a man disappearing down a sink hole after the rain-sodden ground collapsed beneath him. Taiwan's rugged terrain intensified the effect of the storm. ""The mountains really help enhance the rainfall,"" said CNNI Meteorologist Taylor Ward. ""They basically force the air upwards, and that squeezes out the possible precipitation."" The casualties in Taiwan came on top of the 37 people killed and 33 injured by the storm in the Philippines, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. The deaths resulted from causes that included drowning, falling trees and landslides, the agency said. In all, Saola dropped as much as half a meter (1.5 feet) of rain over the Philippines, Ward said. The storm hovered near the country for several days. On Thursday night, Damrey was generating winds as strong as 126 kilometers an hour (78 mph) near its center when it made landfall in Jiangsu, Xinhua reported, citing the Chinese National Meteorological Center. Powerful winds and rainstorms from the storm have lashed nearby cities, Xinhua said, noting that 29 flights had been canceled at the Qingdao Liuting International Airport on Thursday night. No flights were canceled Friday morning, though, it said. Damrey had skirted southern Japan before traveling across the sea toward China's northeastern coastline. East Asia has experienced a number of strong storms in recent weeks. Early last week, a powerful storm that hit the southern Chinese coast prompted Hong Kong to raise its strongest typhoon warning for the first time in 13 years, shuttering much of the city. The storm also pummeled the neighboring Chinese province of Guangdong with heavy wind and rain. Typhoon season in the region typically lasts from June through October, with an average of seven to 10 named storms hitting the Chinese coast. The storms usually form in the area between the Philippines and southern Japan, known as ""Typhoon Alley."" Inland China has also suffered from severe rain this summer. A violent rainstorm in Beijing last month caused the worst flooding in the Chinese capital in decades, killing at least 77 people and provoking criticism from residents about the city's infrastructure and response to the disaster. Heavy rain elsewhere in China has left dozens more people dead, filled rivers and lakes to dangerous levels and forced the authorities to step up emergency preparations. On Thursday, Premier Wen Jiabao called on local authorities to intensify flood control efforts during a two-day tour of Henan and Hubei provinces, Xinhua reported. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Anjali Tsui contributed to this report.","NEW: The Chinese authorities have relocated more than 300,000 people .

"(CNN) -- Two Secret Service supervisors on President Barack Obama's protective detail are under investigation for alleged misconduct, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the internal Secret Service investigation told CNN's John King. The details were first reported in the Washington Post Wednesday night. The investigation began after an incident at the posh Hay-Adams Hotel near the White House in May. As first reported by the Post, one Secret Service agent allegedly removed ammunition from his service weapon and left a bullet in the room of a female guest, whom he had met in the hotel bar. The agent tried to regain entry to the room when he realized the bullet was left behind, the Post said. Hotel staff notified the White House after he identified himself as a Secret Service agent and demanded to be let in to the room. No police report was filed and no complaint was filed with the Secret Service by any of the parties involved, a government source told CNN's Joe Johns Thursday. ""The Secret Service takes allegations of improper behavior seriously and works diligently to investigate and resolve issues. Any misconduct is regrettable, but when it is identified, appropriate action is always taken based on established rules and regulations,"" Edwin M. Donovan, deputy assistant director of the Secret Service, said in a statement. Investigation revisits Secret Service prostitution scandal . The internal investigation was launched as a result of inquiries by the Post, the government source said. That probe led to a routine search of the agent's agency-issued BlackBerry, the Post reported. The federal law enforcement source confirmed that the agent, a supervisor, and a second supervisor were discovered to have sent sexually suggestive e-mails to a female Secret Service employee. Nothing explicitly suggestive has been found, the government source said. The first supervisor was removed from his position, the source said, but the second supervisor remains on the presidential security detail. The Post reported that the second supervisor was removed from the security detail. While the paper named the two supervisors involved, CNN is not yet identifying them. The investigation follows the Secret Service scandal in April 2012 involving prostitution and drinking before a presidential trip to Cartagena, Colombia. A review prompted new rules of conduct for Secret Service employees in the wake of the incident. Sen. Ron Johnson said at a Senate hearing Thursday that despite assurances from Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service that the 2012 Cartagena prostitution scandal involving presidential detail agents was an anomaly, congress has found similar instances in 17 countries. ""Yesterday we learned that two senior level United States Secret Service agents assigned to the President's detail were recently disciplined for sexual misconduct. According to whistle-blowers, one of these men helped lead the USSS internal investigation of the sexual misconduct in Cartagena in April of last year. This is like the fox guarding the hen house,"" the Wisconsin Republican said. ""This type of behavior jeopardizes the security of the President of the United States and makes U.S. government personnel susceptible to coercion and blackmail."" While not addressing the specifics of the most recent case, William Hillsburg, acting director of the Public Affairs Department of the Homeland Security office of the inspector general, said that in the next couple of weeks his office is expected to release an inspection report with an in-depth look at the culture of the U.S. Secret Service. The report will look at whether there's something in the Secret Service culture that led to the behavior in Cartagena. It will also include recommendations on how agents are trained.

"(CNN) -- The doctor-patient relationship is a complex one. It occurs at a stressful and busy time for both the patient and the doctor. Because it involves at least two humans, there are usually at least three versions of the conversation: the doctor's, the patient's and the true version. A survey published this week in the journal Health Affairs reflects this complex relationship. Lisa Iezzoni and her colleagues surveyed 1,891 physicians nationwide about how honest they are with their patients regarding medical mistakes and a patient's prognosis. The survey found that although two-thirds of doctors agree they should share serious medical errors with their patients, one-third did not completely agree. Nearly two-fifths of the respondents said they did not disclose their financial relationships with drug and device companies. And more than 55% of physicians said they often or sometimes described a patient's prognosis in a more positive manner than the facts might support. These survey results are unsettling. We all want to think of medicine as an honorable profession and that the people in it work with integrity. While we should all be appalled that a doctor would deceive or lie to a patient, we should also look beyond the white coat for an explanation. While it is not a vindication, the fact is physicians are human. They have all the feelings and failings of humans. Please keep in mind, medical errors can be due to negligence, but they are more often a failure to analyze data appropriately. Many doctor errors are simply a matter of bad luck: The doctor was not good enough that day and would have done better the day before or the day after. Some bad outcomes are not really the physician's fault. Some doctors do not admit error out of fear of litigation. But my experience is that the discomfort of addressing one's own failings or weakness is more commonly the reason for not coming forward. It is a normal human tendency to not want to admit an error. Confession is difficult, especially when you have to admit responsibility to the person you have hurt. In the case of a ""bad luck"" outcome, the physician may be unwilling to admit their lack of control. This is often due to a lack of communication during the consenting process -- when doctors explain the possible outcomes or side effects -- and can lead to patient anger when things go badly. Ironically, when I have seen a doctor admit an error, the patient or patient's family is usually forgiving and rarely sues. So why would a doctor not be honest about a patient's disease or prognosis? This is likely because doctors are not always the best communicators. Medical explanations involve defining some complicated things. This is difficult and it is often easier to just not do it. Sometimes there is a tendency to simplify to the point of not telling the truth. It is unfortunate that our medical system pays doctors handsomely to do medical procedures, but does not reimburse well for talking to, counseling and spending time with patients. In a normal office environment, a physician is often forced to see four or more patients per hour. Questions go unanswered or half answered as the physician moves from room to room assessing the patient, reading a patient's history and lab research, documenting and looking things up. It's a rare private practice physician who can block extra time for a patient with special needs. This can be costly. Telling a patient bad news is horribly difficult. It is always an emotional struggle for any caring human being. The emotional incentive is to hold back information or be less than honest. It is harder for me to tell a patient that they are dying -- and that all we can reasonably do is try to keep them comfortable -- than it is to tell a family member that a patient has died. As someone who studies how health care is provided and how health care is consumed, this survey's findings do not surprise me and the solutions are not simple. We need to transform health care. This involves empowering the patient. Patients need to take an interest in their own health. Ask good questions and expect if not demand answers. Some patients will need advocates or navigators to help them. The transformation also involves more members of the medical profession coming to realize the meaning of the term ""profession."" A ""profession"" is a group of people who put their own interests secondary to the interests of the people they serve. A profession is also a group that educates and polices itself. My greatest concern is many doctors and patients fail to comprehend just how complicated medicine can be. Even doctors fail to remember that medicine is a science and an art, often with unclear answers. There are things in medicine that are scientifically known, and things that are unknown. There are also things that are believed. The wise physician draws a distinction between the three. The unwise doctor often confuses what he believes with what he knows. These unwise doctors may not know they are not telling their patients the truth. The opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily represent those of CNN, The American Cancer Society, or Emory University.","Survey published in Health Affairs shows one third of doctors don't share medical errors .
Results are unsettling, doctor says, but we should remember that physicians are human .
Doctors often try to soften the blow of a prognosis by not giving all the negative details ."
"New York (CNN) -- New York City's longest-serving Police Commissioner Ray Kelly will join the Council on Foreign Relations after he leaves his post at the end of the year, the organization announced Monday. Kelly -- who served at New York's top cop for a total of 14 years -- will join the council in January as a distinguished visiting fellow. He will focus on national security issues, including counterterrorism and cybersecurity. ""Ray Kelly spearheaded the modernization of the New York Police Department. The result is that crime is down and the NYPD's counterterrorism capabilities are second to none. We are excited and proud to have his experience, expertise, and judgment at the Council,"" said CFR President Richard N. Haass. During Kelly's time as commissioner, 16 terror plots were thwarted, including a plan to blow up New York's subway system -- which was foiled by the FBI -- and a close call in Times Square when a lone wolf failed to detonate a car bomb, Kelly told CNN in April. Kelly's lasting legacy, however, may be New York City's highly controversial stop-and-frisk policy, which Kelly continues to defend. ""Stop, question, and sometimes frisk is a practice, it's a tool that exists throughout law enforcement,"" Kelly told CNN's Susan Candiotti. He added, ""People say, 'Oh, there are 670,000 stops in New York City.' It amounts to less than one stop a week per patrol officer."" During his 43-year career with the NYPD, Kelly served in 25 different commands before being named commissioner. He will be succeeded by William Bratton, who was New York's police commissioner from 1994 to 1996 under Mayor Rudy Giuliani.","New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly will focus on counterterrorism at think tank .

"(CNN) -- Texas billionaire Allen Stanford was taken into custody Thursday night on a fraud-related charge in Stafford, Virginia, the FBI said. Allen Stanford, right, poses with his Antigua cricket team in November 2008. FBI Supervisory Special Agent M.A. Myers would not provide further details on Stanford's arrest, but his attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told CNN that Stanford had surrendered to agents. Stanford, accused of a $9.2 billion fraud by U.S. regulators, denied all wrongdoing in a tearful interview in April during which he threatened to punch his questioner in the mouth. ""I would die and go to hell if it's a Ponzi scheme,"" Stanford, who was ranked at No. 205 in Forbes magazine's list of 400 richest Americans with assets of more than $2 billion, told ABC News. The assets of Stanford and his financial groups, based in Antigua and the Caribbean, are frozen while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigates allegations he ran ""a massive Ponzi scheme,"" a pyramid scheme in which new investors' money is stolen to pay profits to existing clients. During his ABC interview, Stanford complained that he had to fly commercial airlines after the federal government confiscated his six private jets. ""They make you take your shoes off and everything,"" he said. ""It's terrible."" Stanford threatened to punch the interviewer when he was questioned about reported links to alleged money laundering for a Mexican drug cartel, charges he vehemently denied with the threat before backing down. Before his arrest, Stanford faced an array of civil claims. He and his wife owe back taxes, penalties and interest of at least $226.5 million, the IRS said in court documents filed in Dallas, Texas, last March. The final total could be even higher because the Stanfords have not filed their income tax return for 2007. The IRS says they owe $110 million in back taxes, $55.8 million in penalties and $60.7 million in interest for the 1999 through 2003 tax years. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that Stanford was behind ""a fraud of shocking magnitude."" FBI agents served Stanford with SEC papers accusing him and three of his companies of orchestrating a $9.2 billion investment fraud scheme. With the filing, the IRS joins thousands of other creditors in the case who are seeking a crack at Stanford's remaining assets. In February Antiguan and Barbudan regulators took control of Stanford's financial institutions on the twin-island nation, a day after federal agents served the Texas businessman with papers accusing him of running an investment fraud scheme. In a complaint filed in February in federal court in Dallas, Texas, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stanford International Bank of using a network of financial advisers to sell about $8 billion of ""certificates of deposit"" to investors. The bank boasted it had a unique investment strategy that had allowed it to reap double-digit returns on its investments for the previous 15 years, the SEC said. The civil complaint alleged an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales. Stanford's bank claimed its network had $51 billion in deposits and assets under management or advisement, with more than 70,000 clients in 140 countries. The allegations against Stanford and his companies sparked runs on Stanford banks in Antigua and in Venezuela, where the government took over the local subsidiary in February after it recorded ""extraordinary"" withdrawals, according to Venezuela's superintendent of banks. The SEC complaint also named James Davis, SIB's chief financial officer; Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group; and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. Stanford, who sponsored a cricket team and series of matches in Antigua, had his ties to the sport severed earlier this year when the England and Wales Cricket Board announced it would not play any further Stanford Twenty20 matches in Antigua as well as shelving plans for the Quadrangular Twenty20 events. Under the deal struck between the ECB and financier Stanford last summer, England were due to play four further $20 million matches in the Caribbean, while the proposed Quadrangular events were scheduled to take place annually from 2009 to 2011, with each edition worth around $9 million.","Texas billionaire Allen Stanford is taken into custody on a fraud-related charge .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The humble thermostat is getting a 21st-century makeover. And so is the boombox, thanks to a son of the late reggae legend Bob Marley. The 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show doesn't start in earnest until Monday, but at a gadget preview event Sunday, some electronics startups seemed determined to give redemption to ordinary appliances, and not just those from children of the Rastafarian movement. In a packed hotel ballroom, companies demonstrated portable televisions, plastic guitars, stoves and solar-powered e-reader cases. Here are five of the more intriguing gadgets we found: . Nest thermostat . For most of their existence, home thermostats have been mere functional accessories. White or beige, they blend into the wall and only get noticed when someone needs to change the temperature. With an elegantly simple dial that turns blue when cooling and orange when heating, the new Nest digital thermostat seeks to change that. If it looks like something made by Apple, that's because it's designed by former Apple exec Tony Fadell, the man behind the look of the iPod. ""We're the iPhone of thermostats,"" said Nest Labs marketing spokeswoman Kristin Bickett, continuing the Apple theme. ""It's the simplicity of the design."" The Nest saves energy with motion-tracking sensors that detect when people enter or leave a room and adjust temperatures accordingly. It also tracks your energy-use history and energy savings. When it's connected to Wi-Fi, it downloads software updates automatically. And if you're lazy, you can control it wirelessly from your couch with your phone or tablet. It sells for $249 and is available from heating- and cooling-system installers or at Nest.com, although the website is currently sold out. Marley Bag of Rhythm . ""We're bringing back the boombox from the '80s!"" said House of Marley spokeswoman Karen Korponai cheerfully in what must surely be one of the stranger marketing pitches at a cutting-edge gadget show. Indeed they are. The Bag of Rhythm is pretty much that -- a portable stereo with high-end components, a handsome birch wood face and an iPhone/iPod dock, nestled inside a canvas shoulder bag. Take it to the beach, to the college quad or to your next Hacky Sack game. The rechargeable battery promises five to six hours of music for your dancing, air-guitaring or spacing-out pleasure. The Bag of Rhythm will sell for $300 when it hits the market in February, Korponai said. The House of Marley company, which also makes earbuds and headphones, operated under a partnership with the late Bob Marley's family. One of his sons, Rohan Marley, was at CES to help promote the product. Dyle TV tuner . Why is it that your uncle's clunky old hand-held TV can pick up live channels, but our cutting-edge smartphones are left with 20-second cat videos? A new device called Dyle can put live TV on an Android phone, iPhone or iPad. The cork-size plastic gizmo has a headphone jack at the end of a short wire, which houses an antenna that can pick up digital TV signals. The wireless TV transmission is the same one that pipes into many homes that don't subscribe to cable. That means no monthly fee, and watching hours of video doesn't add up in costly cellular data bandwidth. Mobile Content Venture, the year-old company formed by such media giants as Fox Broadcasting and NBC Universal, makes the mobile TV service. The company expects people will access live TV from their phones in addition to all on-demand content found online. The over-the-air broadcasts Dyle pulls in are limited to a dozen or so channels. ""We don't think it's one or the other,"" Erik Moreno, an MCV general manager and also a Fox executive, said in an interview. ""We think consumers want to do both."" MCV and Belkin International, which makes the accessory, declined to announce a price or release date. Those details should come in the next few months, Moreno said. Dyle will also be included in an upcoming Samsung Android phone for MetroPCS, a prototype that MCV demonstrated at the event Sunday. A metal antenna can be extended from the top of the phone to improve reception -- and to make users look like they stepped out of a time machine from 1992. Guitar Apprentice . ""Guitar Hero"" publisher Activision Blizzard hung up its ax a year ago, but music equipment maker Ion Audio is breathing new life into the plastic guitar with a new gizmo called the Guitar Apprentice. The Gibson-style guitar body has a slot in the soundboard for an iPad to be inserted. Using a companion application, Guitar Apprentice players can run their fingers across virtual guitar strings while holding buttons on each fret along the neck to play musical notes. The buttons light up to teach newbies proper finger placement for playing each chord. Virtual shredding will commence when the $99 Guitar Apprentice hits the market in June or July, an Ion spokesman said. Prospective Doors cover bands can already practice with Piano Apprentice, a $100, 25-note keyboard with a place for hooking up an iPad. Strange days, indeed. Tinke vital-signs monitor . Like some similar health-care gadgets, the Tinke is a little gizmo with a sensor that plugs into the bottom of your iPhone. Unlike those devices, however, you don't have to put a clamp on your finger to read your vital signs. If you simply place your thumb on Tinke's sensor for 60 seconds, it will tell you your heart rate, breathing cycle and blood-oxygen level. The Tinke also will store your data on your phone so you can chart your heart or breathing rates over hours or days. Manufacturer Zensorium, a Singapore-based company, expects to debut the gadget in mid-2012 and sell it for about $100.","At a CES preview event, CNN goes searching for noteworthy gadgets .

"(Real Simple) -- Want to elevate your home without taking on a complete overhaul? Interior decorator Nick Olsen -- DIY whisperer and master of the cheap trick -- reveals the little tweaks that make the biggest impact. Real Simple: How did you get started in this field? Nick Olsen: Right after getting my architecture degree, I read about the designer Miles Redd in a magazine. I was so blown away by his bold aesthetic and everything he'd accomplished by the age of 35 that I wrote him a letter asking for a meeting. Two weeks later, I had my first full-time job, as his assistant. It was fate! Real Simple: 3 decorators give readers' rooms makeovers . Real Simple: What's one quick change that will improve any room? Olsen: Lower the artwork. People tend to hang it too high; it should be at eye level. And don't worry about having something on each wall. It's better to cluster art in one or two spots than to spread it out. Real Simple: Decorating a huge room can be intimidating. How do you deal with soaring spaces? Olsen: My philosophy is to fill them with large-scale furniture and art. If you're a less-is-more type, go for one massive piece, like an amazing painting over the sofa. Real Simple: Suppose you can't afford art that big? Olsen: Buy a blank canvas and paint it yourself. Pick the most interesting color in the room (as long as it's not already the dominant color) and just cover the canvas in that shade, using the same paint you'd use for walls. There's no way to mess this up, and it costs next to nothing. Google [famed abstract artist] Ellsworth Kelly for inspiration. He has pieces like this hanging in the Whitney Museum. Real Simple: 21 ways to enhance an entryway . Real Simple: Any tips for jazzing up a minuscule space? Olsen: Nearly every room has a door. Work it. Paint it a glossy black: It takes only two hours and gives a room instant sass but won't eat up any valuable real estate. Real Simple: Say you can revamp only one room. How do you keep the rest of the place from looking shabby? Olsen: Fiercely edit the undone rooms. Get rid of the junk; keep only essentials. You'll be poised to redecorate when the time comesâ€”and until then your rooms will feel calmer. Tell visitors you're experimenting with minimalism. Real Simple: 40 living room decorating ideas . Real Simple: What do you always want to fix when you go into someone's living room? Olsen: The floor plan and lighting! Real Simple: Break that down for us. Olsen: A good living room needs a comfortable place to sit, a place to rest your drink, and a place to read a book. But people default to the school-dance arrangement, where everything is pushed back against the walls. So I start by moving the furniture closer together, toward the center of the room. Then I fill out the arrangement with occasional chairs and tables to create functional seating areas. It makes the space feel so much more intimate and conversational. Real Simple: 20 low-cost decorating ideas . Real Simple: And for the lighting? Olsen: If we've learned anything from the movie Gremlins, it's that bright light is the enemy. Install dimmers, or change your bulbs to extra-soft white 40-watt bulbs. That $30 investment makes a huge difference. Real Simple: What if you have a room that just feels blah? Olsen: A common feature of boring rooms is a lack of color. Start there, and think from the ground up. Buy a patterned rug you love: here's your palette. Go for a geometric dhurrie if you like modern, or multicolored stripes if you're more traditional. You can pull the wall and furniture colors from the rug, then pick up its accent tones in pillows and other accessories. Real Simple: 23 decorating tricks for your bedroom . Real Simple: Speaking of color, are there any surprising shades you're really into right now? Olsen: I think fuchsia should be the color of the year. It's so rich and chic, it's like red's hipper sister. I'd use Benjamin Moore's Gypsy Pink on walls in a room with neutral furniture and gray trim. Or just do the ceiling (use high-gloss for that). Real Simple: One piece of advice you'd shout from the rooftops? Olsen: Stop overthinking every little change and just try it! It's easy to say, ""Oh, that desk will never work next to my bed."" Move it and see how it looks. Sometimes pulling that blue armchair from the den into your green living room can work miracles. Real Simple: 16 before-and-after room makeovers . Real Simple: Name an item you'd like to banish for good. Olsen: That poufy, marshmallow-shaped leather sofa from 1988. I can't slipcover it, I can't change it, and I can't convince someone that it's not really comfortable, because it is really comfortable. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of Real Simple - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- Seems like Dennis Rodman can't get enough of North Korea. The retired basketball star is headed to the reclusive country for the third time on December 18. He'll spend several days helping train the North Korean basketball team, which will play at least one exhibition game against former NBA players in January, according to Paddy Power, the UK-based online betting company sponsoring Rodman's trip. The heavily pierced and tattooed icon will be traveling with a documentary crew, Paddy Power spokesman Rory Scott said. But it's not clear whether Rodman, 52, will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom Rodman calls ""a very good guy"" -- despite international condemnation of the country's human rights record.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration has not always been great at selling its agenda, but the president's adoption of the right-wing slur ""Obamacare"" as a prideful new name for the Affordable Care Act has been a notable exception. We often think the proper response to being called a dirty name is to object. That's a good first step, but in the long term, the judo approach is constructive -- hurl the power being used against you back to your opponent. For example, in 1968 William F. Buckley could offend Gore Vidal by calling him a ""queer"" on television. Today, the line would feel antique and impotent, in large part because gay men adopted the term for themselves and denatured its sting. Women today are doing the same with b---h. Black people long ago adopted the N-word as a raffish term of in-group affection, and if you ask me as a black person, we'd do better to stop going to pieces when white people say it. If the word didn't do the job, people would be less likely to use it. Kanye West understands the technique. His idea of emblazoning the Confederate flag on T-shirts to take possession of it in the name of black America is inspired. The good ole boy hangs a Confederate flag out his window and black people are walking by under it in T-shirts with the same flag on it -- that's how you get a new world started. Yet on Obamacare, we face the awkward fact that the right wing has not been completely vanquished in its quest to vilify the program with a name. We hear of quite a few out people out there who confidently espouse the tenets that the Affordable Care Act is based on and yet lustily declare themselves opposed to Obamacare, which they think is something separate. (Watch this Jimmy Kimmel video to see people do that very thing.) But this doesn't mean we'd be better off if Obama hadn't adopted the term Obamacare. For one, for those in favor of the program, the term stands as a useful reminder of one of the few large-scale triumphs of this administration on the domestic policy front. Health care policy isn't as inherently dramatic as battles over education, the environment or the culture wars. In the grand scheme of things, Obama's legacy in the popular consciousness is better served by a term as memory friendly as Obamacare, just as the Johnson administration is better served by its association with Medicare rather than ""Social Security Act Title XVIII."" But what about those Obamacare opponents who think companies should be required to enroll people despite pre-existing conditions and that young people should be able to stay on their parents' policies until age 26, while unaware that this makes hating Obamacare about as logical as seeking to breathe while disapproving of respiration? Well, we can assume that in a massive, poorly educated nation such as this one, a healthy segment will display this ""keep your government hands off my Medicare"" level of political sophistication. We assume, however, that in a modern democracy, change comes from ongoing disputation, as ""conversations"" move in certain directions. It will be hard for such people not to notice, as time goes by, that the provisions they espouse came into being under ""Obamacare,"" whatever their take on Tea Party ideology. Even sooner than this, the prevalence of the meme holding these Affordable-Care-Act-loving Obamacare opponents front and center as national jokes will have a certain effect. Oh, we won't see many contrite admissions of ignorance. But that's not how ideological battles are won. As often as not, people admit the truth to themselves, but they'd have no way to do even that if Obama hadn't picked up the Obamacare term and lobbed it back. Kanye West's idea with the Confederate flag T-shirts is ""Now, whaddya gonna do about it?"" For those who want universal health care but hate Obamacare, the ignorance so deep that there's nowhere to go but up. What are they gonna do about it? Learn, apparently -- they couldn't avoid it if they tried. That's progress.

"New York (CNN) -- More than two-thousand college-bound students applying to Fordham University received an e-mail Wednesday night informing them they had been accepted to the school, when in fact their status was still unresolved, Fordham University says. ""Congratulations once again on your admission to Fordham,"" the e-mail read. The e-mail was sent to thousands of prospective students who had applied for early admission to New York's Fordham University, said Bob Howe, senior director of communications for Fordham. However, 2,500 of those newly accepted-to-Fordham students received congratulations in a financial aid related e-mail, which usually comes after a proper acceptance letter, Fordham University said in a statement. Fordham sent a correction e-mail later Wednesday evening and all applicants were able to check their admission status online by midday Thursday, according to the statement. Five-hundred were ultimately not admitted, while the rest were deferred until March or had incomplete applications, Howe said. Netta Walker, 17, from Jacksonville, Florida, felt the same disappointment. Walker was wrongfully accepted to Fordham's Lincoln Center campus as a musical theater major. ""The fact that they accepted me and then denied me was really painful,"" Walker said. ""My dad was really upset about it. It wasn't the fact that I was denied, it was the fact that they sent a denial after an acceptance."" ""My wife and I were there for our daughter. She still has opportunities. What if some poor kid out there thought this was their only opportunity and they had no one to help them? It's terrible,"" said Netta's father, Antonio Walker. The inaccurate e-mail was mistakenly sent by a member of Student Aid Services, a third-party company that serves as an undergraduate admission consultant to Fordham, said Mary Fallon, a Communications Consultant for Student Aid Services. Student Aid Services said the mistaken acceptances were a result of human error and there is no indication of a computer glitch that could lead to errors in any of the other 700 secondary schools it provides services, Fallon said. ""We are devastated by the error that has occurred today and extremely upset by the anguish that we have caused. Please accept our most sincere and heartfelt apologies,"" Craig Carroll, CEO of Student Aid Services, wrote Wednesday evening. Fordham University said it ""deeply regrets that some applicants were misled by the financial aid notice"" and ""is working with SAS to find out what went wrong, and will put procedures in place to ensure such a mistake doesn't happen again.""","Fordham tells 2,500 applicants they're in when their status is uncertain .

"Juneau, Alaska (CNN) -- It started when a friend handed her the book ""Scream Quietly or the Neighbors Will Hear,"" about violence against women. ""I took it home and didn't put it down all night,"" Caren Robinson told me, laughing nervously and then tearing up, her voice quavering. ""And I realized it was me. We just didn't talk about it back then ... I just thought I was the only one."" That was in the late 1970s, shortly after Robinson -- a fiery 63-year-old who looks like the Alaska version of Reba McEntire -- moved to Juneau, Alaska, to escape an abusive husband who, at different points over years, held a gun to her head, beat her and, one time, sexually assaulted her. She called the cops on him twice, she told me, but he never was arrested or charged. The police told her maybe she should consider a divorce or that, when he used a gun, he was just ""teasing"" and it had gotten out of hand, she told me. Robinson would go on to become a pioneer of the women's rights movement in a state that needs it more than any other. Alaska is estimated to have the highest rate of reported rape in the county, according to FBI crime data. The rate is three times the national average. State surveys show 37% of women will face sexual violence; and 59% will suffer from threats, domestic abuse and/or sexual assault. Because those numbers are still so high, Robinson sometimes wonders if all her work to end violence against women here has been a waste of time. It hasn't, of course. The results can be seen inside the walls of the Aiding Women in Abuse and Rape Emergencies, or AWARE, shelter in Juneau, which first opened in a two-bedroom house in the late 1970s and at its current location in 1985 -- a time when there were few if any women's shelters in the state. They can be seen in the lives changed because she took battered women into her houseboat before there was any formal place for them to go. And they can be seen in Alaska's Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, which she helped lobby for and create, and which continues to fund violence prevention and treatment programs here. It's the rest of the state that needs to step up. The lawless 'end of the land' Too many women aren't believed when they come forward to report rape and domestic abuse. Too many offenders aren't prosecuted. (Only 46% of reported sexual assaults in Alaska are referred for prosecution and 22% result in a conviction, according to the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center.) Too many families tolerate or just accept abuse and rape they see and hear in their own homes. And far too many communities remain virtually lawless. All that could change if the state would follow Robinson's lead. Her life story should be enough of a wake-up call for this state. Alaska's pioneer woman grew up in Weatherford, Texas, about as far from Alaska as an American could get. She was a beauty queen -- became Miss Parker County at age 17, wearing a gown her mother made. But she remembers that night more for the violence. It was the first time her then-boyfriend gave her a black eye. He was jealous of the attention, she told me. But she stuck with him, thought she was in love. The rapist next door . ""I remember ... hiding, putting makeup on around my eyes, trying to avoid my mother and father for a few days,"" she said. ""Embarrassed."" It only escalated from there. She tried to leave and he came back for her, one time riding after her on a motorcycle, she said. She ended up moving to Alaska to finally get away, for good. They were divorced by then, and a group of her friends drove up to the state on a bus and she followed with her 4-year-old son, on a plane. ""I lucked out,"" she said. ""It's the best thing that ever happened to me."" Shortly after she arrived in Juneau, that's when a friend gave her the book that would open up all her thinking -- make her realize that she hadn't done anything to deserve being beaten and raped, that violence against women was a disease that grew from silence and oppression. She learned that Juneau was not up to protecting its women; the city had no 911 service, let alone a shelter for battered women. So she did something about it: She and a group of like-minded friends started housing survivors of rape and domestic violence in their homes. That's when she started letting women stay in her tiny houseboat, which she rented because she couldn't afford a home in picturesque Juneau. To hear her son, Shane Robinson, in his 40s, tell it, his mom was at this work virtually on her own, his whole life. ""She worked pretty much all the time,"" he told me. And he said he thinks now that their lives were at risk because of her advocacy. States where rape is most common . Her voice is one Alaska didn't want to hear. Robinson set up a hot line for victims and responded to some of the emergency calls herself. She remembers waking up in the middle of the night and throwing Shane in the car to go to a hospital with a rape kit, to be sure it was used. ""Unfortunately, the case never went anywhere,"" she said. ""I even remember (police) called her to take two lie detector tests to make sure she was telling the truth."" ""We even did radical things like post pictures of known rapists in all of the bar bathrooms,"" Robinson told me, ""because we couldn't get the assistance we needed from the local law enforcement at the time."" When other survivors of violence weren't willing to speak up, Robinson met with members of the state legislature. She said that sharing her story openly helped men who might otherwise ignore these issues pay attention and change laws. Forcing that conversation may be Robinson's greatest contribution. She realizes that. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska . ""It's now in the public eye,"" she said. ""People can't turn their heads any longer. They see it. They hear it. They know it's happening."" But she wrestles with her legacy. Several years ago, she backed away from advocating for victims of rape and domestic violence. After several public officials and community pillars in Juneau were outed as abusers, she became paranoid, she told me. She started thinking everyone she met was an abuser or rapist. ""There is a blessing in not knowing how bad it is around you, except by picking up the paper and seeing it daily: a 30-year-old man, a 45-year-old woman, a 27-year-old man have been arrested for domestic violence,"" she said. Talk to her about the statistics now -- that Alaska is still America's rape capital -- and the life drains from her face as she says she's not sure anything's changed. Alaska needs to prove her wrong. This state can change. It just needs to wake up, like Robinson did all those years ago. ""Violence inside the home, within the family, is not new, and because it is not new, it is not easy to see it for what it is,"" Erin Pizzey, a women's rights activist in the UK, writes in the book that changed the course of Robinson's life back in the 1970s. ""People have had lots of practice in ignoring it. They will turn a blind eye or cross the road. They will even, as one woman told Women's Aid, turn up the TV to block out the shouting and sobbing next door so that they can no longer hear it."" Turn down the TV, Alaska.

"(CNN) -- It seems George W. Bush can take a joke -- and tell one. But before the former President sat down with Jay Leno on the Tonight Show late Tuesday, the comedian turned his successor, Barack Obama, into the brunt of his hard jabs. Leno raked him over the coals over Obamacare. ""Better him than me,"" Bush quipped afterward, relieved. He's happy to be out of line of fire. ""Eight years is plenty,"" he said. ""I don't miss the spotlight."" Bush has largely avoided it since he left the White House in 2009, and Leno couldn't help but immediately pry into the reason why. Leno told the 43rd president that he was surprised that he agreed to appear this time. It was Bush's fourth appearance on the show. Bush used the opening to land the first shot at the late-night host, who will go off the air next spring after 20 years on the tube. ""You're about to head out to pasture. Just wanted to see what you look like, before you got to the gate,"" he said to laughs. Bush, like most predecessors, holds tongue on successor . Legacy . Then came his serious answer. ""I don't think it's good for the country to have a former president criticize his successor,"" Bush said. As he has often in the past, Bush said that history will judge his legacy. But he didn't appear concerned. Historians are still preoccupied with George Washington, he said. ""If they're still writing biographies of the first guy, the 43rd guy doesn't need to worry."" Leno asked him for some advice to the sitting President on dealing with tough decisions. ""You have to believe in what you're doing,"" he said. Family, faith and a good team helped him deal with the rest, when he was President, Bush said. President Obama's approval ratings have taken a pounding in the wake of the technical glitches that have plagued the launch of the Affordable Care Act. Bush knows what public scorn feels like. But he said he did not take opinion poll numbers to heart. ""The only poll that really mattered was on Election Day. My first election was a little closer than I wanted,"" he said, grinning over one of many moments of self-deprecation. CNN exclusive: Bush on AIDS, Mandela, Snowden and his legacy . Retirement . Retirement seems to have afforded Bush opportunities for fun and fulfilling charity work. He and his wife Laura travel often to Africa, where the Bush Institute runs health initiatives. Leno showed a video of Bush dancing with locals in Zambia, making them laugh, and photo of the former Chief Executive painting a clinic. It's a good message to leaders around the world, Bush said. Bush: Obama 'ought to play golf' ""If it's OK for the President to be painting and scraping, it's OK for them to be painting and scraping."" Bush joked that he has taken up a new profession since retiring from the Oval Office. ""I am a painter,"" he told Leno with a straight face. Leno asked, if he would add that to his resume. ""You may not think I'm a painter; I think I'm a painter,"" Bush added with a sly smile. Bush made a gift to Leno of a portrait of the comedian, which he painted himself. He has been taking lessons in Dallas, and the results show. When he first met his teacher, Bush said he told her: . ""There's a Rembrandt trapped in this body. Your job is to find him.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's State of the Union address and the traditional post-speech road trip were designed to boost both his agenda and Democratic chances in this difficult election year. But there were instant reminders of the tough terrain, and internal Democratic jitters: The Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin was nowhere to be found when the President visited; that after several vulnerable Senate Democrats publicly tried to create distance between their re-election bids and Obama. Obama State of the Union themes are Democrats' 2014 playbook . And then, this, in an exclusive conversation with CNN's Jake Tapper: . Tapper: ""It's possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country, but not citizenship. Would you veto that?"" Obama: ""Well, you know, I'm not going to prejudge what gets to my desk."" CNN exclusive: Obama says he's not recalibrating expectations . On its own, maybe that's just a conciliatory tone so as not to become part of the GOP's debate about immigration. But the timing makes the President's open mind more significant. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi just Wednesday said of the immigration debate: ""In our caucus there has to be a path of citizenship."" And speaking to The Washington Post, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, whose unions are vital to Democratic midterm campaign chances, said of a GOP plan that provides legal status but not a guaranteed path to citizenship for illegal immigrants: ""It's a joke. It's a hoax, is what it is. It's like fool's gold."" So Obama is now on record saying he won't prejudge an idea that is a nonstarter to the top House Democrat and a ""joke"" to organized labor. And he is not only at odds with those two traditional allies -- he is at odds with himself. A year ago, speaking in Las Vegas, the President laid out his bottom line: ""For comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,"" he said then. The President's refusal to draw a veto line on the citizenship question will make his liberal base anxious, and those tensions could hurt in an election year. Frustrated liberals start to look beyond Obama . But whether liberal disappointment now turns into a political problem closer to Election Day depends in large part on whether Republicans can test the President's openness by getting a bill to his desk. And that remains a giant question mark. Speaker John Boehner wants the House to pass, in several pieces, immigration changes that would include citizenship for so-called ""Dreamers"" -- younger undocumented people who were brought illegally into the United States by their parents -- but guarantee only legal status for older undocumented individuals. House Republican leaders unveil immigration standards . If the House were to act, it would then need to try to reconcile its ideas with already passed Senate legislation. Democrats control the Senate, and finding common ground, again assuming the House acts, likely would prove difficult. But, for now, the biggest question is whether the House will act. Boehner not only believes the changes are good economic policy, he also is trying to help his party deal with a Latino voter crisis that significantly complicates any Republican White House aspirations. But many Republican members of Congress are worried more about their 2014 races and angering the conservative base, whose turnout is critical in the midterm environment. Most House Republicans believe any immigration debate distracts attention from Obamacare. And on the Senate side, there is less urgency as well because of the states the GOP is targeting in its effort to retake control. The 11 seats now held by Democrats that are the top GOP targets have relatively small Latino populations. But in each of those, conservative GOP base turnout would be critical if the race is close come November. The speaker understands that he is at center stage at the moment, and that any chance to see the Democratic immigration tensions in full force depends on whether the House can first advance something meaningful. ""It's been turned into a political football,"" the speaker said Thursday of the immigration debate. ""So I think it is time to deal with it. But how we deal with it is going to be critically important.""","Several vulnerable Democrats put distance between themselves and Obama .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. district judge ordered New York City to pay $128 million in to firefighters who allege the city used an entrance exam that deliberately sought to keep African-Americans and Latino Americans off the force. The judge also ordered the FDNY to hire 293 black and Latino applicants. ""It has been in the city's power to prevent or remedy the need for damages proceedings for a decade, and it has not done so,"" U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garufis said in his ruling on the class action lawsuit. He called it the ""consequences of the city's decision to ignore clear violations of federal law."" The federal government had sued the city (United States of America and Vulcan Society Inc. vs. City of New York) over fire department entrance exams they said discriminated against black and Latino applicants. A group of black firefighters alleged the city had intentionally discriminated against them, violating Title VII, the U.S. Constitution and state law. The lawsuit alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills. Because of the hereditary nature of the fire department, white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed. ""There has been one persistent stain on the Fire Department's record,"" the lawsuit said. ""For decades, black and other minority firefighters have been severely underrepresented in the Department's ranks. ""According to the most recent census data, black residents make up 25.6% of New York City's population; when this case was filed in 2007, black firefighters accounted for only 3.4% of the Department's force. In other words, in a city of over eight million people, and out of a force with 8,998 firefighters, there were only 303 black firefighters. ""This pattern of underrepresentation has remained essentially unchanged since at least the 1960s. While the city's other uniformed services have made rapid progress integrating black members into their ranks, the Fire Department has stagnated and at times retrogressed."" Michael A. Cardozo, New York City's corporation counsel, disputed the decision. ""We believe the court's latest opinion is erroneous and, in any event, is the first step in a lengthy process. As the court itself noted, any damages the city ultimately must pay will be reduced by the amount each member of the class earned. When all the proceedings have been completed, the damages, if any, that the city will have to pay will be far less than $128 million,"" he said. In court documents, the city said of the judge's finding of bias: ""Under the Court's faulty analysis, any rational jury would necessarily find that the City deliberately used facially neutral exams to suppress black employment even as it conducted a targeted multi-million-dollar minority recruitment campaign, enlisted Columbia University to study methods of maximizing FDNY diversity, increased the minority composition of its other uniformed services, engaged an expert with a mandate to design an improved exam, and devised a panoply of other devices to diversify the FDNY's ranks"" The lack of minorities in U.S. fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits. The last available national figures, from the 2000 census, show 8.4% of the nation's firefighting forces to be black and 8.6% to be Latino. Blacks are 12.2% of the population; Latinos are roughly 16%. However, other big cities have made much faster progress at diversifying their ranks. More than half of the Philadelphia and Los Angeles fire departments members are black or Latino. Lawyers for the firefighters who sued said the decision would mean payments to black and Latino applicants to the New York Fire Department who were never hired or hired late from the 1999 and 2002 eligibility lists that resulted from exams given those years. Paul Washington, past president of the Vulcan Society, said: ""The Vulcan Society has been fighting for almost 75 years to open the doors of the Fire Department to black firefighters. This is a great victory for those who have been excluded from serving our city because of their race. We hope the FDNY moves quickly to welcome the 293 Black and Latino applicants who are entitled to be hired, and we look forward to serving with them.""

"(CNN) -- Apple is indeed planning to introduce an iPhone with a larger screen, according to sources speaking to the Wall Street Journal. The company has reportedly ordered 4-inch screens from its suppliers, a bump from the currently standard 3.5-inch screen size that Apple has been using since the original iPhone appeared in 2007. Rumors of a larger-screened iPhone have been floating around for some time now -- especially since comparable Android phones gotten bigger and bigger, like the Galaxy Note and it's monster 5.3-inch screen. But many observers --including those of us at Ars' Infinite Loop --have not bought into those rumors. You can count me as a critic of this rumor, but there may be more to the large-screened iPhone rumors than we originally thought. We're not likely to find out the truth anytime soon, thoughâ€”the report says production is slated to begin next month, and Apple isn't expected to roll out new iPhones until the fall.

"(CNN) -- Today, the day after the tragic shootings near Milwaukee, the fog will begin to lift. Just as after Columbine and Aurora, we will hear the names of the suspect and victims. We will learn more about the motive and imagine the nightmare that unfolded within those walls. In the past, hearing these horrific details would be enough to bring us together in national unity. But that will not be enough today. Today, we are called to do more. We are called to do the hard work of listening. If we really want to unite in response to this national tragedy, we need to know whom we are embracing. For many, this means learning about Sikh Americans for the first time -- and listening closely to what's at stake. For me, the mass shooting is not just about how to keep guns out of the hands of a murderous few. It's also about my community's sacrifice in the struggle to live as free and proud Americans. As a Sikh American whose grandfather sailed by steamship from Punjab, India, and settled in California 100 years ago, my family's story spans the struggle of Sikhs in America. Donning a turban and long beard, my grandfather tamed the hard floor of the Central Valley on a John Deere tractor in the early 1900s. Sikh pioneers such as my grandfather could not own land or become citizens because of the color of their skin, but they stayed and farmed, weathering race riots and decades of second-class treatment until the law permitted their children and grandchildren to become citizens. Like many Sikhs, I grew up with deep roots in America and also fell in love with the heart of the Sikh faith: devotion to one God, who requires us to uphold equality between women and men and all peoples, and perform seva, service to our community as an expression of our faith. Our house of worship is called a gurdwara, where we recite and sing the poetry of our sacred scriptures.Â Many Sikhs wear five articles of faith, including kesh, long uncut hair that most men and some women wrap in a cloth turban. Nearly every person who wears a turban in America is Sikh. Tragically, the turban meant to represent a commitment to service and justice has since marked Sikh Americans as targets in hate violence. Our family, alongside Sikh families who arrived in a wave of immigration after the 1960s, became American in law but not necessarily in the eyes of our neighbors. I was old enough to remember racial slurs and shattered windows after the Iran hostage crisis, the first Gulf War and the Oklahoma City bombing. Still, none of this could prepare me for 9/11. In the hours and days after 9/11, turbaned Sikh Americans became automatically suspect, perpetually foreign and potentially terrorist -- confused with Muslims, and so immediate targets in anti-Muslim violence. Hate violence swept the country, and on September 15, 2001, a Sikh man was gunned down in front of his gas station in Mesa, Arizona. My family knew Balbir Singh Sodhi; it felt as though an uncle had been murdered. But the killing was not broadcast widely on national news. A few days later, I grabbed my camera, left college and began a journey across America that would last a decade, capturing on film the stories of Sikh Americans profiled, beaten, stabbed, shot but persevering in faith and resilience. The FBI reported a 1,600% increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the year after 9/11. Over the last decade, I became part of a new generation of Sikh Americans who organized and became lawyers, artists, journalists and elected officials, in part to advocate on behalf of a community repeatedly swept up in waves of anti-Muslim rhetoric, violence and racial profiling. In a poor economy and critical election season, we have recently watched ideologues use anti-Muslim bias to turn a profit in dollars and votes. When discontents can easily access guns, many of us feared more hate violence. Whether or not the shooting in a Milwaukee suburb is a hate crime, the news has reverberated through every Sikh American home. We saw our own gurdwara on the television screen; we imagined our own aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, caught in the gunfire. And we shared an all-too-familiar sense of helplessness, grief and the sadness of a community that has long struggled to live, work and worship peacefully in this country. But this time, something new happened: The whole nation paid attention. Thousands of people posted messages of love and support in the face of unspeakable tragedy. They knew that the Sikh community gathered to pray on a Sunday morning just like millions in churches across the country. They knew that the terrible loss of life so recently after the shootings in Aurora shocks the conscience and violates our deepest values. They knew that this is not a Sikh tragedy but an American tragedy. Today and in the days to come, I believe Americans are hungry for the next step. We are ready to come together in a groundswell of healing, hope and renewed commitment to a world without violence. We are ready to come together in true national unity, we are ready to listen. There is a Sikh gurdwara in nearly every city in America. Come this Sunday morning. Listen and be with us. Americans' support -- every candle, every prayer -- will be felt by Sikh Americans across the country. Together, we can all be Sikhs; we can all be Americans -- and know what that means.

"New York (CNN) -- On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly is questioning why none of the city's mayoral candidates has requested a briefing from the NYPD about its counterterrorism program, strategies or tactics. He told an audience that even though the threat of terror in New York City is as substantial as ever, mayoral candidates have yet to meet with him about their plans for fighting terrorism in America's largest city. ""The threat of terrorism is as great, if not greater, today than it was before the World Trade Center was destroyed,"" Kelly said Monday, speaking in front of the Association for a Better New York and Council on Foreign Relations. ""Yet I can tell you that none of the candidates has requested a briefing from the Police Department on this topic. I believe the public has a right to ask them some important questions."" Kelly noted that in the past 10 months, at least five terror plots against New York City were foiled, including the potential attack by the Boston bombing brothers had they not been captured. ""What is their understanding of the terrorist threat to New York City and its immediacy? What is their perspective on the role the NYPD should play in protecting New York from global terrorism? Will they expend their political capital and continue to fight in Washington, D.C., for the federal funds we need to maintain our defenses?"" Kelly asked. The city's primary election for mayor is taking place Tuesday. A spokesman for Bill de Blasio, the mayoral front-runner garnering 39% of Democratic primary voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll released Monday, told CNN that de Blasio requested a counterterrorism briefing on August 29. ""Bill de Blasio believes there is nothing more important than protecting New York City from the threat of terror and keeping New Yorkers safe. After the President's remarks on Syria, the office requested a briefing from the NYPD on the city's counter-terror efforts and is working with City Hall to schedule it,"" Wiley Norvell, press secretary for de Blasio, told CNN on Monday. Bill Thompson, who is receiving 25% of the Democratic vote, according to the poll, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. On his campaign website, Thompson says he plans to enhance and establish security measures to protect roads, bridges and tunnels from terror. Specifically, the plans include strategies from ""keeping token-booth operators in the stations"" to ""speeding up the installation of cameras and motion detectors on platforms."" Christine Quinn addresses counterterrorism in her platform for mayor. According to the Quinnipiac poll, Quinn has 18% of the vote among Democrats. ""Christine Quinn is the speaker of the City Council, and as part of her day-to-day job helping run this city, she has conversations and briefings regularly with the NYPD on everything from crime to counterterrorism,"" Mike Morey, a spokesman for Quinn, said Monday. ""In the course of this campaign, she has been advised by and consulted with numerous officials in the NYPD and with anti-terrorism experts because she knows the single most important responsibility for the mayor of New York is keeping the public safe."" Quinn has called for more city employees to be trained in counterterrorism tactics, including sanitation and transit workers, making them a bigger part of the surveillance program. She also proposed a review of New York City infrastructure that could be vulnerable to terror attacks, including metal trash cans, and said the New York City Police Department should be more closely engaged with universities to design curricula to ""fight crimes of the future."" In his speech, Kelly emphasized the public's responsibility to inquire about the future of New York City's safety and push beyond complacency. ""The public should demand detailed answers from the candidates about their plans to protect New York. We've come too far and we've sacrificed too much to leave ourselves vulnerable.""","Ray Kelly: Candidates haven't met with him about plans for fighting terror in New York City .

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- They arrived in the United States from West Africa, young girls held against their will and forced to work for hours on end.  But this time, it didn't happen hundreds of years ago. Nicole's journey started in 2002, when she was barely 12, in her small village in western Ghana.  She and about 20 other girls were held in plain sight, but always under the watchful eyes of their captors. ""It was like being trapped, like being in a cage,"" said ""Nicole,"" now 19. CNN agreed not to use her real name. ""I always have to behave, behave, behave, behave. No freedom at all."" The girls' families sent them to the United States after being assured they would receive a better education. But once they arrived, they were forced to work in hair braiding shops across the Newark area -- just a short drive from New York City, right in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. The girls, who are now young women, have never spoken publicly before, until now. ""It was horrible,"" said Zena Amevor, who was 15 when she was brought over from Togo. ""Sometimes there was not enough food for us to eat. ... It was like a prison. I was just stuck there. ... It was horrible."" For the first time, the former slaves provided details about their horrifying odyssey and an intimate view into the world of human trafficking and contemporary slavery. ""Jacqueline"" was 13 when her family sent her to the United States, not knowing that a woman she called ""auntie"" was a human trafficker. It was unclear if the woman was a blood relative. ""My dad ... worked hard so I could go to school, so when my auntie came and told my family that I could go to a school in the U.S. ... they trusted her,"" she said. ""Everyone was happy about it."" The girls worked in the salons right out in the open, in front of customers. They were on their feet all day, sometimes for more than 12 hours, weaving intricate and elaborate hair braids, seven days a week. This went on for more than five years. ""We stood there all day, just braiding,"" Jacqueline said. ""If they want really small braids, you stay there sometimes until 2 a.m. ... That's every day."" At times, they were forced to braid the hair of American teenagers no older than they were -- girls who were free and had no idea the people braiding their hair were slaves. ""I wished I could go with them,"" Nicole said. ""Most of the time, I'd end up just breaking down later crying ... because when I see teenagers going around, going to the movies and just being a teen ... I just couldn't understand why my life has to be this way ... "" In one of the many ironies in the case, the customers whose hair was braided by the slave girls were mostly African-American women, many of whom could have been descendants of slaves brought to America generations ago. Slavery through trafficking continues widely today in the United States, though often undetected, according to law enforcement officials. Nicole, Zena, Jacqueline and the other girls were held in groups in several houses around Newark and East Orange, New Jersey. The girls were brought to the United States at different times between 2002 and 2007, according to court documents. As the group grew, the traffickers ran out of places to put them and had to rent more living quarters. The homes were always in the middle of residential areas with manicured lawns and nice houses, often near churches, schools and community buildings. ""I think it's hard for people to believe that in 2010, we have people who actually put people in slavery,"" said Paul Fishman, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, whose office successfully prosecuted the case. ""It's the most fundamental and intolerable violation of human rights."" The traffickers convicted in this case were a mother, father and son who also came from West Africa, according to court documents and law enforcement officials. Nicole, Zena and Jacqueline described living in fear shortly after they arrived in the United States, forced to work by day at the hair salons and sleeping in groups on the floor at night. ""When I got here ... I asked her if I was going to school, and she said there was no school,"" Jacqueline said, referring to her auntie, the trafficking ringleader. ""I said, 'I'm not going to school?' [and] she said, 'no' ... and that was her decision and she wasn't going to change it."" The captors controlled the girls by beating them, withholding food, keeping them separated from anyone else and, at times, through sexual abuse, according to court documents. The young women who spoke to CNN described years of cruelty, physical abuse, beatings with wood or metal objects, extreme isolation and sleeping on mattresses on floors in filthy conditions. Even their phone calls back to their families were monitored by their captors. ""I always thought of running [away], but I know nobody,"" Zena said. ""I don't know where to go, didn't have [any] friends, nobody to talk to, so it was kind of hard. ... I had nowhere to go to."" Five years after the girls began arriving, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents received a tip and began extensive surveillance on the houses where the girls were kept. After months of surveillance, the ICE agents raided the houses in 2007. Inside, they found the girls and mattresses on the floor. The traffickers had hidden bags of cash and the girls' passports. Peter Edge, who led the team of agents, said none of the girls' customers ever called officials to help. ""Hundreds of people came into these salons, they probably witnessed things out of the ordinary,"" said Edge, special agent in charge of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations in Newark. ""These girls were shielded from the outside world, virtually hidden in plain sight ... from everything else that was around them."" Edge and the girls said several customers asked about the girls' ages, and the girls -- following the orders of their captors -- lied and said they were 18. ""I wish one of my customers ... would have gone to police,"" Nicole said.  ""I wish they would have helped me."" In the 2007 raid, the ICE agents found a notebook the girls used to track the tips they received, but couldn't keep, at the hair salon. Ironically, on the cover of the notebook was a picture of the Statue of Liberty. More than two years later, Akouavi Afolabi; her husband, Lassissi Afolabi; and their son, Dereck Hounakey, were convicted of running the trafficking ring. Akouavi Afolabi was the ringleader, while her husband and son were accomplices, according to court documents. In September of this year, a Newark court sentenced Akouavi Afolabi to 27 years in prison, while her husband received 24 years and their son received 4½ years. The girls had to testify against the Afolabis in court. ""I remember crying. All I did was cry. It was overwhelming,"" Nicole said. ""I told myself, 'She finally got what she deserved' ... she did really, really wrong. She treated us bad. And she was heartless ... and I'm happy she was caught."" Court records show the Afolabis knew many of the families whose girls they lured away to become their slaves. They had an elaborate scheme to lure the girls: Mrs. Afolabi would approach families of young girls in Ghana and Togo, where she had connections, and tell the families she would give the girls an education in the United States. They then used fraudulent visa papers to sneak the girls into the country. Experts say the main reason for most modern-day human trafficking is money. ""Human trafficking is extremely profitable,"" said Bridgette Carr, a law professor and a national expert on human trafficking. The customers at the hair braiding salon where Zena and Nicole were forced to work would sometimes pay as much as $200 to $400 for elaborate braiding that would take many hours to complete. The traffickers took every penny made by the girls, both in tips and payments for their hair braiding. They made about $4 million, according to court documents. ""It's so profitable that we are seeing some drug traffickers get out of drug trafficking and into human trafficking,"" said Carr, who teaches law at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. Carr heads a clinic that is helping Nicole and many of the other girls move ahead with their lives. ""Sadly, the work of our clinic is necessary in every community in America,"" she said. ""Human trafficking, also known as modern-day slavery, exists in big cities, in small towns, in rural areas with no towns, exists in restaurants, in hair salons, in hotels and in farmwork. ""Almost every industry you can think of, there is an opportunity there for someone to be exploited. This is everywhere in the U.S."" Today, Nicole, Zena, Jacqueline and the other girls are trying to move on with their lives. Several are in high school, and one has recently been accepted into college. Most of the girls have not been able to return home to see their families in West Africa. When asked why she agreed to finally talk out about such a painful chapter of her life, Nicole said she wanted to raise awareness about what other young girls may be going through. ""I want to tell people that slavery exists,"" she said. ""It's huge, and it's really happening here."" Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET.

"(CNN) -- War and toys: two words rarely associated with one another. But veteran photographer Brian McCarty is bringing the two together in photography and a documentary film to explore what children in the war zone endure every day. With simple toys and drawings, the War-Toys project explores the daily struggles of Palestinian and Israeli children through their own eyes, with the help of local humanitarian organizations. McCarty, who has used toys in art projects in the past, takes the drawings from children's art therapy and recreates some of those scenes with toys and photographs them. CNN's Asieh Namdar talked to McCarty about how art therapy is helping kids open up about war, living with fear and day-to-day reality for them. CNN: How did this idea of ""War-Toys"" get started? McCarty: It started 14 years ago at an exhibit in Zagreb, after the Croatian war of independence. I chose to do a study of war toys as cultural artifacts, and as a tool for getting perspective on war. But it was in the abstract form; it wasn't tied into cultural or personal experiences. Over the years I started to see the potential of toys for healing and communication. So War-Toys in a nutshell allows children to articulate their experiences of war, occupation, terrorism through a collaborative process. It's all based on art therapy and play therapy. I essentially go and interview kids, working with established therapists. You ask them to draw a picture or write a letter, and somehow they express what they've seen, what they feel, what they've heard. And from those drawings, I then go and buy local toys, and recreate at the actual locations, what they've described. (CNN Photos: See images from the War-Toys project) CNN: What drew you to kids in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? McCarty: I chose the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the region has been in conflict since the dawn of humanity. It is a reflection of the flaws of human nature -- a place where there is a very definite two sides. It's a place ruled by passions and faith. So far I've only been to the West Bank and Israel. I've worked mostly with the Palestinians. Going forward, I want to work with the Israelis. It's really important to me that the project is completely neutral. I want to show all sides of the conflict, and show the cost of the conflict from the kids, who are just stuck in the middle of this whole mess. CNN: How does art and play therapy work? McCarty: Art therapy is a way to really have a child be in control and express his or her feelings and emotions from a very safe place. I've been working with some amazing art therapists. Art therapy bridges so many gaps. Children are smart. They know what's going on, they know what's happening -- they have emotions attached to it all. But their language abilities may not be there, so they can never sit there and tell you, ""This is what happened to me, this is what I feel about it."" So as a result, their accounts of war aren't seen or aren't valued. What they draw brings their experience to life, and I try to capture that. Same can be said for play therapy -- it's even harder to quantify. It's children in a room playing with toys, and a trained therapist watching how they play with toys, asking questions and getting them to explain what happened. It's really the only recognized way to deal with children in PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) situations, war and that sort of thing. We'll pick the drawings we can capture in a photograph. CNN: What is your role during therapy sessions? McCarty: In the therapeutic setting, my role is observer. I rely on humanitarian organizations with ongoing art therapy and play therapy programs. It's not wise for me to work with the kids directly. In that moment, it would be irresponsible for me to get involved in that way. My biggest fear is to be exploitative, or cause any more harm than these kids have already gone through. It's a real danger, and I'm kind of walking a fine line. CNN: What's been the kids' reaction so far? McCarty: Children in the therapeutic process in the art process are generally excited, because they're drawing -- it's fun. They rush to grab the pastels and the pieces of paper, and they carve out little spots on the floor, and it's adorable. But the drawing can also be disturbing. I watched a little girl coloring in pools of blood. It was hard, it took a lot out of me. After I'd done some of the photographs, I brought them back to the kids and showed them the drawings they had done next to the photographs that I did, and their reaction was wonderful. The kids loved them, they went crazy for them: ""This is exactly what we're feeling, this is wonderful."" The art, for as painful as it was for me to watch, (the kids) were expressing themselves, and able to do so freely. I absolutely saw a release when they were doing the art. One asked ... ""Why toys?"" He was offended -- he asked me why I was shooting toys, and not the reality on the ground? That gave me the chance to conceptually defend the project to a child. And it was a challenge. I was not expecting it. I was able to say this is my method of communication, this is how I get context and boil down what's happening --- a new way of thinking and seeing. It takes quite a long time for the therapeutic process to really have an effect. But to have someone interested in their perspective, to have someone listening to them and someone who wanted to see what they were drawing, that alone kind of validates humans and makes it better. CNN: What is the most memorable experience so far? McCarty: The most overwhelming experience was just shooting video at the barrier wall just inside of the West Bank at the Kalandia checkpoint. The day that I picked happened to be a day that there was a giant protest. I'll never forget a child who drew an account of a shooting by the wall: a little boy being shot in the head. When the boy drew it, you could tell he was really emotional, and he went so far as to cross out the drawing after making it, so I really wanted to do it right. So I went to the wall and set up some toy soldiers, set up a little boy, put down fake blood. Right about then, the protesters showed up en masse, marched on the checkpoint. It was chaos, screaming, running, tear gas. What's remarkable to me looking back, my own reaction. I didn't acknowledge them, just focused on my own shoot. The project isn't about my experiences of war, it's about the kids, it's about articulating what they felt and what they've seen; so my experiences are secondary. CNN: Where do you want to see yourself in a few years from now? McCarty: It's hard to say exactly where I'll end up. It depends on funding, of course, but I've thought about Somalia, thought about Afghanistan, I've thought about Iraq, I've thought about Mexico and the drug wars. Really wherever these things are happening and I think that children's perspectives are either underserved or unseen. That's the motivation for it. My goal for War Toys is to use locally bought toys, to really go to the markets and the places where the children who live there buy their toys, or in some cases, make their toys. But the idea has been to use the toys to reflect socioeconomic conditions. If it's a poor neighborhood you'll have cheaper toys. Those differences to me just add another layer of commentary to the project. CNN: And finally, you've had success with your photography using toys as subject matter. Why toys? McCarty: I am definitely still a kid at heart. My house looks like a rich fourth grader lives there. I'm still a kid. I think through toys. It's how I view the world, it's how I interact with the world, it's how I make sense of the world.","Photographer Brian McCarty has used toys in his art projects for years .

"(CNN) -- Most of us have a favorite toy from childhood that still has the power to make us smile, whether it's a Barbie doll, a Micro Machine or the board game Operation. What makes them memorable is the subject of a new book, ""Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos,"" a collection of some of the most beloved toys of the 20th century. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as ""a catalyst for the imagination,"" Byrne said. Most of our favorite toys came into our lives when we were developing our identity and figuring out the world, he said. Some, like the rampaging dinosaur King Zor (1962), have faded from the cultural landscape, while others, like View-Master and Nok Hockey (which both hit the mass market in the 1940s), have been passed down through generations. The toys that stick with us are those that allowed us to explore new worlds and create experiences. ""Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination,"" said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. ""What makes each Barbie doll unique is how a little girl creates and projects her sense of self and her fantasies onto that piece of plastic."" Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal. ""Some, just by looking at them, reflect the design sensibility of the time, becoming almost works of art,"" he said. ""We identify with them in the cultural context of their time."" So, how can you tell if a toy will be a hit for your child? When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you're shopping for, Byrne said. ""The hot toys are only hot if they're hot for your child,"" he said. ""The toys that become memorable are the ones that connect with our interests.""","New book ""Toy Time"" looks back at memorable toys of the 20th century .

"(CNN) -- Playing professional sport is many people's idea of the perfect job, but that doesn't mean sportsmen are immune to feeling the strain of working life. Just ask cricketer Jonathan Trott, who has pulled out of England's tour of Australia because of a stress-related illness. England lost the first Ashes test against Australia -- one of sport's great rivalries -- with batsman Trott scoring 19 runs in two innings when he struggled against Mitchell Johnson's fast bowling. ""I don't feel it's right that I'm playing knowing that I'm not 100% and I cannot currently operate at the level I have done in the past,"" said the 32-year-old Trott. ""My priority now is to take a break from cricket so that I can focus on my recovery. I want to wish my teammates all the very best for the remainder of the tour."" England were beaten heavily in the first test -- the tourists suffered a 381-run defeat in Brisbane -- and Australian batsman David Warner labeled their batting ""poor and weak."" Warner also claimed England's batsmen had ""scared eyes."" Ashes series are traditionally characterized by gamesmanship and competitive verbal jousting -- known as ""sledging"" -- between the two sets of players. ""On the pitch it's pretty much a war, isn't it?"" said England captain Alastair Cook after his side's comprehensive defeat. ""There are always going to be a few battles and a few words, but on the pitch is fine. ""There were a lot of things said that we think have been disrespectful, but you have to give the Aussies credit for how they played."" At one point in the match when James Anderson faced Johnson television stump microphones picked up Australian captain Michael Clarke telling the England bowler to ""get ready for a broken f****** arm."" But Clarke defended the hostile verbal atmosphere that often goes on in a game. ""I'm not going to go into what's been said on the field - I think that's part and parcel of the game,"" said the Australian captain. ""I've heard a lot worse said on the cricket field than anything the Australian players or the England players have said throughout this test match. ""Both teams want to win so badly. We all respect the traditions of the game - there is a line, and both teams should not overstep that line. ""I'm sure there's plenty of things that are said on the field that you won't overhear on the stump microphone. There is certainly no single England player that we have any vendetta against."" Trott is not the first England cricketer to pull out of a tour with a stress-related illness. Batsman Marcus Trescothick left the 2005-06 India tour and the 2006-07 Ashes tour of Australia, while bowler Michael Yardy came home from the 2011 World Cup. ""Jonathan Trott is an incredibly talented cricketer who has proven himself time and again for England,"" said managing director England cricket Hugh Morris. ""The cricket side of things is unimportant now, all that matters is that Jonathan is given the time, support and space he needs to recover. ""We fully support his decision to leave the tour and the ECB will provide all the assistance we can to help Jonathan and his family through this period. ""Jonathan has asked for privacy while he recovers and I would urge everyone to respect that."" Many past and present sports stars were quick to rally round Trott. ""Feeling for Jonathan Trott,"" tweeted former Australian bowler Shane Warne. ""I hope he and his family are left alone by all media & he's able to recover quickly & return to the Eng team!"" Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville tweeted: ""Hope Trott is OK and back soon.

"(CNN) -- Governments, world leaders and others were responding Friday to a Florida pastor's plan to burn copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, even amid confusion over whether it would go ahead. The Rev. Terry Jones, the head of a small church in Gainesville, called off the burning Thursday but later said he would ""rethink"" his position after a meeting with a local imam. Here's a sampling of global reaction: . Hamas leader Ismail Haniya called Jones a ""religious criminal"" and a ""retard that expresses a Western-retarded mentality"" that targets the Quran, Islam and Muslims. Speaking in Gaza at the start of the Eid holiday, Haniya said, ""I call upon God the merciful, if they want to rip the Quran, for God to rip them apart and their state and make them an example for the believers."" Sporadic protests against the burning happened Friday in Afghanistan. The largest was in the northern province of Badakhshan, where about 500 Afghans protested outside of a NATO base in the area, the International Security Assistance Force said. The ISAF said two people were hurt in the protests, and the deputy governor of the province said thousands turned out, one protester was killed and three were wounded. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the burning of the Quran is wrong and undermines religious tolerance and peace. ""The prime minister urges that such irresponsible actions not be taken,"" read a statement from his office. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the plan to burn the Qurans but said it would not damage the Muslim holy book because it ""is in the hearts and minds of every Muslim."" Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said, ""I continue to urge the government and the people of the United States to ensure the prevention of such an incomprehensible, irrational and immoral act. ... The value of the American nation, which emphasizes tolerance, freedom of religion and common sense, is being tested. Hence, once again, the government and the Americans must continue to take serious action to prevent and stop such uncivilized acts."" The Somali government said in a news release that it ""strongly condemns"" any such action. ""There is no doubt this action could generate more extremists and could spark new violence as the move would assist al-Qaeda and its affiliates. To stop this plan will be a wise, measurable and reasonable decision and we would urge the American pastor to completely withdraw his plans."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said, ""While I will defend any American's First Amendment rights, our generals in the field tell us that the men and women defending those rights would be endangered as a result of this stunt. If this group insists on going forward, I would hope that members of the media will not reward them with what they crave most: news coverage."" Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who said he has been in touch with the church, said, ""I think common decency would dictate that this would not occur and that we would be respectful and are a respectful people of all religions."" He said there was little he could do to stop the burning because of the First Amendment. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday he was ""deeply disturbed"" by reports about the plan. ""Such actions cannot be condoned by any religion,"" he said. ""They contradict the efforts of the United Nations, and many people around the world, to promote tolerance, intercultural understanding and mutual respect between cultures and religions. ... I sincerely hope that they will not take such unacceptable actions."" A spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan told CNN, ""If in Florida they were to burn the Quran, we will target any Christians, even if they are innocent, because the Quran is our holy book and we do not want someone to burn our holy book."" A senior Iranian Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpayegani, condemned the plan to burn the Quran and called for the arrest of Jones, head of the Dove World Outreach Center, according to Iran's semi-official Fars news agency. Should such an ""inhumane incident take place in America, the U.S. government and President Obama will be held responsible,"" he said, according to the report. Interpol, the international police organization, warned of ""tragic consequences"" that ""may well claim the lives of many innocent people"" if the burning goes ahead. Secretary General Ronald Noble said September 11 should be a day to fight terrorism, not a day to ""engage in provocative acts that will give terrorists propaganda"" to recruit others to their cause. Sajjad Karim, a Muslim and member of the European Parliament for Britain, told the chamber Thursday that the Quran burning ""is the act of one man and his followers alone. His actions should not be identified with the West or Christianity. Muslims globally must know that, through this Quran burning, this man will achieve nothing. He has been isolated in his country and his religion. It is only through a reaction that any perverse sense of achievement can be earned."" U.S. Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, urged Jones against the burning in a posting on his Twitter page Thursday. ""Pastor Jones' threats to burn the Quran will put American service men/women in danger - for their sake please don't do it!"" Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Paris Grand Mosque and France's most important spokesman for the Muslim community, urged Muslims to respond ""wisely"" to the burning and ""not to fall into the trap of provocation."" He told French radio station RMC on Wednesday that Muslims should also not be stigmatized or targeted for the ""terrorists, despicable people"" who carried out the September 11 attacks. The U.S. Embassy in London said Washington is ""deeply concerned about all deliberate attempts to offend members of any religious or ethnic group"" and condemned such acts as ""unrepresentative of American values."" While the embassy said it believes firmly in freedom of religion and freedom of expression, ""we reaffirm our position that the deliberate destruction of any holy book is an abhorrent act."" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said everything possible should be done to ban the Quran burning. ""If it does take place, it will inflict the most severe damage to inter-faith relations and human and cultural dialogue and will be used as a pretext by extremists for more killings and retaliatory killing,"" he said. Bernard Valero, the spokesman for France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Thursday that France condemns ""in the strongest terms the vicious and irresponsible statements of Pastor Terry Jones. This incitement to hatred is unacceptable and can only reinforce all forms of extremism. It is also an insult to the memory of the victims of September 11 and also to all the other victims of terrorist acts motivated by intolerance and the abuse of religion."" Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed grave concern over the threats to burn copies of the Quran. According to spokesman Farhatullah Babar, Zardari said anyone who even thought of such a despicable act must be suffering from a diseased mind and a sickly soul. He said it will inflame sentiments among Muslims throughout the world and cause irreparable damage to interfaith harmony and world peace. Zardari called for doing all it takes to stop such a ""senseless and outrageous act."" A hard-line Indonesian Muslim group, the Islamic Defenders Front, told CNN it will protest the planned burning and will issue a death sentence on Rev. Terry Jones if he carries out his plan. ""This is not a problem between Muslims and Christians but rather between Terry Jones and mankind,"" said Sabri Lubis, a secretary general with the group. The Vatican implored the church Wednesday not to burn the Quran, saying it would be an ""outrageous and grave gesture."" The top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David Petraeus, warned earlier this week that the plan ""could cause significant problems"" for American troops overseas. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy group, plans to hold a news conference in Washington on Thursday to address the issue. The group's ""Learn, Don't Burn"" initiative includes the distribution of 200,000 Qurans and other activities planned for Friday and Saturday, the planned date of the burning. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has defended the right of the Rev. Terry Jones to go ahead with the plan, even though he condemns the idea as ""distasteful."" ""The First Amendment protects everybody, and you can't say that we are going to apply the First Amendment to only those cases where we are in agreement,"" Bloomberg said this week, citing the section of the Constitution that promises freedom of speech. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting U.S. troops from religious intolerance, has promised to buy one new Quran and donate it to the Afghan National Army for each one burned in Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Quran burning would be a ""disrespectful, disgraceful act."" Former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin urged Jones on Wednesday to halt his plans, saying the burning ""will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don't feed that fire."" The U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Tuesday issued a statement saying the U.S. government ""in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of Islam, and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups."" It said it condemned the ""offensive initiative"" by the Florida church. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman denounced the Quran burning as ""contrary to the teachings of tolerant divine religions and totally incompatible with the logic of dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures."" He noted that a United Nations conference on religious tolerance two years ago called on people ""to renounce hatred and intolerance and terrorism,"" and ""to reflect on the Christian teachings and concepts of humanity that emphasizes the love and respect for the other."" Muhammad Ismail, a spokesman for the hard-line Indonesian Muslim group Hizb ut-Tahrir, said earlier this week, ""The burning is not only an insult to the holy Quran, but an insult to Islam and Muslims around the world."" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said people in Turkey ""wouldn't consider burning of the Torah or the Bible positively, as we would not consider the burning of (the) Quran positively."" He said he considers anti-Semitism ""a crime against humanity"" just as he considers ""Islamophobia as a crime against humanity.""

"(CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor was thrust into the national spotlight on two hot-button issues this week. It had nothing to do with the cases involved -- same-sex marriage in Utah and a requirement for contraceptive coverage under Obamacare. The two emergency appeals on New Year's Eve came her way because the cases originated in western areas of the country -- Colorado and Utah -- that fall under her jurisdiction for reviewing time-sensitive federal motions. Sotomayor sought more information on an appeal from Utah to uphold its voter-approved ban on same-sex unions in the state. But she made headlines on the politically charged case around the Affordable Care Act just as new rules were about to take effect. Sotomayor issued an order that, for the moment, stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost. The Denver-based organization that cares for elderly poor, the Little Sisters of the Poor, objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but, in theory, still require a third party to provide contraception insurance. Ultimately, it believes authorizing a form that passes the ball to another entity still means contraception coverage for its employees and that, to the nuns, is objectionable on moral grounds. The Catholic Church opposes artificial contraception. While Sotomayor's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law, it isn't. Nor does it convey any meaning about where Sotomayor, a liberal jurist, may stand on the larger issues raised in the appeal overall. ""She just placed a single case on hold. She did not overturn Obamacare,"" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. Her decision late on Tuesday simply put the brakes on compliance for the Little Sisters of the Poor and enabled the Obama administration to file its arguments. The Justice Department said on Friday the appeal lacked merit. The charity, it said, is eligible for an exemption and moreover, the entity that administers its insurance plans, the non-profit Christian Brothers Services, is also exempt under certain conditions in the Obamacare rules applying to religious institutions. Toobin said Sotomayor acted ""based on her view of the law"" in holding up the rule in this case. Sotomayor voted to uphold The Affordable Care Act in 2012 in a blockbuster Supreme Court ruling that gave Obama an enormous political victory. Obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of Americans without it and is the President's signature domestic achievement. It is relentlessly under attack from conservatives who have made numerous attempts to repeal or otherwise sink it, and is the focus of numerous legal challenges.","Sotomayor upheld Obamacare last year, now she's in the spotlight again in another appeal .

"(CNN) -- While the Olympic Games in London steals the world's attention, over 5,000 miles away another global event born from the same ideal of cultural exchange and peaceful rivalry is entering the home stretch. Rather than competition, Expo 2012 in the city of Yeosu, South Korea, is the latest incarnation of an event that officially is meant to foster international understanding; unofficially it is used for national promotion, boosting trade and providing networking opportunities. Of the approximately 4 million visitors that will have wandered through the transformed cement port and industrial site before it closes on August 12, most will have been there to enjoy the pavilions hosting interactive displays on ocean conservation and marine exploration -- the theme of this year's event. But a small but notable minority will not have been there to watch the shows. For them it provides a number of chances to broker deals and reach new contacts where 104 countries can be reached in a day. ""It's government relations really,"" said Stine L. Guldmann, director of the Denmark pavilion. ""South Korea is quite important to Denmark. It's an opportunity to brand your country both in a tourism way but also attract skillful people or showcase our abilities."" Denmark's pavilion is funded by a mix of public and private money, including some Danish companies at the forefront of the renewable energy industry. Lego bricks are on hand to attract the visitors and keep them entertained, but a backroom for more grown-up meetings is regularly used. ""There has to be a reason for them both (government and private companies) to be here and spend money on it,"" said Guldmann. ""It's a success if our private partners are happy with their participation and our political relations are very strong."" The basic principle of Expos is non-commercial and educational, according to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), the organizing body that was founded in 1928. Yet that has not prevented a strong presence from the commercial sector, with a large part of the Yeosu site devoted to temporary pavilions from South Korea's biggest corporations, some of which were built at a cost of more than $1million. ""Expos don't provide concrete benefits for companies,"" says Lee Joon-hee, Commissioner for Expo 2012. ""But is it still relevant... the evidence of why they are still relevant is that a lot of companies and countries want to host Expos."" Participant countries have different reasons to be in Yeosu. Qatar and the U.S, with strong trade and diplomatic ties to South Korea, respectively, have been two of the more popular pavilions. Earlier this year a 20-year deal for Qatar to supply South Korea with natural gas was signed between the two countries, but pavilion manager Mona Sulaiti was keen to stress that the reason for their participation at event ""is about people, not business relationships."" Andrew Snowhite, CEO of the U.S. Pavilion, believes the event is unique in its scope and potential. ""It's the only place where you can create something that has a critical mass around it; it's a very large event. It's a big tourism opportunity for some, for others it's about trade,"" he said. For developing countries like Angola, participation is a way to draw attention to a little known country, either as a holiday destination or potential trading partner. ""We don't see it as being old fashioned,"" said Claudia Santana of Angola's pavilion. ""We are building our country since 2002... if you search for an official tourism website in Angola you can't find it, so we have to find other ways to show our country. There's a lot of work ahead for our country and this is part of it."" For all the fostering of relationships and networking over glasses of sweet tea or Lego, ultimately the biggest tangible benefit of the event goes to Yeosu itself. The city is little known by people within South Korea let alone internationally, but around $2billion spent on operations and facilities from the government, BIE and private investors has completely transformed it. ""This area is relatively backwards and needs a boost,"" said Lee Joon-hee, saying it is part of a larger project to develop South Korea's southern ""Sun Belt"". ""It will put Yeosu on the map. We have big ambitions to be a famous marine resort area."" Yeosu's infrastructure has been upgraded, with new, marble-smooth roads cutting through the lush hillsides and along the coast, while the train to the capital Seoul now takes half the time it used to. While it is still undecided what will happen to most of the Expo site when it closes -- conference centers and shopping malls have been mooted -- and tourism to the region develops, there will be an immediate beneficiary of the improved infrastructure: the petrochemical industry. Just a few miles from the Expo is one of South Korea's biggest industrial complexes that dwarfs the Expo site and is the area's largest industry. ""For the moment we just want domestic development,"" says Lee, ""Secondary is marine resort development.""","Expo 2012 in South Korea an unofficial business and development opportunity .

"(CNN) -- Author Arthur C. Clarke, whose science fiction and non-fiction works ranged from the script for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to an early proposal for communications satellites, has died at age 90, associates have said. Visionary author Arthur C. Clarke had fans around the world. Clarke had been wheelchair-bound for several years with complications stemming from a youthful bout with polio and had suffered from back trouble recently, said Scott Chase, the secretary of the nonprofit Arthur C. Clarke Foundation. He died early Wednesday -- Tuesday afternoon ET -- at a hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka, where he had lived since the 1950s, Chase said. ""He had been taken to hospital in what we had hoped was one of the slings and arrows of being 90, but in this case it was his final visit,"" he said. In a videotaped 90th birthday message to fans, Clarke said he still hoped to see some sign of intelligent life beyond Earth, more work on alternatives to fossil fuels -- and ""closer to home,"" an end to the 25-year civil war in Sri Lanka between the government and ethnic Tamil separatists. ""I dearly wish to see lasting peace established in Sri Lanka as soon as possible,"" he said. ""But I'm aware that peace cannot just be wished -- it requires a great deal of hard work, courage and persistence."" Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick shared an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay for ""2001."" The film grew out of Clarke's 1951 short story, ""The Sentinel,"" about an alien transmitter left on the moon that ceases broadcasting when humans arrive. As a Royal Air Force officer during World War II, Clarke took part in the early development of radar. In a paper written for the radio journal ""Wireless World"" in 1945, he suggested that artificial satellites hovering in a fixed spot above Earth could be used to relay telecommunications signals across the globe. He is widely credited with introducing the idea of the communications satellite, the first of which were launched in the early 1960s. But he never patented the idea, prompting a 1965 essay that he subtitled, ""How I Lost a Billion Dollars in My Spare Time."" His best-known works, such as ""2001"" or the 1953 novel ""Childhood's End,"" combined the hard science he learned studying physics and mathematics with insights into how future discoveries would change humanity. David Eicher, editor of Astronomy magazine, told CNN that Clarke's writings were influential in shaping public interest in space exploration during the 1950s and '60s.  Watch how Clarke stands among sci-fi giants » . ""He was very interested in technology and also in humanity's history and what lay out in the cosmos,"" Eicher said. His works combined those ""big-picture"" themes with ""compelling stories that were more interesting and more complex than other science fiction writers were doing,"" he said. Tedson Meyers, the chairman of the Clarke Foundation, said the organization is now dedicated to reproducing the combination of imagination and knowledge that he credited the author with inspiring. ""The question for us is, how does human imagination bring about such talent on both sides of the brain?"" he asked. ""How do you find the next Arthur Clarke?"" Clarke was knighted in 1998. He wrote dozens of novels and collections of short stories and more than 30 nonfiction works during his career, and served as a television commentator during several of the Apollo moon missions. Though humans have not returned to the moon since 1972, Clarke said he was confident that a ""Golden Age"" of space travel was just beginning.  Watch Clarke talk about sci-fi vs. reality » . ""After half a century of government-sponsored efforts, we are now witnessing the emergence of commercial space flight,"" he said in his December birthday message. ""Over the next 50 years, thousands of people will travel to Earth orbit -- and then, to the moon and beyond. Space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet."" E-mail to a friend .","Arthur C.

"(CNN) -- Chris Christie got to the point immediately. The embattled New Jersey governor, who's seriously considering a 2016 run for the White House, began his State of the State address on Tuesday by pledging to cooperate with multiple investigations into controversies that are threatening to complicate his political future. Opinion: We need the full truth from Chris Christie . He didn't specifically mention suggestions that top aides orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country's busiest bridge last year in an alleged case of political payback, but noted that ""mistakes were clearly made."" His usual swagger gone, Christie continued: ""And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve. I know our citizens deserve better. Much better. I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad."" Christie: 'Mistakes were clearly made' A Republican in a state dominated by Democrats, Christie then moved on. He used the rest of the 45-minute address before state legislators in Trenton to push his legislative agenda and tout his accomplishments. He threaded through his entire speech pitches for his bipartisan efforts, making a plea for those efforts to continue. So, how'd he do? Addressing the controversy early was the right move, experts and analysts said. NJ Democrat lawmaker on traffic scandal: 'I do think laws have been broken' CNN Chief National Correspondent John King: ""He did exactly what he needed to do by getting to it first. His trademark is being blunt and direct. His brand, his trademark, is damaged right now. He's trying to get the tarnish off it. This was a first page in the next chapter of Chris Christie. We don't know where that chapter is going."" CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger: ""He got it out of the way early, he said what he needed to say."" But Borger also said she believes ""a line of argument against Chris Christie has been established with the public. That he is petty, that his administration was vengeful. If he wants to reverse that narrative, he does have to get something done in a bipartisan way and he has to get this story over with and it doesn't look like it's going to end any time soon."" Borger also observed Christie's turn-of-phrase. ""He said that 'mistakes were made,' not that he made the mistakes."" Borger added that Democrats in New Jersey ""now believe they have an opening (against Christie) and they're going right through it."" CNN Political Analyst John Avlon: ""He needed to address the elephant in the room right off the top, and he did. He was contrite -- mistakes were made. Pay careful attention to the word 'appropriate' -- he'll cooperate with all 'appropriate' inquiries. I don't think he's going to try to turn over private e-mails."" CNN Political Analyst Ana Navarro: ""I think it was very smart of him to address it right off the bat. He knew all of us were watching those first few minutes. Then he could go on to talk about filling potholes in New Jersey. But he captured our attention with those first few sentences."" But also in those first few sentences was a phrase that surprised CNN Political Commentator Ryan Lizza: ""Mistakes were made."" ""Every politician, every pundit knows that that is a phrase, at the very least, from the Iran-Contra scandal, and it's basically been mocked as this passive voice and way of pretending to take responsibility for something when you're not,"" Lizza said.

"(CNN) -- The biggest near-term unintended consequence of the Obama Democrats' decision to destroy the Senate filibuster will be the repeal of Obamacare. Under the old Senate rules, a minority could use the filibuster to block undesired change. It required 60 votes to run over a determined minority. Even if the Republicans have a good outcome in 2014 and 2016, there is a pretty good chance they will not win the 15 seats (one third of their current total membership) that would have been required to make major changes under the old Senate rules. Winning even 14 seats in the next two elections would have left them one short of a filibuster proof majority (and that assumes all the Republicans would agree on repeal). Now, with one clever move, the Obama Democrats have lowered the bar from 60 votes to 51. The odds of gaining six seats from the current 45 are dramatically better than trying to pick up 15 seats. For my entire career in the House, including when I was speaker, we were told again and again of the things we couldn't pass because they wouldn't get through a Senate filibuster. Now that inhibition is gone. The Democrats will try to say they have only eliminated the filibuster for certain cases involving presidential appointees, not legislation. But what they have really eliminated is a longstanding principle of the Senate. With a simple majority, Republicans could soon push through dramatic changes like the replacement of Obamacare because a liberal minority would have no tools to stop it. In 2016, every Republican candidate for House, Senate, and president will be asked if he or she is committed to replacing Obamacare in the first 100 days. Virtually all of them will pledge to do so. The opportunity for a breakout from the entire obsolete bureaucratic structure is now enormous. This makes the 2014 and 2016 elections among the highest stakes of any in recent memory. When Obamacare disappears with a simple majority vote in the Senate, thank President Obama and Senator Reid for the new Senate rules which made it possible. It all started this week. It will end around March 1, 2017. The die has been cast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: Unintended effect of Senate filibuster change will be Obamacare repeal .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A company that makes toys to encourage girls to become engineers has backed down from using a Beastie Boys song in its ad. GoldieBlox had used a parody version of the decidedly misogynistic Beastie Boys song ""Girls"" in a video featuring a trio of inventive girls who trade their tiaras for a toolbox. The company's lawyers filed a lawsuit last week asserting their ""fair use"" of the tune, but Wednesday its founders posted a letter addressed to Beastie Boys Mike Diamond and Adam Horovitz. ""We don't want to fight with you,"" founder Debbie Sterling wrote. ""We love you and we are actually huge fans."" The song has been removed from the video, which went viral this month and gained millions of online viewers, she said. ""When we made our parody version of your song, 'Girls', we did it with the best of intentions,"" Sterling said. ""We wanted to transform it into a powerful anthem for girls."" The company did not realize that Beastie Boys member Adam Yauch, who died last year, had in his will that he wanted his songs to never be used in advertising, she said. ""Although we believe our parody video falls under fair use, we would like to respect his wishes and yours,"" she wrote. The Beastie Boys song 1987 ""Girls"" has lyrics including, ""Girls, to do the dishes,"" and, ""Her pants were tight, and that's OK."" Â . In the GoldieBlox version, the lyrics are synchronized with a ""Rube Goldberg"" contraption -- a device over-engineered to carry out a simple task -- and altered to convey a more feminist message: ""You like to buy us pink toys, and everything else is for boys and you can always get us dolls and we'll grow up like them ... false."" ""Over the past week, parents have sent us pictures and videos of their kids singing with pride, building their own Rube Goldberg machines in their living rooms and declaring an interest in engineering,"" Sterling wrote Wednesday. ""It's been incredible to watch."" Sterling, a Stanford-educated engineer, has said her ultimate goal is to bridge the gap of gender disparity in engineering; according to the Association for Women in Science, women account for 24% of the science, technology, engineering and math work force. She wants to ""disrupt the pink aisle"" and ""get girls building"" with her ""toys for future inventors."" The video is one of four finalists in Intuit's ""Small Business, Big Game"" contest.

"New York (CNN) -- An estimated 1 million people marked the passing of one year and the beginning of another in New York's Times Square with the descent of an iconic ball. With the help of Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sgt. Salvatore A. Giunta, the dazzling crystal ball began its 70-foot drop at 11:59 p.m. Friday to the harmonious chants of New Year's Eve revelers counting down the final seconds of 2010. More than one ton of confetti was released at midnight, with personal individual wishes written in more than 25 languages, a tradition from the past three years. Weighing in at 11,875 pounds with a diameter of 12 feet, the sparkling sphere is covered with 2,668 triangular crystals and is powered by 32,256 LED lights. By mixing red, blue, green and white light elements, the ball's lighting system is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million hues and colors, and billions of patterns, the event's website says. Each giant New Year's numeral making up ""2-0-1-1"" will stand seven feet high and the numerals will use a total 453 9-watt LED bulbs. As in the past three years, the numerals were designed to be more energy efficient, as Duracell Batteries set up a lab in which visitors rode stationary bikes to provide the stored battery power that will light the numbers on the ball Friday night. Times Square has served as one of the most popular sites of New Year's festivities since 1904, though the New Year's Eve ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at One Times Square in 1907. That first ball, built with iron and wood, featured one hundred light bulbs and was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metalworker. The New Year's Eve ball has beamed and dropped every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943, when the United States was embroiled in World War II and New York City observed a city-wide ""dim-out"" to cut energy costs. According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, this New Year's Eve celebration, like years in the past, is a product of a lot of hard work and planning by many people. ""We don't ever take it for granted,"" Kelly said. ""The situation changes somewhat, we have sort of a core plan but we always add to it or change it -- we don't want to get stuck in a rut where we simply take a plan off the shelf."" As in previous years, security will be tight. Times Square will be closed to traffic at approximately 3 p.m. on Friday. Backpacks and alcohol are prohibited at the event and party-goers can expect a beefed-up police presence, according to the statement from the New York Police Department. ""It is a big complex operation and you know you always breathe a sigh of relief when it's over,"" Kelly said.","NEW: Mayor, medal of honor winner start the ball drop .

"(CNN) -- Kyron Horman has been missing since June 4, 2010, but his mother is not giving up. Desiree Young and volunteers spent ""two solid days of searching"" for her son this weekend, she said in a news conference Sunday in Portland, Oregon, calling the search ""successful."" More than 100 volunteers, along with 10 search dog teams from around the country, joined the search effort in the Portland area, looking for evidence that might help solve Kyron's disappearance. Kyron was 7 years old when he went missing. He was last seen by his stepmother, Terri Horman, who told police she had dropped him off at his school, Skyline Elementary. Young was optimistic about the latest search, telling reporters, ""we found a lot of things, and possibly evidence,"" but declined to give details, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. Everything searchers found will go to law enforcement for further examination, she said. Though Portland law enforcement was not part of this search, Young said she has been working closely with police and has been keeping them informed. In 2011: Mystery, pain linger after Kyron goes missing . The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office told CNN affiliate KGW that their investigation is ongoing, and they hope the volunteers find something that helps bring Kyron home. Since Kyron's disappearance, most of the speculation has focused on the boy's stepmother. In August 2010, investigators solicited the public's help for information about the location of the white pickup truck that she is believed to have driven the morning of Kyron's disappearance. And in divorce filings, the boy's father, Kaine Horman, said he believes his estranged wife, Terri Horman, ""is involved"" in the boy's disappearance. No charges have been filed against anyone in the case, nor has anyone officially been named a suspect. Young told the media gathered Sunday that she will not give up searching for her son.

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier arrested in connection with the killing of a Mexican drug cartel member in El Paso, Texas, allegedly worked as a hit man, court records say. Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, is a soldier based at Fort Bliss. Pfc. Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, was one of three men arrested Monday in connection with the shooting death of the mid-level drug cartel member who also worked as an informant for the United States, according to a complaint affidavit. Apodaca joined the Army a year ago and worked as a crew member on a Patriot missile launcher, officials at Fort Bliss in El Paso told CNN. ""He was in the top of his class,"" said Dave Jackson, his grandfather. ""You talk to all his sergeants. He's  a good soldier. Now, before he went in (and joined the Army), he was in, he was in with a bad crowd."" Police identified the other suspects as Ruben Rodriguez Dorado, 30, and Christopher Andrew Duran, 17. The three men each face one count of capital murder, El Paso police said. The victim, Jose Daniel Gonzalez Galeana, was shot multiple times in front of his home on May 15. The three men are being held on $1 million bond. Duran and Rodriguez told police that Apodaca was paid to be the shooter, the affidavit states. Cell phone records, witness statements and El Paso Police detectives corroborated this, according to the document. Orders to kill Gonzalez came from the same cartel he worked for, the affidavit said. Gonzalez had become a target because the cartel believed he was leaking information to authorities, the document said. The victim and one of the suspects, Rodriguez, were in the Juarez cartel, based across the border from El Paso, police spokesman Chris Mears told CNN. Police believe that Apodaca and Duran were not cartel members, he said. The three arrested men's phone records showed their approximate locations on the night of the killing, according to court documents. The pattern showed that the suspects were tracking Gonzalez and followed him to the scene of the crime, the affidavit states. During an interrogation, Rodriguez told investigators that he ordered Gonzalez's execution and that he paid the participants for their role in the killing, the affidavit states. Apodaca joined the Army in September 2008, according to a statement from Fort Bliss in El Paso. He is a member of the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade at Fort Bliss, the statement said. El Paso County District Court records show that Apodaca was arrested 10 days after Gonzalez's killing and charged with attempted theft of property, a second-degree felony. He posted a $10,000 bond a few days later. CNN's Melanie Whitley and Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.","NEW: 18-year-old was ""a good soldier,"" grandfather says .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Dmitry Medvedev made a strong pitch for foreign investment in Russia Wednesday as he gave his first special address as Russia's prime minister at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He painted a picture of a strong economy that is open to those who are ""ready to be partners"" and invest in Russia. Follow the action live on CNN.com . This year Davos, a picturesque Swiss ski resort, is hosting nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives. The world's top policymakers gather annually to discuss global issues, and are this time meeting under the banner of ""resilient dynamism."" Medvedev sought to position himself as a reformer in a country that is moving determinedly forward. ""Russia is an open country, whatever they might think or say,"" he said, referring to critics of its record on corruption and governance issues. Russia's unemployment rate, at a little over 5%, is the lowest among developed countries, he said, and it also has an extremely low level of foreign debt. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos . ""We need to see investment growing by 10% annually,"" he said. ""Therefore we are interested in attracting large-scale foreign investment."" That amount of investment expansion is needed to push Russia's economy beyond 4% growth, he said. But Medvedev acknowledged that Russia needs to do a much better job of attracting foreign direct investment. Russia ranks very low in global corruption indices, which has held back investment despite a sizable population of 142 million. Medvedev said his government's priority is to improve public governance. But, he said, this is not a problem unique to Russia. Is the rise of China creating conflict? ""It's nothing new --- humanity has been facing these problems for centuries, if not millennia,"" he said. ""The more law and order, the more thieves and robbers. In that sense, little has changed."" Medvedev stressed that Russia is an open market now and pointed to membership in the World Trade Organization as a indication of that. The country's next priority is to gain membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, composed of the world's industrialized nations, he said. Interactive: Europe's tale of boom and bust . The prime minister suggested this sends a strong message to the world, even though both structures ""are not perfect,"" in his view. He also spoke of the need to create an equal playing field for all businesses and to create a ""single economic space"" with Russia's neighbors, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But the prime minister dismissed suggestions that this is an effort to somehow recreate the Soviet Union, saying Russia wants to play in the global market. Interactive: How's your economic mood? ""There is no going back to the past,"" he said. Executives have not been convinced in the past that Medvedev and Russian President Vladimir Putin are on the same page. But the prime minister stressed that Russia has a global outlook and will continue dialogue with its European friends and partners. ""We are building our cooperation,"" he said, acknowledging that unilateral action could have ""dire implications."" Medvedev said the G-20, which brings together the world's major economies, is becoming increasingly efficient and that this has helped limit the extent of the global economic crisis. ""We need to use modern technologies, crowd sourcing,"" he said. ""Those technologies change the status and enhance the legitimacy of decisions made in government."" Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? The speech echoed one Medvedev gave at Davos as his country's president in 2011, when he also pushed foreign investment in Russia while acknowledging that reforms were needed. Russia last month assumed the rotating presidency of the G-20. ""The Russian presidency's main task will be to focus the G-20's efforts on developing measures to stimulate economic growth and create jobs,"" Putin said at the time. Few are likely to dispute Medvedev's comments on the need for Russia to prioritize governance issues. Russia ranked 133 out of 174 in Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. Ahead of the World Economic Forum, the non-governmental group's chairwoman, Huguette Labelle, called on countries and businesses to change the way they work, for everybody's sake. ""Future prosperity will always be undermined by corruption, excessive risk-taking, a lack of transparency and other unethical practices,"" she warned. Pavel Khodorkovsky, the son of jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and president of the U.S.-based Institute of Modern Russia, also wrote an open letter to those at the World Economic Forum in which he highlighted the plight of his father. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who backed an opposition party, has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Russia has faced wide criticism over his treatment, with the United States and others accusing it of ""selective prosecution"" and abuse of the legal system. His son, in his letter to policymakers at Davos, called on them to raise the issue of the former Yukos chief executive's continued imprisonment and urge support for the rule of law in Russia. ""Ending corruption is not just a human rights issue,"" Pavel Khodorkovsky said. ""The proliferation of corruption remains a huge impediment to direct foreign investment. ""Both U.S. and Russian officials have publicly acknowledged Russia's weak property rights and rampant corruption are reasons to avoid doing business in Russia. This is thwarting job creation and starving Russian businesses of the capital they need to grow."" Medvedev's comments come amid frosty relations with the United States after Putin signed a law in December prohibiting Americans from adopting Russian children. The move by Russian politicians was widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on those it considers human rights abusers in Russia.","NEW: Son of jailed Russian tycoon Khodorkovsky urges a focus on tackling corruption .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- In an elaborately choreographed ceremony broadcast live on television, the leaders of Iraqi Kurdistan began pumping oil from Kurdish-controlled oil fields in northern Iraq through a pipeline to neighboring Turkey. A worker at the oil refinery near the village of Taq Taq in the province of Irbil. It is the first time Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region has officially exported oil out of the country. For years, the central Iraqi government in Baghdad has been at odds with the Kurds, arguing they do not have the right to exploit oil in territory under Kurdish control. Kurdish officials have ignored Baghdad's warnings, and signed dozens of agreements with small foreign oil companies. The two sides finally reached an agreement on the issue last month. ""I believe that the cooperation between northern Iraq and Baghdad administrations is useful and beneficial for all. Therefore this strategic cooperation will continue,"" said Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government. He was speaking in Kurdish before a hall filled with dignitaries, at a glitzy ceremony complete with swirling spotlights and a bleached-blond Turkish female master of ceremonies. Audience members watched a live video feed showing workers opening up the pipeline. The oil is being exported from the Taq Taq field in the province of Irbil. Kurdish officials and representatives from Genel Enerji, a Turkish company working in Taq Taq, said initially only 40,000 barrels of oil would be exported a day. That is a fraction of the 1.8 million barrels a day currently being exported by Iraq. But at the ceremony, the oil minister in Iraqi Kurdistan, Ashti Hawrami, announced Kurdish exports could increase to as many as 450,000 barrels a day. ""As much as Baghdad might like to object, economy (sic) reality necessitates that it go along with the Kurds -- for now,"" wrote Joost Hiltermann, an Iraq expert with the International Crisis Group, in a recent article on Foreign Policy.com. Hiltermann argued that the sharp drop in the price of oil last year forced the Iraqi central government to compromise with the Kurds, as Baghdad scrambled to find alternative sources of much-needed revenue. Under the arrangement, the Iraqi government will get the bulk of the earnings from Kurdish oil exports, while the Kurdistan Regional Government will be allotted 17 percent of the revenues. The cooperation of neighboring Turkey has been critical for the export deal to go through. In the past, the Turkish government has vehemently opposed any move by the Iraqi Kurds to develop oil resources, because of Turkish fears that the oil revenues would allow the Kurds to establish an independent state. In recent months, relations have improved dramatically between the Turks and the Iraqi Kurds. The Kurdish oil exports will likely be pumped through to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, on the Mediterranean Sea. Kurdish officials and their foreign partners are now looking at the possibility of exporting natural gas from Iraqi Kurdistan, through Turkey, to gas-hungry markets in Europe. Officials in Iraq's Oil Ministry, however, say such a deal would require permission from the Iraqi central government.","First time Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region has officially exported oil .

"(CNN) -- Iran and world powers are resuming talks in Geneva amid high hopes that a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear program will finally be reached. But while the P5+1 -- the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China and Germany -- and Iran appear to be closer than ever to striking a deal, there are still a lot of details to iron out. Read our explainer to get up to speed on 60 years' worth of nuclear history in Iran. When did Iran's nuclear program begin? The U.S. launched a nuclear cooperation program with Iran in 1957 -- back when the Shah ruled Iran and the two countries were still friends -- and by the mid-70s Iran began developing its nuclear power program. But the U.S. pulled its support when the Shah was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Why is the West worried about Iran's nuclear program? Since the 1979 revolution the West has worried that Iran could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons by producing highly-enriched uranium -- the material needed to make a bomb. Iran has always insisted it only wants to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes. In 2003 nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency announced they had found traces of highly-enriched uranium at a plant in Natanz. Iran temporarily halted enrichment but resumed enriching again in 2006, insisting enrichment was allowed under its agreement with the IAEA. What did the international community do? In late 2006 the U.N. Security Council passed sanctions against Iran for failing to suspend its nuclear program. Sanctions that initially targeted Iran's nuclear capability were greatly expanded over the next seven years to include bans on arms sales to Iran, travel bans on certain Iranians, Western bans on buying Iranian oil, and bans on dealing with Iranian financial institutions, including the country's central bank. Have sanctions worked? No and yes. In 2007 Iran claimed to have 3,000 centrifuges capable of enriching uranium. Today Iran has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. On the other hand, sanctions have crippled the country's economy. Oil revenues have plummeted, and the local currency had dropped 80% in value by 2012. The Iranian people have faced spiralling inflation and job layoffs within the state sector, according to CNN's John Defterios. Why are Iran and world powers talking now? The U.S. believes these sanctions have left Iran little choice but to compromise its nuclear ambitions in return for relief from the economy-destroying effects of the oil and banking bans. Newly-elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is also more moderate than his predecessor, and all sides believe there could now be a window of time to get a deal done. How close is Iran to producing a nuclear bomb? One U.S.-based anti-proliferation group says Iran could potentially produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb in as little as a month if it broke with international laws and went all-out towards production. But Hibbs says most world powers believe Iran is realistically at least a year away. ""Most of the people involved in this negotiation are looking at a longer time frame of between 1 and 3 years,"" he said. ""Negotiators have to be concerned about this but they know it's a worst-case scenario."" What would a deal on Iran's nuclear program look like? Most importantly, Iran would have to agree to suspend enriching uranium to 20% purity, according to one scenario being considered. While uranium isn't bomb-grade until it's enriched to 90% purity, Hibbs says ""once you're at 20%, you're about 80% of the way there."" Iran would also have to reduce its uranium stockpiles, stop constructing new centrifuges, and freeze essential work on its heavy-water reactor under development at Arak, which could be used as a source of plutonium -- a second pathway to a nuclear bomb. In return, world powers would have to agree to relax sanctions and allow Iran to enrich some uranium at a low level. Iran also wants the world to acknowledge its right to enrich uranium under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Does Iran have the right to enrich uranium? The U.S. and other world powers say no, but Iran says yes. Iran believes that it has the right to enrich uranium as a signatory to the NPT, but Hibbs says no such right is enshrined in the treaty. ""There is a right to the peaceful use of nuclear activities in the NPT,"" he says, ""but there's not a right to enrich uranium specifically."" While not conceding the point in principle, Iran appeared to loosen its stance on the issue at the weekend when Foreign Minister Javad Zarif reportedly told the ISNA news agency that Iran's right to enrich ""does not need recognition, because it is an inseparable right based on the NPT."" Why haven't other countries faced similar sanctions for their nuclear programs? India tested its first nuclear device in 1974, followed by Pakistan in 1998. Israel has always refused to confirm or deny that is has the bomb, although the Federation of American Scientists estimates it has around 80 atomic weapons. Action was never taken against India and Pakistan, partly because they never signed up to the NPT -- and in the latter's case, Hibbs says, ""because there was very little that the U.S. could've done to stop Pakistan."" Iran, on the other hand, signed up to the NPT and its declared program is being inspected by the IAEA. And Hibbs says the IAEA and world powers ""have information suggesting that Iran has carried out activities it hasn't declared in the past."" Who's against a deal? Israel is opposed to Iran having any nuclear enrichment capabilities at all and says the current plan is ""a bad deal"" that won't work. ""Iran is practically giving away nothing. It's making a minor concession, which they can reverse in weeks,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN. ""I think if you want a peaceful solution, as I do, then the right thing to do is ratchet up the sanctions."" CNN's Fareed Zakaria says Saudi Arabia's objections to Iran are existential. ""The Saudis regard Tehran as a heretical, Shiite, Persian enemy that must be opposed,"" he says. ""Its antipathy predates Iran's nuclear program and will persist whatever the resolution of it."" Hibbs says that as a country with nuclear power ambitions itself, Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to Iran having a nuclear program that includes sensitive activities like uranium enrichment. Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress have also said they will try to pass new Iran sanctions, despite Secretary of State John Kerry's warning that the move could ""destroy the ability to get an agreement"" in Geneva. And even if a deal is agreed, the White House faces an uphill battle trying to convince those same Congressional leaders to pass laws to relax sanctions on Iran. Another tough sell will be Iran's hardliners. Zakaria says: ""Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guards remain deeply anti-American, and they may well oppose the concessions that Rouhani and Zarif would have to make to get a deal."" Obama's task is two-fold, says Zakaria: ""First he has to get a deal that hardliners in Tehran can deal with. Then he has to get one that the hard-liners in Washington and Jerusalem and Riyadh can abide."" How would a deal be enforced? Iran could end up with a program that allows some uranium enrichment in exchange for full cooperation with IAEA inspectors over the next few years, according to Hibbs. Hibbs says: ""What's missing is answers from Iran to pressing questions from the IAEA about the scope and extent of the Iranian nuclear program during its history. If the powers are going to relax sanctions, they and the IAEA need to know that the program in Iran is exclusively dedicated to peaceful use. If they can get answers to those questions, that will bring Iran pretty far along."" Read more: U.S.-Israel rift over Iran nukes now in the open . Read more: Give Iran talks time, says skeptic .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Army is recalling 44,000 combat helmets -- some of which are being used by U.S. troops in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq -- after they failed to meet ballistics testing standards, an Army official announced Monday. Brig. Gen. Peter N. Fuller, who's responsible for buying and testing equipment for soldiers, told reporters at the Pentagon the recall was issued Thursday. Tests showed the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), which is standard issue for all soldiers, did not meet service requirements. Fuller said he was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the recalled helmets. The move was triggered after the Justice Department informed the Army about an ongoing investigation into the company that makes the helmets, ArmorSource LLC, formerly Rabintex USA LLC. ""There is evidence that ArmorSource and Rabintex ACHs were produced using unauthorized manufacturing practices, defective materials and improper quality procedures which could potentially reduce ballistic and fragmentation protection,"" said an All Army Activities message released May 14 to soldiers around the world. After the Justice Department's notification, the Army conducted ballistic tests on the helmets and found they didn't meet service standards. It is unclear why the helmets failed the most recent tests but passed initial testing when the Army first contracted with ArmorSource in 2006. The Army has an additional 55,000 helmets in storage. Those are also part of the recall and will be destroyed to ensure they are not distributed, Fuller said. The Army refused to accept delivery of another 3,000 helmets recently, bringing the total of problem helmets to 102,000, Fuller said. The helmets cost $250 each, and Fuller said the Army is investigating whether it can recover funds already paid to the company. The 44,000 recalled helmets had been sent to locations all over the world for distribution. Some 24,000 of them were sent to a distribution center that gives them to other services as well. ""We don't know where they are, so they could be on a soldier's head in Iraq or Afghanistan,"" Fuller said. ""We are seeing some getting returned in Bagram (Afghanistan)."" A statement posted on the ArmorSource website says the Army has not notified the company about the recall. ""ArmorSource was not informed of this recall before we saw the press release on Friday evening. We have not heard from the government regarding the recall and have no additional information,"" the statement said. Army officials said they were not required to tell the company about the recall because the military owned the helmets. Fuller said the Army had already broken its contract with ArmorSource earlier in the year because of other problems with the helmets, including paint chipping off. Army officials could not discuss details about the problems with the helmets because of the Justice Department investigation, but they said the ballistics tests showed they would not protect a solider against a worst-case scenario strike on the helmet. Fuller said general ballistics tests showed that while a bullet would not penetrate the helmet, they still failed to meet stringent Army requirements and ""fell short of the required ballistics test."" Three other companies also make the helmets, and replacement helmets are already being distributed, an Army statement said. The recall affects about 4 percent of the more than 1 million ACHs in the Army's inventory, according to Army statistics.","Brig. Gen. Peter N.

"Washington (CNN) -- The ""nuclear option"" would be the changing of Senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60. Apparently you need 60 votes to do just about anything in the Senate but change the rules. That only takes 51 votes. Nuclear? That sounds harsh for something as simple as a rule change. Senators view themselves as being part of the ""world's greatest deliberative body."" It's a debatable point, but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate, Senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation. In the fancy language they speak on Capitol Hill, moving toward a vote is called ""invoking cloture."" Senate moving toward 'going nuclear' Actually confirming the nominee or passing the legislation takes only 50 votes, but because of the procedural rules, it pretty much takes 60 to invoke cloture and get anything done these days. By requiring only 51 votes, the entire character of the chamber would change. Instead of being forced to get buy-in from the minority party (Republicans right now), the majority party (Democrats right now) would be able to confirm anybody for whom they could get a simple majority. Click here for a good academic paper from George Kroger at the University of Miami on ""The Rise of the 60-Vote Senate"" The idea is that it would ""blow up"" the Senate. We're speaking figuratively, of course. The symbolism of ""going nuclear"" also portends a sort of mutually assured destruction in the future, to borrow another Cold War term. Democrats won't always control the Senate. And when Republicans are in charge, you can bet they'll return the favor. Man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it . Wow. That does sound serious. Is this constitutional? Sure is. The Constitution doesn't say anything about Senate rules. It puts that power in the hands of senators and congressmen. ""Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,"" according to Article 1, Section 5. Senators are tasked with signing off on nominees in Article II, Section 2. But it doesn't say how exactly, which has led to a centuries-long debate on the matter. Here's what the Constitution says about the president's power to appoint: ""He shall have Power... with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."" OK. Fine. There's nothing in the Constitution. But Senate rules are pretty clear on the 60-vote threshold. Yes, they are. Read the chapter on cloture. But they've changed over time. Until 1949, for instance, according to the Congressional Research Service, senators couldn't even move to limit debate (invoke cloture) on nominations. According to the Senate website, Henry Clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear, back in 1841, on legislation. Up until 1975, it actually took 67 votes to overcome a filibuster. The most famous examples came during the Civil Rights era when Southerners from both parties blocked equal rights legislation. It took 60 days of filibustering to find the votes for the 1964 Civil Rights Act. What role does filibustering play in all this? Everybody seems to have a different definition of what a filibuster is. In pop culture, filibustering brings to mind Jimmy Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" speaking for hours to block legislation with which he disagrees. Anymore the filibuster is an implied thing. When everybody realizes that if there aren't 60 votes to limit debate, senators don't generally spend much time debating at all. They just move on. Even when a senator mounts a long, all-night speech, the outcome is usually pre-ordained. Take Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who spoke all night just before the recent government shutdown. Even before Cruz started speaking, senators had reached agreement to vote on a government funding bill the next day. His speech was not a filibuster; it was preaching to his political choir. Why is all this coming to a head now? This is where it gets even more complicated. Republicans have been blocking nominees to the D.C. Court of Appeals not because they dislike all the nominees, but because they don't want more Democrats than Republicans on that court. Currently, there are equal numbers of Democratic and Republican appointed judges on the court, which is considered second only to the Supreme Court in importance. In fact, Republicans want to shrink the number of judges on the court and expand the number of judges in other courts. But this is a fight that extends way beyond the current spat over the D.C Circuit Court. The number of filibusters has exploded in recent years, and so has the number of votes trying to end them. Between 1949 and 2012, cloture was invoked 122 times. The vast majority of those occurred in the past decade. Democrats, who employed the tactic of filibustering to some effect during the George W. Bush administration, now say they're fed up with Republicans employing it against President Barack Obama. Read a really detailed look at the history of filibusters and cloture filings from the Congressional Research Service. Republicans block nominees to D.C. court .","Senate rules require 60 votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation .

"(CNN) -- A ""suspicious"" fire devastated the church attended by Alaska Gov. and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Friday night in her hometown of Wasilla, the church's minister said. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reportedly apologized for the possibility the fire was related to her nomination. ""We have no idea what caused it,"" the Rev. Larry Kroon of the Wasilla Bible Church said Saturday, adding that investigators were considering arson and other possible causes. A ladies' craft group was in the building when the fire broke out, but they got out safely, Kroon said. ""No one was hurt,"" he said. Central Mat-Su Fire Department Chief James Steele said the department was ""treating it as suspicious and as potential arson at this point"" but did not elaborate, The Anchorage Daily News reported. The newspaper said Palin released a statement after the fire in which she said she stopped by the church Saturday morning and offered an apology to the assistant pastor ""if the incident is in any way connected to the undeserved negative attention the church has received since she became a vice presidential candidate."" Steele said that as many as 40 firefighters from his and neighboring departments fought the blaze, which started about 9:40 p.m. Friday (1:40 a.m. ET Saturday). Firefighters were on the scene dealing with hot spots until about 5 a.m. Saturday, the Anchorage Daily News reported. The metal church building, which normally accommodates Sunday congregations of up to 1,000 people, was heavily damaged by flames and smoke, Kroon said. ""The fire investigators and insurance people are there now. There's definitely a lot of damage. I've heard the figure of $1 million, but I don't know for sure,"" he said. Kroon said he was not at the church when the fire broke out and would not discuss what any of the church members who were there had reported to him. He would not specify how many people were in the building at the time of the blaze. ""They were all adults, and they all got out. We're trying not to talk about specifics while investigators are still working on finding out what happened."" Kroon said the nondenominational church, which he described as ""just a local community church,"" is about 30 years old and the church building itself is about 2½ years old. The pastor said church services would be held on schedule Sunday in a nearby school.","Ladies' craft group escaped safely after fire broke out Friday night, pastor says .

"(CNN) -- At the request of the Australian, Russian and Chinese governments, the U.S. Coast Guard is stepping up to help break up ice off Antarctica that has ensnared a pair of ships. The Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star had been heading to that area anyway, having left its home port of Seattle early last month to eventually break through sea ice and refuel the U.S. Antarctic Program's McMurdo Station on Ross Island. Now the icebreaker is retooling to help the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy and China's Xue Long due to ""sufficient concern that the vessels may not be able to free themselves from the ice,"" the Coast Guard said Saturday in a statement. The Polar Star, currently in Sydney, will take on supplies and head out Sunday on what should be a seven-day voyage to the ships in Commonwealth Bay, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. ""We are always ready and duty-bound to render assistance in one of the most remote and harsh environments on the face of the globe,"" said Vice Adm. Paul F. Zukunft, the U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific commander. Chinese ship in Antarctica rescue stuck in ice . The Australian agency formally requested the Americans help on Friday. The Coast Guard noted that the governments of Russia and China also asked for U.S. assistance. Earlier this week, a helicopter ferried 52 passengers from the MV Akadmik Shokalskiy to the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis. The Akadmik Shokalskiy had been trapped in unusually deep ice since Christmas Eve with scientists, journalists, tourists and crew members on board. Twenty-two Russian crew members are still on the Akademik Shokalskiy, waiting for either the ice to shift or for outside help. Xue Long is a Chinese icebreaker that sent out the helicopter Thursday that airlifted several dozen passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy to safety. But after that happened, the Chinese vessel itself got stuck in the ice, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Xue Long's captain told AMSA that his ship is safe, has plenty of food and supplies and did not need immediate assistance. The U.S. Coast Guard's ""only active heavy polar icebreaker,"" the 399-foot long Polar Star recently completed a three-year, $90 million overhaul. Capable of traveling at speeds of 18 knots (21 mph), the ship can continuously break through 6 feet of ice while traveling 3 knots. With its reinforced hull and special bow, the Polar Star can bust through as much as 21 feet of ice at a time. After its new mission, the U.S. Coast Guard vessel is set to continue to its original mission in McMurdo Sound. All 52 passengers rescued from ship trapped in Antarctic ice .

"(CNN) -- It's a first-world problem of epic proportions, and the couch potatoes of the Web aren't pleased. Just before midnight Tuesday, a dispute between satellite provider DirecTV and mass-media company Viacom led to nearly 20 million customers losing access to 26 channels Viacom owns. On social media Wednesday, it seemed like a good chunk of those millions were lashing out, telling the world that they want their MTV ... or Nickelodeon ... or VH1, Spike, BET and Comedy Central. ""When my son cant watch 'The Backyardigans' tomorrow he might call DirecTV himself,"" Atlanta Falcons All-Pro cornerback Brent Grimes posted on Twitter, referring to the Nickelodeon animated series. Some less-famous Twitter users turned to humor, and Jay-Z lyrics, to address the situation. ""If you got DirecTV I feel bad for you son, I got 999 channels and you just lost some!"" tweeted user ""Ezel From Friday."" And like any good dispute in the Twitter-and-Facebook age, the two principals cranked up an online fight of their own. Viacom retweeted several posts blaming DirecTV for the blackout, many from stars of shows that air on the affected channels. It also used the site to accuse DirecTV of refusing to negotiate. DirecTV, in turn, hammered home its case, saying Viacom wants to raise the price of the channels, which would in turn create more expensive service for subscribers. It shared a link to its own version of the dispute and a post saying it hopes ""to reach an agreement soon & keep your bill low."" Both companies also were sharing their side with fans on Facebook, where customers were responding with hundreds of often-angry comments. ""This is ridiculous, I've only had DirecTv for 6 months and this is the SECOND time that we've lost channels that we watch on a regular basis,"" one fan of DirecTV's Facebook page wrote. ""Get your stuff together and get it settled BEFORE it affects us as customers. It's very unprofessional. I will be canceling once my contract is up."" On its own page, Viacom took a bit of a cheap shot Wednesday afternoon, posting an image of Nickelodeon cartoon favorite SpongeBob SquarePants with this text: . ""Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? I don't know. I have DirecTV."" More than a few Facebook fans weren't amused by the stunt. ""WOW, Viacom! You win the crown for King of corporate [expletive]s!"" one of them wrote. ""My kids are upset because they can't watch Spongebob anymore after you rubbed it in their faces with that lousy commercial you came up with to HURT their feelings and make Directtv look like a bunch of [expletive]s and now here you are making a joke about it. YOU SUCK!!!!!"" Of course, neither company has the chops to talk smack like a pro wrestler. Grappling legend Hulk Hogan appears on ""TNA Wrestling Impact,"" which airs on Spike. He took to YouTube in a video that makes up in intensity what it lacks in nuance. ""I've had a world of piledriving punishment dished out to me, brother, but I've never been hurt like I am right now since I heard that DirecTV dropped Spike,"" he says in the video, which had only a modest 3,200 views as of midday Wednesday. Some complaints, of course, were perhaps more self-aware than others. ""Dear Direct TV ... I want my expensive service to include all the channels I once had. Thanks,"" read one tweet. Who was that complaining about having to pay so much for blacked-out satellite service? Reality-TV star, NBA wife and millionaire heiress Khloe Kardashian. So, what are subscribers to do while the two entertainment titans hash out the dispute? Here are a few alternatives: . Web services like Hulu Plus offer the current seasons of many TV offerings, with episodes appearing shortly after they air. Comedy Central's ""South Park"" and ""The Daily Show"" and The CW's ""Supernatural"" are just a few of the top offerings listed under Hulu's ""Currently On Air"" feature. And right now, Hulu is offering a free one-week trial -- so if you get lucky, you might be able to ride out the spat without paying anything extra (Khloe Kardashian, take note). Amazon, Netflix and other providers offer current TV series as well. So, worst-case scenario, even if you can't get the latest episode of your current favorites, you can review past seasons or catch up on those shows you've been meaning to check out.","Subscribers take to Web to bemoan DirecTV Viacom blackout .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- ""It is like a tsunami has hit here."" These were the first words from CNN's Paula Hancocks, as she arrived in the storm-battered eastern city of Tacloban on board a military transport plane. Leading the first international news team into this part of the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan -- one of the strongest storms ever recorded to hit land -- Hancocks and crew hitched a ride from Manila with the country's military, along with members of the World Food Program, the United Nations, local media and a load of food aid. This is her first account of the scenes she witnessed: . The damage in Tacloban looks almost identical to that caused by a tsunami. As we were flying over the area, it was quite clear there was a lot of water and a lot of destruction. The area is flooded and everything I can see has been damaged. Latest on Super Typhoon Haiyan: More than 100 killed in Tacloban . The sheer devastation and debris is something I have seen from tsunamis -- I haven't seen damage of this magnitude from a typhoon before. Every single tree is either flattened or broken off and stripped bare. This damage to the trees alone shows the strength of the winds. Officials tell me the storm surge came as high as the second story of the terminal building here and it clearly has devastated the structure. What was once inside the building is now strewn outside. Helicopters are taking off from the airfield -- this looks like it is becoming a staging point for the relief effort. It is hard to get a gauge right now on just how many casualties or how much damage the storm has caused here and across the country. In Tacloban, all the power lines are down and the airfield itself is badly damaged. The military and the U.N. are looking for where they should set up areas where residents can come to get assistance. This is the initial phase of the relief efforts. Typhoon tracker: Haiyan heads to Vietnam . There are a lot of residents wandering around looking lost -- they look like they're not sure what they should be doing. It is difficult to know how many people will come to this area. The roads are inaccessible and completely cut off. There is barely a tree in its entirety standing, blocking roads. People are coming to the terminal area as they believe this is where food and water and first aid will be administered. The head of the World Food Program told me what they have to do in the first few hours is figure out what they can do -- figure out the lay of the land, where they can get to, where they can't get to and that will take some time. And that is also a major task facing the military -- getting to the areas they need to get to. It is going to take heavy machinery and a lot of work before they can reach those who need help. The first challenge will be providing food and water as well as shelter. A couple of residents have approached me. One, a young man with his baby daughter looked very shell-shocked and very shaken up. He was waiting for some medical treatment. The medical facilities at this point are very rudimentary but that will change in the coming hours. I have also had many people wave and smile at me. They are familiar with typhoons -- this country sees more than 20 typhoons each year but not at the level or scale brought on by this storm. Among the tasks facing relief workers is bringing in food for these people. Food and water are the main issue facing residents. I can see the military right now carrying in tents to certain areas -- for medical purposes or to provide shelter. There are some structures that remain intact but they look very dangerous in themselves. Twisted and unstable -- it is not an ideal situation for people to shelter but there are no alternatives right now. Are you in the affected area? Send us your images and video but please stay safe .","Paula Hancocks are crew are the first international news team to reach Tacloban .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Model Reeva Steenkamp was shot four times through the bathroom door at the home of Olympian Oscar Pistorius, a South African official familiar with the case told CNN on Monday. She was alive after she was shot and was carried downstairs by Pistorius, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media. A blood-stained cricket bat has also emerged as key evidence in the case, according to the City Press newspaper of Johannesburg. Detectives are working to determine whether the bat was used to attack Steenkamp or she used it in self-defense, the newspaper reported, citing a source with inside knowledge of the case. Detectives are also looking into the possibility that Pistorius used the bat to break down the bathroom door. The details are the latest to emerge in the shooting death that has roiled the nation and left South Africans asking what went so terribly wrong inside the upscale Pretoria home of the man nicknamed ""Blade Runner"" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications the 29-year-old model intended to stay the night at the house: She had an overnight bag and her iPad. Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women . Authorities have released little about a possible motive in the Valentine's Day shooting, while local media have reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. South African authorities have stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home. Police have charged Pistorius with murder, and he will appear in court Tuesday for a bail hearing. South African prosecutors have said they intend to upgrade the charge to premeditated murder, but have not released further details. Pistorius, 26, has rejected the murder allegation ""in the strongest terms,"" his agent said in a statement. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires . Burial service . The same day Pistorius returns to court, Steenkamp will be buried in a private service in her hometown of Port Elizabeth. Her burial Tuesday will come two days after South Africa's national broadcaster aired a pre-recorded reality TV show featuring Steenkamp discussing her exit from ""Tropika Island of Treasure,"" on which local celebrities compete for prize money. The decision to air the program took ""much deliberation,"" and ""this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory,"" said Samantha Moon, the executive producer. The shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero as the first disabled athlete to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games. He competed in the London Games as well as winning two gold medals in the Paralympic Games. Headlines about the case have dominated in the days since Pistorius was arrested, though tight-lipped authorities have revealed little about what, if anything, the track star has said. Questions swirl . Reports say Pistorius and Steenkamp became an item around November and were popular in South African social circles. The night before the shooting, Steenkamp appeared to be looking forward to Valentine's Day. ""What do you have up your sleeve for your love tomorrow?"" she asked her Twitter followers the day before. ""Get excited."" Steenkamp was found in a pool of blood at Pistorius' home Thursday morning. Neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting, saying they had ""heard things earlier,"" police spokeswoman Denise Beukes has said. She did not clarify what the neighbors reported they heard. Authorities also have not said whether Pistorius called for help. Pictures of his walk to a police car, his head covered by a sweatshirt, have flashed repeatedly across television screens. On Sunday, Pistorius canceled his appearances in five upcoming races. The move is meant to help Pistorius focus on the legal proceedings and ""help and support all those involved as they try to come to terms with this very difficult and distressing situation,"" said Peet Van Zyl of Pistorius' management company, In Site Athlete Management. CNN's Robyn Curnow reported from South Africa; Chelsea J. Carter and Faith Karimi reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Detectives are examining role of a blood-stained cricket bat, newspaper reports .

"London (CNN) -- The horrifying video of a Syrian rebel leader apparently eating the heart of a dead government soldier, which has been circulating this week on the internet, has caused a storm of instantaneous outrage and disgust on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. But the video, which human rights monitors say appears to be genuine and not a regime propaganda ""plant,"" may also inflict long-term political damage on the already challenged reputation and credibility of the Syrian opposition, despite earnest condemnation of the alleged atrocity by the umbrella rebel organization, the Syrian National Coalition. Human Rights Watch said this week the video ""appears to show"" a commander of a rebel Syrian brigade called the Independent Omar al-Farouq brigade mutilating the corpse of a regime opponent. ""The figure in the video cuts the heart and liver out of the body and uses sectarian language to insult Alawites,"" a HRW statement said, adding: ""At the end of the video [the man] is filmed putting the corpse's heart into his mouth, as if he is taking a bite out of it."" The HRW statement said: ""It is not known whether the Independent Omar al-Farouq brigade operates within the command structure of the Free Syrian Army. But the opposition Syrian National Coalition and the Free Syrian Army leadership should take all possible steps to hold those responsible for war crimes accountable and prevent such abuses by anyone under their command ... Any party with the power to do so should do all it can to keep weapons from reaching the brigade."" The last sentence is particularly pointed, given the accelerating debate in the U.S. and Britain on whether to arm the rebels. The past two weeks has seen a concerted effort by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to rally support for an international summit on Syria to discuss a peace agreement and a transition of power from the regime led by President Bashar al-Assad to a new opposition-led government. When David Cameron travelled to Washington and New York this week, he was pushing a similar agenda. In White House talks with Barack Obama, the British prime minister stressed the urgent need for a diplomatic settlement, but also reiterated that Britain (like France) was considering supplying weapons to the rebels after the EU arms embargo expires at the end of this month. Pentagon officials have meanwhile indicated that the U.S. is moving closer to providing weapons and other lethal assistance to the rebels. Up until now, it has not done so, although the CIA has reportedly been involved in routing weapons supplied by Gulf state sympathizers to the rebels. Cameron also pressed his case in Russia, during a Black Sea meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Like Kerry and Obama, the British see Moscow's support for al-Assad as the key obstacle to ending the Syrian civil war. But Putin continues to suspect that the western nations are pursuing regime change in Syria, and that they are looking for an excuse to intervene, as Nato did in Libya two years ago. He has refused to join calls for al-Assad to step down. Upping the ante, Cameron subsequently announced that Britain would double its non-lethal aid to the opposition over the next year and that it was looking at ways to provide more technical assistance to the rebels. The new humanitarian support of Â£30 million ($46 million) takes the UK's total contribution to the Syria humanitarian crisis to Â£170 million, according to Downing Street. All these well-laid diplomatic stratagems in Washington and London could be set at nought if alleged rebel atrocities, such as this week's video, and other misdeeds turn international public opinion against the opposition. The rebels were already facing an uphill battle for support. Republican members of the U.S. Congress and right-wing commentators have long warned that elements of the rebel forces are linked to al Qaeda, and that arming or otherwise supporting them would be to repeat the same mistake the U.S. made when it armed the Afghan mujahedeen in the 1980s (when Afghanistan was occupied by the Soviet Union). The mujahedeen mutated into the modern-day Taliban, formed an alliance with the late Osama bin Laden in the 1990s, and have since turned the expertise they attained in defeating the Red Army against Nato forces which entered the country after the 9/11 attacks. What leads a human being up to a grotesque act . Putin has voiced similar fears in September 2012, suggesting the West could be creating a monster in backing Sunni Muslim groups against the Alawite-led regime. Moscow argues, in effect, that better the devil you know (al-Assad) than the devil you don't (an extremist Sunni successor regime). Oddly, perhaps, these western voices of caution find themselves in de facto coalition with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shia Muslim allies of the Assad regime. Meanwhile, a senior U.N. official suggested recently that the rebels were guilty of using chemical weapons (which they deny). On top of all this, the opposition faces another question, bigger than all the others: can it win? According to the U.N., the Syrian civil war has claimed an estimated 80,000 lives so far, with millions more displaced or forced into foreign exile. The rebels control large tracts of territory, but they have failed to seize and hold major cities, and the balance of battlefield fortunes swings back and forward inconclusively. The regime has proved tenacious, resourceful and stubborn. Al-Assad and his allies have nowhere to run. For them it is a fight to the death. The rebels, meanwhile, comprising myriad local groups and leaders, continue to lack strong central direction or agreement on what a post-Assad future might look like. It may be that a compromise deal on a new government including existing members of the regime and some rebel elements will ultimately prove the only way to end the war. This week's video horror increases pressure to halt the bloodshed as quickly as possible -- even if that means some kind of patched-up deal, unpalatable, unsatisfactory and impermanent though it will undoubtedly be.

"Sapelo Island, Georgia (CNN) -- It's a culture struggling to survive. Fewer than 50 people -- all descendants of slaves -- fear they may soon be taxed out of the property their families have owned since the days of slavery. They are the Gullah-Geechee people of Sapelo Island off Georgia's coast, near Savannah. This small, simple community is finding itself embroiled in a feud with local officials over a sudden, huge increase in property assessments that are raising property taxes as much as 600% for some. Many say the increase could force them to sell their ancestral properties. ""That's part of the American history. That's part of what built this country,"" said Charles Hall, 79, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel who was born under a midwife's care in the same home he lives in today. ""Sapelo being the only intact Gullah-Geechee community in the country that's left, that is a part of history. It will be a shame not to preserve"" it, he told CNN. McIntosh County's decision to reappraise homes on the island sparked the problem. County Attorney Adam Poppell told CNN that the Gullah-Geechee culture is invaluable, but the properties had been historically undervalued due to errors in previous property appraisals. ""We have to follow the law, and assess at fair market value,"" he told CNN. To fix the problem, he said, ""the state has to create a special exemption for cultural communities."" Sapelo Island, about the size of Manhattan, is a short 20-minute boat ride from Georgia's coast. But in some ways, it seems much farther. The bumpy, unpaved dirt roads are a constant reminder that this is an island with few services. There are no police officers, fire rescue personnel, doctors or hospitals. There is no school or post office. People drive their garbage to a single garbage compactor. There are no grocery stores. The gas station is open only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Ninety-seven percent of the island is owned by the state of Georgia. Residents live on a small section known as Hog Hammock. A ferry makes three round trips each day, with the last departure from the mainland at 5:30 p.m. Residents can't miss that ferry if they want to work or go to school on the mainland. They complain this limits their employment opportunities and prohibits their children from participating in after-school activities. Half of nation's foreclosed homes still occupied . Many have fled the island over the years because opportunity just doesn't exist there. Cornelia Bailey has been one of the loudest defenders of the island where she was born and raised. She's the ninth generation of her family to live on the island, whose slave roots are traced back to Angola. She said the taxes on her one acre property have gone from $600 a year to about $2,300. ""All these years of getting nothing, then all of a sudden, they want to lay this tax on your back and still not give you nothing,"" she said. ""For the last three years, we've been paying $128 a year for garbage collection. I don't even have my green garbage can. Where's my can?"" She added, with a hint of anger in her voice, ""You can call 911, but nobody gonna squeal up to your front door, so forget it."" Homeowners are hiring lawyers now to have their displeasure heard in state and federal court. Reed Colfax -- a partner at Relman, Dane & Colfax, one of the leading housing discrimination litigation firms in the country -- is heading full speed into court to have the tax bills struck down for at least half the residents of the island. ""The solution is that we freeze the tax assessments, we get the services to this island, so the people can live here,"" he said. ""Families can move back in, have children here, have jobs on the mainland, or even develop their own economy here on the island."" Tax Assessors Board Chairman James Larkin suggests the Sapelo residents brought this issue on themselves, as some began to sell their property to developers and non-islanders who built bigger, upscale vacation homes, causing valuations to increase, and along with them their property taxes. ""If they hadn't started selling their property, there wouldn't be a problem,"" he told CNN. But Reginald Hall isn't buying that argument. He and his family own three properties on more than seven acres of property on the island. The assessed ""fair market value"" of their property went from $176,075 in 2011 to $910,333 in 2012. That brought on increase of more than 500% in property taxes. He is refusing to pay the taxes and he refuses to sell his family land, which he says is worth over $3 million. ""Once you leave, you are separated from more family members ... which is a real interruption in the generational teachings on this island of the culture,"" he said. ""We leave, and we're gone. Can't come back, because if we try to come back after we sell, you can't afford to buy,"" he told CNN. Cornelia Bailey said her land may be worth about $384,000, but in reality it is priceless. ""I told one guy it was priceless, and he said everything has a price, and I said, you don't know me, this is priceless. You don't have enough money to buy it, so forget it,"" she said. ""We have a legacy that most people would die to have. We're fighting to keep it even for the unborn.""","Fewer than 50 of the Gullah-Geechee people remain on Georgia's coastal Sapelo Island .

"New York (CNN) -- New York mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who began his campaign as a long-shot but surfed a late wave of momentum by tapping into liberal anxiety over the three-term administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, overwhelmed his opponents on Tuesday to finish first in the city's Democratic mayoral primary. With results still being counted late Tuesday evening, de Blasio, the city's public advocate, was bobbing around the 40% mark needed to avoid a three-week runoff race for the Democratic nomination. Early Wednesday the New York City board of elections confirmed that there were still over 19,000 absentee ballots, special ballots, affidavits, and military ballots that needed to be counted, and that the number of uncounted votes could increase. ""We don't declare a winner until every vote is counted,"" said Valerie Vazquez, NYC Board of Elections director of communications, said in a statement. Exit poll results . If De Blasio is forced into a runoff, he would face the second place finisher, former city comptroller Bill Thompson, the race's lone African-American candidate. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a lesbian who would have been the city's first female mayor, finished in a disappointing third place, her once-invincible campaign collapsing under the weight of her ties to Bloomberg. City comptroller John Liu finished fourth, followed in a distant fifth by former Rep. Anthony Weiner, whose candidacy imploded earlier this summer after he admitted to having more lewd conversations with women he met on the Internet. Republican Joe Lhota, the former top deputy to Rudy Giuliani, won his party's nomination, defeating John Catsimatidis, the colorful grocery store maven who pumped millions from his personal fortune into the race. 5 Things . If de Blasio wins the nomination, he would enter the general election as the clear favorite against Lhota. Down the ballot, former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's bid for political redemption was thwarted in the Democratic race for city comptroller by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, who reversed Spitzer's early lead in the race by reminding voters of the prostitution scandal that derailed his political career in 2008. De Blasio, the city's public advocate, frequently hammered a ""tale of two cities"" theme on the campaign trail, painting Bloomberg's New York as an increasingly unaffordable metropolis that rewarded wealthy Manhattanites at the expense of the outer borough middle class. A Brooklyn resident who showcased his interracial family in television ads, de Blasio ran up sweeping margins in nearly every borough and demographic category, besting his opponents among voters of all ages, races and income levels. According to exit polling published by the New York Times, de Blasio, who is white, even outperformed Thompson among black voters. Campaign's final days . Though Democrats were split on their opinion of Bloomberg's job performance -- 49% approved, according to the Times exit poll data, while 48% disapproved -- almost three quarters said they wanted the city to move in a new direction. De Blasio performed best among voters who were sour on the mayor. By a wide margin, Democratic voters said they disapproved of the New York Police Department's aggressive ""stop-and-frisk"" policy, a Bloomberg-backed tactic that grants police the power to search random citizens they deem suspicious. The policy is deeply unpopular among African-Americans who consider it racial profiling, and de Blasio won a majority of Democrats who described the tactic as ""excessive.""","Anthony Weiner's rollercoaster campaign comes to quiet end in primary loss .

"(CNN) -- The horseback riders braving the rugged Idaho wilderness came upon the older man and younger female and sized them up on the spot: A pair of greenhorns, square pegs in hard country. ""They just really didn't fit very well,"" rider Mark John said Monday on CNN's ""New Day."" ""The expressions on their face, their demeanor, just didn't fit that country."" After the riders got home, they turned on the TV and realized they had stumbled upon the objects of an intense manhunt across the West. An image of the girl was in an Amber Alert, the child abduction alert system. She turned out to be 16-year-old Hannah Anderson, the teen taken captive by a family friend, James DiMaggio. Troopers from California to Idaho had been hunting them down for about a week. The riders contacted Idaho state police and their tip over the weekend sent FBI agents swarming to the camping spot outside Cascade, in central Idaho. Hannah was rescued.

Out in the wild, the four riders, Mark and Christa John and Mike and Mary Young, briefly interacted with the pair. Their presence just didn't seem to add up, the Johns said.

Scared, Mike Young said. ""They weren't dressed for the country or the area and then as we rode further on, we encountered the tent that they had set up, which was totally out of place. it was way on top of a mountain, looked like it would make a real good lightning rod.

""I did want to make contact with her. In retrospect, I'm glad that I didn't because that could have turned out terribly wrong for all of us."" However, she did speak to the man. ""I did talk to him about why he was there in this far-out place and he said she got to pick where we went last year.

"New York (CNN) -- Federal agents say a missing New Jersey woman may be one of 11 victims believed to have been slain by admitted serial killer Israel Keyes. Investigators believe the woman Debra Feldman, 49, was last seen at her Hackensack home on April 8, 2009. She has not been heard from since. The FBI said Keyes admitted that on April 9, 2009, he abducted a female from a state on the East Coast and transported her over multiple state lines into New York. Keyes said he killed the victim and buried her in upstate New York. FBI Special Agent Barbara Woodruff told CNN Thursday that Keyes -- before he committed suicide last year -- was shown pictures of unsolved murder victims and people who had gone missing to see whether he would admit to being involved in any of those cases. When Keyes was shown a picture of Feldman, he paused, looking at it a long time, before saying, ""I'm not ready to talk about that one,"" according to Woodruff. Footage on the FBI website shows Keyes during the interviews with federal agents, telling them he would release certain information or details about his victims, and then changing his mind. Detailed interactive map of Keyes' travels . ""He did enjoy the cat and mouse game,"" Woodruff said. Keyes committed suicide in his Alaska jail cell last December by slitting his wrist and strangling himself with bedding.

An Army veteran and traveling contractor, Keyes studied other serial killers, but liked to say that he had not patterned himself after any other killer. Serial killer a murder addict .

"New York (CNN) -- Safely back on American soil, freed Americans Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer on Sunday recounted their two years in ""a world of lies and false hope"" behind the walls of an Iranian prison. Wearing green shirts and big smiles, Bauer and Fattal landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport four days after their release by Iranian authorities. In a news conference following their arrival, they described long days held in isolation, the hours punctuated by the screams of other inmates, and their ""total sham"" of a trial. ""Releasing us is a good gesture, and no positive step should go unnoticed,"" Fattal told reporters Sunday afternoon. ""We applaud the Iranian authorities for finally making the right decision regarding our case. But we want to be clear that they do not deserve undue credit for ending what they had no right and no justification to start in the first place."" Fattal, Bauer and Bauer's now-fiancee, Sarah Shourd, were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran in July 2009. Shourd was released in 2010, but Bauer and Fattal were freed only Wednesday, after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on ""ridiculous lies."" ""Sarah, Josh and I have experienced a taste of the Iranian regime's brutality. We have been held in almost total isolation from the world and everything we love, stripped of our rights and freedom,"" Bauer said. He urged Iran to release all political prisoners immediately, telling reporters, ""There are people in Iran who have been imprisoned for years for simply attending a protest, for writing a pro-democracy blog or for worshiping an unpopular faith."" But he also criticized the treatment of prisoners held in U.S. facilities, such as the military's prison camp for suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""In prison, every time we complained about our conditions, the guards would immediately remind us of comparable conditions at Guantanamo Bay,"" he said. While the hikers don't believe American policies ""justify what has been done to us,"" he said, ""We do believe that these actions on the part of the U.S. provide an excuse for other governments, including the government of Iran, to act in kind."" They said they were held in near-complete isolation in Tehran's Evin prison, allowed a total of only 15 minutes of telephone calls with their families throughout their ordeal. Fattal said the two had to wage repeated hunger strikes in order to even receive letters from their families. Iranian authorities told them their families had stopped writing, that they would receive due process of law and that the Swiss ambassador -- who represents U.S. interests in Iran -- was not interested in seeing them. Worse, Fattal said, ""Many times -- too many times -- we heard the screams of other prisoners being beaten, and there was nothing we could do to help them."" Shourd said Bauer was beaten and Fattal was forced down a flight of stairs during their captivity. She was released on medical grounds in September 2010, and told CNN the screams that echoed within Tehran's notorious Evin Prison ""will always be with me."" ""I don't know what was being done to them,"" she said. ""But not being able to help another human being, being completely impotent and unable to do anything to ease their suffering, is something I'll never forget."" Iranian authorities released Fattal and Bauer on Wednesday. They first were flown to Oman, where they enjoyed several days of freedom after their lengthy captivity. Fattal's mother, Laura Fattal, told CNN their families ""were hooting and hollering and waving our scarves"" when they landed. ""We couldn't wait for them to get to us ... I couldn't have asked for anything better,"" she said. And Bauer's mother, Cindy Hickey, said the families haven't heard ""a whole lot of details"" from their sons since their release. ""We have taken the time to just sit and talk and regather,"" Hickey told CNN. ""We've been very busy traveling,"" she said. Hickey said they were held as ""political pawns."" Bauer and Fattal blamed three decades of hostility between the United States and Iran for making their plight worse than that of other Westerners who had strayed into Iranian territory. ""It was clear to us from the very beginning that we were hostages,"" Fattal said. ""This is the most accurate term because, despite certain knowledge of our innocence, Iran has always tied our case to its political disputes with the U.S."" But, Shourd said in hindsight, ""I don't believe that Iran got anything good out of this. ""I don't believe it was good for the country, and it certainly wasn't good for the Iranian people, whom I admire and support in their struggle for democracy and freedom,"" she said. Fattal and Bauer thanked the numerous people in America and abroad who helped secure their freedom, including their Iranian attorney, Masoud Shafiee. Shafiee ""was never allowed to represent us properly, but he never gave up,"" Fattal said. Shourd said no one has ever taken credit for paying her bail or those of Fattal and Bauer. She and Bauer became officially engaged on Friday, although he proposed to her during their time in prison. ""When Sarah was about to walk out of Evin prison last year, we vowed to each other that none of us would be entirely free until all of us were free,"" Bauer said. ""That moment has now thankfully come.""

"London (CNN) -- Retro ruled at the Ninth International London Tattoo Convention over the weekend. It was a reminder of how central the theme of travel has long been to tattoos. How so? Consider the vintage designs that proved so popular among the thousands of inky fans gathered from all over the world at the three-day meet. Mermaids. Anchors and sailing ships. Coy 50s pin-ups. Gypsy girls. It's the classic iconography of the sailor's bicep -- signifiers, in other words, of the professional, inveterate traveler. Traditional swing . ""There's definitely a swing back to traditional. The fashion is the old U.S. marine styles,"" Marcus Berriman, co-organiser of the convention, told the Guardian. But another trend on show had an equally strong travel imprint. Along with ""[t]he old-school sailor stuff ... the Japanese are really in vogue now,"" Aimee Cornwell, a second-generation tattooist at the show told the paper, referring to designs thick with swords and samurais. Such oriental themes hark back to the allure of the exotic, when wearing a tattoo so often symbolized that you'd been somewhere foreign -- possibly very foreign -- and were therefore also probably a little suspicious. Now all a tat need signify is that you know how to find your way to a trendy inner-city tattoo parlor. Could it be that a return to rootless maritime themes and the mysterious east are an attempt to restore a demimonde thrill to a practice that's becoming so mainstream that the next radical statement could be to go entirely tattoo-free? Or to tattoo your head -- another unmissable trend at the convention that one artist present called a potential ""life-ruiner,"" and something she, like many of her fellow practitioners, never offered. Scrubbed clean . Seen as one of the great follies of youth, tattooing -- especially when it's on someone's head -- can make you want to scream, ""You can't scrub it off!"" Except that you can. Painful and expensive it might be, but lasering can now return a tattooed body to a blank, if slightly smudgy, canvas. Leaving you to travel the world in search of new tattoos. Judging by the skilled artists present, by invitation only, at the convention, electrifying designs are on offer in a growing number of countries around the world.

"Washington (CNN) -- A compromise amendment intended to ease congressional passage of sweeping immigration legislation easily won Senate approval Wednesday. The 69-29 vote set up a procedural motion immediately afterward to limit debate on the roughly 1,200-page bill, which would provide an eventual path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living illegally in the country. While some further amendments still could be considered, the measure appeared headed to a final Senate vote by the end of the week after the procedural motion passed in a 67-31 vote. Backers of the bill want the Democratic-led Senate to pass it with a solid majority to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum as the measure heads to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. The compromise amendment by Republicans John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee would increase border security, a demand by conservative opponents of the immigration bill. Justices could put an end to hard choice for gay couples . ""I hope our colleagues in the House of Representatives will follow the Senate's lead, and work to pass bipartisan reform that both Democrats and Republicans can support,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said before Wednesday's votes. Conservative GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, an opponent of the Senate bill, conceded it s likely to pass and called on House Republicans to make things right. ""I expect the House of Representatives to fix this miserable failure,"" Grassley said. Republican leaders say the House will consider the issue in several smaller proposals instead of a comprehensive single measure, a process that would allow more debate and votes on specific provisions. Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner reiterated to GOP members that he opposes having the House take up any Senate immigration legislation, according to Rep. John Fleming. Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, said Boehner told the weekly policy meeting that the House would work on its own immigration bills. If enacted, the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants while enhancing security along the border with Mexico. Among other things, the compromise border security amendment would add 20,000 border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Opinion: Protect rights of immigrant whistle-blowers . The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and border entry-exit controls. Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security. Hoeven and Corker introduced the compromise amendment last week, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system. Grassley and other opponents argued the legislation amounts to an amnesty for immigrants who broke the law by living illegally in America. They argued the promises of increased border security before giving undocumented immigrants permanent residency would end up proving empty. ""It does nothing to change the legalization-first philosophy and does little more than offer false promises that the American people can no longer tolerate,"" Grassley said. If eventually passed into law and signed by President Barack Obama, the bill would be the first major immigration reform since 1986, during the second Reagan administration. Grassley conceded he voted for the 1986 measure, which also called for increased border security, and called his support then a mistake he regrets. Farm bill failure portends problems for immigration in the House . The 2013 version was drafted by a Senate ""Gang of Eight"" composed of four Democrats and four Republicans motivated by political and policy needs. Both parties concede the nation's immigration system is broken, and some Republicans believe that GOP refusal to work with Democrats on the matter would mean a repeat of the 2012 presidential election in which Obama won a strong majority of the Hispanic vote. However, other Republicans fear that providing a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants would bolster support for Democrats from the new voters. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the ""Gang of Eight,"" told CNN's Dana Bash last week that he understands ""why conservatives are upset."" ""They've seen all these promises in the past that haven't been delivered,"" Rubio said. But the status quo on immigration ""is hurting America,"" he added.

"(CNN) -- The old deal made rough sense. The United States would provide only a very thin social-insurance cushion for people of working age, but jobs would always be available. Critics might deride the jobs as McJobs: often poorly paid, often offering scanty benefits. But better McJobs than No Jobs. To anyone who proposed tighter job protections or more generous social benefits workers came the crushing answer, ""Do you want us to be like Europe?"" While American generated tens of millions of low-wage service jobs, the economies of Europe struggled hard not to lose jobs, even during good times. The tradeoff was patiently explained by free-market economists and is by now familiar to us all. More job rules mean less jobs; fewer rules will bring more jobs. And for a quarter-century, from 1982 until 2007, the old deal held true. Wages didn't rise much, but demand for nurses' aides, fast food servers and other low-wage service workers surged and surged -- so much that for the first time since 1913, the United States again found itself welcoming a mass immigration of poor people, arriving legally and illegally from Guadalajara and Guangzhou, eager to accept America's abundant $9-an-hour jobs. Then, suddenly, the old deal broke down. It broke down as abruptly, as utterly and as seemingly irretrievably as a previous old deal broke in 1929. Mass and long-term joblessness characterize the U.S. economy of 2014 as surely as plentiful low-wage jobs characterized the U.S. economy of 15 years ago. Look at the output statistics, and the United States has recovered from the crisis of 2008. Look at the job numbers, and it seems the United States never will. What are Americans to think of and do about their new economic dispensation? One answer is to deny that the dispensation is new at all. Republicans in Congress are working to repeal the emergency job benefits put in place in 2009, on the familiar theory that if we quit paying the unemployed, they'll stop being unemployed. Extended unemployment insurance coverage lapsed on Saturday; 1.3 million long-term jobless lost benefits that day, and those still receiving benefits will lose them if they remain without work for longer than 26 weeks. Food stamp coverage has been cut once and will probably be cut again in 2014. Proposals to raise the minimum wage gain no hearing in the Republican-majority House of Representatives, whose members condemn such proposals as job-killers. Yet these familiar arguments bump into an unfamiliar situation. Almost six years after the economic collapse of 2008, the ratio of job seekers to unfilled positions -- which peaked at 5.5 to 1 -- has declined to 2.9 to 1, a ratio that would until now have indicated severe recession. The huge backlog of unemployed workers exerts downward pressure on the wages of those still working. The old employment deal seems a formula for a massive write-off of the great majority of working Americans lacking specialized skills. On the other hand, nobody seems to offer any credible new deal. Some cities and towns are experimenting with higher minimum wages. That may put money in the pockets of some workers at Wal-Mart and Starbucks. But people who can't find work at $9 won't find it easier to find work if their price is raised to $12. In a major economic address delivered in Osawatomie, Kansas, in 2011, President Obama speculated that more public-sector hiring might do the trick. But how many people can government employ? And how sustainable is it for government to raise its payroll at exactly the same time as it is also shouldering the rising costs of Medicare and Social Security for retiring baby boomers? These are questions that will dominate American politics for years to come. As the European experience of the 1990s sadly reminds us, mass prolonged unemployment is not a problem that recedes rapidly in a peacetime economy. People who have been out of work would find it hard to return to work even in a strong job market -- and this job market remains desperately weak. What we can at least do is refrain from further penalizing people whose problems nobody knows how to fix. People who can't work still must eat. Americans in distress have a claim on the rest of the nation. Extend unemployment insurance. Sustain food stamps. While we're looking for a new deal, at least quit deluding ourselves that the old deal is still operable. It's not. It has passed on, from everywhere except our increasingly outdated memories. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Mass joblessness isn't going away; wages are falling .
Frum: U.S. used to provide minimal benefits but lots of jobs, but not now .
Public-sector hiring is helpful, he says, but how many can government employ or afford?

Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor said Monday night that the ""specialized K-9s (were) flown in"" to help in the case of young Isabel Mercedes Celis, who was reported missing on Saturday morning. The dogs ""did alert on some things that caused us to go back"" to the house, said the chief. While they've described her disappearance as suspicious, local authorities have not identified any suspects in Isabel's case nor have they indicated what they believe may have happened to her. They have launched an extensive search in a 3-mile radius of the girl's home, where she lives with her parents and two older brothers, as well as contacted all registered sex offenders living nearby. Villasenor said on Monday morning that authorities had combed through the area ""at least three times now,"" with neighbor Cynthia Mort vouching that they'd ""searched inside and outside every home in the neighborhood."" The girl's small stature -- at 3 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing 44 pounds -- makes it critical to leave no stone unturned, given that she may be in any number of places. ""We ... are checking every corner, every nook and cranny that could possibly hold a child,"" Tucson police Sgt. Maria Hawke told CNN's sister network HLN on Monday . Isabel was last seen by family members when she went to bed at 11 p.m. Friday. When her father went to wake her at 8 a.m. Saturday -- a half-hour after her mother had gone to work -- he said the girl was nowhere to be found, according to police. A screen was found removed from one of the house's windows. Hawke said the missing screen ""could be suspicious"" and indicate someone broke through the window to get into the residence or get out, though she stressed ""there's nothing conclusive at this point."" Villasenor did not specify what the FBI K-9 dogs hit on, or the possible significance. He did say that, because of their reaction, authorities sought and obtained a search warrant to occupy the house. He said they asked for a warrant ""just to make sure everything is done correctly,"" not because the family at the center of the case isn't cooperating. Hawke said the family left voluntarily. ""We have asked the family if they would be willing to leave so that we can avoid any potential evidence contamination, ... (and) they have agreed to do so,"" the police sergeant said. One street away from one of Tucson's busiest thoroughfares, the Celis' home is in a neighborhood of largely middle-class, single-family residences. A fence and wall surround the yard of the house. Mort described Isabel's family as ""wonderful, caring people."" ""They are always helping, you always see them together,"" said Mort, who has lived next door to Isabel's grandparents for the past 25 years. ""They are very, very loving. I couldn't imagine anyone in this family doing anything to anyone."" She added that Isabel's disappearance has rocked the community, leaving ""everybody ... totally distraught."" ""We're just afraid to let our children out,"" Mort told HLN. ""We're terrorized.""","Isabel Mercedes Celis, 6, was reported missing Saturday in Tucson, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- As Iran's relations with the Western world seem to be thawing following a historic U.S. agreement over its nuclear production, sport is also doing its part to bring Tehran in from the cold. AC Milan, the world's most successful soccer club in terms of trophies won, sent a team stacked full of its former stars to take part in a charity match against counterparts from Persepolis FC. Thursday's game, watched by 65,000 fans in Persepolis' Azadi Stadium, was won 3-1 by the seven-time European champion. But as Iran's nuclear deal will help lift some of the economic sanctions that have hurt its growth, this exhibition has bigger meaning for Persepolis and the development of Iranian football. It is part of a collaboration that began at the end of last year when Persepolis president Mohammad Rouyanian visited Italy to meet with Milan chief executive and V.P. Adriano Galliani. Milan's website reports that the ""Rossoneri"" (""black and reds"") will be sharing knowledge of the club's successful youth academy with Persepolis -- which is Iran's most successful team and one of the most popular in Asia. ""Mohammad Rouyanian expressed his admiration for the way that the club and its proprietor made Milan the most decorated in the world,"" the website said. ""The desire to create and develop a form of collaboration between the two clubs came naturally. ""Collaboration is already underway that will see the Milan Academy help to export and replicate the Milan Model with Persepolis, which celebrates its 50-year anniversary this year."" Legendary defender Paolo Maldini headed a star-studded Milan lineup at the 100,000-capacity Azadi Stadium for a match that marked the last Persepolis appearance for former Iran captain Mehdi Mahdavikia. Mahdavikia, 36, retired this year following a distinguished career in which he appeared at two World Cups -- representing his country 111 times in all -- and spent eight seasons with German club Hamburg. The Milan team also included another of Italy's defensive greats, Franco Baresi, and his fellow World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso. Its goals came from Daniele Massaro -- part of Italy's 1982 World Cup-winning squad -- Christian Lantignotti and Stefano Eranio, while Alireza Emamifar scored for Persepolis. ""Thank you to @acmilan glorie for coming to Iran and putting a smile on the Iranian AC Milan fans :)"" one supporter wrote on Twitter.","Iranian soccer fans welcome AC Milan to Tehran for charity match against Persepolis .

"(CNN) -- A special prosecutor appointed in a controversial case of an alleged rape in Maryville, Missouri, promised on Monday to review the case ""without fear and without favor."" ""I know that this case has raised a variety of concerns in northwest Missouri, so please know this: This case will be thoroughly reviewed,"" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said. ""I can also assure you that politics, connections or any other reason you can think of will not play a role in our review of this case. It will be the evidence, as it is in every case that we review,"" she said. A judge appointed Baker as special prosecutor days after a different prosecutor, who dropped charges, said he'd request the move. The alleged victim, a teenage girl, says a teenage boy raped her when she was 14. The initial prosecutor, Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert L. Rice, has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the girl and her relatives refused to cooperate. ""There was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he said in a statement. A charge against the boy's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an iPhone was also discontinued. But the case got new life this month after The Kansas City Star featured it and CNN interviewed the alleged victim, Daisy Coleman, and her mother. Why Anonymous wants justice in Missouri rape case . After this month's reports, Rice said last week that he'd ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor. CNN does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, have chosen to go public. Both appeared on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday, one day before a planned protest in support of Daisy at the Nodaway County Courthouse. The teenager said she and her mother would probably not be going. ""We were pondering it, but it sounds almost as if it wouldn't be safe for us to go just because of all the people in Maryville being very angry with the case right now. But we are thinking about it, and we are very thankful for all the people attending,"" Daisy said. When asked what she and her daughter are hoping for, Melinda Coleman told Tapper that they just want to be heard and to have the case looked at ""fairly, and with some enthusiasm."" ""We were disappointed that they didn't really do the job. They didn't really collect the evidence, and they didn't seem to care from the beginning.

"(CNN) -- The New York City Fire Department on Thursday will graduate its most diverse class ever after decades of criticism and legal battles over the racial composition of its firefighting force. Of the 242 probationary firefighters joining the ranks, 62% are minorities. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano will preside over the ceremony. In the last 12 years, the fire department has doubled the number of minority firefighters, the city said in a statement. One year ago, a federal judge ordered New York to pay $128 million to firefighters who claimed in court that the department's entrance exam was deliberately designed to keep African-Americans and Latinos off the force. ""It is a very important step,"" said Ghita Schwarz, senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented a group of black firefighters, referring to the latest graduating class. ""It's due almost entirely to the efforts of the Vulcan Society to make sure that the tests that the fire department used were fair."" Last year's ruling followed a lawsuit that alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills. Because of the hereditary nature of the fire department, white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed. Paul Washington, a former president of the Vulcan Society, a group of black firefighters, praised racial makeup of the latest class. ""We've got to continue down this path,"" he said. ""We've been assured a more fair testing procedure. We've also made them increase their recruiting in neighborhoods of color but these have to continue... We need a commissioner and a mayor who are committed to this if we want to see a bigger number of people of color coming onto the job."" The lack of minorities in U.S. fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits. The last available national figures, from the 2000 census, show 8.4% of the nation's firefighting forces to be black and 8.6% to be Latino. Blacks are 12.2% of the population; Latinos are roughly 16%. However, other big cities have made much faster progress at diversifying their ranks. More than half of the Philadelphia and Los Angeles fire departments members are black or Latino.","New York on Thursday will graduate most diverse firefighting class in history .

"Carlsbad, California (CNN) -- Charity has always been a part of every spiritual tradition, and learning to give is an essential part of everyone's inner growth. However, charity has a dirty little secret that few of us want to face. It can fail or backfire. Our gifts can be squandered. A dollar given with compassion may wind up lining the pockets of someone who doesn't deserve it. It's a healthy sign that the public has become more aware of these drawbacks. Yet we have to be careful to ward off cynicism. To stop giving would be the wrong choice. Here's how I empower my own giving while at the same time bringing the compassionate gift closer to the right receiver. First of all, fuel an aspiration. The most hopeless people in the world aren't the poorest; they're the ones who can never fulfill even a tiny dream. As a group, women are the largest population of the helpless, so I look to help them any way I can. Invest in the future, which means directing your gift to young people. Ask for accountability. Know exactly where your money is going, and demand progress reports. Take advantage of the multiplier effect. The reason micro-financing has taken off like wildfire is that small loans to individuals to help them buy their own land or start their own businesses turn out to pay off handsomely. The businesses get started and flourish. The loans are repaid quickly and thus multiply the effect of your gift. I participate in Start Fund, started by philanthropist Fred Matser of the Netherlands. But there are now many online resources for directing your gift into micro-financing. Give generously of your spirit. If you can do this, money is secondary. Personal guidance, mentoring and encouragement happen on a one-to-one basis. If you can bring your spirit into contact with someone else's, your gift can change a life. These are simple, basic guidelines, but I believe in them wholeheartedly. I hope they come to mind the next time you get one of those annoying phone calls from a fast-talking, impersonal fundraiser who works for a cut of the money raised. There's a better way to give, and it's open to all of us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deepak Chopra.","Deepak Chopra: Giving part of inner growth, but corruption in charities makes us pause .
Don't stop giving, just be smart about it. Seek accountability; ask where your money goes .

"(CNN) -- ""Hobbit"" mania is in full swing in New Zealand this week, where all three of the Peter Jackson-directed movies based on the work of J.R.R. Tolkien were filmed. Wellington International Airport has unveiled a new installation featuring two realistic ""great eagles"" from the ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"" the second in the trilogy. The film's world premier will take place on December 2 in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Air New Zealand is showing off a new livery featuring the title character on one of its planes. The airport's new sculptures were created by Wellington's Weta Workshop -- the same team that built props and designed physical effects for ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogies. Each eagle weighs approximately one ton, with a wingspan of 15 feet. The wizard Gandalf is depicted riding on one of the eagles. ""We were thrilled to return and create another installation for Wellington Airport,"" said Weta's Richard Taylor, who oversaw the project. ""What could be more suitable for an airport in Middle Earth than Gandalf the Grey atop a great eagle swooping into the terminal, such an evocative image from 'The Hobbit' and a fantastic and challenging project for our artists to design and build."" The giant eagles appeared at the end of the previous Hobbit movie, ""An Unexpected Journey,"" and twice in ""The Lord of the Rings."" They act as aids to Gandalf and his companions, rescuing them from the bleakest of circumstances. That they're now being displayed in celebration of the upcoming film, ""The Desolation of Smaug,"" suggests that the eagles will yet play other parts in ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. The sculpture joins an existing installation featuring Gollum fishing for trout, which is suspended above the airport's food court. It's become a tourist attraction, with visitors driving to the airport just to take photos beneath it. Air New Zealand's new Hobbit livery . Over the weekend, Air New Zealand -- also working with Weta -- unveiled a new livery on one of the airline's Boeing 777-300s. The livery features the dragon known as Smaug stretched out along the plane. This is the first time the full design of the highly anticipated character has been released to the public. ""To see Smaug fly off the big screen and into the skies like this is pretty exciting,"" said director Peter Jackson in a statement. ""We're proud to debut him here in New Zealand, where our team has worked so hard to bring him to life."" Air New Zealand also recently released a new Hobbit-themed commercial starring Dean O'Gorman (Fili the dwarf) and the voice of Sylvester McCoy (the wizard Radagast), continuing its history of using the films to promote New Zealand. Last year, for the world premier of the first Hobbit film, Air New Zealand teamed up with Weta to design a Hobbit-themed livery for one of its Boeing 777-300 aircraft, which it used to transport the actors back to New Zealand and then buzz the crowds along the red carpet later with a flyby. Since the first film debuted, Air New Zealand has offered Hobbit-themed flights and put out a popular Hobbit flight-safety video using cast members and other actors in costumes. The airline is currently screening the extended edition of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" on all international flights. Capitalizing on the films' fame . Weta has long been the public face of New Zealand's movie capital, Wellington. While its main workshop isn't open to the public, an adjoining Weta Cave in the suburb of Miramar is open for visitors, offering a mini-museum and behind the scenes documentary screening, as well as movie prop reproductions for purchase. The ""Window Into Workshop"" is a separate tour that allows visitors to watch Weta artists work on art pieces, view more of the actual props used in ""Lord of the Rings"" and other films and learn about the process of creating props for the film industry. Hobbit madness doesn't stop there. Last year the city of Wellington was redecorated and temporarily renamed The Middle of Middle Earth, hosting a red-carpet event for the world premiere of ""The Hobbit"" that ran through the city. While it won't host the world premiere this year, there are still several parties and advance screenings planned around town. Meanwhile, Tourism New Zealand and Warner Brothers have teamed up for ""The Book of New Zealand"" in Hollywood, a five-day VIP publicity event to market the new Hobbit film and New Zealand as a film location destination. The large display features four reassembled film sets from the movie, and will be open to fans on December 4 only. Following its December 2 world premiere in Los Angeles, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" will open in New Zealand on December 9.","Wellington International Airport unveils sculpture of ""great eagles"" from ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug""

"San Jose, California (CNN) -- Apple, one of the most famously secretive companies in the world, is giving the public a rare peek into how it makes and markets its products. Two major Apple executives took the stand at the Apple patent trial against Samsung Friday in San Jose, California, discussing the history of the iPhone and iPad and the impact of Samsung on the company. Apple is suing Samsung for $2.5 billion, claiming it copied the design of the iPhone and iPad. Samsung is countersuing Apple for patent infringement and seeks a portion of all iPhone and iPad profits. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, and Scott Forstall, senior vice president of iOS, both talked about how the iPhone came to be, sharing some color about the device's early days. The origin stories were meant to depict the iPhone as an original, breakthrough technology and show that developing it was a risky undertaking for the company. Addressing attorney behavior . The day began with Judge Lucy Koh taking the attorneys to task for recent behavior, including ""messy"" objections and possible jury tainting. Earlier in the week, Samsung released documents to the press that the court had already decided should not be seen by the jury. ""I will not let any theatrics or any sideshow distract us from what we are here to do,"" said Judge Koh before asking each member of the jury if they had seen any of the press coverage of the case. One juror admitted to seeing headlines, but all said they could still be fair and impartial. Judge Koh promised to print out and collate every article about the case to give to the jurors when the trial is over in exchange for their cooperation in avoiding the news until then. ""We can scrapbook it for you, whatever you like,"" she promised. Remembering a secretive start . Schiller said the company was high on the success of the iPod in 2004 and trying to think of what to do next. Executives threw out many ideas: ""Make a camera, make a car, crazy stuff. We were searching for what to do,"" said Schiller. ""We all had cell phones and we all hated our cell phones,"" said Forstall, who was in charge of the iPhone's user interface and operating system. Apple was already experimenting with touchscreen tablet designs when top executives, including Steve Jobs, thought to use that technology and make a phone instead. The group began prototyping and a super-secret project was born. Jobs split the work between separate groups: hardware, design and Forstall's software group. Jobs told Forstall he could only hire existing Apple employees to work on the phone, dubbed the Purple Project, and employees were not told what they were working on or who it was for. A floor of one of Apple's Cupertino buildings was locked down tight, with security cameras and multiple badge readers. They called it the ""Purple Dorm"" and ""The Fight Club"" motto was posted on the door. ""The first rule of Purple Project is that you do not talk about it outside of those doors,"" said Forstall. Damage done . Schiller accused Samsung of ""ripping off"" the iPhone and iPad design, and said the imitations could confuse consumers and create problems for the Apple marketing team. When he first saw the Samsung Galaxy S, Schiller said he was shocked at how much it had copied Apple products. Asked what he felt when the Galaxy Tab came out, Schiller said: ""Even more shock. My first thought was they've done it again, they're just going to copy our whole product line."" Apple spent more than $647 million marketing the iPhone in the United States, and $457 million on the iPad in the U.S. It has spent money marketing the device in a number of ways, including billboards, magazines, bus shelters and product placement in movies and TV shows. According to Apple, a consumer could easily mistake the similar-looking Samsung products for an iPhone when briefly spotting it -- zipping by a billboard on a highway or in a 30-second TV spot -- and could accidentally buy a the competing gadget. Apple and Samsung products are sold at many of the same stores, including Wal-Mart, Verizon, AT&T and Best Buy. Apple is not exactly hurting for sales. The financial success of Apple's iPhone line is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend. Schiller said there was even an internal joke that ""each new generation sold was approximately equal to all the previous generations combined."" But part of that continued success is the halo effect -- customers buy their first product with a company and, when they have a positive experience, continue to buy related products and stick with the ecosystem. Schiller said losing one customer who is confused and buys the wrong device isn't about the one smartphone or tablet. That could be a lost customer for years because they would be inclined to stick with whatever hardware and software ecosystem they started in. ""I absolutely believe it's had an impact on our sales,"" Schiller said. Fighting over features . A seemingly small feature developed and then patented by Forstall's software group was the focus of much attention in the courtroom. The feature lets users double-tap on a Web page to zoom in just to an exact area of text. An early selling point for the iPhone was that it let you see the ""whole Web"" instead of the bare-bones version of the Internet phones typically accessed at the time. This type of zooming was key to making the full sites usable on the iPhone's screen. Schiller was asked by Samsung's council about the rounded corners on the iPhone, and if they were chosen because they were necessary for the phone to easily fit into a user's pocket. Samsung has argued that Apple does not have a monopoly over the rectangle-with-rounded-corners design on smartphones. Later in the day, Justin Denison, Samsung's chief strategy officer, testified that there are common industry reasons for phones to have rounded corners, including feeling more natural in the hand, fitting into pockets and withstanding drops better. Much of the case hinges on Apple's claim that Samsung imitated the design of Apple iOS products, including those rounded corners. Schiller read from internal Apple customer surveys that found a large percentage of customers cite design as a reason for choosing Apple devices. Foreshadowing . One of the more exciting e-mails put into evidence could show what's to come next from Apple. In January 2011, Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet services, forwarded Forstall, Cook and Schiller an article about switching from the iPad to Samsung's Galaxy Tab 7-inch tablet. ""I believe there will be a 7-inch market and we should do one,"" said Cue. Forstall testified that Cue had used the Galaxy Tab in the past, and it's been widely rumored that Apple is working on a 7-inch version of the iPad to be announced in September. While details about Apple's past products have been flowing, very little has emerged about any future gadgets the company may be working on. Samsung's own counsel couldn't resist trying to get secrets out of Schiller, asking the executive if the design of the iPhone 5 would be changed from the 4S. Schiller declined to comment.","Apple-Samsung patent trial brings out some secrets .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ryan Seacrest became the latest celebrity targeted by a ""swatter"" when a hoax 911 call reported armed men were shooting their way into the ""American Idol"" host's home Wednesday. When police arrived at Seacrest's Beverly Hills home at about 2:40 p.m., they found Seacrest there, but no group of armed men, a Beverly Hills police spokesman said. After speaking with Seacrest and his security team, the officers left. Seacrest joins a growing list of celebs ""swatted"" in recent months, including Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, the Kardashians, Tom Cruise, Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber. Russell Brand's Hollywood Hills home was a target Monday afternoon when a 911 caller told a Los Angeles Police Department emergency dispatcher that a man with a gun was in the house. These prank calls earned the nickname ""swatting"" because law enforcement agencies sometimes would send SWAT teams to respond to the false emergencies. In most cases, though, SWAT units are not involved. Still, officers rush to the scene with guns drawn. ""It's a very high-risk response,"" Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore told CNN Tuesday. ""The problem with crying wolf is that sometimes it's not false, so we always have to respond accordingly but cautiously."" Law enforcement agencies are ""making advances each day"" in their ability to track the calls to their origin, Whitmore said. Along with new technology, investigators have analyzed the calls to learn how to identify them. ""We're getting better at knowing what is and what isn't a hoax,"" he said. When Rihanna's Hollywood Hills home was swatted last week, the dispatcher suspected it was a hoax, so just one police patrol car was initially sent, LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. ""We figured it was a swatting,"" Smith said ""We really low-keyed it compared to how we've been."" LAPD officers are being trained on ""what to be aware of and the possibility these are swatting calls,"" Smith said. ""We're training dispatchers to be able to recognize certain distinct characteristic of these calls and maybe change the way we dispatch them so they don't draw as high a profile response.""

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel doesn't like the word ""dominance"". That would appear strange given that's exactly what he has created within the world of Formula One. At the age of 26, Vettel has won four successive drivers' titles and after claiming seven straight successive race victories last weekend, he can even afford to take his foot off the gas with two Grands Prix of the season remaining. Not that he will though. This is a man who lives to win -- even if he doesn't like the term which goes with his era of success. ""I don't like the word domination because it makes things sound easy,"" Vettel told reporters. ""If we look back through every single individual race it was very, very hard work. ""We got great results to finish on the podium on days where possibly we shouldn't have. ""It's a long season and you need to make sure that you get to your 100%. ""You can't do that all the time but I think you can get very, very close."" Vettel's win at last weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix brought him level with fellow German Michael Schumacher's record of seven successive race victories which was recorded back in 2004. With two races left on the calendar, he can match Alberto Ascari's record of nine in a row set in 1952-53 and Schumacher's 2004 feat of 13 in one season. Such success would cap another phenomenal season for Vettel, who is hoping to improve on his 37 career wins by triumphing in the U.S. and Brazil. ""When I jump into the car, I'm not thinking about what has happened before -- I'm thinking about what is going to happen in the future,"" he added. ""I'm not completely aware of what I've achieved over the past couple of years. I'm happy not to be aware. ""I love racing and it has been my dream since I was a child -- was a dream to race in Formula One. ""To be this successful, of course I'll take it and I'm very proud. But every race is a new challenge, every year is a new challenge. I'm not lacking in motivation because I know how hard it is deliver."" What is scary for Vettel's rivals is that he has no desire to slow down any time soon. Schumacher, Juan Manuel Fangio and Alain Prost have all won four drivers' titles but Vettel is the youngest to have reached such a milestone. Fangio was 45 when he took his fourth title, Prost was 38 and Schumacher was 32 -- and Vettel is already planning his next. He added: ""The next goal is the next race. I'm not trying to look too far ahead or looking back. ""You should always look forward. We had many great moments, a special moment but I believe the biggest moment in my life is yet to come. ""It would be quite sad at the age of 26 to look back and that the greatest moment had happened and have nothing to look forward to."" Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner says Vettel's ""burning desire and great natural talent"" separates him from his competitors. ""The hardest thing about being his Team Principal is slowing him down,"" Horner told CNN after being asked about working with Vettel. ""He pushes himself very hard and is hard on himself, sometimes he needs to be less so. He has a burning desire in him and a great natural talent too. ""The qualities he has -- huge inner belief, determination, a fantastic natural feel for the car and beyond all that he's a really, really nice guy. ""That's why he's so popular within the team. He wears his heart on his sleeve.""","Sebastian Vettel has won the Formula One title four years in succession .

"(CNN) -- Investigators in Vermont charged the uncle of a missing 12-year-old girl Sunday with sexually assaulting a minor -- but they said the charge does not involve his niece. Police said their investigation into the disappearance of 12-year-old Brooke Bennett uncovered evidence that her uncle had sexually assaulted someone else. Police charged Michael Jacques, 42, with aggravated sexual assault against a minor. The charge carries a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Jacques is listed as a registered sex offender in Vermont. Vermont State Police Col. James Baker said Monday that investigators are considering that there may be ""more victims of sexual abuse""  by Jacques. ""The state police would like to speak to any child or teenager who may have been in contact with Michael Jacques,"" he said. Authorities began focusing on Jacques based on information they gleaned through computer forensics, Baker said, adding, ""This case is about social networking on the Internet."" Baker would not comment about the family dynamics between Brooke and her uncle. Police have said the girl was communicating with someone on an online social networking site before she disappeared. Investigators have been examining her computer. In an affidavit, State Police Detective Sgt. William Jenkins said the girl Jacques is accused of assaulting told investigators that when she was 9 or 10, she was told -- by telephone call and in a note left under her pillow -- that she had been chosen for enrollment in a ""program for sex"" and that Jacques was to be her trainer, The Associated Press reported late Monday. According to the AP, the girl described being told that she and two other girls were in the program. ""The first who does it lives and the second gets her throat cut,"" the affidavit said. Brooke disappeared on Wednesday after visiting a convenience store in Randolph, Vermont, authorities said. A few days later, police said they found articles of clothing that they believe belonged to her. The disappearance triggered the first Amber Alert issued in Vermont, authorities said. Her father, James Bennett, has pleaded for information about his daughter. ""Obviously I'm upset,"" he told WCAX-TV, a CNN affiliate. ""We just want her home. We want her back."" Police have said they do not know whether Brooke left voluntarily with someone.","Michael Jacques is charged with aggravated sexual assault against a minor .

""An agreement has been reached with Didier Yves Drogba of Shanghai Shenhua football team, starting from the second half of 2012-2013 season for a 1.5 year period,"" the Turkish club announced on its official website. The club announced that Drogba is to be paid $13.5 million for the 18-month period, with an additional bonus of $20,000 for each match played. The forward left Chelsea for China last June, a month after helping the Londoners win their first European first Champions League title. His arrival marks the Turkish club's second significant signing this month after Dutchman Wesley Sneijder joined the 18-time champions from Italians Inter Milan. Drogba, who had wanted to go on loan to Chelsea to keep fit for the Nations Cup, is currently preparing for Ivory Coast's final Group D game against Algeria on Wednesday as the West Africans seek to win the tournament for the first time since 1992. Along with former Blues teammate Nicolas Anelka, the Ivorian failed to settle in China amid reports of unpaid bonuses, with both strikers now set to return to Europe. This is despite the fact that Anelka had agreed a two-year contract with Shenhua which reportedly earned him over $300,000 a week, while Drogba was believed to have signed an even more lucrative deal. Anelka, who is a 1998 World Cup winner, is currently in Italy as he seeks to negotiate a move to join reigning champions Juventus, which the club says will be for an initial five-month period with a view to a longer deal. ""Nicolas Anelka continued his medical ahead of a proposed transfer to Juventus,"" the club said on its official website on Monday. ""The French forward underwent a series of tests yesterday at Turin's Istituto di Medicina dello Sport and continued with further assessments this morning at the city's Clinica Fornaca di Sessant."" Now 33, Anelka briefly worked as a player-coach at Shenhua following the dismissal of coach Jean Tigana but is now looking to play in Serie A for the first time in his career. The departure of two marquee signings will represent a major blow for the standing of Chinese football, which has sought to improve its image after a number of match-fixing scandals in recent years. Founded in 1994, China's first professional football league boomed in its early years until fans fell away after a match-fixing and gambling scandal. Despite attempts to clean up the sport, one of the country's leading referees -- Lu Jun, who officiated at the 2002 World Cup -- was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail in 2012 for his role in fixing matches. During their time with Shenhua, Drogba and Anelka could only help the team finish ninth in the 16-team Chinese Super League. Recently training with his first senior team, Paris Saint-Germain in France, Anelka will boost the offensive options of the Serie A leaders, with Spaniard Fernando Llorente due to join in the summer from Atletico Bilbao. In a separate development on Monday, the Turin club was handed a series of bans and fines following the aggressive behaviour shown to referee Marco Giuda after he refused to award a late penalty in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Genoa. Coach Antonio Conte was handed a two-game touchline ban and a $13,500 fine by Serie A officials, while defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini were handed two and one-game bans respectively. Club president Giuseppe Marotta was suspended from carrying out of any his functions until 18 February for challenging the officials in an ""intimidating and insulting manner in their dressing room"". ""Juventus are fined 50,000 euros ($67,250) for failing to control fans who spat in the faces and on the clothes of officials as they left the pitch,"" added the statement by Serie A's disciplinary body.","Turkish champions Galatasaray announce deal to sign Drogba from Shanghai Shenhua .

"(CNN) -- Fannie Mae said it will set aside the loan of a woman who shot herself as sheriff's deputies tried to evict her from her foreclosed home. Fannie Mae foreclosed on the Akron, Ohio, home of Addie Polk, 90, after acquiring the mortgage in 2007. Addie Polk, 90, of Akron, Ohio, became a symbol of the nation's home mortgage crisis when she was hospitalized after shooting herself at least twice in the upper body Wednesday afternoon. On Friday, Fannie Mae spokesman Brian Faith said the mortgage association had decided to halt action against Polk and sign the property ""outright"" to her. ""We're going to forgive whatever outstanding balance she had on the loan and give her the house,"" Faith said. ""Given the circumstances, we think it's appropriate."" Residents of Akron have rallied behind Polk, who is being treated at Akron General Medical Center. She was listed in critical condition Friday afternoon, according to Akron City Council President Marco Sommerville. U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, mentioned Polk on the House floor Friday during debate over the latest economic rescue proposal. ""This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world,"" Kucinich said after telling her story. ""This bill fails to address the fact that millions of homeowners are facing foreclosure, are facing the loss of their home. This bill will take care of Wall Street, and the market may go up for a few days, but democracy is going downhill."" Neighbor Robert Dillon, 62, used a ladder to enter a second-story bathroom window of Polk's home after he and the deputies heard loud noises inside, Dillon said. ""I was calling her name as I went in, and she wasn't responding,"" he said. He found her lying on a bed, and he could see she was breathing. He also noticed a long-barreled handgun on the bed, but thought she just had it there for protection. He touched her on the shoulder. ""Then she kind of moved toward me a little and I saw that blood, and I said, 'Oh, no. Miss Polk musta done shot herself,' "" Dillon said. He hurried downstairs and let the deputies in. He said they told him they found Polk's car keys, pocketbook and life insurance policy laid out neatly where they could be found, suggesting that she intended to kill herself. ""There's a lot of people like Miss Polk right now. That's the sad thing about it,"" said Sommerville, who had met Polk before and rushed to the scene when contacted by police. ""They might not be as old as her, some could be as old as her. This is just a major problem.""  Watch Polk's neighbor describe what he saw » . In 2004, Polk took out a 30-year, 6.375 percent mortgage for $45,620 with a Countrywide Home Loan office in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. The same day, she also took out an $11,380 line of credit. Over the next couple of years, Polk missed payments on the 101-year-old home that she and her late husband purchased in 1970. In 2007, Fannie Mae assumed the mortgage and later filed for foreclosure. Deputies had tried to serve Polk's eviction notice more than 30 times before Wednesday's incident, Sommerville said. She never came to the door, but the notes the deputies left would always disappear, so they knew she was inside and ambulatory, he said. The city is creating programs to help people keep their homes, Sommerville said. ""But what do you do when there's just so many people out there and the economy is in the shape that it's in?"" Many businesses and individuals have called since Wednesday offering to help Polk, Sommerville said. ""We're going to do an evaluation to see what's best for her,"" he said. ""If she's strong enough and can go home, I think we should work with her to where she goes back home. If not, we need to find another place for her to live where she won't have to worry about this ever again."" For his part, Dillon hopes his neighbor of 38 years can return to her home. ""She loves that house,"" he said. ""I hope they can get her back in. That would make me feel better because I don't know what they're going to put in there once she leaves."" He said the neighborhood is declining because so many people have lost their homes. ""There's a lot of vacant houses around here. ... Now I'm going to have a house on my left and a house on my right, vacant,"" he said. ""That don't make me feel good, because we were good neighbors, we trusted each other, and we looked out for each other. ""This neighborhood is shot, to me, from what it used to be,"" he added. ""When I moved here, if it were like it is now, I would have never moved here. But it was a nice neighborhood. ... ""I'll just tough it out. I'm too old to start thinking about buying another house."" Sommerville said that by the time people call for help with an impending foreclosure, it's usually too late. ""I'm glad it's not too late for Miss Polk, because she could have taken her life,"" Sommerville said. ""Miss Polk will probably end up on her feet. But I'm not sure if anybody else will.""

"(CNN) -- Police have detained a man in his 70s at Montreal airport after a suspicious item was found in his luggage for a flight to Los Angeles, authorities said. The item discovered wasn't an explosive but a part of a potential device, said Montreal Police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere. The detained man is known to police, Lafraniere said, but not for anything related to terrorism. Police searched the other passengers and their luggage, looking for a possible accomplice, the police commander said. But none was found. Authorities then began searching the man's home and car, he said, seeking ""anything that will make us understand what's going on."" During the time it took police to secure the area around the man's home, about 20 people were evacuated from the area. They have all since been allowed to return.","Police: The suspicious item is part of a potential device but not an explosive .

"(CNN) -- Three major U.S. airlines on Saturday confirmed that pilots were complying with Chinese government demands that it be notified of plans to traverse the newly declared air defense zone over the East China Sea. The demands from Beijing have resulted in tensions with Japan and the United States. On Saturday, United, American and Delta airlines told CNN that its pilots were following Washington's advice and complying with Beijing's ""air defense identification zone."" A senior official in U.S. President Barack Obama's administration said Friday that commercial airlines are being told to abide by Beijing's instruction, even if the U.S. government doesn't recognize it. ""We ... are advising for safety reasons that they comply with notices to airmen, which FAA always advises,"" the official said. Japan resists Chinese demand . Two major Japanese airlines have refused to comply with China's declaration. The Japanese government said Saturday it has asked the International Civil Aviation Organization to address China's designation of the new defense zone, the Kyodo News Agency reported. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said the government's proposal at an ICAO meeting Friday in Canada called the Chinese zone a threat to aviation safety, Kyodo reported. Kyodo said Australia, Britain and the United States supported the proposal, with China opposed. Fears of unintended consequences . The latest U.S. advice to comply with the defense zone requirements reflects fears that the back-and-forth between the two sides could have unintended consequences involving not just opposing troops, but innocent civilians as well. It's a subtle change from two days earlier, when the State Department said ""the U.S. government generally expects that U.S. carriers operating internationally"" comply with other countries' mandates, rather than directing them to. OPINION: China's balance between sovereignty and stability . Last Saturday, China announced the creation of the zone over several islands it and Japan have both claimed. The two countries have been sharply at odds over those isles, which are believed to be near large reserves of natural resources. Tokyo rejected the new zone, as well as Beijing's insistence that aircraft entering it identify themselves and file flight plans. They were joined by South Korea and Washington, with Secretary of State John Kerry saying the move would ""only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident."" Since then, there's been no backing down. On Friday morning, for instance, China scrambled fighter jets after U.S. and Japanese military aircraft entered its disputed air defense zone, according to a Chinese military official. U.S. military flights 'not changing' Col. Shen Jinke, a Chinese air force spokesman, said in Beijing that the two U.S. and 10 Japanese aircraft were targets of monitoring in the zone. He said the Chinese air force and navy were identifying and monitoring all foreign warplanes in the zone. A U.S. military official told CNN that at least one U.S. unarmed military aircraft and several Japanese military aircraft flew through the zone Friday without incident. The official said the U.S. flight was part of scheduled routine operations. ""This is status quo,"" the official said. ""We are not changing what we are doing. We are not trying to make a point with China. We fly U.S. aircraft daily in international airspace in the region. This is normal."" The official said the aircraft were not B-52s, though the United States did fly two of those type of planes through the zone Monday as part of what the Pentagon described as a preplanned military exercise. South Korea said its military sent a plane on a routine patrol flight into the zone on Tuesday without alerting China. A South Korean Defense Ministry official said such flights are carried out twice a week and would continue despite China's declaration. Can China keep up the monitoring? U.S. officials said they did not know how China would be able to monitor the flight zone, given its lack of midair refueling capability and limitations of its early warning radar aircraft. ""It is indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace, and also to make sure that its territorial integrity, its sovereignty, are safeguarded,"" Liu Jieyi, China's ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters Tuesday. ""This is a normal arrangement."" Why China's new air defense zone has incensed neighbors . On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy offered a different view: ""Unilateral actions like those taken by China, with their announcement of an East China Sea air defense identification zone, undermine security and constitute an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea,"" she told reporters in Tokyo. ""This only serves to increase tensions in the region."" Japan and China have a lot at stake in maintaining their delicate relationship: Last year, trade between the two countries totaled more than $333 billion, according to the Japan External Trade Organization. CNN's Ray Sanchez, David Simpson and Kevin Wang contributed to this report.","Administration had advised airlines to comply with Beijing demand .

"(CNN) -- The Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor will shut late next year and be decommissioned, its owner announced Tuesday, citing low prices for natural gas and high operating costs. ""This shutdown decision was made because this asset is not financially viable,"" owner Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee LCC said in a statement. The 40-year-old plant, which employs 630 workers, is in Windham County on the Connecticut River, near the border with Massachusetts. During decommissioning, a process that could take decades to complete, fuel will be transferred to storage, Entergy said. Entergy said decommissioning is expected to cost $566 million, but its decommissioning trust contains $582 million. The plant's boiling water reactor, made by General Electric, uses river water as a cooling source and is licensed to operate through 2032. Vermont Yankee had been the subject of a battle between state authorities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over its GE-designed containment housing known as the Mark 1, one of 23 such reactor housings in the United States. That was the design used at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where three reactors melted down after the station was struck by the tsunami that followed an earthquake in March 2011. The disaster resulted in the widespread release of radioactive contamination that forced more than 100,000 people from their homes. Japan fed up with 'whack-a-mole' approach to Fukushima . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to shut reactors using the GE Mark I containment. Japan will need decades to clean up after Fukushima Daiichi, the world's worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986. The U.S. nuclear industry hasn't built a new reactor since the 1970s. But on February 9, the commission approved two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. The reactors differ from those at the GE plants at Fukushima Daiichi and in the United States. National Energy Institute President and CEO Marvin Fertel called the closure ""a great loss to the state of Vermont, the regional economy and consumers and the environment."" But the Vermont plant's finances have dimmed in recent years, as widespread drilling for shale gas has lowered the price of natural gas. A 2008 post that is still on Entergy's website predicted that ""the continued operation will result in over $2 billion in additional income for the residents of Windham County and the state of Vermont as well as increased tax revenues for the state in excess of $300 million in today's (2008) dollars."" At the time, Vermont Yankee was supplying nearly a third of the electricity used in the state. But the company said Tuesday that it had spent more than $400 million in operating costs since 2002. ""The announcement today by Entergy that it will shutter the troubled Vermont Yankee reactor is the latest -- but certainly not the last -- domino to fall for the failing U.S. nuclear power industry,"" said Mark Cooper, a senior fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School. He noted that Tuesday's announcement follows the August 1 announcement by Duke Energy that it is abandoning its reactor project in Levy County, Florida, and that the French-subsidized nuclear giant EDF was pulling out of the U.S. nuclear power market ""due to the inability of nuclear power to compete with alternatives and the dramatic reduction in demand growth caused by increasing efficiency of electricity consuming devices."" He cited the recent closures of four other nuclear reactors: two at San Onofre in California and one each at Kewaunee in Wisconsin and Crystal River in Florida. ""What we are seeing today is nothing less than the rapid-fire downsizing of nuclear power in the United States,"" he wrote. ""It is important to recognize that the tough times the U.S. nuclear power industry faces today are only going to get worse."" After Chernobyl, complexity surrounds local health problems .

"(CNN) -- While tragedy envelops the families of the injured and dead in New York's Metro North train derailment, the train's operator could be facing a crisis of his own from criminal charges, if compelling evidence supports them. Although such charges are difficult to prove in accident cases, this one may prove to be an exception to the rule. It is the kind of high-profile case involving multiple deaths and many injuries that will undoubtedly attract the careful scrutiny of the prosecutor in charge: Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson. Even at this early stage of the investigation, it would appear that a determined prosecutor could find adequate evidence to support an indictment. New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a former prosecutor himself, made it clear he believes law enforcement will look into the engineer's actions, and that the derailment was related to ""excessive speed and reckless handling of the train."" He focused on the investigators' assessment that the train was traveling at least 82 mph through a sharp ""deadman's curve,"" which requires a speed of 30 mph for the safety of the train and its passengers. ""I wouldn't be surprised if criminal agencies looked into the facts of the matter once they're fully developed,"" Cuomo said. Should these facts prove to be accurate, the framework of a criminally negligent homicide prosecution begins to emerge from the twisted rubble on the Hudson River. Under New York law, criminally negligent homicide can be charged in cases where death is caused by acts of grossly negligent or reckless conduct. New York characterizes these charges as criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter or ""depraved indifference murder,"" depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. The penalty for these crimes increases exponentially as the degree of negligence escalates to killing with ""depraved indifference"" to human life. The depraved indifference murder charge carries essentially the same penalty as a deliberate and intentional murder, usually known as ""Murder One"" in other states. Unlike civil cases, in which the only penalty is the award of money damages, criminal liability for a homicide based on gross negligence, recklessness or ""depraved indifference,"" can result in substantial prison sentences, ranging from a year-and-a-half to life. For this reason, the standard or proof required to prove such charges is quite rigorous. Certainly operating a commuter train at such an excessive speed would easily constitute either reckless or grossly negligent conduct. Historically, New York courts have required more than a single act of negligent conduct before upholding a very serious charge like criminally negligent homicide. In most cases in which the charge of criminal negligence or recklessness is upheld by appellate courts, a defendant must exhibit at least two forms of negligent conduct in the commission of the crime. For example, in drunken driving prosecutions for criminally negligent homicide, cases are often based on the claim that the defendant was not only drunk but was also speeding or ignoring other traffic laws when the person was killed. (In Mr. Rockefeller's case, blood tests for alcohol were negative.) But it's possible that the prosecution could meet this high standard if investigators find evidence that Mr. Rockefeller was not only speeding at 82 mph when entering the dangerous curve, but was also operating a train while inattentive or impaired. That is similar to running a red light or a stop sign because of inattention -- the law does not grant a waiver for the failure to perceive an obvious risk. His own lawyer's surprising admission that Mr. Rockefeller was driving a train while dazed or ""zoned out"" could constitute yet another form of gross negligence -- at the first sign of such a condition, prosecutors will argue, a reasonable person exercising due care for the safety of his passengers would have stopped the train and radioed for assistance. Even if the engineer avoids a criminal indictment, he will most certainly be involved as a witness or a party in many civil lawsuits filed by the victims and their families. Both he and Metro North officials will have to fight claims of negligence in the training and monitoring of railroad personnel. They will also have explain to the families of those whose loved ones perished on a routine commute to New York City why this happened when technology has long existed to stop an out of control locomotive from speeding into a dangerous curve. Rockefeller's real worries, however, should be focused on possible criminal charges. In November of 1992, 39-year-old New York Subway motorman, Robert Ray, was sentenced to 5 to 15 years in prison for the reckless manslaughter of five subway passengers in a derailment caused by speeding. He was drunk, however, and had walked away from the accident. He served 10 years. A robbery suspect who ran over a nun while fleeing police in a minivan was convicted of murder in yet another example of reckless homicide while operating a vehicle in New York. The National Transportation Board's findings are not yet in. But if the investigation finds the accident was not related to track conditions or a terrible mechanical problem, but was because of human error, the defense will have to prove the existence of something that struck him suddenly and unexpectedly -- or Mr. Rockefeller could soon be traveling ""up the river"" in handcuffs toward a new residence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Callan.","Paul Callan: Train operator could face charges if evidence supports criminal negligence .
Callan: Criminally negligent homicide very difficult to prove, but possible in this case .

"(CNN) -- Filipinos are used to typhoons. I grew up in the Philippines knowing it has two seasons -- the ""wet"" and the ""dry."" More than 20 typhoons whip through the Philippines in a year. I could smell the rain when it was coming. I knew that if the moon had a ring around it, there would be rain the next day. I knew that the excited twittering of birds also meant rain was coming. At a young age, I could gauge just how strong the typhoon was, not only based on the storm signal warnings, but on how thick and dark the clouds were, how heavy the rain fell, how strong the wind blew. It became instinctive to know how dangerous a storm was. In Cebu City, where I grew up, a siren would blow the warning signals when a typhoon was approaching. Storm Signal No. 1 meant rain and some wind, but we still went to school. No. 2 meant stronger rain and wind. We were excused from school, but it was safe enough to go to the movies or to a friend's house. We would also listen to announcements on the radio. We knew a storm was coming, but the radio news gave us an inkling of its severity. We took Storm Signals Nos. 3 and 4 seriously and stayed indoors because it meant the rain and wind were very powerful. The streets would flood; branches of trees could break; trees could be uprooted, corrugated metal roofing could come loose and fly about, electric power lines could break. It was dangerous to be outside. We stayed home with canned goods, water, candles and matches, because it was a given that electricity and telephones would be cut off during typhoons. We waited out the storm in the safety of our homes. That's how it is; that is what the Filipinos expect and do when a storm is coming. Even before the Western media started focusing on super typhoon Haiyan, I'd been following the news on the Internet. Friends in Cebu, Philippines, who had just been battered by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake last October 15, were giving me a blow-by-blow account as they hunkered down and waited for Haiyan. After the super typhoon passed, someone jubilantly e-mailed, ""We survived."" Facebook pictures were posted of the damage in Cebu City, which didn't look too bad: Streets littered with debris, trees uprooted, cars flipped over on their sides, some roofing damaged, store signs askew. And so for a few hours at least, a sense of relief washed over me -- until a friend received a text message from the parish priest of Odlot in Northern Cebu: . ""Church no more roof and ceiling. 95% of parishioners homeless. We need help. Food and water."" Deep inside, I had known that a country can't get away unscathed when a super typhoon like Haiyan hits it, and the text from Father Desuyo brought me back to reality. As communications resumed, the world understood the awful destruction that Haiyan had wrought in Samar, Leyte, Northern Cebu, and other parts of Central Philippines. It has been painful to see images of villages destroyed, of people wandering around in the midst of all the rubble, of survivors holding up signs begging for food and water. What I find most nerve wracking are the pictures of the dead lying by the roadside or under rubble. Filipinos have much respect and love for their dead, and so these images indicate just how desperate survivors are that they can't take the time to bury their loved ones. I can't help but wonder what went so wrong. Why were Filipinos caught off guard? Why didn't the government plan better for Haiyan -- or Yolanda, as the super typhoon is called in the Philippines? Why have so many people died? Why are survivors left on their own? I have no doubt that the survivors and victims of Haiyan had done their part: Like they always have, they had stocked up on basic necessities and hunkered down in the safest place they could think of. But here's the thing: Even though Filipinos knew that Haiyan was the strongest typhoon in recorded history to make landfall, they did not have the collective memory of something this powerful. No one expected the great destruction of Haiyan. No one expected its 15- to 20-foot tsunami-like surge. Here's the irony: Many people died in the evacuation centers or gymnasiums or churches where they sought refuge, from drowning and from the buildings collapsing. Here's a fact: The death toll will rise because the Philippines has 7,100 islands, and in those islands, many coastal villages have not yet been accounted for. Now, Haiyan will never be forgotten. The super typhoon is part of the Filipinos' collective memory, when before, it was unimaginable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cecilia Manguerra Brainard.","Cecilia Brainard grew up in the Philippines; where people deal with about 20 typhoons a year .
She says Signal 1 meant rain and some wind; 2 was no school, 4 was hunker down .
Everyone took shelter as usual, she says, but Haiyan was beyond anyone's experience .

"(CNN) -- Since March 11, the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Here is the latest on the status of each reactor and what was being done to prevent further emissions of radioactive material. Reactor No. 1 . Pressure and temperature levels at the No. 1 reactor continue to fluctuate, though Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency told reporters Friday that the situation then appeared ""rather stable."" While conceding that ""controlling the temperature and pressure has been difficult,"" Nishiyama said there were indications that the pressure and temperature were both decreasing. Authorities hope to begin injecting fresh water, rather than seawater as has been done, into the reactor's spent nuclear fuel pool. According to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, a nuclear industry group basing its data on official government and utility information, the No. 1 unit's reactor core has been damaged, but its containment vessel was not. As of Friday, the reactor's cooling systems were still not operational. Still, the building was ""severely damaged"" by an earlier hydrogen explosion. While electricity issues remain, lighting has been restored for this and the No. 2 reactors. Reactor No. 2 . Like with No. 1, there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the No. 2 reactor -- though not as high as that of the No. 3 unit. Nishiyama said Friday that authorities hope to start injecting fresh water (rather than the current seawater) into the reactor's core and spent nuclear fuel pool. The water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material. Damage is ""suspected"" in this unit's containment vessel -- the only such vessel so compromised, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. The reactor's core is also thought to be damaged. But the building itself has only been ""slightly damaged,"" the same group reports. That said, the containment vessel pressure is considered ""stable,"" the nuclear industry trade group reports. Reactor No. 3 . The water that three men stepped in while laying cable in the basement of the No. 3 unit's turbine building had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for that locale, Nishiyama said. The workers -- each of whom tested 170 or more millisieverts of radiation, including two with direct exposure on the skin -- were admitted Friday for four days of observation at Japan's National Institute for Radiological Sciences, a research hospital in Chiba. He noted that the contamination likely came from the reactor's core, adding there's a possibility of ""some sort of leakage."" That potentially could come from a crack in the reactor core, though Nishiyama cautioned that there is no definitive answer yet on how the radioactivity got into the basement. Despite the suspected damage to the reactor core -- something that isn't presumed at any of the other five reactors -- the nuclear safety official said there is evidence that pressure is somehow being maintained in the vessel, making it less likely there is a big gash. ""Radiation levels are high"" in some locations in and around the reactor, Nishiyama said. These issues, including the radiation in the water, are prompting authorities to consider ""other routes"" to address issues at the reactor without exposing workers to excess radiation. Nishiyama said that, as of Friday afternoon, there was no firm plan on workarounds. Firefighters from Kawasaki, with assistance from the Tokyo fire department, sprayed water Friday on the No. 3 reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool. The building of the No. 3 reactor was ""severely damaged"" after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas, reports the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. Its core reactor is also damaged, its fuel rods are either partly or fully exposed. As to its nuclear spent fuel pool, reports are that the pool was ""possibly damaged"" and the water level has been low -- a reason for the repeated spraying. Reactor No. 4 . A concrete pump truck was used once again Friday to inject seawater into the unit's fuel pool. Along with the Nos. 5 and 6 units, the No. 4 was offline on a scheduled outage when the earthquake hit, and as a result the reactor's water level and pressure are continued safe. But its nuclear spent fuel pool was ""possibly damaged,"" which is why authorities have said its water levels are low and why they've made repeated efforts to fill it up with seawater. Reactor No. 5 . The No. 5 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum. As with units Nos. 4 and 6, this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself. The nuclear spent fuel pool is thought to be functioning, aside from continued concerns about powering its cooling system to ensure that the fuel rods contained within remain cool. As with unit No. 6, three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion. Reactor No. 6 . The No. 6 unit appears safe, for now, Nishiyama said. Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.

"(CNN) -- Skeletal remains found near an Arizona campground are believed to be those of a missing 2-year-old, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. Sylar Newton was reported missing July 25 from the Beaver Creek Campgrounds in Rimrock. Authorities said last week that the boy was presumed dead as they announced the launch of a criminal investigation into his disappearance. The remains were found Tuesday afternoon at the bottom of a wash less than two miles from the campground, the sheriff's office said. The office said the remains ""likely came to rest in this area due to recent flash flooding."" ""At this time, the remains are believed to be that of Sylar Newton, but final confirmation is still pending,"" the sheriff's office said. Sylar was last seen shortly after midnight July 24, sleeping in a tent with his family at the campgrounds. About 1:45 a.m. July 25, the family noticed that he was missing from his sleeping bag. ""The sheriff's office believes Sylar did not wander from the campground and he is presumably dead,"" Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told a news conference last week. ""The search effort is now in a recovery mode and the investigation has become criminal in nature."" Sylar was camping with his custodial mother, Christina Priem, and her children, when he disappeared. Priem has said she was in the process of adopting the boy from his biological mother. Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said last month that ""there's no evidence"" that the planned adoption played a role in his disappearance, ""but until we've exhausted every lead, all possibilities are being investigated."" About 25 other people were at the campground the night of Sylar's disappearance -- all of whom have cooperated with investigators, according to the sheriff's office.","Sylar Newton was reported missing from a campground July 25 .

"(CNN) -- Violence surged in the strategically important Syrian town of Qusayr on Sunday. Activists said the offensive marked some of the most intense fighting they've seen in the fiercely contested area near the Lebanese border. Rebels and the Syrian government both claimed to control parts of the city, where fighting has been raging for weeks. Activists said artillery shells, mortar shells and bombs from aircraft were raining down as government forces attacked. Makeshift medical clinics were reportedly filled with casualties. By all accounts, Qusayr is in a strategically valuable location. For rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad's government, it sits along a transit route for weapons and supplies coming in from Lebanon. For the Syrian government, it's a key point between the capital of Damascus and al-Assad's supporters on the Mediterranean coast. Videos posted on social media Sunday show the city blanketed with black and gray smoke amid an almost continuous stream of sounds of mortar and artillery fire. Dozens of people were killed in the clashes, including 48 rebel fighters, the London-based opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Hundreds of people were injured, many in critical condition, the opposition organization said. Syrian state-run television reported that Syrian forces ""have spread safety and security after taking control of the city hall and surrounding buildings in Qusayr as they continue to chase the terrorists in the city."" The opposition Local Coordination Committee of Syria denied that report. ""The field commanders in the Free Syrian Army stress that they remain in control of the city and are fighting back attempts to storm the city,"" the opposition activist network said in a statement. Activists describe a city under siege . Qusayr has been under rebel control for months. The opposition accused Hezbollah fighters from neighboring Lebanon of joining Syrian government troops in the assault on the city, a claim that al-Assad's government has disputed in the past. The Shiite militant group is considered a terror organization by the U.S. government and is a traditional ally of al-Assad as well as Iran. The Free Syrian Army said it fired rockets from Qusayr across the border into northeastern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah areas. The official Lebanese news agency said eight rockets landed in Hermel. Activists in Qusayr said the city was under siege Sunday from several directions. ""There is continuous shelling using artillery, mortar and warplane bombs,"" activist Abu Ali said. ""It is so intense, like 50 shells a minute."" Residential areas were hit, said Abulhoda Homsi, another activist. The opposition Syrian National Council warned that 40,000 civilians' lives were in danger amid the violence and called for the Arab League to hold an emergency meeting to protect the besieged city. The United Nations estimates that more than 70,000 Syrians have been killed since anti-government protests in March 2011 led to a fierce government crackdown, an armed uprising and a civil war with no end in sight. At least 125 people were killed across the country Sunday, the Local Coordination Committees reported. How to end the civil war in Syria . The voice of Assad . In an interview with Argentine journalists on Saturday, Assad said Syria can solve its own problems. ""It isn't up to the United States or any other country to intervene,"" the Syrian president told Argentina's Telam news agency. ""This is an issue that is Syrian. We are an independent state. We respect ourselves. We don't accept anyone telling us what to do -- not the U.S., not any other country."" Assad asserted he's dealing appropriately with people he calls ""terrorists."" ""Nobody has dialogue with the terrorists. Terrorism has hit the United States and Europe. By any chance, did any of these governments talk to terrorists? One talks with political entities, but not with a terrorist who cuts people's throats, assassinates people and uses chemical weapons,"" he said, ignoring allegations that his own government has very likely used chemical weapons on Syrian citizens. Massive flight . The Syrian civil war has uprooted a quarter of the country's civilians, according to the United Nations. The number of Syrians who have fled the violence has surpassed 1.5 million, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday. Since the start of 2013 alone, the UNHCR has registered close to 1 million refugees crossing out of the battered nation into other countries, which amounts to about 250,000 people each month. Along with the refugees, more than 4 million people have been internally displaced. Syria has a population of just over 22 million, according to the CIA World Factbook.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of African migrants cram into Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, calling for a labor strike. Their chants fill the air, summing up their message: ""We need asylum."" Activists estimate more than 50,000 migrants work illegally in low-paying jobs in Israel. Many are fleeing persecution from war-torn areas like Sudan and Eritrea. The threat to their lives pushes them to undertake the dangerous journey via smugglers' routes to Israel. A vast majority cross the Sinai Peninsula, known for being a hotbed of kidnapping and organ harvesting. Once across the border in Israel, they try to claim asylum. ""All of us are fleeing genocide, fleeing dictatorship regimes. Looking for protection,"" says the African Refugee Development Center's Mutasim Ali, who came to Israel from Darfur. ""(A migrant) doesn't care where he gets it. We know it's too difficult to cross the border making our way to Israel, but that's the only option at the time."" The asylum seekers complain that the Israeli government isn't viewing their goal as legitimate, but rather sees them as migrant workers. ""The Israeli government leaves them in limbo from one side. The Israeli government calls them infiltrators, that they came here for work and that they are all criminals,"" says Orit Marom of ASSAF, Aid Organization for Refugees and Asylum Seekers. ""On the other side, they never check their asylum requests."" The Israeli government refers to the asylum seekers as illegal migrants who are in the country to work. They blame them for an increase in crime and say they threaten Israel's internal security. The government says it is increasing the number of security personnel to combat the crime. They are also giving refugee seekers willing to voluntarily return to their home countries a cash incentive of $3,500. But if that doesn't work, then the government says they'll deport them. ""We are determined to deport the tens of thousands of illegal migrants who are here after having reduced the number of illegal labor migrants who enter Israel's cities,"" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last November during his weekly Cabinet meeting. ""The steps that we unanimously approved today are proportionate and necessary for maintaining the Jewish and democratic character of the state and will restore security to Israel's citizens while upholding the directives of the High Court of Justice and international law."" Basow Ibrahim gave up being a rebel in Sudan's Nuba Mountains over a year ago. While fighting the Khartoum government, he said, he realized there was more to life. ""I'm here because I want to protect myself. I want to save my life,"" Ibrahim said. ""I want to finish my education."" Ibrahim's story is similar to that of many refugee seekers. They say they plan to return home to their families and friends once the threat to their lives is gone. Until that day comes, they say they hope Israel will keep them safe by granting them asylum.","African migrants call for a labor strike in Tel Aviv .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan began dumping thousands of tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean on Monday, an emergency move officials said was needed to curtail a worse leak from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In all, about 11,500 tons of radioactive water that has collected at the nuclear facility will be dumped into the sea, officials said Monday, as workers also try to deal with a crack that has been a conduit for contamination. The radiation levels were highest in the water that was being drained from reactor No. 6, the officials said. These are the latest but hardly the only challenges facing workers at the embattled power plant and its six reactors, which have been in constant crisis since last month's ruinous earthquake and tsunami. Officials with Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, proposed the release of excess water that has pooled in and around the Nos. 5 and 6 reactors into the sea. But most of the dumped water -- 10,000 tons -- will come from the plant's central waste treatment facility, which will then be used to store highly radioactive water from the No. 2 unit, an official with the power company said. The water in reactors Nos. 5 and 6 is coming from a subdrain and wasn't inside the building itself, officials said. Tests suggest that groundwater is the source of the contamination in these two units, but they are not certain. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano called the dumping ""unavoidable."" The liquid was most likely contaminated in the process of trying to cool nuclear fuel rods. The scope of the dump was staggering. ""For an idea about how much is 11,500 tons, one metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds, which is close to an English ton. Water is about 8.5 pounds per gallon, so one ton is about 260 gallons,"" said Gary Was, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan. ""So 11,500 tons is about 3 million gallons. A spent fuel pool holds around 300,000 gallons. So this amount of water is equivalent to the volume of roughly 10 (spent fuel pools)."" It could take 50 hours to dump all the water, Tokyo Electric said. The dumping of so much radioactive water into the ocean conjures up fears of mutated sea life and contamination of the human food chain, but experts said the radiation will be quickly diluted, minimizing risk. ""To put this in perspective, the Pacific Ocean holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water and they're going to release about five swimming pools full of water. So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly,"" said Timothy Jorgensen, chair of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""It's a considerable amount of water, but the immensity of the Pacific Ocean will quickly dilute this amount of water to harmless levels,"" he added. John Till, president of Risk Assessment Corp., similarly cited the vastness of the ocean in helping to minimize harm, and said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life, even close in to the plant. However, he said officials should continue to monitor the radiation levels closely. ""What we have to watch is how these materials accumulate in food products and then could be consumed by people,"" Till said. The build-up of water could cause problems around the nuclear facility, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, Edano said Monday. Authorities have made a priority of dealing with water from the No. 2 unit, some of which has been gushing into the sea through a crack in a concrete shaft. ""The radioactivity level is very high near the No. 2 reactor, and we know this. We have to stop the leak as early as possible to prevent this from going into the sea,"" Edano said. ""The radioactivity level is much less in the water from the Nos. 3 and 4 units."" Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency officials said Monday night that the hope is that pumping out the No. 2 reactor turbine plant will lower the water level enough that contaminated liquid won't be able to reach the sea. ""I am not able to say for certain whether or not this will be the last discharge, but we certainly would like to avoid releasing any such water into the sea as much as possible,"" agency spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said. Officials were still awaiting test results to confirm the water pouring into the ocean is leaking from the highly radioactive No. 2 reactor. ""We don't know clearly, but we feel it is somehow leaking from Unit 2,"" Nishiyama said. Even if the water is confirmed to have come from the reactor, neither Tokyo Electric nor government officials know how it is making its way from the reactor to the leaking pit, he said. Once the water is pumped out of the waste treatment reservoir, the agency believes it can safely transfer the water from the basement of the No. 2 turbine plant to the reservoir without further leaks, he said. Though Japanese officials say the water being discharged is less radioactive than the water now leaking into the sea, its top concentration of radioactive iodine-131 is 20 becquerels per cubic centimeter, or 200,000 becquerels per kilogram. That's 10 times the level of radioactivity permitted in food. But since it's being dumped into the Pacific, it will be quickly diluted, according to Dr. James Cox, a radiation oncologist at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center and a CNN consultant. Reactors No. 1 and No. 3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well. Tokyo Electric's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks, including some that still need to be set up. Attempts to fill the 20-centimeter (8-inch) crack outside the No. 2 reactor's turbine building -- on Saturday by pouring in concrete, then Sunday by using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper -- were not successful. As officials mull other ways to cut off the leak at its source, workers will install a silt fence along a damaged sea wall surrounding the plant, Nishiyama said. The aim of this screening, usually used to halt erosion at construction sites, is to prohibit the spread of radioactive particles into the sea. Workers also have injected a dye tracer into the water to allow them to track the dispersal of such particles, the spokesman added. Addressing the issue quickly is critical because officials believe it is a source of alarmingly high radiation levels in seawater near the plant, as well as in nearby groundwater. Complicating the situation is the fact that, in some cases, authorities don't even know how much radiation is getting out. After some high-profile errors, little new information on water, ground and air radiation has been released since Thursday. One reason is that the dosimeters being used don't go above 1,000 millisieverts per hour, said Junichi Matsumoto, an executive with Tokyo Electric. Authorities know the water in the cracked concrete shaft is emitting at least that much radiation -- which equates, at a minimum, to more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year. Plugging the external leak is job one, in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the Pacific. But it may not be the most difficult, or important, task ahead. Authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place. The water had to come from somewhere, potentially traveling across melted-down nuclear fuel in the reactor's core before somehow reaching the outside. ""We were assuming and hoping (that water) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled,"" Nishiyama, the nuclear safety official, said Sunday. ""However, it may have flowed into the building, and then the trench."" Determining why and how that happened -- and what to do about it -- may be ""exceptionally challenging,"" said physicist James Acton, with the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment think tank. Officials may have to inspect a complex array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment inside the containment buildings. The state of the Nos. 5 and 6 units is another new problem. Water in their turbine buildings' basements threatens the power supply for the system used to cool nuclear material in these units' spent fuel pools, Edano said. This makes it imperative to pump out that water, which will end up into the sea like that from around the Nos. 3 and 4 units. ""Though those reactors are stable at the moment, the growing water level in the turbine houses may disturb their stability,"" he said. The effort to keep the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactor cores and spent fuel pools cool took a step forward Sunday, when the electricity source powering those three units' cooling systems was switched from a temporary diesel generator to a more permanent, external power supply, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency's website. Authorities hope this step, as well as preventing damage to the Nos. 5 and 6 units' power supply, will help to minimize the prospect of any more radiation that might contaminate tap water or food. Farmers have pushed for lower standards on radiation in food, calling them unnecessarily stringent. On Monday, Edano said these limits would not change, even as he outlined a process in which sales restrictions on certain crops, in certain areas, would be lifted if they test safe three times in a row.

"(CNN) -- The FBI is investigating an arson fire at the Chinese consulate in San Francisco, an incident that has China's diplomats calling on the United States Thursday to ""take all measures to provide adequate protection."" There is no indication the fire was an act of terrorism, FBI spokesman Peter Lee said. According to a statement released by the consulate, footage from surveillance cameras shows the fire began Wednesday night after a person emerged from a parked mini-van, poured two buckets of gasoline on the front door of the consulate and ignited it. ""We strongly condemn this despicable attack,"" Wang Chuan, the consulate spokesman, told reporters during a news briefing outside the consulate. ""We urge the U.S. side to take all necessary measures to provide adequate protection for Chinese consular personnel and properties.""

"Washington (CNN) -- All eyes were on the problem-plagued Obamacare website Monday after the administration said it would smoothly handle most users following its botched launch two months earlier. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that 375,000 visitors went to HealthCare.gov by 12 noon ET, almost half the total daily capacity of 800,000 that officials announced Sunday as a result of a round-the-clock effort to fix the site. However, Carney provided no details about how many of those visitors were able to sign on and enroll in insurance exchanges set up under President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms. A new function created in the latest technological overhaul completed Sunday put people trying to sign up in an online waiting queue if capacity exceeded demand. They could wait until their turn came to enter the system, or ask to receive an e-mail when they could try again at the front of the line. Three CNN journalists who attempted to sign on Monday ended up in the new queue around midday and then two hours later. Their wait lasted a few minutes before they received a prompt on their screen to proceed with enrollment. Later in the day, users proceeded directly to enrollment without waiting, indicating reduced volume at the end of the afternoon, as officials had predicted. Having declared the site working as intended on Sunday, the administration effectively painted a target on it for detractors led by conservative Republicans, who will look for any anecdotal evidence of continued problems with the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The Republican National Committee wasted no time Monday, distributing a list of media reports that noted administration officials warned people to expect continued glitches with the problem-plagued online portal. ""President Obama and his administration repeatedly claimed the Obamacare website would be fully functioning by the end of November, but this has proven to be just another broken promise,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. ""The Obama administration had over three years to build HealthCare.gov, and all they've produced is a non-functioning website, wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars."" Administration: We met the website deadline . Obamacare site fix: 5 things to look for . Carney made clear more glitches were likely in coming weeks and months, arguing that any major website has periodic problems that must be addressed. ""It does not mean that there will be no problems with the website going forward,"" he said when asked by reporters if HealthCare.gov was truly fixed or merely functioning at a minimal level. To Carney, the bottom line was that as of Monday, ""more people are visiting the site and are able to effectively go from beginning to end"" compared to the unsuccessful launch in October and through November. On Sunday, officials announced they had met their self-imposed November 30 deadline for getting the site working for the ""vast majority"" of users, saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased. Jeffrey Zients, a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch, compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on-ramp from two lanes to four. That means chronic breakdowns, error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared, he said, noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system's ""uptime"" -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90%. It all means that HealthCare.gov can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day, according to Zients. Upgrades, trouble-shooting, and old pizza . In a commentary in USA Today, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius advised consumers to try the website in off-peak hours -- mornings and evenings on weekdays or else on weekends -- and noted the new feature for times of high demand ""that allows users to opt to receive an e-mail when it's a better time to come back."" She emphasized that consumers have time to sign up, with a December 23 deadline to get coverage that starts on January 1 and a March 31 enrollment deadline to avoid a financial penalty for not having insurance in 2014. Back-end problems remain . Insurers: Site glitches persist . Meanwhile, insurers warn that more work is needed on the ""back-end"" functions of the website that process payments and provide enrollment information to the companies. ""Insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information,"" Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement to CNN. ""In some cases they are not getting the enrollments at all."" The administration chose to stress the positive on Monday with a statement saying November enrollment figures on HealthCare.gov were expected to be higher than the previous month. An administration official familiar with the matter told CNN that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month alone on the site. The official cautioned the number was preliminary and final numbers would be released in mid-December. Joanne Peters, a Health and Human Services spokeswoman, said enrollment through alternate channels and successful exchanges in 14 states would help bolster November figures. In October, the first month of a six-month enrollment period, just over 106,000 people signed up for Obamacare. Less than 27,000 of them did so through the HealthCare.gov website, which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal. Initial enrollment figures lower than hoped . Website progress garners muted reaction from Congress . Marilyn Tavenner, the official charged with implementing Obamacare as director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of November. The overall enrollment target by March 31 is 7 million. A properly functioning HealthCare.gov is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage. In theory, the law would create large pools of younger, healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more. The program must convince younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they don't think they need. To GOP opponents, the law needs to go. They focused on canceled coverage for some individual policy holders as an example of how Obama and Democrats failed to fulfill a pledge that people could keep health insurance they liked. GOP Obamacare playbook: Spread negative perception . ""This isn't just about a broken website, it's about a fundamentally flawed law,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, while conservative Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Monday the administration lied to the public about the health care reforms and other issues. ""That's the one thing I find most aggravating about what's happening in Washington these days, particularly about this administration, which is a lack of accountability and the willingness to mislead people or provide them just demonstrably false information and expect to be able to move on,"" Cornyn said during a Google Hangout online conversation. CNNMoney: Premiums influenced by state roles . Another Republican attack line -- that people are paying more for their health care under Obamacare, despite Obama's claim that costs would go down -- may depend on where they live, according to a CNNMoney report. In Oregon and Maryland, state regulators challenged the premiums that insurers wanted to charge for Obamacare policies, forcing the companies to lower their rates, said the report by CNN's Tami Luhby. But in states like Florida and Texas, regulators took a hands-off approach, allowing premiums that insurers filed to sail through. Like most things Obamacare, the treatment was infused with politics, with several states run by Democrats more active and public about negotiating with insurers while some GOP-led states disassociated themselves from the process. Rate reviews by states have proved effective in lowering premiums, according to a study last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The average rate allowed after a review was 2.6 percentage points lower than the average rate initially requested in the individual market, though there was a wide variation between states. ""If states were more aggressive in reviewing rates, you saw more of a decrease,"" said Cynthia Cox, policy analyst at Kaiser. Obama: People do think I'm trustworthy .

"(CNN) -- A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the state attorney's office believes there were two motives in the home invasion murder of Florida couple Byrd and Melanie Billings -- robbery and a contracted hit. Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, is believed to be the organizer of Byrd and Melanie Billings' deaths. The Escambia County Sheriff's Office had said it believed robbery was the prime motive, but that it would explore all avenues. The source said the state attorney's office is working under the belief that most of the suspects in the case thought they were there for a robbery, but that Leonard Gonzalez Jr., the alleged organizer of the crime, and other yet-unnamed suspects were plotting a hit on the couple. The source said that from ""Gonzalez down"" it was a robbery and that from ""Gonzalez up"" it was a hit. The source was not sure of the motive behind the hit. The Escambia County Sheriff's Office has said it believed robbery was the prime motive, but that it would explore all avenues, a position Sheriff David Morgan reiterated Friday night. ""We are, in fact, looking at this,"" Morgan said. ""We want to ensure the citizens of Escambia County that we are not in any way, shape or form of the imagination taking that possibility or probability off the table in the conduct of the Billings murder."" Morgan said that early in the investigation, investigators had ""uncorroborated information that would lead a reasonable person to believe that this was an avenue of the investigation that we should in fact pursue."" He added, ""We have and will continue to do that very thing."" ""I want the citizens of Escambia County to understand that this investigation will go where it goes, and anyone who aided or abetted in the commission of this crime will be brought to justice,"" the sheriff said. Greg Marcille of the Escambia County Office of the State Attorney did not deny that investigators were considering a contracted hit, but said his office believes ""that the prime motive was robbery."" ""We will consider all possibilities and review any evidence that is brought forward regarding the issue of motive in this case,"" he said. The Billingses, who were known for adopting special-needs children, were killed during a robbery at their Beulah, Florida, home July 9. A small safe containing prescription medication, family documents and some jewelry was taken, and later found in the backyard of a woman who said she was a friend of Gonzalez, authorities have said. Two sources familiar with the investigation told CNN that a second safe at the home contained at least $100,000. Eight people have been arrested in the case. Seven are facing murder charges and one is accused of being an accessory after the fact. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said Gonzalez once worked for a car dealership Byrd Billings owned, and court documents state that Gonzalez received financial support from the family for a martial-arts studio that he ran. An attorney representing the Billingses has said that Byrd Billings made a nominal donation to Gonzalez's karate charity. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: Escambia County sheriff says theory is not off the table .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney won all three of Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, putting more distance between himself and his closest contender, Rick Santorum, who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of Pennsylvania and beyond. Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates. Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters. Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama. ""This has really been quite a night. We won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America,"" Romney said. He continued his criticism of Obama's economic polices and what he repeatedly called Obama's plan for a ""government centered society."" ""There is a basic choice that we're going to face: The president has pledged to transform America, and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises."" The former Massachusetts governor is expected to take the majority of Wisconsin's 42 delegates and Maryland's 37 delegates, with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally. He will take all 16 delegates at stake in the District of Columbia. Counting partial allocations for Wisconsin and Maryland, and full allocations for D.C., Romney has collected 648 delegates since the primary and caucuses began in January, according to CNN estimates. That's more than twice the 264 delegates Santorum is estimated to hold. Gingrich and Paul trailed well back. GOP delegate count | Delegate calculator . With 93% of the vote reported in Wisconsin, Romney had 42% and Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had 38%. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas had 12%, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 6%. In Maryland, with 75% of the vote reported, Romney had 49%. Santorum had 29%, Gingrich had 11% and Paul had 10%. In the District of Columbia, with 99% of the vote reported, Romney had 70%. Paul had 12% and Gingrich had 11%. Santorum was not on the D.C. ballot. Maryland results | D.C. results . Pre-primary polls appeared to show Wisconsin's contest was the only one Tuesday that Santorum had a chance to win. And analysts said Wisconsin might be Santorum's final chance to slow Romney's march toward the GOP nomination. Wisconsin exit poll | Maryland exit poll . But Santorum told supporters in Mars, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime, with only roughly half the available delegates awarded. ""Pennsylvania and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard, and we're going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months,"" Santorum said. Santorum, who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than Romney, also warned supporters that the Republican Party often has fielded moderate Republicans against incumbent Democratic presidents, only to see the moderate Republican lose. He appeared to raise Ronald Reagan, a conservative who defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, as an example for a way forward. ""If we're going to win this race, we can't have little differences between our nominee and President Obama. We have to have clear, contrasting colors,"" Santorum said. ""... Time and time again, the Republican establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the Republican Party and people across this country moderate Republicans because, of course, we have to win by getting people in the middle. There's one person who understood we don't win by moving to the middle. We win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward."" President Barack Obama, meanwhile, clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday with primary wins in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, CNN projected. Unlike the Republicans, Obama faces no serious opposition in his race. According to CNN's delegate estimate, the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party's nod before Tuesday's contest. He is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in Maryland and D.C., as well as the 100 delegates at stake in Wisconsin. On the Republican side, since Romney's double-digit victory in Illinois two weeks ago -- followed by a wave of some of the Republican Party's major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle -- the conversation seems to have changed: the GOP front-runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee. Wisconsin exit polls show that endorsements might have helped Romney. About 60% of respondents said the Romney endorsements were a factor in their votes, and 33% called them an ""important"" factor. Most of those voters broke for Romney. CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley reported that Romney's campaign was prepared to spend ""a lot of money and a lot of candidate time in Pennsylvania,"" where polls show Santorum's once-large lead has shrunk. Santorum's campaign points toward May, which looks friendlier for him. He could be the favorite in primaries in North Carolina and West Virginia on May 8, Nebraska on May 15, Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22 and Texas a week later. But it could be too little, too late by May. Sen. Hillary Clinton won most of the final contests against Sen. Barack Obama in the marathon 2008 Democratic presidential nomination battle. But in the end, it didn't matter. And Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said that while he believed that Santorum earned the right to fight through Pennsylvania, the race was all but over. ""I think the writing is on the wall. Does Rick Satorum want to read it is the question,"" Fleischer said. Romney and Obama on Tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to November's general election, with Romney blasting the president during a campaign stop in Wisconsin and Obama mentioning Romney in a speech for the first time this year. Speaking at a restaurant in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Romney suggested Obama wants to duck responsibility ""for what's happened in this country,"" saying the president should get full credit or blame for ""what's happened in this economy, and what's happened to gasoline prices under his watch."" ""It is time to have somebody who will take responsibility, and if I am president, I will not only get things right again, I will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the White House again where the buck will stop at his desk,"" Romney said, while standing with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a prominent Wisconsinite who endorsed Romney. Later Tuesday, Obama mentioned Romney while slamming a House-passed budget proposal that Ryan drew up and Romney embraced. Obama, speaking at a media luncheon in Washington, said the plan, which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs, was ""thinly veiled Social Darwinism"" and ""antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who's willing to work for it."" ""One of my political opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,"" Obama said. ""He said that he's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don't often hear when it comes to describing a budget."" While Romney is far ahead of Santorum, Gingrich and Paul in the hunt for delegates, exit polls have indicated Romney still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party. That continues to fuel Santorum's campaign, in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the Republican establishment and liberal media bias. As in previous contests, Wisconsin's early exit polls showed Romney doing better among higher-earners and Santorum better with lower-income voters. Among exit-poll takers making $100,000 to $200,000 annually, Romney led 55%-30%, with Santorum winning the under-$30,000 voters, 44%-34%. The Wisconsin exit polls showed Santorum is more popular in rural areas and Romney in urban areas in Wisconsin. According to the exit polls, Santorum was winning the rural vote, 37%-27%, and Romney was winning big-city voters, 43%-23%. About 24% of the vote in Wisconsin came from urban areas and 22% from rural areas, according to the exit polls. The rest is suburban. Wisconsin's primary was open to any registered voter in the state, regardless of party. Exit polls showed that 58% described themselves as Republicans, 30% said they were independent and 12% said they were Democrats. Santorum was doing best among self-described Democrats with 32% of their vote, while Romney had 22% and Paul had 16%.

"(CNN) -- Think you use your phone to look at Facebook a lot? Unless you're doing it at least 14 times a day, you're actually below average. That's just one of the surprising revelations in a research report by IDC released Wednesday. The study tapped 7,446 iPhone and Android users in the U.S. between 18 and 44 — representative of the 50% of the population that uses smartphones — and asked them questions about their phone usage across one week in March. Depending on your perspective, many of the results are either depressing or confirm what you knew all along. For example, it seems that 79% of smartphone users reach for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up. A clear majority — 62% — don't even wait 15 minutes, and grab their phones immediately. (Among 18- to 24-year-olds, the numbers rise to 89% and 74%.) Given that the survey was sponsored by Facebook, most of the questions focus on the social network. Which is, it seems, only the third most popular app on your smartphone, after email and the browser. Still, 70% of smartphone users are frequent Facebook visitors, with more than half of them checking it every day. Peak Facebook time is during the evening, just before bed. But any time's good: on average, we visit the Facebook app or the site 13.8 times during the day, for two minutes and 22 seconds each time. Our average total daily mobile time on the site — and remember, this is just via our smartphones — is half an hour. That's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating; it's only slightly less time than we spend texting. On weekends, we check Facebook more than we text. Any place seems to be good to check Facebook, too. Some 46% of us check it when we're shopping or running errands; 48% use it at the gym. Even preparing a meal gives 47% of us no respite from the social network. (Well, what else are you going to do while you're waiting for the microwave to ping?) Perhaps the most unpardonable sin: 50% of smartphone users admit to checking Facebook while at a movie. We hope they mean only during the ads. So what are we spending all that time doing? Well, for about half of that daily half-hour on the social network, we're simply browsing our News Feed. The rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between Facebook messaging and posting updates. Half of Facebook users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day. Does the smartphone survey ring true to you? Share your thoughts in the comments. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Logan Stevenson's role as best man at his parents' wedding Saturday came just in time. Logan, a 2-year-old terminally ill boy whose parents moved up their ceremony so he could witness it, died Monday night at his home in Jeannette, Pennsylvania, with family at his side, Westmoreland County Deputy Coroner John Ackerman said Tuesday. The child died of complications from the genetic disorder Fanconi anemia, Ackerman said. On Monday, Logan's parents, Christine Swidorsky and Sean Stevenson, held him for long periods after it became apparent that his death was near, his mother wrote on Facebook. ""At 8:18 my son took his last breath in my arms,"" the mother, now known as Christine Swidorsky-Stevenson, wrote Monday night. ""Im so sad upset and im in disbelief he is with angels and he's in no more pain. no more sickness no more hospitals."" The parents had put off their wedding for two years, hoping that Logan's health would improve. The wedding was set for July 2014, but after being told that Logan had just weeks to live due to leukemia brought on by the Fanconi anemia, his parents moved their wedding to Saturday. ""Under the circumstances of what the doctors told us, we just decided to go ahead and do it while he is still with us,"" Stevenson told CNN Pittsburgh affiliate KDKA. On Saturday, Logan, dressed in a tan suit and an orange shirt matching his mom's bouquet, looked on as his parents exchanged vows in a backyard ceremony. Swidorsky carried her son down the aisle, and his grandmother then cradled him in her arms, his favorite brown teddy bear by his side. ""This is our dream come true, all our family together, and we're all together celebrating. The celebration of my son's life and the celebration of our marriage,"" Swidorsky said, as Etta James' ""At Last"" played in the background. Whirlwind wedding allows dying tot to be best man for parents . Swidorsky said she often described her son as a fighter. He battled through health complications and medical treatment since birth, but remained strong. Fanconi anemia most frequently results in death, commonly from cancer, between the ages of 25 and 30. Funeral arrangements for Logan, who left behind two older sisters, are being made in Jeannette. CNN's Joseph Netto, Chuck Johnston, Leslie Holland, and Jacob Robinson contributed to this report.","Logan Stevenson's parents were married Saturday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- 'Tis the season to publish those year-end predictions. Forecasting in any form -- from a sideshow psychic to the Magic 8 Ball -- is usually a foolish enterprise. So this is not a crystal ball gaze at the newsmakers that will make the headlines next year. These are the individuals I will be watching from CNN's Hong Kong newsroom and in the field in 2014. 1. The June 4 protester . June 4, 2014 will be the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. In 2013, tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents braved a rainstorm to hold a vigil in the city's Victoria Park to honor the victims and express anger at Beijing. Though such protests are banned in mainland China, the vigil is an annual event in Hong Kong, a self-administered region under Chinese sovereignty. Twenty-five years after the crackdown, how many more in Hong Kong will observe this major anniversary? And how will Beijing respond? 2. The NSA leaker . OK, this is a cheat. I'm not closely following Edward Snowden himself. Honestly, I don't care about where he's pushing a shopping cart in Moscow. What I do care about are the yet-to-be-released leaks that will further reveal the size and scope of surveillance efforts by the U.S. National Security Agency. Incredibly, Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger says they have published just 1% of the files leaked by Snowden. In the year ahead, I'll be looking out for the revelations yielded by the rest of the damning data dump. 3. Xiaomi's new hire . Hugo Barra made headlines in August when he ditched Google for Xiaomi. The big hire was a big moment for the Chinese smartphone maker, raising expectations that the so-called ""Apple of China"" would greatly expand its market reach beyond its domestic market. Since then, Xiaomi has announced plans to launch next year in Southeast Asia. With Barra on board, can Xiaomi's inexpensive and highly customized Android smartphones find as much favor abroad as at home? 4. The Marshal . North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, remains as perplexing as ever. Why did he execute his former trusted mentor and uncle Jang Song Thaek? Why did he release American veteran Merrill Newman? And why the soft spot for former NBA star Dennis Rodman? After a year of puzzling and provocative moves -- including missile and nuclear tests -- The Marshal has forced the world's attention on him, raising concerns of more brinksmanship to come. 5. The typhoon survivor . In the immediate aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan, a CNN crew encountered Juvelyn Taniega on the devastated streets of Tacloban -- the capital of the Philippine province of Leyte. She was crouched among the rubble of what was her home, where she last saw her husband and six children alive. In 2014, we must remember the victims of Haiyan because after the emergency relief, comes the long task of recovery and rebuilding. We must remember Juvelyn Taniega and the scores of survivors like her.","CNN's Kristie Lu Stout takes a look at 5 people who could shape 2014.

"(CNN) -- When European explorers were planting their flags all over North and South America, they referred to the territory as the ""New World."" That was a misnomer. For while the Americas might have been ""new"" to the Europeans, they weren't new on the world timeline. Things were happening in the Western Hemisphere a long, long time ago, as the sites on this list (a very small sampling) demonstrate. Some you might know already; others might come as a surprise. Many of them are sites of active archaeological research that continues to unearth new examples of very interesting old stuff. 15 ancient ruins you might not know . Tiwanaku, Bolivia . Theorists have explained Tiwanaku as everything from a temple complex built by nomads to the work of an extraterrestrial society. Its truth is only slightly less extraordinary, and it tantalizes with questions of why and how a city of temples, public buildings, homes, streets and irrigation systems was built at 13,000 feet above sea level in the Altiplano of the Bolivian Andes. Between 500 and 900 A.D., the Tiwanaku civilization numbered in the hundreds of thousands. By 1200, they were gone. Archaeologists continue to study the site, even constructing reed boats to demonstrate how stones weighing several tons might have been transported from one shore of nearby Lake Titicaca to the other. You'll need imagination to picture Tiwanaku as it was; a visit during the winter or summer solstice celebrations can enhance its mystical qualities. Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada . About 75 million years ago, western Canada was part of an island continent called Laramidia, and this 30-square-mile expanse of badlands was populated by creatures great and small. Sounds like the start of a fantasy novel, but it's a dream come true for anyone fascinated by dinosaurs. UNESCO adds 19 sites to World Heritage List . Since the turn of the last century, when paleontologists began working here in earnest, the park has yielded thousands of prehistoric remains, including hundreds of complete dinosaur skeletons from the Late Cretaceous Period. At the park you can join in or observe current fieldwork. There are activities for families and kids, guided and self-guided tours, and sunset excursions for photographers. To see more specimens recovered from the park, visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, two hours away. Tikal, Petén, Guatemala . With its five towering pyramids, probably built between 250 and 900 A.D. (ongoing research regularly revises the dates) and situated to correspond with the position of the sun, Tikal is the site by which other Mayan archaeological sites are measured, both in scope and significance. Tikal National Park also encompasses Uaxactún -- once a separate city -- as well as nearly 55,000 acres of rainforest that add to its beauty and mystery. The Petén Region in northern Guatemala continually yields archaeological discoveries from the Maya, such as the stunning frieze found in Holmul earlier this year. The murals at San Bartolo are under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage site status. In neighboring Honduras, is the Mayan site of Copán -- founded by a splinter group from Tikal. Monte Albán, Oaxaca, Mexico . Monte Albán is a marvel of urban planning, especially when you consider that the Olmecs -- and later the Zapotecs -- who built it did so by carving its terraced landscape out of the mountainside. And they began construction sometime around 500 B.C. It was built to be grand, from the ceremonial pyramids to the stadium surrounding the ball court, and because it's so impressive Monte Albán tends to be heavily visited today. The most famous artifacts are the series of Olmec carved stone slabs known as Los Danzantes (The Dancers) because it was originally assumed they depicted dancing men. Current scholarship says they depict disemboweled prisoners of war, which would be strange, yet in keeping with the unusual artistic sensibilities of the Olmecs. Parque Museo La Venta, Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico . It's hard to know what to think about the Olmecs. They practiced ritual human bloodletting and raised dogs that they subsequently ate as part of their regular diet. On the other hand, they're probably responsible for introducing chocolate to the world. They also left a wondrous legacy of carved stone sculptures, especially the enormous stone heads for which they're known. Many Olmec sculptures discovered at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán in Veracruz and at La Venta in Tabasco -- Olmec settlements dating back to 1200 B.C. -- have been relocated to museums where they're more accessible for public viewing. You'll find more than 30, including three 20-ton heads, at Parque Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. The 16-acre park is known for its tropical foliage and for the dramatic sound and light show that illuminates the sculptures at night. Chan Chan, Peru . Machu Picchu is the most widely known archaeological site in Peru, the Nazca Lines are arguably the most mysterious, but Chan Chan, located about three miles from Trujillo, deserves mention because while its past is documented, its future is uncertain. The capital of the Chimú culture, Chan Chan probably dates back to before 850 A.D. At its peak in the early 1400s it had a population of 30,000 before the Inca came and wiped it all out. What remains of the huge earthwork city is still astounding -- networks of beautifully carved and sculpted adobe walls delineate enclaves devoted to work, worship and family life. About five square miles of the Chan Chan site is on the UNESCO World Heritage list, but even UNESCO can't stop the wind and weather from slowly eroding Chan Chan. Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site, Collinsville, Illinois, United States . Cahokia Mounds looks like a grouping of giant lumps in the earth -- hills where no hills should be, built by the Mississippian culture more than 1,000 years ago. The largest is 100 feet high and bigger than the Great Pyramid of Giza at its base. Around it once stood wooden houses and plazas where people gathered for ceremonies that involved a potent concoction called Black Drink and competitions in a vigorous sport called chunkey. Inside the mounds, archaeologists have found a wealth of objects including unexpected specimens like shark's teeth carried from the Gulf of Mexico to western Illinois in some way yet to be determined. In fact, much of what went on at Cahokia is still undetermined, including why this thriving community -- the oldest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico -- disappeared in the early 14th century. Rock Art of the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, Texas, United States . Around Comstock, Texas, where the Pecos River meets the Rio Grande, acres of unremarkable terrain hold a remarkable surprise: cave paintings (pictographs) and carvings (petroglyphs) made by the prehistoric hunter-gatherers who lived here thousands of years ago. They're not especially easy to reach, which has been their salvation, having left them largely unmolested throughout the centuries. Recently archaeologists have been working to raise awareness of the sites in order to catalog, preserve and protect them. Guided tours at Seminole Canyon State Park take you on a rigorous 1.5-mile hike to the Fate Bell Shelter. Other tours conducted by members of the nonprofit Rock Art Foundation visit sites located on private land. Panther Cave and Parida Cave in the Amistad National Recreation Area near Del Rio are accessible by boat.","Things were happening in the 'New World' a long, long time ago .

"(CNN) -- He had grand plans on how to rebuild his broken land, but Haitian President Michel Martelly can't even get over the first hurdle: forming a government. Haiti's parliament rejected Tuesday the new president's pick for prime minister, Daniel Rouzier, sending Martelly back to the drawing board. Meanwhile, it has been more than six months since Haitians first went to the polls to vote for new leadership after last year's devastating earthquake. Martelly, a former pop star, nominated Rouzier, an entrepreneur who also helped lead a Christian charity in Haiti, on May 20. Many Haitians had expressed hope the pair would be a jolt of fresh energy. After days of hearings and required documentation, 42 members of the Assembly of Deputies voted against Rouzier's nomination, while 19 deputies voted for him and three abstained, the Agence Haitienne de Presse news agency reported. Those who opposed Rouzier questioned his allegiances for his appointment as honorary consul for Jamaica and alleged that the millionaire businessman -- his family owns a car business in Port-au-Prince -- had failed to pay proper taxes. The latter charge made longtime observers of Haiti laugh aloud. Who in Haiti has ever been honest about that, asked Jocelyn McCalla, a Haitian-born political strategist and human rights expert. The real problem, he said, seems to be more of a political stalemate between Martelly, who appealed to the masses for his political novice, and veteran politicians who are perhaps resentful of that. ""The legislature is flexing its muscle in anticipation of the battles to come with Martelly,"" McCalla said. And that, said McCalla, does not bode well for an impoverished nation struggling to recover from the enormous setback it suffered last year. Haiti was the most worsened nation on this year's index of failed states released this week by the Fund for Peace in Washington. ""The process of rebuilding Haiti is essentially stalled,"" McCalla said. That process has already been painfully slow for the Haitian people. Tens of thousands of Haitians continue to live in makeshift camps; rubble still soars high on some streets -- schools, hospitals, roads, houses have yet to be rebuilt. Frustration with a lack of progress contributed to defeat for former President Rene Preval's party. At first, Preval's protege, Jude Celestin, was named the No. 2 vote getter in the November election. But after charges of widespread fraud and weeks of review, Martelly won that spot and a right to face former first lady Mirlande Manigat in a March runoff. By then, Haitians were anxious to get a new government installed and get on with the task of piecing their nation back together. Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor and publisher of the New York-based newspaper The Haitian Times, said Preval stocked parliament with his own people. And they are likely to challenge Martelly on every move at the expense of Haiti, he said. ""How do you govern in that situation?"" Pierre-Pierre asked. ""There's so many compromises you can make.

"Washington (CNN) -- Use any metaphor you like -- predators smelling blood, invaders storming the castle, a snowball growing in size and momentum as it rolls downhill. All describe efforts by opponents of President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms to kill the 2010 law after the botched launch of the HealthCare.gov website provided a new opening for attack. Critics led by conservative Republicans target the Affordable Care Act itself, not just the website woes, in hopes of creating a public groundswell of opposition. ""Obamacare is much more than a bad website; it's a bad law,"" says a House Republican playbook for GOP members to follow in the campaign. The document obtained from a Republican source Thursday by CNN lays out a strategy of talking points, videos, op-eds and social media outreach intended to spread as negative a perception of the health care reforms as far and wide as possible. Obama regularly complains about such search-and-destroy tactics, telling business leaders Tuesday that ""one of the problems we've had is one side of Capitol Hill is invested in failure."" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Thursday that the GOP playbook lacked ""a single word devoted to helping constituents enroll or offering an alternative idea to help Americans gain access to qualify, affordable care."" ""This is a partisan political strategy that hasn't worked in the past, and it's not going to work now,"" he said. For Republicans, the goal is to bolster GOP prospects in next year's congressional elections by vilifying the health care reforms and making them the main campaign issue. Holding their House majority and winning back the Senate from Democratic control next year would increase leverage for weakening and perhaps even dismantling the reforms they despise as government overreach run amok. President and Obamacare sink to new polling lows . At every opportunity, Republican leaders cite effects so far -- including canceled policies, higher premiums and limited options for some -- as evidence that the dysfunctional website merely foreshadowed what they call an incurably flawed law. When the Affordable Care Act passed with no Republican votes more than three years ago, ""reasonable minds perhaps could have differed on whether Obamacare would work,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told CNN on Wednesday. ""Today, that's not possible,"" said Cruz, the tea party favorite who spearheaded the GOP fight against the reforms that led to the 16-day government shutdown in October. ""In my view, coming together to stop Obamacare is the essence of pragmatism because it is self-evident this isn't working."" Keeping the pressure up . Cruz and his GOP colleagues plan to maintain that focus. The Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold ""field hearings"" in four states in coming weeks that will focus on consumer complaints about Obamacare. Friday's initial event in North Carolina is titled ""ObamaCare Implementation: Sticker Shock of Increased Premiums for Healthcare Coverage."" In particular, Republican opponents lambast Obama for his ""if you like your policy, you can keep your policy"" pledge of past years that proved untrue for what could amount to several million Americans who bought their own insurance instead of getting coverage through employers or government programs. While affecting less than 5% of the population, the cancellation notices to individual policyholders became a symbol of oversell by the President and Democrats that Republicans now exploit by citing public mistrust in the government. The 17-page House GOP playbook obtained by CNN includes specific instructions for legislators to solicit personal stories from people losing policies or forced to pay more under Obamacare. ""In this playbook, you'll find messaging tools to help you communicate in your district about the disastrous Obamacare rollout,"" it says. Talking points in the document cite information from the House Ways and Means Committee that stress worst-case scenarios predicted so far, such as at least 7 million Americans losing employer-provided health insurance in coming years because of the reforms. Digital fliers the playbook provides quote television comedians joking about the dysfunction of the HealthCare.gov website when it launched on October 1. It is all designed to create a perception of total public rejection of the health care reforms to pile on recent polls that show already shaky support for Obamacare declining further, along with support for the President. Obama accepted responsibility for the dysfunctional website that stymied the October 1 launch of the vital new insurance exchanges for people to shop for coverage, as well as the failure of the reforms to better protect individual policy holders getting cancellation notices. He framed the issue as facing expected challenges in trying to reform a failing health insurance system that left more than 40 million people without coverage and millions more lacking adequate policies. ""There have been times where I thought we were kind of, you know, slapped around a little bit unjustly. This one's deserved, right? It's on us,"" Obama told reporters last week. ""But, we can't lose sight of the fact that the status quo before the Affordable Care Act was not working at all."" Presidents and Democrats: What's your counterproposal? The President and Democrats complain that Republicans intent on eliminating Obamacare lack any serious proposals to help the uninsured get coverage and address the broader problem of bringing down overall health care costs, a goal of the reforms. In a report released Wednesday by Jason Furman, Obama's new head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, the administration claimed health care spending from 2010 to 2013 grew at the lowest rate on record since 1965. While House Republicans have voted more than 40 times to repeal or otherwise undermine Obamacare, specific GOP proposals offer limited approaches, such as allowing insurers to offer health policies across state borders. In addition, Republican leaders don't mention benefits of the reforms such as ending denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions as well as limits on total benefits. Instead, they frame their stand as protecting consumers facing higher costs and forced changes by the overhaul. Bad news for woman cited as Obamacare success story . ""We're going to continue to do oversight so that we understand exactly what's happening out there. Our members are going to continue to collect stories,"" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters Tuesday, adding that there was ""no decision"" on specific steps Republicans might take. ""But we're going to do everything we can to try to protect the American people from this awful law."" For his part, Obama also says the goal is to protect Americans, with the reforms providing coverage to people previously unable to afford it or determined ineligible by insurers to get it. He emphasizes in every public pronouncement on the reforms that they already have ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions, provided free preventive screening for millions, eliminated caps on total benefits and brought other much-needed changes for consumers. ""I'm not going to walk away from 40 million people who have the chance to get health insurance for the first time,"" the President said last week. ""And I'm not going to walk away from something that has helped the cost of health care grow at its slowest rate in 50 years."" Shoring up the HealthCare.gov website . For now, the administration continues work to get the HealthCare.gov website functioning well enough by the end of November for most users to complete the enrollment process in a timely manner. The enrollment period extends until March 31, and officials believe there will be time to reach the goal of about 7 million enrolled by then to make the new exchanges economically viable. Blocked out at www.HealthCare.gov? Bypass on way soon, feds say . Democrats, including Obama administration officials, concede that failure to get the website working properly soon will mean major trouble for the reform law. For now, they declare their support for Obamacare, setting it up as a crucial campaign issue in 2014. ""While Republicans continue to fixate on sabotaging health reform and root for failure, House Democrats will continue to stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act, work to strengthen the health reform law as implementation continues, and ensure that millions of uninsured Americans get coverage,"" said a statement Thursday by Drew Hammill, a spokesman for House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. The Republican National Committee already is taking up the challenge. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus held a news conference Thursday to assert that Democratic candidates were more likely to shun the health care reforms than embrace them. ""It looks like any Democrat in a serious reelection fight is neither eager nor proud to run on Obamacare,"" Priebus said, adding that opposing the reforms was ""nothing to be ashamed of"" and that he was ""proud to take the position that we are against Obamacare, that we want to repeal Obamacare, and that it's bad for America.""

"(CNN) -- ""To This Day"" had a very small beginning. The poem itself was written in 2009 after rereading a series of notebooks I had written in as a child. I'm fortunate enough to have a grandmother who never throws anything away, and one day, she returned a series of journals I had kept. I didn't pay any attention to them at first. I wondered what possible value could come from revisiting what I had already managed to survive. One day, out of boredom, I picked up a journal and began reading it. I was amazed to discover that in midst of all the darkness surrounding my childhood, there was a still a young boy with a sense of humor. After quickly consuming all of the other texts, I realized that I had been completely neglecting a large chapter of my life simply because I wanted to be done with the pain that I had associated with it. Watch Shane Koyczan's TED Talk . I wrote a series of pieces, all exploring my early life, and was not surprised to find that so many people were relating to the material. There was a tremendous sense of agony as I prepared to perform the poems for the first time. I remember wondering why I was willfully about to put myself through these experiences again. It has been such a rewarding journey to rediscover a part of myself that I thought I had long discarded. My band, Shane Koyczan and the Short Story Long, ended up rerecording ""To This Day"" for our 2011 album Remembrance Year. The poem quickly became a requested piece from our catalog at live performances, and each time there seemed to be a special silence from the audience. Fans have often remarked that we were telling their story back to them with that piece. I get a lot of mail regarding poems that I've written, but the letters I get in response to this piece are easily the most heartrending. There are people in the world whose endurance staggers me. There are stories that test our hearts. They stretch us out into empathy, and all we can do is feel for these strangers who in an instant feel like family. In 2012, I lent my voice to a project developed by Giant Ant studio for the Dalai Lama Center and their Educate the Heart campaign. The team at Giant Ant were great work partners, and they offered to lend me their services for a project down the road. It didn't take long to pick a project: ""To This Day"" was a piece I was wanting to do something special with for a long time. Giant Ant put together an animated video call out to other animators and the response we got was overwhelming. The team did an incredible job of threading the animations together to create the finished video. Language fails me in my gratitude for everyone who helped bring this project to life. From ""To This Day"": . ... if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself . get a better mirror . look a little closer . stare a little longer . because there's something inside you . that made you keep trying . despite everyone who told you to quit . you built a cast around your broken heart . and signed it yourself . you signed it .

"KEY WEST, Florida (CNN) -- It's one of the few New Year's Eve parties in America where straight guys think twice about kissing a stranger at midnight. The red paint was still wet when Sushi took the first ride on the ruby slipper. Key West, Florida, the southernmost point in the continental United States, has long been known for its pristine blue ocean, key lime pie, mega bars and margaritas. But it's also known for a female impersonator who rings in the new year in a giant, ruby-red, high-heel shoe live on CNN. The magnificently gowned, stylishly coiffed Sushi is about to enter his eleventh year in the eight-foot shoe. At the stroke of midnight, he'll be lowered from the second-story balcony at the Bourbon Street Pub to ring in 2009 as only he can. ""I never thought growing up that I'd be on television in a giant red heel"", said Sushi, whose real name is Gary Marion. ""That's not something that a young kid aspires to, but I'm so thankful that I live in a country that lets us do what we want to do, as long as we don't hurt anybody else."" This extravaganza has long been a featured part of CNN's Live New Year's Eve coverage, hosted this year by CNN's Anderson Cooper and comedian Kathy Griffin. iReport.com: Show us what happens in your town . ""This has got to be one of the most unique drops in the world,"" said Andy Newman, director of media relations for the Florida Keys tourism council. ""The whole thing of a drag queen coming down in a bright red shoe is just wild and could only happen in Key West."" Leading up to the stroke of midnight, thousands of partygoers are treated to an elaborate drag queen show in the middle of Duval Street. Sushi, or Marion, is the leader of an acclaimed troupe of drag performers, called the 801 Girls, who dance the night away at the 801 Bourbon Street Pub. The owners of the bar, Jimmy Gilleran and Joey Schroeder, dreamed up the event 11 years ago to get more tourists down to Key West. The first event was thrown together in about two weeks, and the shoe was made of papier-mâché and two-by-fours, and painted red. ""The paint was still wet, and I had a white dress on, and I sat in it,"" Sushi said. ""They didn't have a permit, and the cops kicked me out, and then we had to call the mayor, and he gave us the OK. ... It was just a mess"", he said. CNN correspondent John Zarrella is covering the show. It's been his assignment for several years now. ""The very first year ... standing on the stage with two drag queens, not knowing what to expect, and when they both kissed me on the cheeks at the same time, I thought to myself, I hope my mother and my wife weren't watching -- but they were,"" he said. Zarrella says he's seen the event change over the years that CNN has been carrying the show live. ""Every year, it seems to get bigger, and more and more families come every year,"" he said. A costume designer by profession, Marion has designed most of the 801 Girls' stage outfits and has created costumes for Keys theatrical productions. But he continues to gain widespread fame as Sushi. ""A lot of feedback from the straight community, who are like, 'that's really cool,' "" he said. ""I get a lot of people from Montana, and they think the only gay thing is Brokeback Mountain. Now they see me in the shoe.""","New York has a crystal ball, Atlanta has a peach, Key West has a ruby-red shoe .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Juanita Moore, the third African-American actress to ever get a supporting actress Oscar nomination, died of natural causes at her Los Angeles home Tuesday, her grandson said. She was 99. Moore worked right to the end, preparing for a stage reading of a new play and helping her actor grandson learn lines, Kirk Kellykhan said, . ""I just got cursed out that morning about learning my lines,"" Kellykhan said. Moore was helping him prepare for the lead in the West Coast production of the Broadway play ""The Wedding Man,"" he said. She was scheduled to take part in a January 17 reading of a play based on Michael St. John's book ""Hollywood Through the Backdoor,"" her grandson said. Moore was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar in 1960 for Douglas Sirk's ""Imitation of Life."" She played a housekeeper whose daughter passes for white. A Los Angeles native, she began her entertainment career as a Cotton Club chorus girl and a film extra. At the same time, she worked on her acting skills on stage in the Ebony Showcase Theater. Moore's feature film debut came in 1949 when she played a nurse in ""Pinky."" Most of her roles in the 1950s were as domestics, until she was cast as Annie Johnson in ""Imitation of Life."" The story was about Johnson's light-skinned daughter denying her racial roots. The lack of roles for African-American actresses in the early 1960s made it difficult for Moore to find big-screen jobs despite the accolades for her work. She acted in supporting roles in 1961 in ""Tammy, Tell Me True"" and in 1963 in ""Papa's Delicate Condition."" Moore did land a significant role as a nun in the 1966 hit ""The Singing Nun."" As more black-themed movies were made near the end of the decade, her career improved. She acted in ""Uptight"" in 1968, ""The Mack"" in 1973 and ""Abby"" in 1974. While she cut back on acting work in the 1980s, she never retired. She played a wise grandmother in ""Disney's The Kid"" in 2000, while acting in television guest roles in ""ER"" and ""Judging Amy.""","Moore was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar in 1960 for ""Imitation of Life""

"(CNN) -- Anywhere large numbers of humans gather, strange and wonderful stories are likely to emerge. Over the past week, at least three noteworthy tales surfaced at separate airports. The first involves the Transportation Security Administration and an unlucky puppet. The TSA confiscated a toy pistol from Rooster Monkburn in St. Louis on December 3. It would have gone unnoticed except for the fact that Monkburn is a monkey sock puppet and the gun is 2 inches long. Passenger Phyllis May, who modeled this particular puppet after the ""Rooster Cogburn"" character in the John Wayne movie ""True Grit,"" was carrying the puppet through TSA security, and she told CNN affiliate KING 5 about the incident. May said the TSA agent told her, ""If I held it up to your neck, you wouldn't know if it was real or not."" May's response was, ""Really?"" 24 hours at the world's busiest airport . It's true that realistic replicas of firearms are prohibited in carry-on bags. ""TSA officers are dedicated to keeping the nation's transportation security systems safe and secure for the traveling public,"" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in an e-mail. ""Under longstanding aircraft security policy, and out of an abundance of caution, realistic replicas of firearms are prohibited in carry-on bags."" It's not the first time a gun replica has delayed a passenger. In 2011, Virginia Gibbs' gun-themed purse was flagged as a security risk by TSA officials at the Norfolk, Virginia, airport. The second story took place at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where the all-vocal rock group Face held an impromptu holiday concert for stranded passengers on December 8. The group posted about their adventure on Facebook. Weather delays hit the airport especially hard, with thousands of flights delayed and/or canceled over the weekend. Members of Face spent six hours there before finally boarding a flight to their hometown of Denver. And there's the tale of Canadian airline WestJet treating 250 passengers to an early Christmas. The company created a virtual Santa where passengers could scan boarding passes and tell ""Santa"" what they wanted for Christmas. Children and adults alike were encouraged to reveal their wishes. Although one passenger humbly asked for socks and underwear, other gifts included snowboards, TVs and Android tablets. When the passengers arrived at their destination, their gifts were on the baggage carousel. It's going to be tough for other airlines to compete with this upgrade. Since it was posted Sunday, the video has received more than a million views on YouTube and 14,000 mentions on Twitter and become a trending topic on Facebook.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Just as the riskiest financial investment strategy is to have all of your money in one place, the riskiest career management strategy is to have all of your income from one organization unless you are in a critical role and have skills that are difficult to find in the labor market. To enjoy job security and professional fulfillment in this new employment reality, you should have a ""portfolio career"" that includes multiple and simultaneous income streams or ""career acts."" Career acts can include an eBay business, part-time job, profitable hobby, nonexecutive board seat, franchise, authored book, affiliate links on your blog, weekend jazz trio, etc. Here are 10 tips for managing career acts in a portfolio career: . Diversify . Start maximizing your talents to generate broad-based income streams. Some career acts can be slow and steady sources of income, while others can be higher-risk with higher potential reward. Professions such as nursing or teaching science are low-risk sources of guaranteed income, whereas starting a small business has a higher risk, with potential for a much higher reward. Invest intelligently . To build income-generating career acts, you will need to invest in yourself, your business, your network and the like. You may need, for example, to return to school for a degree or training program, to invest in equipment or supplies, or to attend a conference or some other networking event. Manage the financial risk incurred by being realistic about your talents and abilities and making sure you have the tenacity and effectiveness to take full advantage of your investments. Actively manage your portfolio . Your career acts will need different investments and have different trajectories for growth. Today's careers are actively self-managed. Invest prudently . Start protecting your time and your discretionary spending, as you may need both to start a new career act. Maintain high ethical standards . Do not add career acts that a reasonable supervisor wouldn't consider or that would use company time or resources for your private gain. At the same time, remember that you did not take a vow of poverty when you became employed. Sell high . Many people actively manage how they enter an organization but passively manage their exit, often waiting for a layoff, reorganization or something else to force their departure. If you work for an unsupportive supervisor, have no opportunities for growth or dislike what you are doing, start planning your exit while you still have an income stream. Know your tolerance for risk . Entrepreneurship is not right for everyone. Find a mix of career acts that do not add anxiety to your life and that align with your talents. Trust your hunches . Do not let anyone tell you that you lack focus or should get serious about one career. Careers today are moving further away from the traditional 40-hour-per-week employer to more self-directed opportunities for generating income. Understand the data . Speak with multiple people who occupy any career act you would like to have. There are often different ways to achieve the same career goal. Some ways may take less time and less money but produce the same result. Seek advice . Often people have a hard time understanding ways they can use their talents and abilities. Speak to trusted friends or advisers who know you well and want to see you succeed about what they see you doing. You will be surprised at how well others can spotlight your talents and give you ideas. A well-managed portfolio career can provide greater income, personal fulfillment and professional security. What income-generating opportunity can you create for yourself that would use your talents and skills, in a way you would like to work? Make a plan and start growing your amazing portfolio career.

"(CNN) -- Dozens of whales are dead after they got stuck on a remote beach in New Zealand, authorities said Monday. The 39 long-finned pilot whales became stranded overnight on Farewell Spit, a narrow claw of land that juts out into the sea from the northern tip of New Zealand's South Island. Twelve of the whales had died by the time they were found Monday morning. Conservation officials said they decided to euthanize the remaining 27 because the chances of getting them safely back out to sea were too slim. ""They have come very high onto the beach in a big tide,"" said John Mason, the conservation services manager for the area where the whales were found. ""The big tides are now reducing, coming in further out from shore, so it would be difficult to get the large animals into deep enough water to refloat them."" He said that he and his staff had ""carefully weighed up the likelihood of being able to refloat"" the whales, but that they ""determined that due to various factors it was unlikely they could be rescued."" ""Rather than prolong the suffering of the remaining 27 whales, we decided to humanely euthanize them,"" he said in a statement. Surrounded by oceans rich in marine life, New Zealand has one of the highest stranding rates for sea mammals in the world. An average of about 300 dolphins and whales get stuck on the country's coasts each year, according to Project Jonah, a nonprofit group that aims to rescue and protect marine mammals. Golden Bay, the area where the group of pilot whales got stuck, is known as a stranding hotspot because of its protruding coastline, gently sloping beaches and system of currents. Pilot whales, which live offshore, are among the most vulnerable species to mass strandings in such conditions, according to the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. But the number of whales that died on Farewell Spit this week pales in comparison with some of New Zealand's worst strandings. In 1998, more than 300 pilot whales died after they got stuck in Doughboy Bay on Stewart Island, which sits off the south coast of the South Island. New Zealand's worst ever stranding took place in 1918, the Encyclopedia of New Zealand says, when around 1,000 pilot whales got marooned on Long Beach in the Chatham Islands, which are situated hundreds of kilometers off the country's east coast. Scientists ask public to help find missing whales stranded off Florida coast . CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report.","The group of whales got stranded overnight on New Zealand's South Island .

"Washington (CNN)  -- In what one advocate called ""a Christmas miracle for airline passengers,"" the Department of Transportation on Monday announced a rule prohibiting U.S. aircraft on domestic routes from remaining on a tarmac for more than three hours with travelers aboard. ""Airline passengers have rights, and these new rules will require airlines to live up to their obligation to treat their customers fairly,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. Exceptions to the three-hour rule would be allowed only for safety and security reasons or if air traffic controllers advise a pilot that returning to the terminal would disrupt airport operations, the department said. U.S. airlines operating international flights departing from or arriving in the United States ""must specify, in advance, their own time limits for deplaning passengers, with the same exceptions applicable,"" the statement said. Airlines also are required to provide adequate food and water for passengers within two hours of their plane being delayed on the tarmac, the department said, maintain operable restrooms and provide medical attention if necessary. The rule is a victory for passengers' rights organizations, which have long pushed for such a measure. It will take effect 120 days from the date of its publication in the Federal Register, which will be sometime next week, the DOT said. ""This is a Christmas miracle for airline passengers,"" said Kate Hanni, who founded FlyersRights.org after she and her family were stranded on an Austin, Texas, tarmac for more than nine hours in 2006. ""Everyone needs to say thank you to the Obama administration and the Department of Transportation."" FlyersRights.org describes itself as the largest nonprofit airline consumer organization. Hanni said her group has achieved its goal, saying, ""I was always optimistic, but I really didn't know if we would get it."" The DOT statement said, ""The rule was adopted in response to a series of incidents in which passengers were stranded on the ground aboard aircraft for lengthy periods and also in response to the high incidence of flight delays and other problems."" In one of the most high-profile recent incidents, 47 passengers spent nearly six hours overnight on a Rochester, Minnesota, tarmac in August, with only pretzels to eat. ""We were not offered food. We were not offered water,"" passengers Link Christin testified in September at an unofficial Capitol Hill hearing sponsored by advocates for a passenger bill of rights. ""The toilet broke at 3 o'clock in the morning, and it was impossible to sleep,"" he testified. Read more stranded on the tarmac stories . The DOT blamed a poor decision by regional carrier Mesaba Airlines for the stranding of the Continental Airlines passengers. LaHood said in August that a Mesaba representative improperly refused requests by the captain and crew to let passengers off the plane. Mesaba, based in Eagan, Minnesota, and owned by Delta Air Lines, was the only carrier able to assist Continental Flight 2816 on its way from Houston, Texas, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, after it was diverted because of strong thunderstorms, LaHood said. But according to the DOT, Mesaba's representative refused to help passengers off the plane, saying incorrectly that the airport was closed to passengers for security reasons. Mesaba, Continental and ExpressJet Airlines were fined $175,000 for their roles in the incident, the department said Monday. ExpressJet was operating the Continental flight. Among those testifying at the September hearing was Robert Crandall, former chairman and chief executive of American Airlines, who spoke in support of the three-hour limit. After Monday's announcement, James May, president and CEO of the Air Transport Association, issued a statement: ""We will comply with the new rule even though we believe it will lead to unintended consequences -- more canceled flights and greater passenger inconvenience."" The association represents the principal U.S. airlines. ""In particular, the requirement of having planes return to the gates within a three-hour window or face significant fines is inconsistent with our goal of completing as many flights as possible. Lengthy tarmac delays benefit no one,"" May said. The rule brings the United States closer to European regulations aimed at protecting passengers, Hanni said. According to the European Transport Commission's Web site, those include ""information and minimum assistance,"" including ""catering, communications and an overnight stay if necessary."" ""This is the best gift that airplane passengers could have had, and it's been a decade coming,"" Hanni said. The Business Travel Coalition also applauded the rule. According to the DOT, the new rule also: . • Prohibits airlines from scheduling ""chronically delayed"" flights. Those who do may face enforcement action from the department for ""unfair and deceptive practices."" • Requires airlines to designate an employee to monitor the effects of flight delays and cancellation, respond ""in a timely and substantive fashion"" to consumer complaints and give consumers information on where to file complaints. • Requires airlines to display flight delay information on their Web sites for each domestic flight operated. • Requires airlines to adopt customer service plans and monitor compliance. • Prohibits airlines from retroactively applying material changes that could negatively affect consumers who have already purchased tickets. The DOT said it also plans to ""begin another rulemaking [process] designed to further strengthen protections for air travelers."" Areas under consideration include requiring airlines to submit contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays to the DOT for review and approval, to disclose baggage fees and to report additional tarmac delay data; and strengthening requirements that airline ads disclose the full fare consumers pay for tickets, the department said. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Advocates call new rule on tarmac delays a ""Christmas miracle"" for passengers .

"Washington (CNN) -- Illinois teenager Hannah Perryman lived in fear for years until the young stalker who tormented and threatened her was finally convicted. Hannah was on hand at the Justice Department on Tuesday to tell her painful story as Attorney General Eric Holder and other top officials headlined an event designed to call attention to the growing problem of stalking. Hannah is now a 17-year-old junior at Elgin High School near Chicago. She says the stalking started when she was in elementary school and continued for so many years she believed living a life in constant fear was normal. Then, a few years ago, she decided to openly declare her fears and take up a public fight against stalking. With the help of her mother, who taught school, a determined policeman and a caring social worker, Hannah's case opened the eyes of students and adults alike and led to a tough new anti-stalking law in Illinois. ""They just couldn't believe that I was afraid every day, every night, every moment of my life,"" Hannah told the audience in the ornate Great Hall of the Justice Department. ""That's been happening to me since I was in fifth grade, so that was pretty normal to me, you know?"" The tormenter in Hannah's case was a girl from the neighborhood who at first hung out for hours and days outside Hannah's house. But after the intimidation escalated to verbal threats to kill Hannah, the courts finally intervened. The offender pleaded guilty and was ordered to stay away. Because the case was adjudicated in juvenile court, many of the specifics remain under seal, and Illinois officials and Hannah's family and supporters won't talk about many details. Attorney General Holder paid tribute to Hannah for ""the courage to come forward and share her heartbreaking story with the world."" Holder said Hannah and her family had ""provided a model for how a potential tragedy can be turned into an opportunity"" to pass a law strengthening protection of stalking victims. There are millions of victims, and many of them aren't even certain they are being stalked, officials said. Cindy Southworth, director of the Safety Net Project, says much of the abuse and torment has moved online. She says virtually every technology program and social networking site is being abused and users are being harassed or stalked. In extreme cases, victims are killed. In most cases, they are scared or intimidated. The government defines stalking as a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. The latest Justice Department statistics are nearly five years old, but they show about 3.4 million people age 18 or older were victims of stalking in 2006. Southworth says the number is surely much higher now. There are no available figures on juvenile stalking victims. Officials urge individuals to report repeated unwanted phone calls, letters or e-mails. They also want authorities called if there are repeated incidents in which offenders leave flowers or gifts, show up at places waiting for the potential victim, or spread rumors about that person on the internet. Authorities stressed the individual acts may not be criminal, but collectively if they cause real fear they can violate the law, and courts can order protections for victims of any age. Victims come in all demographic groups, but officials say at least three of every four stalking victims are women.","Hannah Perryman says she was stalked for years, beginning in elementary school .

"New York (CNN) -- Routine training exercises turned deadly Saturday morning when two racehorses collided at Belmont Park in New York, killing both animals and injuring one rider, officials told CNN. The incident occurred at a training track at Belmont at about 8 a.m. Six Drivers, a 4-year-old colt, threw his rider and ran into a crowd of horses running in the opposite direction, New York Racing Associating spokesman Eric Wing told CNN. Six Drivers crashed into Caixa Eletronica, a multiple-stakes-winning thoroughbred, killing both horses and injuring Caixa Eletronica's rider, Carlos Castro, who was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation, according to a racing association press release. ""This was a freakish tragedy that happens very, very rarely, but it makes it no less unfortunate,"" Wing told CNN. Caixa Eletronica suffered a skull fracture and Six Drivers a neck fracture in the incident. The racing association's chief examining veterinarian said both horses died immediately, according to the press release. Caixa Eletronica was a prolific racer and fan favorite. ""For any horse, it's horrible. When you hear it's Caixa Eletronica, it's magnified,"" the horse's owner, Mike Reople, said in a press release. Caixa Eletronica, a 9-year-old, had a record of 23 wins in 69 lifetime starts, won seven stakes and earned more than $1.8 million. Belmont Park is the site of the Belmont Stakes, the annual final race of the Triple Crown.","One horse threw his rider and ran into a crowd of horses going in the opposite direction .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The Republicans have an authenticity problem. After many decades of enjoying huge political power, elected officials are struggling to energize voters about the party's brand name. Even the troubles faced by President Barack Obama don't seem to help. The recent interest in governors such as New Jersey's Chris Christie or national politicians who are relatively new to Washington, such as Sen. Rand Paul or Sen. Marco Rubio, reflects a thirst in the electorate to find Republicans who will stand for something and mean what they say. According to The New York Times, the Koch brothers are pouring money into rebuilding the party around candidates who stand for their libertarian ideals. The challenge that Republicans face is captured in a new pilot airing on Amazon Instant Video, ""Alpha House,"" written by Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau and starring John Goodman. The comedy focuses on the life of a group of four GOP senators who room together on Capitol Hill in what the producers call a ""man cave."" The pilot shows Republicans in Washington who are essentially faking it, putting on theater for constituents despite what they really believe. The show begins with one of the senators, played by Bill Murray, oversleeping on the morning he was supposed to turn himself in to the Department of Justice for some kind of unspecified wrongdoing. One of the senators, a closeted homosexual, tries to bolster his heterosexual credentials by castigating gay marriage in front of a conservative group and trying to learn to shoot a gun for a possible photo op. Goodman plays a South Carolina senator who is grudgingly forced to campaign in his state even though he has little interest in dealing with voters. The parody, with an admittedly liberal slant, conveys the essential dilemma that the party faces: the growing skepticism about a number of arguments that the GOP continues to make about itself. The party of fiscal restraint: Republicans claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility, the people who will balance the budget and constrain the budget in contrast to the reckless Democrats. Yet the GOP now has a long history of running up the deficit. When Republicans are presidents, spending has continued to rise and deficits have gone up. The presidency of George W. Bush burst any illusion that Republicans would maintain a tight fiscal order. Bush inherited surpluses from President Bill Clinton but as a result of the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, combined with military and domestic spending, he turned them into a deficit. Even with all the rhetoric coming out of Congress today about Republicans who desire to control spending, a close look at the plans of individuals such as Congressman Paul Ryan shows that deficits would remain alive and well if their policies went into effect. The party of outsiders: This has been a favorite trope for the GOP, with Republicans still acting as if they live in an era dominated by the Democrats. But nothing can be further from the truth. Republicans have enjoyed a strong run in the White House since Richard Nixon's victory in 1968 and they have maintained control of Congress for much of the period since 1994. During this time, Republicans have formed close connections with the K Street lobbying community and become accustomed to the benefits of pork barrel spending. Goodman's character reflects an image that too many, on the right and left, have of Republican elected officials. Belying the notion that they are not part of life inside the Beltway, Republicans have also been implicated in many scandals involving the abuse of power, such as all the politicians who fell as a result of their connection to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2006, making it difficult for many Americans to hear Republicans blast away at the very Washington in which its members thrive. The party of morality: This remains a chestnut for many Republicans who want to appeal to notions of social and cultural conservatism. Although this position has come under fire as out of touch with where many Americans are on issues such as gender rights and gay rights, the party's leaders are generally standing firm. Yet scandals in recent decades have rocked the image of the party. In South Carolina, former Gov. Mark Sanford's congressional campaign has stumbled as voters were reminded of the affair that brought him down from power. The party of national security: This was one of the most important claims for the party since World War II. The Republicans had made significant political gains, arguing that they were better equipped to handle national security than the Democrats. They used this argument to devastate their opponents. But the memory of the war in Iraq under President George W. Bush continues to haunt the party. The recent opening of Bush's presidential library brought up memories of the controversy, as does the current debate over whether to send arms to Syrian rebels following evidence that the government used weapons of mass destruction. The deployment of military resources based on faulty intelligence and the enormous failures of the post-reconstruction period in Iraq have put Republicans on the defensive. The party of opportunity: Republicans have always argued that their policies would offer the greatest opportunities to the largest number of Americans. Through trickle down economics and the expansion of markets, Republicans said, all Americans would gradually prosper. Yet many of the party's economic policies have proved to benefit a small portion of the population, bolstering critics who claim that the GOP does not support the middle class. When 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was secretly taped talking about 47% of the nation consisting of people who didn't pay taxes, he perpetuated this image, which was damaging to his campaign. For many voters, the rhetoric of the GOP does not reflect the recent history of the party. Until Republicans put forth more compelling ideas and offering politicians who stand for something, they will have trouble regaining strength. Until they do, shows such as ""Alpha House"" will continue to ring true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","A pilot show, ""Alpha House,"" depicts GOP senators in unflattering light .
Julian Zelizer says show makes Republicans out to be hypocrites .
He says the party is perceived to lack authenticity in pushing conservative values .
Zelizer: GOP hasn't shown it is party of fiscal restraint, national security, morality ."
"(CNN) -- A recent commentary by James Walker in CNN.com's opinion section grossly mischaracterized the cruise industry's practices and record, claiming that the industry is ""largely unregulated"" and ""largely accountable to countries like Panama or the Bahamas."" Nothing could be further from the truth. Essentially every aspect of the cruise industry is heavily regulated and monitored under national and international maritime laws for many purposes, the most important of which is to protect the safety of passengers and crew. A U.N. agency -- the International Maritime Organization -- mandates global standards for the safe operation of cruise ships through its 170-member governments, including the United States. These regulations are extensive and wide-ranging. They start with the design and construction of the ship and extend to the operation of the vessel, the emergency equipment on board, and scenarios for emergency situations, including the evacuation of a ship. Regulation of the cruise industry involves many levels of enforcement -- the international; the flag state or the flag of the country that the ship is registered in; and the port state (the country a ship is visiting.) For example, cruise ships that operate from U.S. ports are subject to strict U.S oversight and enforcement of international laws and regulations as well as all applicable federal laws of the United States. This oversight enforcement is carried out primarily by the U.S. Coast Guard. Opinion: What cruise lines don't want you to know . Most significantly, this means that any ship entering a U.S. port, no matter what country's flag it sails under, is subject to U.S. Coast Guard examination for compliance with international and applicable U.S. regulatory standards, especially those related to safety. The coast safety regulation enforcement of the U.S. Coast Guard begins at the concept or design stage for new cruise ships and continues throughout the ship's entire time of service. At any time, the responsible Coast Guard captain of a port can prevent any cruise ship from departing if a serious violation of any regulation is found or any dangerous condition exists. Contrary to what the op-ed's author says, significant fires on board ships are rare. The global cruise industry has robust regulatory measures to protect passengers and crew. Fire safety regulations are continuously enhanced and have reduced the frequency and severity of fires. The last major overhaul of fire safety regulations entered into force in 2010, and those regulations remain the subject of continuous review and updating. Every oceangoing ship in the Cruise Line International Association fleet must carry firefighting teams made up of crew members. They receive formal firefighting training and regular drills to ensure a rapid response in the unlikely event of a fire. The average oceangoing cruise ship has about 4,000 smoke detectors, 500 fire extinguishers, 16 miles of sprinkler piping, 5,000 sprinkler heads and six miles of fire hose. Opinion: My celebration trip on the Carnival Triumph . Jobs in the cruise industry are highly sought after, and crew members have opportunities for career advancement. The industry offers opportunities not available for many crew members in their home countries, allowing them to support families, pay for college and even start their own businesses. Beyond wages, crew members are provided free room and board in a clean, well-maintained environment. They receive cruise-line sponsored medical care at no cost. And the cruise industry maintains strict workplace standards set by the International Maritime Organization and the International Labor Organization -- both U.N. agencies. The cruise industry also takes steps to prevent its people from bringing norovirus, which causes gastrointestinal illness, on board. About 10.3 million passengers embarked on Cruise Lines International Association ships from a U.S. port in 2012. There were 16 cases of cruise ship norovirus outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year, involving about 2,600 passengers out of those 10.3 million. To put this in perspective, the CDC reports norovirus causes about 20 million cases of gastroenteritis a year. Opinion: How Carnival can clean up the PR mess . The cruise industry is subject to strict international regulation and oversight and fully promotes policies and practices that foster a safe, secure and healthy cruise ship environment. There's no doubt that cruising is one of the safest, affordable and enjoyable vacation experiences available today, which explains why a record 20.6 million passengers worldwide enjoyed a cruise vacation in 2011. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bud Darr.","Bud Darr objects to op-ed that criticized cruise industry .
He says the industry is heavily regulated and monitored under maritime laws .
Cruise ships entering U.S. ports must be examined by Coast Guard, he says .
Despite headlines and criticism, fires and illnesses are rare on ships, Darr says ."
"(CNN) -- It did not happen when the top job opened up at the International Monetary Fund: Christine Lagarde of France won out over candidates such as Mexico's Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens, who put up a good fight. It did not happen at the World Bank either: Washington leaned on the members of the developed world to back their man Jim Yong Kim, the former president of Dartmouth College. But the third time was the charm for those in emerging markets to finally run a post-World War II institution in modern times. Brazil's Roberto Azevedo took the flag after voting from the 159 members of the World Trade Organisation, becoming its first ever Director General from South America. He outpolled Herminio Blanco of Mexico -- another highly experienced trade veteran -- who had the backing of other NAFTA members the United States and Canada. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . As the new DG, Azevedo did not overplay the significance of what his backing meant. But in his first television interview since securing the job he acknowledged the shift to the emerging markets. ""It is important to have the developing world and the emerging economies being participants, active participants even in a leadership role as well,"" he said. Not surprisingly he came out of the starting gate in the role saying that resuscitating the Doha Round of free trade talks is priority number one. Read more: O'Neill: Euro may not exist by 2020 . ""We have a very large trade agenda to push forward, but we can't because we are paralyzed,"" said the veteran trade negotiator, who noted that the rules governing the WTO are outdated. The job will not be easy. For his predecessor, Pascal Lamy, the term was a frustrating one. In the midst of the worst financial crisis in a generation, free trade slipped right off the global agenda. Some would contend the crisis reignited protectionist tendencies, especially in emerging markets. Watch more: O'Neill: BRIC more important than EU . According to the World Bank, Argentina topped the list of countries that filed the most measures to guard certain sectors and products from competition. It was joined by the BRIC countries and the U.S., rounding out the top six places. Azevedo will have to take a nuanced approach to navigate demands at home in Brazil and at the same time chart a new course to build a consensus. Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff raised the tenor of the protectionist debate when she accused Washington of driving down the value of the U.S. dollar to the detriment of developing countries. Read more: Defterios: Are the emerging 'BRICS' markets dead? The new Director General suggested in our interview that the topic of currency fluctuations could also be included in the WTO's agenda, even if other institutions such as the IMF keep it on theirs as well. ""I am optimistic that the organisation can look at these very important issues that are a big part of today's business world,"" he said, adding that the WTO needs to avoid a ""disconnect"" between business and the multi-lateral trading system. To get the Doha Round moving forward as opposed to sitting in neutral where it has been for years, top trade officials told me emerging economies need to embrace market opening measures. Their resistance to change is what allowed them to stumble badly in the past two years. Azevedo said it is important to move forward: ""We cannot look backwards. What we have to do is raise our heads, look forward, roll up our sleeves and work."" Brazil is a prime example of how a lack of reforms has undermined the economy. After growing seven and a half percent in 2010, the vast emerging market just managed to grow less than one percent last year. That may be Roberto Azevedo's prime argument to revive free trade. Now he has to get at home and in other emerging markets to embrace that concept as well.","Brazil's Roberto Azevedo took the flag after voting becoming its first ever Director General from South America .

"(CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson has offered to travel to Iran to help release a jailed Iranian-American journalist who was recently convicted of spying. The Rev. Jesse Jackson says he would be willing to travel to Iran to appeal for Roxana Saberi's freedom. ""If our voices are heard in Iran today, I would be anxious to travel with a delegation to Iran, if we are permitted, and make an appeal for her freedom,"" said the longtime civil rights activist, according to his Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson, 67, was speaking Tuesday at a peace conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""Whenever we've brought people out of captivity, whether in Syria, Cuba, Iraq, or Yugoslavia, or Liberia, it's always opened a diplomatic door to reduce tensions,"" he added. Roxana Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public. The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials. Saberi's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair. Jackson has offered in the past to help release American hostages, most recently in 2005. At that time, he said he was willing to use his role as a religious leader to help secure the release of Roy Hallums, who was kidnapped along with five others in Baghdad in November 2004. Hallums was freed in September 2005 when American troops raided the farmhouse where he was being held outside Baghdad. In 1984, Jackson successfully secured the release of a Navy pilot held in Syria. In 1991, he helped secure the release of 500 ""international guests"" held in Iraq, and in 1999, he worked to persuade Yugoslavia to release three U.S. soldiers held there during the Kosovo conflict. Obama has called for Saberi's release, saying he is ""gravely concerned with her safety and well-being."" ""We are working to make sure that she is properly treated and to get more information about the disposition of her case,"" Obama said Sunday. ""She is an American citizen, and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage."" Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation. Saberi, who comes from North Dakota, has been living in Iran since 2003, said the Committee to Protect Journalists, a journalists' advocacy group. She has freelanced for National Public Radio and other news organizations, and was writing a book about Iranian culture. Iranian authorities revoked her press credentials in 2006, but Saberi continued to file short news items without permission, the journalists' group said. Saberi was detained in January, although no formal charges were disclosed. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage. ""Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter, she was carrying out espionage activities,"" Hassan Haddad, a deputy public prosecutor, told the Iranian Students News Agency. Authorities also said Saberi confessed. Her father said he believes she was coerced into making damaging statements. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Civil rights activist says he's willing to travel to Iran to seek journalist's release .

"(CNN) -- An unprecedented global crime wave threatens the most important natural places on Earth and we are failing in our efforts to stop it. Look past the drug wars, the counterfeiting industry and human trafficking and you'll find one of the next biggest criminal enterprises in the world: the trade in illicit wildlife. Trafficking in wildlife and its body parts is exploding in popularity among global crime syndicates. Unlike other illicit trades, killing and selling parts from rhinos, tigers and elephants holds advantages for criminals: The product is poorly protected at its source, its trade is poorly regulated and wildlife crime is poorly investigated and lightly punished. For a hardcore criminal, illicit wildlife trafficking is a low-risk, high-reward bonanza. News: Rhino poaching hits record numbers in South Africa . An analysis released Tuesday and commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund -- based on interviews with governments, military and civil society leaders -- underscores that illicit wildlife trafficking is not just an environmental problem, but a transnational crime issue. It compromises the security of countries and destroys natural wealth. INTERPOL and other law enforcement groups agree that the involvement of organized crime syndicates and rebel militias in wildlife crime to fund their activities and purchase weapons has increased. It also highlights that black market wildlife trade hinders sustainable, social and economic development. The violent nature of poaching reduces the effectiveness of governments, erodes the rule of law and affects the growth of local communities. Authorities estimate the illegal wildlife trade to be worth up to $10 billion annually -- or almost $20 billion if you count the illegal trade in timber and fisheries products. That puts it among the top illegal trades in the world. As a direct consequence of these profits, the killings are way up: Africa loses tens of thousands of elephants each year for their ivory, wild tiger populations have plummeted to as few as 3,200 and rhino poaching in Africa is exploding. News: Booming illegal ivory trade taking severe toll on Africa's elephants . For years South Africa boasted low rates of rhino poaching, with approximately 20 rhinos killed annually. In the past five years, the number has soared exponentially; 618 rhinos have been poached in 2012. Vietnam, China and Thailand drive much of the illegal wildlife demand but we shouldn't forget that Americans are complicit in this trade. After China, the United States may be the second largest market for wildlife products in the world, a significant percentage of which is illegal, including illicit ivory trinkets being sold in Manhattan and international rhino horn trafficking rings operating out of Los Angeles. We're going to lose this fight if we don't up our game. We need solutions as sophisticated as the criminals we face. Crime syndicates employ helicopters, night vision equipment and high capacity automatic weapons. Park rangers are vastly outgunned and often outmanned. There is a way forward that offers some hope. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made this a strategic imperative for U.S. interests around the world, emphasizing it as a major national security issue, and we are beginning to engage other governments in this discussion. It goes far beyond the loss of animals. Poaching decreases food security for rural communities, and evidence points to the sale of ivory as a means of funding rebel militias in places like Central Africa. News: Thousands of crocodiles rescued from smugglers in China . The private sector is taking notice. Google just announced a signature charity giving initiative, funding WWF in the development of cutting-edge technologies to help us detect and track both animals and poachers on the ground. This project will develop a new surveillance approach to greatly increase enforcement effectiveness by intercepting the poachers before they can do harm. This is a step in the right direction, but we'll need governments to build not just the capacity but also the resolve to apply the technology and enforcement at a much greater scale. Across the world, we need to strengthen criminal investigation, prosecution and sentencing on wildlife crime. That means more money and resources for law enforcement to support, for example, specialized investigative and forensic methodologies. Simultaneously, we need awareness-raising campaigns to reduce demand, especially among consumers in Asia, and to use the best available market research to guide social media campaigns. We need governments on both the supply and demand side of this trade to work together and bring serious commitments to the table in March, when representatives for some 170 nations will come together in Thailand -- itself a major market for illegal ivory -- for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Here they will aim to make good on the promises to get a handle on this epidemic. A major litmus test of the convention will be the nations' ability to make convincing commitments to address all aspects of the crisis. News: Photographer documents trafficking of endangered animals in Asia . We can roll back this wave of crime, but we're far from making that happen. There are promising signs but we will need a sustained tenfold increase in efforts from consumers, communities, the private sector, and most importantly, from governments to stop the slaughter before it's too late. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carter Roberts.","Carter Roberts: Wildlife trade a growing global criminal enterprise poorly addressed .

"(CNN) -- Italian police descended on the national team's Euro 2012 training base Monday to speak to Zenit St Petersburg defender Domenico Criscito as part of a wide-ranging investigation into match fixing. The 25-year-old, formerly of Genoa, was questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in the Italian top flight. A total of 19 people were arrested in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in Cremona, 11 of them players in Italy's top division. Juventus coach Antonio Conte, who led the club to the Serie A title last season, was spoken to by police, while Lazio's captain Stefano Mauri was arrested. Juventus defiant in match-fix controversy . As a result of the dawn raid on Italy's training camp at Coverciano, near Florence, Criscito decided to withdraw from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. Italian Football Federation (FIGC) vice-president Demetrio Albertini said Criscito was hugely disappointed to miss out but that he quit in order to protect the rest of the squad. ""Criscito decided not to join Italy at the Euros. The tournament is no longer his priority, he wants to get in touch with the prosecutors as soon as possible to clear his position,"" Albertini said. ""We are with him, we believe in his innocence: until no evidence is proved, he should be considered innocent."" Prosecutors said the left-back was seen in a restaurant with match fixing suspects during his time at Genoa but the player has also protested his innocence. Criscito's agent Andrea D'Amico said: ""Criscito is calm but very surprised. He just joined a dinner with fans, a meeting asked by fans after the derby Genoa lost to Sampdoria in 2011. ""He didn't know any of the ultras involved. He can't understand how he could be connected to this story. As soon as possible he will ask prosecutors to be interrogated."" Roberto Di Martino, chief prosecutor in the case, told a press conference the police's swoop on Italy's base was solely related to Criscito. ""We shouldn't place too much emphasis on the blitz at Coverciano,"" he said. ""It is a problem that concerns only Criscito and not other players in the national team at the moment. ""Also we shouldn't place too much emphasis on this anyway, the notification of an impending investigation is a tool we have, but not a guilty judgment. There's been no action taken against Criscito travelling, he can play at the Euros easily."" Police said Juve manager Conte was being quizzed in relation to sporting fraud accusations relating to a match played by Siena, the club he used to coach. Conte's lawyer said his client was completely innocent. Siena's president, Massimo Mezzaroma, has also been placed under investigation. Di Martino added: ""There are seven, eight games being looked at and there have been statements that make us think they were manipulated. The searches involved players, coaches and directors of the club, including Conte and Mezzaroma."" Di Martino also revealed the investigation was spreading beyond Italian borders, with five people arrested in Hungary. ""We have evidence that this Hungarian gang worked to fix in Serie A 2010-11 the games between Bari and Sampdoria, Lecce and Lazio and some others. ""We have different evidence of their presence in Italy and of their contacts with people from Singapore, where the money is coming from."" The arrests are the latest in a long running saga that has cast a shadow over Italian football. In 2006 the Calciopoli match fixing scandal saw Juventus relegated to the second tier and stripped of two league titles. Seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year, the most high-profile of which was Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni. He was subsequently banned from the game for three years. Giovanni Trapattoni, who coached the Italian national team for four years, said the latest twist represented ""devastating news."" Trapattoni, who now coaches Ireland, said: ""What could be the Italian team's reaction? On one side it is clear that news like this can bring people down, but it could also push them to show the clean face of football. ""As someone who has been abroad for years it's a pity that these things cast a dark shadow over our football.""","Italian police arrest 19 people, including 11 players, in match fixing investigation .

In 1979, Nancy Garces broke out of the women's prison in Chino, California, where she was serving a sentence in a credit-card forgery case, said Lt. Paul McCaffrey, spokesman for Santa Barbara police. She had a pending warrant for her arrest since May 25, 1979, McCaffrey said. Police received a tip that she would be arriving by train Tuesday in Santa Barbara at 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), McCaffrey said. ""I can tell you she was very surprised,"" McCaffrey told CNN. ""I do believe that she regrets her decision to come to Santa Barbara,"" he added. ""She's been on the run for 32 years, but the minute she arrived in Santa Barbara, we were ready to scoop her up."" Garces, 56, was traveling under her assumed name of Lydia Mendez of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and told authorities she even has kids under that name, McCaffrey said. Police used the description of her age, height and weight to spot her as she got off the train, McCaffrey said. ""We made contact with her, and she gave us her assumed named, Lydia Mendez,"" McCaffrey said. ""But we determined that she was in fact Nancy Garces, and we confronted her. Then she admitted who she was."" Garces was being held Wednesday in the county jail without bail.","Nancy Garces escaped from a women's prison in California in 1979 .

This is our last show of the school year, and we're gonna get things started with a little help from our friends.

CARMEN SMITH (DOROTHY), CARSYN WHITEHEAD (TIN MAN), ALLYSON BROWN (COWARDLY LION), STEPHANI PAYNE (SCARECROW): You are about to enter the wonderful world of the wizard.

Hey, wait up! LESTER STO. NINO, IREPORTER: You are watching CNN Student News! (END VIDEO) First Up: Northeast Tornadoes . AZUZ: First up, we're looking at some of today's headlines, starting with tornadoes in Massachusetts. Several twisters hit the state on Wednesday, and Springfield -- one of the largest cities in Massachusetts -- was hit badly. At least two tornadoes touched down there. You can see some of the damage that was left behind. At least four people were killed. Dozens of other people were injured. Rescue workers were going door-to-door early Thursday looking for survivors. This could be a record year for tornadoes, but you don't see too many of them up in Massachusetts. That's part of the reason why these storms made such an impact. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: And magnitude, when you see those houses flattened, really hits you. In 45 years of public service, I have never seen this kind of damage or devastation in Massachusetts. And as many of the residents said to me, ""This is Massachusetts, this is not supposed to happen here."" And it never has to our recollection. New Food Plate . AZUZ: For a while now, U.S. nutrition standards have been based off different versions of the food pyramid. A lot of people say the pyramid was too confusing. So yesterday, officials ditched the pyramid for a plate. It's called ""MyPlate,"" and it's the government's new standard for nutrition. About half of the plate, half of what the government says people should be eating, is made up of fruits and vegetables. Whole grains and lean protein make up the other half, with a side of dairy. Officials hope that simplifying the standards this way will help Americans eat better. A lot of health experts agree it's better than the old pyramid. But some say that the new MyPlate doesn't give people enough information to make the best choices. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to all of the students and teachers who watch CNN Student News! Which of these headlines came first? Here we go! Was it: A) Earthquake strikes Japan, B) Revolution in Egypt, C) Chilean miners rescued or D) U.S. holds Midterm Elections? Three seconds on the clock -- GO! The Chilean miners were rescued before any of these other stories happened. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Top Stories of the School Year . AZUZ: Those were some of the biggest stories that made headlines during this school year. We're going to take a look back now at the top stories from 2010- 2011, and we're including some of your comments along the way. Set your clocks back to August, and here we go. (BEGIN VIDEO) AZUZ: From Grace: Being a military child myself, I know that many families across America have been affected by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is really hard to go through a deployment when you have a loved one fighting in the war. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Daddy! U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Our goal, our goal is not just a physically secure Iraq, but an economically and prosperous and stable one as well. AZUZ: From Megan: The rescue of the Chilean miners was one of the most touching stories reported during the whole year. The rescue was so breathtaking and the reactions of everyone were so sincere. TOM FOREMAN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: August 5th; 2 in the afternoon; 2,300 feet underground, a shaft collapses in the San Jose copper and gold mine. 33 miners are somewhere behind the rubble, their condition unknown. The Chilean president promises every effort to rescue them. Finally, after more than 2 months buried alive, salvation. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Never has a man been underground so long and gotten out alive. GROUP: Chi! Le! Chi Chi Chi ...Le Le Le! Viva Chile! AZUZ: From Ryan: During the U.S. midterm elections, I started to wish I could vote. I got excited to see who would win or lose the elections. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) OHIO, HOUSE SPEAKER: Let me just say this: It's clear tonight who the winners really are, and that's the American people. SEN. HARRY REID, (D) NEVADA, MAJORITY LEADER: This race has been called, but the fight is far from over. The bell that just rang isn't the end of the fight, it's the start of the next round. AZUZ: From Danielle: In my honest opinion, I think that our country has not improved in the economy. Gas prices have continued to rise, and your everyday tools prices are soaring. Many prices on things are unbelievable. From Mo's class: We believe that the upheaval in Arab nations was a top story because it affected the whole world. After these events, our class started to pay more attention to the news. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will die for our freedom! MOAMMAR GADHAFI, LIBYAN LEADER: We will be victorious in this fight. AZUZ: From Kazumi: I live in Tokyo, so the tsunami was really shocking to me. Japan is getting over the damage. We are so grateful for the help and prayers from all over the world. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God! AZUZ: From Lexi: Every night I pray that the people whose lives have been impacted from the natural disasters get better. COOPER: We're talking about the deadliest tornado season since 1953, that's what we're experiencing right now. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's something you don't want to experience. You don't want to experience nothing like this. It ain't a good feeling, it ain't nothing you can do about it. AZUZ: From Juliana: When Osama bin Laden died, I thought it was probably the biggest story reported this year. Considering he was the starter of a terrorist group and the cause of 9/11, I do think justice was done. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Okay, before we go, you know we always like to have a little pun at the end of our show. I've chosen my top 5 favorite puns of the school year. And right now, you get to sit through every punful one of them again. Let's goose this up! When a bird joined a couple canines on their walk through the park, we had to give it wings on the air. After all, what's good for a goose is good for a gander. Okay, then, there was this zip-line over a reptile pit. To protect the people, you'd think they'd have a gate or something. To protect the reptiles, you'd need a little gator aid! When a retriever took some ducklings under her wing -- or paw -- you could see she didn't duck any responsibility. It wouldn't fit the bill. And as far as duck puns go, you've got to admit they quack you up. And after a group of presidential mascots took off running -- that's running a race, not 'running a race' -- you want a clean match. Anything less elects a commander-in-cheat. My favorite had to be this one, though. Back in August, we showed a butterfly causing a bunch of penguins to flip out. Now, we could've talked about the butterfly effect, said this was frightless versus flightless, said the butterfly ruled them like a monarch. But instead, we settled on this: the pupa becomes the master. Goodbye . AZUZ: Sure, they might bug you from time to time, but you know we larva good pun here at CNN Student News. All right.

"(CNN) -- Queen Beatrix spent 33 years on the throne and will be succeeded by her son, the Prince of Orange, Prince Willem-Alexander. She ascended to the throne when Queen Juliana abdicated on her 71st birthday, on April 30, 1980. Beatrix announced Monday that she will step aside on April 30. Beatrix was born January 31, 1938, and when World War II reached Holland the family fled to London. Juliana, Beatrix and her sister Irene then moved to Ottawa, Canada. Beatrix married German diplomat Claus von Amsberg on March 10, 1966, in Amsterdam. They have three sons, Willem-Alexander, born in 1967, Friso, born in 1968, and Constantijn, born in 1969. Friso was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last year. She has eight grandchildren. Her husband died in 2002 aged 76. He overcame early Dutch wariness -- in a country where the German occupation in WWII was still fresh in the national memory -- to become one of the most popular members of the Dutch royal family . Under the Dutch Constitution the king or queen is head of state but politically neutral. Beatrix, held weekly meetings with the prime minister and spoke regularly with high-ranking ministers and secretaries of state. The head of state also signs all new acts of Parliament, and plays a role in the formation of new governments. Prince Willem-Alexander, 45, was educated in Wales and Holland where he earned a history degree at Leiden University. He served in the Dutch Royal Navy from August 1985 to January 1987. As Prince of Orange -- the title given to the person first in line to the Dutch throne ---- he has been interested in sustainability and innovation. He has also been a member of the Dutch central bank supervisory board and regularly has represented the queen at international events. Willem-Alexander has been a member of the International Olympic Committee since 1998. He is married to Princess MÃ¡xima, who was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She has a degree in economics and has worked for HSBC and Deutsche Bank. The couple, who met at a party, were engaged in March 2001 and they were married in February 2002. The relationship -- like his mother's marriage -- sparked initial controversy when it emerged that Maxima's father had been a minister during the 1976-1983 Argentinean military dictatorship. He agreed to stay away from the wedding. They have three daughters, Princess Catharina-Amalia, Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane. When Willem-Alexander becomes king, 9-year-old Catharina-Amalia will be next in line. Tell us what you think of this story.","Queen Beatrix will end 33 years on the Dutch throne on April 30 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Most Japanese treat Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's new economic program, dubbed ""Abenomics,"" with a heavy dose of skepticism. If there is a miracle cure for Japan's decades-long malaise, then it'll have to be seen to be believed. And Abe himself admits it will take time for salaries to rise and for the real economy to respond to treatment. But in Tokyo's central Akihabara district, four young Abenomics devotees dressed in giant glittery bow-ties and denim mini-skirts are handing out fliers. They chant: ""We're the Street Corner Economists -- please come to our concert'!"" Granted, it's less the promise of massive public spending programs, the whirring of the monetary printing press or the slightly ambiguous growth strategies pulling in the punters here. It's more about the girl band's coquettish sales pitch. ""When the economy is good the skirt lengths get shorter,"" says 20-year-old band member Yuki Sakora. ""So when the Nikkei goes below 9,000 we wear long skirts; when it's between 10 and 11,000 we go medium-length, and miniskirts when it's 11 to 13,000."" Their signature tune ""Abenomics"" has only been on sale a couple of weeks, but the audience seem to know it. An assortment of geeky 20-something males and the odd suited salaryman faithfully mirror the girls' dance-routine, punching the air with glow-sticks when the refrain comes through. Perhaps it's because the Nikkei's wedged firmly above 13,000, so they're treated to the girls in bloomers. I ask Yuki what Abenomics means to her. ""The weaker yen probably means prices will go up,"" she says without missing a beat. ""But that helps exports. And I think companies will start to earn more and that will boost consumer spending."" That is the theory but it requires a shift in thinking. ""Our biggest problem is that the general public has been stuck with deflation -- in mind and heart -- for the past 20 years,"" Japan's Finance Minister Taro Aso told CNN's Jill Dougherty recently. ""People don't buy things today because they think tomorrow it will be cheaper. Unless this mindset changes and people start buying things, consumption, which is near 70% of GDP, won't grow."" Toru Urayama set up an academy in 2007 to teach amateur traders how to make money on the markets. In the last few months of the Nikkei's meteoric rise he's experienced a flood of applicants. But he tells them not to hold out hope that Abenomics will do much in the long term. ""It's good for the stock market but not for the economy as a whole. It could lead to a bubble, though I don't think it will be as bad as it was back in the 1980s,"" he said, referring to the spectacular crash that followed decades of soaring stock and real estate values in Japan. Megumi Fukuzawa's signed up because she made a bad investment in 2008 and is wondering what to do with her money now the market's up. She's hoping Abenomics boosts her husband's salary. ""In the past I've tried to save because his salary was low. But if things change then I might spend more, this stock market investment is part of that."" Back on stage, the Street Corner Economists finish their song in a blaze of multi-colored lights, before they settle in for a chat with the fans. Everyone dutifully sits down. But when the girls ask whether anyone's bought the single, there's not much of a response. The appeal here is more show than substance. Precisely what critics fear so-called Abenomics will turn out to be too.","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's new economic program is dubbed ""Abenomics""

"Boston (CNN) -- A monster blizzard has left at least one person dead and hundreds of thousands of New Englanders in the dark and in the cold Friday night, thanks to a storm that's already delivered whipping winds and more than a foot of snow in some parts, with prospects of even double that by the time it's done. The storm -- actually the convergence of two powerful systems -- began in earnest Friday morning in parts of New York and is expected to continue well into Saturday in Rhode Island, eastern Massachusetts and Maine. Snow was more or less continuous for much of the region all day, with some lulls as well as times when it picked up considerably. At one point Friday night, for instance, Connecticut's emergency management agency warned on Twitter that ""a wide ban of extremely heavy snow"" was moving through the central and eastern parts of the Nutmeg State, dropping snow at a staggering rate of 4 to 5 inches an hour. Smithfield, Rhode Island, had 14 inches of snow by 9 p.m. Friday, one of several towns in that state, Connecticut and Massachusetts to be buried under more than a foot of snow -- with much more, potentially, on the way. ""I couldn't believe the amount of snow that had piled up, as well as the many fallen branches,"" said CNN iReporter Molly Schulson in Providence, Rhode Island. She was among the tens of millions of people stranded in the blizzard's path. Many were prohibited by authorities from driving as a preemptive measure while other roads were closed in the thick of the bad weather, as was the case late Friday for New York's Long Island Expressway and Sunrise Highway, according to the Suffolk County Police Department. Others saw their travel plans squashed when more than 5,000 flights from some 60 airports were canceled. And Amtrak nixed several of its scheduled runs, citing the weather, while commuter rail service in and out of New York and other locales were also impacted. Track the storm on map, timeline . That helped transform several New England communities into ghost towns, as streets that typically would be choked with traffic were quiet, except for whistling winds; and empty, except for a blanket of thick, sticky snow. CNN iReporters sent in photos and video from Boston, for instance, that showed sheets of white on the ground -- except when whipping winds made for near whiteout conditions on camera -- and little movement on the streets. ""Boston is kind of eerie at the moment,"" said Chris Moran, a veteran snowplow driver doing his best to keep the roads clear. ""People are off the streets, and it looks like it could be 3 o'clock in the morning."" Strong winds made this storm especially biting. By Friday night, the National Weather Service reported wind gusts around 70 mph along the Massachusetts coast and through greater Boston, including a 74-mph gust in Buzzards Bay on Cape Cod. ""The wind is just pounding,"" CNN iReporter Jordana Fleischut said from Nantucket, off Massachusetts' southern coast. ""It's currently moving the Jeep that we're in -- that's how powerful it is."" Such strong winds threatened to rustle up flooding along the coast at high tide Saturday morning. In the seaside Massachusetts town of Marshfield, for instance, the emergency management agency noted there may be a storm surge of between two to three feet and forecast a ""serious event with moderate to major impact"" around 10 a.m. Saturday. Police in Poughkeepsie, New York, said one person died in a storm-related vehicle accident there, the first fatality that CNN has confirmed from the blizzard. The storm also damage for those not living directly on the coast, as evidenced by extensive power outages around the region. For many more people, the storm's impact will be in the form of widespread power outages. By early Saturday, more than 600,000 customers -- most in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut -- were without electricity, a number that could grow. Apps to help get you through . For some, it all evoked memories of the ""Blizzard of '78"" and the ""Presidents Day Storm of 2003"" -- two of dozens of winter storms in Massachusetts that Moran has been out on the streets. The Framingham resident bundled up to brave the bitter cold and clear snow off the roads. But with a storm this powerful, it sometimes seems like a losing battle. ""I just finished plowing a 40-car parking lot,"" said Moran. ""But if you were to look at it now, you never would have guessed. It's completely covered."" Alarms raised, events canceled ahead of the storm . Authorities have been sounding the alarm about the coming storm for days, urging people to stock up and stay off the roads. The worries were especially pronounced in places slammed by Sandy. That late October storm tore through Nick Camerada's Staten Island home, leaving him personally ""destroyed"" and cognizant that there may be more hits coming. ""You can't mess with Mother Nature,"" an emotional Camerada said. Lines of customers snaked around storefronts as many braced for the worst. When Reading, Massachusetts, resident Elizabeth Frazier arrived at a grocery store late Thursday night, shoppers were already buying up the store. ""It's a zoo in there,"" she said. ""There's nothing left on the shelves,"" she told CNN affiliate WHDH. Governors across New England and New York have declared states of emergency, and all cars and trucks -- except emergency vehicles -- must now be off Massachusetts and Connecticut roadways. A similar ban in Rhode Island took effect at 5 p.m. Violating that ban could incur a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $500 fine. By Friday night, the storm had already led to hundreds of cancellations of public school classes to sporting events. The storm even prompted the cancellation of ACT tests, for would-be college students, around the Northeast. Utility companies tried to get a head start on the storm, by having additional crews ready to respond to outages caused by downed power lines. The fear is that, as happened after Sandy, such outages could persist for days. Still, for all the alarms being raised, the mayor of Boston -- which forecasters expected would be the city hardest hit by the storm -- said he expected residents of his community and others to hunker down and weather the storm. Said Mayor Thomas Menino, ""We are hardy New Englanders."" 5 ways to keep your phone charged in a power outage .

"(CNN) -- Angelina Jolie knows that were her mother still alive, she would have been proud. While receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 Governors Awards on Saturday, the Academy Award-winning actress paid an emotional tribute to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died in 2007 of ovarian cancer. Jolie said during her acceptance speech that her mother was very supportive of her career, driving her daughter to auditions and waiting for her for hours. She was also instrumental in inspiring her daughter's humanitarian endeavors, Jolie said. ""Above all, she was very clear that nothing would mean anything if I didn't live a life of use to others,"" Jolie said. "" And I didn't know what that meant for a long time. It was only when I began to travel and look and live beyond my home that I understand my responsibility to others."" Hollywood turned out for the event where Steve Martin, Angela Lansbury and costume designer Piero Tosi also received Oscars honoring their careers. Jolie told CNN on the red carpet that the honor was ""very exciting, but it's also .. it's very humbling to receive anything like this that touches on humanitarian issues when there's so many crises going on around the world."" ""I see it as a 'you're on the right track, but there's a lot more to do,' so I'm glad. I feel like I have so much more to learn and so much more I should be doing to help others,"" she said. ""Especially at this time, with so much happening in Syria and the Philippines, and everywhere else, so it's a bittersweet evening.""

"(CNN) -- For decades, the attempts at health care reform have aimed to increase access. The United States is one of the few industrialized nations in the world that does not provide universal health care to its citizens. And repeatedly, those who oppose it have been forced to argue that access isn't the problem some make it out to be. Why? The emergency department, they say. After all, it is a commonly held belief that no one can be denied care there. So -- in essence -- everyone can get free health care if they need it. We have a universal system after all. That, of course, is not true. It's not even close. Let's start with the idea that emergency rooms must provide you care. What's important to remember is that you can't be refused emergency care. That's because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that any hospital that takes Medicare or Medicaid must check you for emergent conditions and treat them if they exist. Since nearly every hospital in the country takes federal funds from one of these programs, nearly all hospitals are subject to EMTALA. But ""emergency medical condition"" has a pretty narrow definition. It includes active labor for women and acute conditions that would cause death, serious bodily organ harm or serious bodily function impairment if they were not treated right away. If politicians are meaning to say that women have universal access to delivery care, then I suppose there's an element of truth to that. But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department. If they are saying that we have universal access if we're acutely having a heart attack, then I suppose there's truth to that as well. But there's no such access for lipid panels, stress tests or prescriptions for cholesterol medications that might help you avoid the heart attack in the first place. If you're acutely obstructed by massively advanced colon cancer, it's likely you can get emergency surgery to end the blockage. But your cancer is likely too far advanced to cure at that point. Moreover, you're not going to get chemotherapy in the emergency department nor could you have gotten the colonoscopy that might have detected the cancer far earlier. You can't get preventive care in the emergency department. You can't get screened for a host of disorders. You can't get treatment for your depression there or really for any chronic mental disorders. You can't get help with your child's autism, ADHD or developmental delay. And even if you could, it wouldn't be free. That's the second and perhaps more misunderstood part of this emergency department misconception. The costs of treatment in the emergency room are not quickly dismissed or written off. You'll get that emergent care, but you'll also be charged for it. And hospitals aren't going to let that go easily. A recent article in the New York Times detailed how Accretive Health, a medical debt collector, is using aggressive tactics such as confronting patients in their hospital beds to collect the money owed for even emergent care. The article also describes how collection agencies have long been used to go after patients after they've left the treatment facility. In some cases, patients were even confronted and stalled by debt collectors as they entered the emergency department on some later occasion so that the company could collect on old bills before more care was offered. An even more recent story covered by Kaiser Health News and NPR reported on a family of four sued by its local nonprofit hospital. The family earned about $25,000 a year -- below the poverty line -- but the parents did not qualify for Medicaid in Ohio. It seems that the hospital had sued almost 1,600 people for unpaid medical bills from 2009 to 2011. Further, the piece reported, ""[w]hile Ohio has a law that prevents foreclosures based on medical debt alone, it is legal for hospitals to garnish patient wages, attach bank accounts and get a lien on any future earnings, including from the sale of a house."" It might even be worse in North Carolina, where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40,000 patients from 2005 to 2010. This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax-exempt status. A recent review found that three hospitals in Illinois were providing a very small amount of care for free or at discounted rates. This has led to a number of facilities losing their nonprofit status and legislators to try to pass new laws requiring specify charity care minimums for nonprofit status. Before you get all riled up, I understand that hospitals need money to run. The American Hospital Association reports that hospitals lost upward of $40 billion in unpaid bills in 2010 alone. I'm not suggesting care should be given out freely or that hospitals should be forced to operate at a loss. But let's acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care, even in the emergency room. If they can't pay those bills, their credit can be ruined. Medical bills are a very significant cause of bankruptcy in this country. So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues. And, while they will provide that lifesaving care to you even if you have no insurance and no money, they will send you a bill. And if you can't pay, it may cause you, and your family, financial ruin. That's a far cry from universal health care, and nothing to brag about. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: Opponents of health reform say emergency rooms give health care to all .
Not true, he says. ERs can't refuse emergency care but not required to give other care .
He says other misconception is treatment costs easily written off; in fact, billers will pursue .
Carroll: Yes, hospitals need money; important to realize ER care no substitute for reforms ."
"(CNN) -- UPS on Friday finished delivering its backlog of holiday packages, company spokeswoman Natalie Godwin told CNN. The company earlier this week said that the volume of packages in its system exceeded its capacity, causing delays. The delays meant that some packages were not delivered before Christmas, despite promises by some retailers. UPS did not provide numbers, but the spokeswoman said the backlog was cleared Friday. ""Yes, the holiday packages have been delivered,"" Godwin said. The company considered Christmas Day deliveries as an emergency measure, but ""after much thought and consideration"" decided not to ask drivers to work on the holiday. The delays angered many customers, who took to social media to vent their frustrations. The company said that previous severe weather in the Dallas area had already created a backlog, and the holiday volume proved too much. FedEx was late with some deliveries as well, but called them ""isolated incidents."" On Saturday, FedEx reported that ""any isolated issues are resolved.""

"Lancaster, Texas (CNN) -- About 200 homes were destroyed and 650 were damaged by violent tornadoes in northern Texas, an American Red Cross spokeswoman said Wednesday, a day after the storms tore through one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas. Spokeswoman Anita Foster said Wednesday that their teams are still in the field assessing the damage and that she expects final tallies late Wednesday or early Thursday. Between six and 13 tornadoes may have touched down in Dallas, Arlington and the surrounding area Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Dallas-Fort Worth said. The number is an estimate because crews are still surveying damage across the area. There are no reports of deaths so far, the mayors of Dallas and Arlington said. Preliminary ratings of damage to one subdivision near Forney, just east of Dallas, suggests the tornado there rated up to EF-3, the National Weather Service forecast office in Fort Worth said. Wind speed was estimated to have been as high as 150 miles per hour in the town, it said. Tornadoes can rate up to an EF-5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which uses damage to calculate the storm's rating. Other tornadoes that touched down in the area Tuesday rated EF-1 and EF-2, according to the weather service. Three people were taken to a hospital in Arlington and at least 150 homes were destroyed there, Mayor Robert Cluck said. ""We've dodged a bullet,"" he said. ""We've done the primary search. We feel as though we have everybody now, but they won't give up until they have done all the other searches."" Dallas mayor: It's a 'miracle' ""It was like 'The Wizard of Oz,' "" said Gwen Dabbs, who was not able to make it to an interior room before the storm blew her windows out. She huddled in a corner of her living room covered with blankets as the tornado passed. ""My body is sore from being in the corner. But I don't have not a cut, not a scratch, and I'm so thankful. Thank you, Lord,"" she said. Massive hail pounded the area before the tornadoes touched down. ""Once the hail stopped, our electricity went out. I thought, 'That's it, we need to get into the bathtub,'"" said Nicole Lawrence said. ""It's only by God's grace that I'm here."" Lawrence said her home was reduced to rubble. She took shelter in a bathroom with her two sons, who covered their mother with their bodies to avoid debris. By the time the tornado had swept through, all that was left of her house was her son's tuxedo hanging in what used to be a closet. He was planning to wear it to the prom. Hail damaged more than 100 aircraft at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport, spokesman David Magana said. About 250 departures and 250 arrivals were canceled Wednesday after the storm, he said. In all, about 1,400 passengers spent the night in the terminals. The airport passed out cots, blankets and pillows to those sleeping there, Magana said. Thousands of others went to local hotels, he said. Airport officials Wednesday were asking travelers to check with their airlines before arriving at the airport. Eric Gould was aboard his flight and ready for takeoff Tuesday when the pilot announced a delay. Suddenly, the skies opened up, unleashing rain and hail as big as golf balls. ""The noise of ice cubes hitting the aluminum exterior of a 757 was as deafening as it was frightening,"" he said. ""Imagine the sound of dropping a bucket of ice cubes onto a metal-roof shed for about 10 minutes straight."" In Lancaster, south of Dallas, roofs were stripped to bare plywood. About 300 buildings were damaged, according to the city's mayor. A citywide curfew was in place. CNN affiliate WFAA broadcast video of tractor-trailers lifted and flipped like matchsticks. Ominous clouds darkened the skies. In one picture at a freight truck depot on the south side of Dallas, a twister flung semitrailers high into the air and hundreds of feet from their parking spots. Lot owner Wisconsin-based Schneider National Trucking Co. said there were no injuries at the facility, but about 100 pieces of equipment were damaged. ""The storm's impact to freight, our customers and our operations overall appear to be minimal -- a remarkable outcome in light of the force of the storm,"" the company said in a statement. A tractor weighs 20,000 pounds. An empty trailer weighs 14,000 pounds, while a full one weighs about 46,000, a Schneider spokesman said. CNN's Henry Hanks, Ed Lavandera, Matt Smith, Dana Ford, Chad Myers, Joe Sutton and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: About 200 homes were destroyed and 650 damaged, the Red Cross says .

"(CNN) -- It's going to take more than free beer, gift cards and iPads to convince uninsured young adults that opting out of health coverage under Obamacare is a good decision. Recently, Generation Opportunity, a conservative group, was down in Florida hosting swag-filled events at the University of Miami encouraging young people to do just that. But health care is too important for our generation to opt out. We recently met with Emily W. Wright, who suffers from aching pain caused by endometriosis and has been putting off badly needed surgery for the past five years because she could never afford health insurance, particularly with a pre-existing condition. Now, under Obamacare, she can afford a high quality, affordable plan and can get the treatment she needs. Too many young adults, like Emily, lack health insurance. Polls show that young people value coverage and see it as something they need, they just have not been able to afford it. And with fewer employers offering young workers health care benefits, the need for affordable coverage has never been greater. Luckily, the increased competition among insurers on the health insurance marketplace as well as new tax credits are making health insurance for the young uninsured much more affordable. On its face, opting out of insurance under Obamacare makes no sense. Paying for financial insecurity is dumb. Purchasing health coverage is like buying a $10 umbrella when you see rain in the forecast. If you don't purchase the umbrella, not only do you risk getting soaked from head to toe, you could end up ruining your new favorite pair of sneakers or iPhone, costing you a lot more than just $10. In the same way, at some point everyone gets sick and needs health insurance coverage, even those of us who are young and seem healthy. Obamacare provides decent coverage we can actually afford. If you look at Miami, where Generation Opportunity recently took its Opt Out campaign, competition is so strong that consumers on HealthCare.gov will be able to choose between over 100 plans offered by seven insurance carriers. For example, a 27-year-old person living in Miami earning $25,000 annually will be able to buy a plan for as little as $87 per month. The young uninsured population is largely low income; not surprisingly, cost is their greatest impediment to getting covered. In Florida, the average uninsured 18- to 34-year-old earns about $14,659 annually. Since premium tax credits are determined on a sliding scale based on income, most young people will pay far less because they will have access to greater subsidies. In fact, a recent study from the Department of Health and Human Services found that nearly 7 in 10 single, uninsured young people looking to purchase coverage on the marketplace could qualify for a plan that would cost them under $100 a month. Based on data from the Census' Current Population Survey, we estimate 605,000 currently uninsured 18- to 34-year-olds in Florida could qualify for reduced-cost coverage thanks to automatic monthly premium tax credits. If the state legislature agreed to expand the its Medicaid program, nearly 590,000 currently uninsured young Floridians could be eligible for free care. It is true that enrollment has been slowed down by initial glitches on the health exchange website, but we have seen dramatic improvements in the site already. The past two weeks have seen a big uptick in enrollment. Prior to the Affordable Care Act's passage, too many Americans relied on lousy coverage not even worthy of the term insurance. Seventy-eight percent of medical debt-related bankruptcy filers actually had insurance. In an effort to provide consumers with greater financial security, the Department of Health and Human Services identified 10 essential health benefits that all plans on HealthCare.gov must offer consumers. These benefits, like maternity and newborn care, prescription drug and mental health coverage, are particularly important to young people. For instance, according to a 2013 study, young people have a disproportionate need to access mental health services. So don't let the opt-outers fool you into thinking that plans purchased outside the exchange will have the same level of comprehensive coverage or satisfy the mandate. The worst-case scenario is buying low-quality coverage that doesn't cover what you need and still having to pay the individual penalty. Young people should take the time to learn more about their new coverage options, encourage their friends to do the same, and enroll in a plan that fits their needs. Generation Y shouldn't gamble when it comes to their health -- especially when Obamacare makes health insurance coverage so affordable. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Smith.","A conservative group tried to encourage young Floridians to opt out of Obamacare .
Aaron Smith: Health care is too important for Generation Y to forgo .
He says in Miami, people can choose between over 100 competitive health plans .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- ""Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States,"" is something I heard a lot growing up in Mexico in the 1980s. How that saying, first coined by President Porfirio Diaz around the turn of the 20th century, resonates today. With the U.S. election next door, Mexico seems not only far from God, but forgotten. In the past six years, 60,000 people have died in drug-related violence. Some say the death toll could be as high as 100,000. Yet the violence here didn't make it into the last U.S. presidential debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. We may share a 2,000 mile border, but the view from here -- notwithstanding our trade relationship and the hunger for drugs in the U.S. that is fueling the bloodshed and flooding my country with weapons -- is that we're truly off the radar. Map: World weighs in on U.S. election . ""We can't blame the U.S. for the violence in Mexico,"" says Anabel Hernandez, an investigative journalist who has put her life on the line writing about Mexico's drug lords. ""We have to look at our own corruption, the terrible impunity and lack of justice. We have to fix these problems ourselves, not wait for Obama or Romney. But that Mexico didn't even warrant one line in the last debate, when we have thousands dead, and even two CIA agents nearly killed in an ambush recently -- that tells you that the U.S.-- Mexico relationship is not going to change."" So much has happened in Mexico since outgoing President Felipe Calderón of the National Action Party (PAN) declared war on organized crime in 2006 that it's hard to keep pace with how much the country has changed. Hard to come to grips with the pain of families I've met during my years covering the drug war -- whose fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters have come to an untimely and tragic end. Postcard: Is Obama still Kenya's favorite son? Because it is hard to understand how we got here, I think back to the time when I was a child here -- back then, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dominated Mexico -- and miles of walls across the country had the PRI logo painted in Mexico's flag colors of green, white and red. One party, one ideology. One powerful broadcaster that fed us party propaganda. That was just the way it was. Very early on, during family trips to Texas, I learned that the U.S. meant choice. In the U.S. you could get a whole range of shoes, not just the boxy and nerdy pre-NAFTA shoes available to schoolchildren in Mexico. It meant playing Pac-Man, watching the film ""E.T.,"" not being spoon-fed soppy telenovelas. But the best, in my view: Snickers and Milky Ways, not the slim, omnipresent Carlos V chocolate bars available back home. Postcard: Nigerians enjoy election soap opera . The electoral process in Mexico back then was just like its chocolate, not only insipid but worse -- a foregone conclusion. What we looked forward to was the ""dedazo,"" when the president would figuratively wag his finger in the direction of his successor thereby naming his replacement. Meanwhile in the U.S., elections seemed much more colorful. One of my first memories of a U.S. election was of Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer from Georgia who talked about human rights vs. Ronald Reagan, the actor from California who talked about the ""Evil Empire."" Here were two very different men with two very different ideologies. In contrast, the stream of gray men running Mexico endured. This period was marked by a couple of national tragedies -- the nationalization of the banks in 1982, and the calamitous 1985 earthquake, which rocked the PRI to its core. Postcard: Obama finds support among Chavistas . In 1994, on the eve of the Zapatista rebellion, Mexico joined the North American Free Trade Agreement and for better or for worse, you could eventually get Snickers bars in nearly every shop corner. At the same time the media was becoming freer and more robust. In Mexico we have tended to see the U.S. elections through the prism of trade, as with NAFTA, or through immigration, as one out of every 10 Mexicans lives in the U.S. The 9/11 terrorist attacks shifted George W. Bush's focus from immigration to waging war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mexico, understandably, was not a priority. Fast forward to 2006, a little over five years into our nascent democracy with the PAN in power after 71 years of autocratic PRI rule: Five severed heads were rolled into a nightclub in Uruapan, Michoacán. We were all stunned. This sort of thing didn't happen under the PRI, and the violence has continued unabated to this day. Postcard: Why Berliners, U.S. are kindred spirits . ""There have been 30,000 killed in Syria and 60,000 killed in Mexico, many of whom the government says belonged to criminal groups. Yet Mexico didn't figure in the debate. It's shocking, appalling and disturbing,"" says Sergio Aguayo, a political analyst here. ""If Mexico had been mentioned it may have been in the 'failed state' category along with Pakistan,"" counters Andrés Martinez of the New America Foundation. ""So a mention is not always a good thing."" In recent years I've travelled back and forth to the front lines of the drug war, but I always return to the safety of Mexico City, which so far seems to be cocooned from the bloodshed. Postcard: War-scarred Baghdad has little faith in election . But despite living in Mexico City today, it's hard not to see everything -- including the U.S. election -- through the very dark spectacles of the drug war. ""That's exactly the problem,"" says Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard, from the left-of-center Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). His government says it has significantly decreased crime in the last six years -- an improvement from when Mexico City used to be a hotbed of crime. Today victims of the drug war are taking refuge here, and even journalists from violence-ridden states are seeking exile in the capital. There is no denying that Mexico City is going through some sort of renaissance. Not only are the days of rampant kidnappings behind us, the capital's also become more liberal, more culturally rich and more tolerant. Postcard: Obama's 'hope' a mirage for hostile Pakistanis . Yet, I tell Ebrard, Mexico City only seems safe because we're comparing it to a level of violence we never had in the rest of the country. ""Imagine if we had a different strategy -- the tactic of confrontation -- to get rid of crime,"" Ebrard told me. ""We'd have more blood."" As I write surrounded by boxes before an impending move to London, I see the PRI's comeback with President elect Enrique Peña Nieto as a direct result of the PAN's failure. And I see Mexico City as a reflection of what the rest of the country can one day become. As for God, he's still very far away from here. And the U.S. elections? Largely irrelevant to most Mexicans, except for Eduardo Cruz, a Mexico City taxi driver who put it this way: ""It doesn't matter who wins the U.S. elections, they just better send the loser to sort things out here!""","Brutal drug war in Mexico not mentioned in U.S. presidential debate .

"London (CNN) -- Seamus Heaney, the poet whose deeply felt descriptions of rural life in Ireland managed to carry larger echoes of the island's violent sectarian split, died Friday at the age of 74, his publisher said. Heaney died in Dublin, Ireland, after a short illness, the publishing house Faber & Faber announced on behalf of his family. One of the most widely read poets of the past hundred years, Heaney carried the long lineage of Irish authorship into an era of violence that marked Ireland for much of the later twentieth century. ""We are blessed to call Seamus Heaney our own and thankful for the gift of him in our national life,"" Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said Friday. ""He belongs with Joyce, Yeats, Shaw and Beckett in the pantheon of our greatest literary exponents."" Heaney joined three of those writers -- William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, and Samuel Beckett -- as a recipient of the Nobel literature prize. The 1995 citation noted Heaney's ""works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past"" as a reason for bestowing the honor on a fourth Irishman. Born in 1939 on a farm in Country Londonderry, in Northern Ireland, Heaney's work, which relied heavily on personal observations, evoked the island's rural heritage at close range. The eldest of nine children, Heaney -- a Catholic -- described his father to an interviewer in 1994 as a ""creature of the archaic world"" who ""would have been entirely at home in a Gaelic hill-fort."" In ""Follower,"" from the collection ""Death of a Naturalist,"" Heaney recalled being brought up around country farmers, like his father, whom he idealized -- but who later in life came to represent a bygone era: . I wanted to grow up and plough, . To close one eye, stiffen my arm. All I ever did was follow . In his broad shadow round the farm. I was a nuisance, tripping, falling, . Yapping always. But today . It is my father who keeps stumbling . Behind me, and will not go away. The family spoke English, not Irish, and Heaney described in interviews living in a home without many books. He attended a boarding school in Derry beginning at age 12 and studied for an English literature degree at Queen's University in Belfast. Derry -- ruled by Protestants, despite a majority Catholic population -- would eventually become the center of Northern Ireland's decades-long period of sectarian violence. Heaney moved in 1972 to Dublin, where he wrote poems that reflected the struggle navigating between the Irish nationalist movement, which he supported, and an allegiance to his birthplace in the British-ruled North. After ""Death of a Naturalist,"" Heaney's reputation began to grow, and he eventually became the rare poet to achieve both critical acclaim and popular appeal. His collections featured a range of themes, from lighthearted love verses to deeply personal meditations on Ireland's Troubles. His collection ""North"" was released in 1975, one of the bloodiest years of Ireland's sectarian conflict. In it, Heaney mined the roots of Irish division, often offering a grim assessment of a nation facing constant misfortune. ""Coherent miseries, a bite and sup, / We hug our little destiny again,"" he wrote in ""Whatever You Say Say Nothing."" Decades after ""North"" was published, Heaney characterized himself as a poet writing from his own experience rather than a political agenda. ""What matters is the shape-making impulse, the emergence and convergence of an excitement into a wholeness,"" he said. ""I don't think I'm a political poet with political themes and a specifically political understanding of the world."" But he nonetheless held a lasting place within the history of Ireland's struggle for peace, offering his deeply personal view of the Troubles to a worldwide audience. ""His mind, heart, and his uniquely Irish gift for language made him our finest poet of the rhythms of ordinary lives and a powerful voice for peace. And he was a good and true friend,"" Bill and Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. president and first lady, wrote in a statement Friday. As president, Bill Clinton helped broker the 1999 Good Friday Agreement that established Northern Ireland's system of government. Later in life, Heaney turned to producing new translations of well-known works of Anglo-Saxon literature, including a well-received version of ""Beowulf."" He worked as a professor of poetry at Oxford University for five years beginning in 1989, and held various posts at Harvard University for more than two decades. Heaney is survived by his wife, Marie, and three children. People we've lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Something emerged from the sun after Comet ISON made its closest approach today. Is it the ISON? NASA scientists, professional and amateur astronomers are analyzing images from NASA satellites to learn more about comet's fate. ""We haven't seen any definite nucleus yet,"" said Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the Space Science Institute and NASA's Comet ISON Observing Campaign. Members of the group's Facebook page spotted what may be the remnants of ISON in satellite images soon after experts at NASA's Google Hangout on ISON said it looked like the comet had broken up and melted into the sun. Comet watchers will have to wait until ISON, or what's left of it, are a bit further from the sun to get more information. ""What we see here is the dust tail emerging first, pointing away from the sun,"" Yanamandra-Fisher said. But it is not clear if the comet's core, or nucleus, is intact, or if it's just a bunch of dust. Observers were hoping that ISON would survive its Thanksgiving Day close encounter with the sun and emerge to put on a big sky show in December. A fleet of spacecraft watched ISON plunge toward the sun, including NASA's STEREO satellite, the European Space Agency/NASA SOHO spacecraft and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter. When they get near the sun, they warm up and spew some of the gas and dirt, creating tails that can stretch for thousands of miles. Most comets are in the outer part of our solar system. When they get close enough for us to see, scientists study them for clues about how our solar system formed. Astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok discovered ISON in September 2012 using a telescope near Kislovodsk, Russia, that is part of the International Scientific Optical Network. ISON -- officially named C/2012 S1 -- was 585 million miles away at the time.

"(CNN) -- Disciplinary proceedings were launched Friday against Croatia international Josip Simunic for alleged pro-Nazi chants after his country had sealed qualification for the 2014 World Cup, FIFA confirmed. In the wake of Croatia's 2-0 win over Iceland in a playoff match Tuesday to seal their passage to Brazil, Simunic grabbed a microphone and addressed the crowd at the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb. He said loudly ""za dom"" -- translated from Croatian as ""for the homeland"" -- four times, gaining an immediate response from fans, who chanted ""spremni"", meaning ""ready"". The chants have been associated with the feared pro-Nazi Ustase regime, which controlled Croatia during World War II. According to reports in Croatia, the 35-year-old Simunic has been fined 25,000 kunas ($4,400) by prosecutors in Zagreb for inciting racial unrest. World governing body FIFA has also felt compelled to act. ""We can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened concerning the case,"" it said in a statement. Dinamo Zagreb captain Simunic has denied any political intent behind his impromptu celebration. ""The thought that anyone could associate me with any form of hatred or violence terrifies me,"" he said in a statement on Dinamo's official website. ""If anyone understood my cries differently, or negatively, I hereby want to deny they contained any political context. ""They were guided exclusively by my love for my people and homeland, not hatred and destruction."" The veteran defender, who has spent much of his club career in the German Bundesliga, has been a mainstay for Croatia since making his debut in 2001. Both FIFA and European football's governing body UEFA have warned and fined Croatia on several occasions for the racist behavior of their fans. Its football federation also reacted to Simunic's actions, with chief Davor Suker describing them as ""an inappropriate gesture"" and hinting at further action. In September, Simunic was the center of further controversy during Croatia's qualifying match against bitter rivals Serbia. With the scores tied at 1-1, a result which all but ended their chances of automatic qualification for Brazil, Simunic scythed down Serbia's Miralem Sulejmani as he burst clear, earning an immediate red card. In other football news Friday, UEFA fined both Marseille and Napoli for incidents involving flares during Champions League games between the sides. French giants Marseille were hit with a euro 58,000 ($78.600) sanction after their fans threw flares and other objects on to the pitch during their home fixture on October 22 and in the away game at Napoli's San Paolo stadium on November 6. Serie A Napoli, who won both games, were hit with a euro 55,000 (74,500) fine for the same behavior by their supporters.","FIFA start disciplinary proceedings against Josip Simunic .
