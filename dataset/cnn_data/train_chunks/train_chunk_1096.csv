"West Ham installed a ring of extra security around Sam Allardyce during a torrid period for the Hammers boss last season. Sportsmail can reveal that with home fans turning against their unpopular supremo as his side languished in the lower reaches of the Premier League, the club beefed-up security around the home dugout. A stadium management briefing before the Hammers’ home clash with Sunderland on December 13, 2013, reveals that Allardyce had complained to staff about foul and abusive language aimed at him and his players from around the bench area. West Ham employed six security staff at the Boleyn Ground to eject fans abusing manager Sam Allardyce . Hammers fans hold up a banner in April last year asking for Allardyce's time at West Ham to come to an end . The club employed three staff to sit either side of Allardyce with strict instructions to eject any abusive fans . It adds that, as a result, stadium management decided to bring in six extra security personnel and ‘eject if needed’. The briefing tells stewards: ‘The manager has complained about foul and abusive language aimed at him and our players from around the dugout area. For all matches we have employed 6 extra security personnel from Jumbo who will sit 3 either side and eject if needed. THERE ARE TO BE NO WARNINGS JUST EJECTIONS’ It also states that one supporter has already been thrown out for such behaviour. The message ends: ‘THIS MUST BE STRICTLY ENFORCED ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY’S MATCH AS GIVEN THE WRONG RESULT WE COULD BE IN THE BOTTOM 3’. An uninspiring 0-0 draw against the bottom-of-the-table Black Cats was enough to keep Allardyce’s men outside the drop zone. Two months later, Swansea City were the visitors on February 1. The tables have turned for the 60-year-old as he has guided the Hammers to seventh in the Premier League . Adrian celebrates after scoring the winning penalty to send West Ham into the fourth round of the FA Cup . The Spanish goalkeeper celebrates with West Ham teammates after the victory over Everton on Tuesday . With the Hammers now in the bottom three, the safety briefing sent out a similar message and added that the extra security was still in place if needed. But the home side, inspired by two goals from Kevin Nolan, won 2-0 and there were no incidents against Allardyce in a match which signalled the end of his opposite manager Michael Laudrup’s tenure at the Swans. West Ham stuck by Allardyce, went on to avoid the drop and after a successful summer in the transfer market are now in a position to challenge for a place in Europe. The high-flying Hammers declined to say whether the extra measures were still in place but it is thought to be unlikely. A West Ham source said: ‘A message in every matchday programme states the use of threatening behaviour, foul or abusive language is strictly forbidden in any part of the stadium and will result in arrest and/or ejection from the stadium. The Club want all supporters to be able to enjoy watching West Ham in a safe and secure environment.’","Sportsmail reveals West Ham's strict instruction to stewards .

"Gareth Southgate has effectively ruled out selecting Raheem Sterling for this summer’s European Under 21 finals. England head coach Roy Hodgson said in November that Southgate would have priority when picking his squad for the tournament in June, even though the seniors have a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia that month. But Southgate said: ‘Realistically, Raheem has become a very important player for the senior team and for Liverpool. There is a huge demand on him. Part of my role is looking at the development of individuals and I’m not convinced another tournament in the summer would be right for him. Raheem Sterling won't be picked for the European Under 21 Championships, says Gareth Southgate . Sterling, pictured in action against Slovenia, is expected to turn out for the senior squad next June instead . England Under 21 manager Southgate says Sterling doesn't need more tournament experience . ‘If he plays another 20 or 30 games before the end of the season, I really can’t see him coming. God forbid, if something was to happen and the dynamic changed, in that he needed games, of course you would look at it. 'But he has been to the Under 17s World Cup in Mexico and a World Cup last year in Brazil. He’s had tournament experience. ‘Of course he is a super player and, from a selfish point of view, it would be easy to try and grab all of those. But we have to look at the bigger picture.’ Sterling has featured 34 times already for club and country so far this season . Sterling last played for the Under 21s in a 9-0 win over San Marino in November 2013. But while Southgate, who on Thursday signed a 12-month contract extension, is sure about Sterling, 20, the picture around Ross Barkley is less clear. The Everton midfielder won his sole Under 21 cap against Scotland in August 2013 but he could be involved in Euro 2015, particularly if he drops down to the Under 21s for the March friendlies against the Czech Republic and Germany. Everton midfielder Ross Barkley's England future remains uncertain . Southgate was at Goodison Park last Saturday to watch John Stones and Barkley in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Manchester City. The midfielder’s form has been indifferent and while there is no disputing his talent, he is not playing well enough to be an England regular at the highest level. ‘Ross is interesting as we haven’t had a chance to work with him yet,’ said Southgate. ‘He is someone myself and Roy will talk about. I will also talk to Roberto Martinez, who I get on with very well. The boys who have got us to this point are a tight group and I have to think about the dynamic.’ Alongside England manager Roy Hodgson (right), Southgate addresses the media at Wembley in 2013 . The FA have been looking to renew Southgate’s terms since England breezed past Croatia in the Euro 2015 play-off last October. He had 18 months left on his contract but this deal now runs until after the 2017 tournament . As yet, though, there is no indication about whether his influential assistant Steve Holland will commit to another qualifying cycle, given his workload with Chelsea. ‘That would be down to him,’ said Southgate. ‘Chelsea have been really good. He has been invaluable to the way we work. But it is a massive commitment and he will look at it at the end of this cycle. He has been huge for me.’","Southgate says Raheem Sterling doesn't need more tournament experience .

"Ronny Deila  has insisted that he already has other striker options lined up should John Guidetti not agree a permanent switch to Celtic. The Parkhead club are thought to have some interest in Maccabi Tel Aviv forward Tal Ben Haim, but sources have played down reports in Israel linking the club with a £1.5million offer. Deila is still optimistic that a deal can be done to keep Guidetti at the end of his season-long loan from Manchester City. John Guidetti has failed to score for the Scottish champions in six matches but his confidence remains high . But he has also told the 22-year-old Swede that he is not the only name in the frame to strengthen their attacking options going forward. ‘Celtic also has options, it’s not all one-way,’ said Deila. ‘We have to work to get Guidetti, but he also has to be happy that we want him. It works two ways, always. ‘Playing at Celtic is a big thing and you can see that with other players who want to play for us. Celtic boss Ronny Deila has looked at other options should Guidetti not agree a permanent switch . ‘We have to look at different options if it doesn’t happen, but, hopefully, it happens and I’m positive we can do it. ‘Do I have other options? Yes, but anyway John is going to be here until the end of the season, so it’s not like we are losing him on February 1.’ Guidetti made a stunning start to life in Glasgow with 11 goals in his first 12 games, but then endured a five-game blank streak that saw him drop to the bench for Celtic’s 2-0 Premiership win against Kilmarnock 12 days ago. The Parkhead club are thought to have some interest in Maccabi Tel Aviv forward Tal Ben Haim (centre) However, speaking during last week’s training camp in Gran Canaria, the 22-year-old dismissed talk of any crisis of confidence. Instead, he boldly set his sights on becoming the first Celtic player to score a hat-trick against Rangers in 41 years when the clubs meet in a League Cup semi-final at Hampden a fortnight on Sunday. Ben Haim, meanwhile, is also reported to have attracted interest from Standard Liege, PAOK Salonika and Dynamo Kiev. It is claimed the 25-year-old is valued at around £1.75million.","John Guidetti is on a season-long loan from Manchester City .

"David Cameron was today accused of making 'pathetic excuses' for not wanting to take part in TV debates during the election campaign. Ed Miliband said the Prime Minister was 'frit' after joining Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage in insisting the Tories must not be allowed to block the clashes. In an unprecedented alliance, the Labour, Lib Dem and Ukip leaders have written identical letters to Mr Cameron suggesting he be 'empty chaired' by broadcasters if he does not give ground. Downing Street insists that the Green party should be allowed to take part, but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all. David Cameron was challenged over the debates during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today . Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage have stepped up pressure on David Cameron to agree to take part in the TV debates . Downing Street insists that the Green party should be allowed to take part, but this is being seen as an attempt to stop the debates happening at all. The Prime Minister said he would not sign up to a proposal from Britain's main broadcasters for the TV debates unless it was changed to include the Green Party. in bruising clashes in the Commons, Ed Miliband deployed Margaret Thatcher's famous barb by branding Mr Cameron 'frit'. The Labour leader pointed out that in 2010 Mr Cameron had condemned 'feeble' reasons for backing out of debates, and said 'no-one believed' his protests were genuine now. 'It is frankly a pathetic excuse. It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate. It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in,' Mr Miliband said. 'Is he really telling the people of Britain that he is going to seek to deny them the TV debate if he doesn't get to choose who is in them?' Mr Cameron hit back that Mr Miliband was 'chicken' for being unwilling to face off against Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage. 'I'm all for these debates but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is he frightened of debating the Green Party?' The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics say they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign. In October the main broadcasters set out plans for three debates, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage offered a slot in one contest for the first time. Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News would host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by Jeremy Paxman. The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010. ITV would host the four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time, chaired by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham. But last week Mr Cameron ruled out taking part unless the Green leader Natalie Bennett was included. When asked if it was correct that would not take part as it stands, Mr Cameron told ITV News: 'Correct.' The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown . Candidates: David Cameron and Ed Miliband . Host: Jeremy Paxman . Candidates: David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg . Host: David Dimbleby, . Candidates: David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg . Host: Julie Etchingham . More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time political leaders had gone head-to-head in Britain. Today's letters to Mr Cameron point out that he had 'enthusiastically endorsed' the idea when in opposition. Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage add: 'I believe it would be a major setback to our democratic processes if these debates were not repeated in 2015 because of one politician's unwillingness to participate. 'I hope you will agree that the decision as to who should take part in the televised debates should not be in the hands of any party leader, each of whom inevitably has their own political interests to defend. It must be a decision independently and objectively arrived at.' The leaders insisted the broadcasters were under strict obligations of political impartiality and had made an 'objective determination' about who should participate. 'While each of the other parties invited to take part in the debates has their own views on the proposal and the levels of participation offered and will continue to make their case in this regard, we all accept the independence and impartiality of the broadcasters and have committed to take part in the debates,' the letters added. 'It would be unacceptable if the political self-interest of one party leader were to deny the  public the opportunity to see their leaders debate in public. 'Therefore, if you are unwilling to reconsider, the three party leaders who have committed to participate will ask the broadcasters to press ahead with the debates and provide an empty podium should you have a last minute change of heart. 'These debates are not the property of the politicians and I do not believe the public will  accept lightly the prospect of any politician seeking to block them.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett has insisted she should be included in televised debates alongside Nigel Farage . Polling by YouGov shows how during 2014 Ukip overtook the Lib Dems, who are now also being challenged by the Greens . Downing Street said its position on the debates 'hasn't changed', insisting any multi party format must include the Green party and should take place outside main election campaign. A Conservative source said: 'It shows how desperate Miliband is to keep the Greens out - and stop them taking Labour votes - that he is prepared to team up with Nigel Farage and agree an identical letter they could both send.' Lib Dem election chief Lord Ashdown accused Mr Cameron of being 'frit'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Is it perfect for the Liberal Democrats? No, it's not, but in the interests of having these debates, we go ahead. 'What Mr Cameron is trying to do is hold us to ransom because it's not in his interests to go ahead with the debate. The idea that it's about the Greens is complete nonsense. 'Mrs Thatcher had a word for this: it's that he's frit and that's exactly what it is. Can you imagine Mrs Thatcher refusing to go and debate and using the Greens as cover to do so? 'I mean, even Gordon Brown, who didn't want to do this, in the end did it. So we can only draw the conclusion that Mr Cameron, frankly, has got less confident in his own ability to make his case than Gordon Brown had.' Mr Farage insisted there was no regulatory barrier to broadcasting without Mr Cameron. 'It is pretty clear that from the BBC's own editorial guidelines, you would be within your rights to hold these debates whether Mr Cameron turned up or not,' he told Radio 4's Today. 'In 2010 David Cameron did very badly in these debates and was seen to be the loser. And I have seen this week that he has launched the six main priorities for the Conservatives' general election campaign and he has completely ignored the issues of Europe and immigration. 'I feel very strongly he would rather not debate these things with me on national television.' A chicken hired to chase Tony Blair over his refusal to take part in a TV debate with John Major almost defected to Labour after seeing the party's leader close up, it emerged today. Former Conservative party aide Daniel Finkelstein said the actor hired to dress as a chicken was so impressed by Mr Blair during their encounters there were fears he would jump ship. Now a Tory peer and columnist, Lord Finkelstein made the revelation has proof that voters will take little notice of whether David Cameron takes part in the debate or not, adding: 'After all, even the chicken himself was resolutely unimpressed.' The Tory party hired a chicken in 1997 to stalk Tony Blair over his refusal to take in a TV debate with John Major . Writing in The Times, Lord Finkelstein said that in 1997 the Conservative party hired an actor to dress up as a chicken and follow Mr Blair around. 'Unfortunately, the more the actor saw of Mr Blair, the more he liked him. And so the idea took hold that the chicken might, as it were, cross the road. 'This would have been a PR disaster even greater than having involved ourselves in such a stupid stunt in the first place. 'So I was given a job. I was to have lunch with the chicken on a regular basis and keep him onside. I proved myself worthy of the trust placed in me.'","Labour, Lib Dem and Ukip leaders round on Tory for trying to duck debate .

"Former Rangers star Gennaro Gattuso has thrown his hat in the ring to become the next Hamilton manager. Sportsmail understands the Italian World Cup winner is one of more than 50 applicants to replace Alex Neil – despite the position not yet being advertised. Centre-back Martin Canning has been placed in interim charge, but Gattuso is thought to have made known his wish to be included in considerations for a permanent appointment. World Cup winner and ex-Rangers midfielder Gattuso has had a patchy managerial career to date . The 37-year-old has endured a turbulent managerial career to date, spending three months as player-coach of Swiss side FC Sion and being sacked after six Serie B games in charge of Palermo. His most recent stint was with OFI Crete in the Greek Super League. The AC Milan icon was appointed last June but resigned in December after insisting the financial crisis at the club left him feeling ‘unable to go on any longer’. He had signalled his intent to step down two months earlier but reconsidered after pleas from OFI supporters. Gattuso’s wife is from Glasgow and a move back to Scotland has long carried emotional appeal for the ex-midfielder, who has spoken in the past of his desire to manage Rangers. Italian midfielder Gattuso spent 15 months at Rangers early in his career . He spent 15 months at Ibrox early in his career before a hugely-successful 13-year spell with Milan, where he won two Champions League titles. Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald last night refused to confirm that Gattuso had put himself forward. ‘We would never divulge any applications or break confidentialities,’ he said. ‘We are in a process and could possibly look at a different structure going forward, one that would suit everyone at the club.’ Gattuso enjoyed hugely-successful 13-year spell with Milan, where he won two Champions League titles . Frankie McAvoy is currently assisting Canning but will leave to join Neil at Norwich City at the end of the month. The Accies board are likely to want a succession plan in place before then. Canning remains in the frame but the net will also be cast wider to ensure the best possible candidates are sourced. McAvoy’s importance to the both the first-team and youth structures could mean a clutch of appointments in a revamped set-up at both senior and academy level. As well as riding high in the Premiership after promotion last season, Accies also top the Under-20 development league.","Gennaro Gattuso spent over a year at Rangers earlier on in his career .

"Charged: Laszlo Csatary was the world's most wanted Nazi for his alleged role in the Holocaust. He is accused of beating jews with his bare hands and a dog whip . The world's number one Nazi war crimes suspect has been arrested in Budapest. Laszlo Csatary, 97, was taken into custody in the Hungarian capital earlier today. He is accused of helping to organise the deportation of 15,700 Jews to the Auschwitz death camp during the Second World War. A spokesman for the public prosecutors office in Budapest today said: 'Csatary has been taken into custody.' He corrected an earlier . statement that had said the elderly man had been charged with war crimes. Further details are expected at a news conference later today. Csatary - full name Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary - is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's wanted list. During . the war, he was a senior police officer in Kosice, which at that time . was occupied by Nazi ally Hungary and is now in Slovakia. In . 1948, a Czechoslovakian court condemned Csatary, who the Wiesenthal . Center said was in charge of the Jewish ghetto in Kosice, to death in . absentia. But he had . made it to Canada, where he worked as an art dealer in Montreal and . Toronto until in the 1990s he was stripped of his citizenship there and . was forced to flee. He . ended up in Budapest where he has lived undisturbed ever since until the . Wiesenthal Center alerted Hungarian authorities last year, providing it . with evidence it said implicated Csatary in war crimes. He was then tracked down by the Sun newspaper, who photographed him after confronting him at his front door. Acting on the information provided by . the Wiesenthal Center, which was supplemented by fresh evidence last . week over the deportation of some 300 other Jews in 1941, prosecutors . began an investigation in September. A statement by prosecutors on Monday, however, appeared to limit the chances that the old man will end up in the dock. Accused: The 98-year-old is alleged to have been the chief of an internment camp for 12,000 Jews . Case: Csatary was a senior police officer at the time he is accused of committing the crimes . The . events 'took place 68 years ago in an area that now falls under the . jurisdiction of another country - which also with regard to the related . international conventions raises several investigative and legal . problems.' Efraim . Zuroff, the Wiesenthal Center's chief Nazi-hunter, said on Sunday that . he has been 'very upset and very frustrated' about the lack of action by . Hungarian authorities. The . fact that Csatary lived freely in Hungary for some 15 years and the . lack of progress by prosecutors also added to worries about the . direction of the EU member state under right-wing Prime Minister Viktor . Orban. Almost exactly a . year ago, a court in Budapest acquitted Hungarian Sandor Kepiro, 97, of . charges of ordering the execution of over 30 Jews and Serbs in the . Serbian town of Novi Sad in January 1942. The . Wiesenthal Center, which had also listed Kepiro as the most wanted Nazi . war criminal and helped bring him to court, described the verdict as an . 'outrageous miscarriage of justice'. Six weeks later Kepiro died. Up in arms: Demonstrators protest outside Csatary's Budapest home last year after prosecutors said investigating an aged Nazi war criminal is problematic because the events took place so long ago .

Slow progress by prosecutors has added to worries about the direction of Hungary under right-wing PM Viktor Orban (right) Prior to his arrest: The European Union of Jewish Students stand with their hands taped together in front of Csatary's home . Recent months have seen something of a . public rehabilitation of controversial figures, most notably of Miklos . Horthy, Hungary's dictator from 1920 until falling out with his . erstwhile ally Adolf Hitler in 1944. Anti-Semitic . writers like Albert Wass and Jozsef Nyiro, a keen supporter of the . brutal Arrow Cross regime installed in power by the Nazis in 1944, have . also been reintroduced into the curriculum for schools. Other . incidents include the verbal assault of a 90-year-old rabbi, Jozsef . Schweitzer, when a stranger came up to him in the street and said 'I . hate all Jews!' The . decision by the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, Orban ally Laszlo . Kover, to attend a ceremony in May honouring Nyiro, prompted Nobel . laureate Elie Wiesel to return Hungary's highest honour in disgust. Holocaust . survivor Mr Wiesel, 83, said: 'It has become increasingly clear that . Hungarian authorities are encouraging the whitewashing of tragic and . criminal episodes in Hungary's past.' The . speaker of Israel's Knesset followed this up by withdrawing an . invitation to Kover to a ceremony this week in Israel paying tribute to . Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved Jews during the war. Hell: Millions lost their lives at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Csatary is accused of being complicit in deporting 15,700 to their deaths . Csatary, the former police commander of the Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths . Laszlo Csatary is number one on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list of Nazi war criminals known to be alive and at large almost seven decades after the end of the Second World War. Csatary, 97, is listed by the Vienna-based Nazi-hunters as having 'helped organise the deportation to Auschwitz of approximately 15,700 Jews' from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1944. The top two names - Alois Brunner and Aribert Heim - are widely suspected to be dead. The following are the five top remaining names on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list: .","Laszlo Csatary, 97, was arrested in the Hungarian capital today .

"The San Diego Chargers needed to merely to beat Kansas City in their regular-season finale to seal a play-off spot for the second straight year. That's why Mike McCoy was so surprised by their terrible showing. The Chargers' coach watched in bewilderment as Philip Rivers was sacked seven times and picked off twice, Donald Brown was stuffed on a key fourth down late in the game, and the Chargers' season ended with a lackluster 19-7 loss to the Chiefs. 'For everything that was at stake, for us to play the way we did, get behind early on, and we got some rhythm going and we couldn't make that one play to get it going and turn on the momentum -- very disappointing,' McCoy said. 'We didn't play well.' Kurt Coleman intercepts a pass during the game against the San Diego Chargers at Arrowhead Stadium . Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers is sacked by Justin Houston - one of seven during a disastrous outing . The Chiefs played much better, though it ultimately didn't matter. They needed Baltimore to lose to Cleveland and Houston to lose to Jacksonville, but both teams rallied in the second half for victories. That gave the Ravens the AFC's final playoff spot. 'We end up missing the playoffs,' Chiefs coach Andy Reid said, 'so while it's fresh in the players' minds, it's important that they feel how important every game is in this league. There's so much parity in the league and these games are so close.' The Chargers (9-7) will look back on their season finale as one of wasted opportunities. Nick Novak missed a 52-yard field goal attempt late in the third quarter. Midway through the fourth, a touchdown pass to Eddie Royal was overturned by a video review when the ball appeared to skip off the turf - San Diego went for it on fourth down and Rivers threw incomplete. Then with about four minutes left, Donald Brown was stuffed on fourth-and-1 at the Chiefs 20. Rivers was intercepted for a second time in the closing seconds of the game. He finished with 291 yards passing to go over 4,000 yards in a season for the sixth time in his career. Branden Oliver added 71 yards rushing and a touchdown. 'It's tough when it ends. You never plan on it,' Rivers said. 'We didn't play our best. But you've got to give them credit. They beat us twice this year, so they were the better team.' Cleveland 10-20 Baltimore .

Cairo Santos kicked four field goals, and Chase Daniel played well in place of injured quarterback Alex Smith, throwing for 157 yards without an interception. The Chiefs' only touchdown came when wide receiver Dwayne Bowe fumbled inches shy of the goal line early in the second quarter. Tight end Travis Kelce recovered in the end zone, not only giving Kansas City a 10-0 lead, but keeping a dubious streak intact: No Chiefs wide receiver caught a TD pass all season, the first time in at least 50 years that has happened. 'I honestly didn't pay attention to that. I wanted to win,' Houston said of his record. 'I felt like everything was going to work out in our favor if we won, we'd be in the playoffs.' Kansas City started the season 7-3, but limped to the finish amid several injuries. The latest was to Smith, who lacerated his spleen in last week's loss to Pittsburgh. Even if the Chiefs made the playoffs, he likely would have been out until the Super Bowl. Injuries also crippled San Diego's postseason hopes. After starting the game without running back Ryan Mathews, wide receiver Keenan Allen and center Chris Watt, the banged-up Chargers watched right tackle D.J. Fluker walked slowly to the locker room late in the first half. He joined safety Marcus Gilchrist (elbow), cornerbackShareece Wright (head injury) and wide receiver Eddie Royal, who got hurt late in the game. The Chargers wound up losing three of their final four games. 'This is not a knock on anybody at all, but this is not the offense we expected to have at the end of training camp,' Rivers said. 'I know I have to play at a high level in these kind of games for us offensively to go. And it wasn't my best day.'","The Chargers needed to beat the Chiefs to reach the post-season for the second consecutive year .

"The Cincinnati Bengals intercepted Peyton Manning four times to clinch a playoff berth with a big-play filled 37-28 victory over the Denver Broncos on Monday. Playing in pouring rain, the Bengals staged a fourth-quarter recovery after blowing a 13-point lead to earn a fourth straight trip to the post-season. 'This one was big. We knew what we were up against... at home, playing on Monday Night in prime time,' Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton said. Denver Broncos' Peyton Manning was unable to help his side claim a win against the Cincinnati Bengals . Manning was intercepted four times during the match between the Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals . 'Our defence played great, especially when it counted.' Dre Kirkpatrick caught two interceptions for Cincinnati, who also enjoyed a big day on kick returns. The Bengals (10-4-1) can now seal the AFC North Division with a season-finale win against Pittsburgh next week. Denver (11-4), who had already clinched the AFC West, was hoping to maintain their push to enter the playoffs as the conference top seed but the loss conceded the number one spot to the New England Patriots. Manning threw for 311 yards but was unable to connect with his wide receivers when it mattered most. 'I had four interceptions, you're not going to beat very many good football teams (that way),' Manning said. 'We have to find a way to learn from this and play better next week.' Dre Kirkpatrick was in impressive form during the match between the Bengals and Broncos . In a wild affair, the Broncos woke up in the second half, with Manning tossing two third-quarter touchdowns to give the visitors a 28-27 edge. Brandon Tate lifted the Bengals midway through the fourth with a 49-yard punt return that helped them move back in front on Mike Nugent's 23-yard field goal. The Cincinnati defence struck the decisive blow in the final minutes as Kirkpatrick intercepted Manning and returned it 30 yards to help push the Bengals nine points ahead of a demoralised Denver team. Early on, it was the Cincinnati running game that led the way on a night where the Bengals lost standout wide receiver A.J. Green to an arm injury in the first quarter. Kirkpatrick celebrates his side's win after the 37-28 victory over the Denver Broncos on Monday . Jeremy Hill broke free for an 85-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, finishing with 147 yards on the night, and fellow back Giovani Bernard caught a 22-yard TD in the third to give the home side a 27-14 advantage. The win was a big relief for the Bengals, who have a reputation for failing in big games and have not won in the playoffs since 1990. 'We understand that it was the elephant in the room; we heard it all week,' Hill said. 'We knew tonight with the country watching that we had to show people we're serious.'","The Bengals intercepted Peyton Manning during a 37-28 victory .

"A match between Memphis Tigers and BYU Cougars ended with a mass brawl as the two sets of players decided to take aim at each other, ending in a bloody fight. The Tigers, who were participating in the inaugural Miami Beach Bowl, should have been celebrating their win over the notoriously straight-laced BYU Cougars, but the players ended up dealing physical blows. Some were even seen using their protective helmets as weapons in order to get the better of their opponents after the tense game. The field was flooded with Memphis and BYU players in a bloody fight as the final whistle blew . BYU player Kai Nacua is facing expulsion after he was caught on camera punching an opponent . It has been an embarrassment for Brigham Young University's college team, which is grappling to wedge itself into the upper echelons of league football - while promoting the school's Mormon values. The Memphis Tigers had just won their first game in nine years, defeating the BYU Cougars 55-48. But Christian Stewart, on the losing side, closed the game by throwing an interception. And havoc ensued. The Tigers' Chase Johnson was caught on camera swinging his helmet into the head BYU center Tejan Koroma - who was fighting off four other opponents. Meanwhile BYU defensive Kai Nacua could be seen punching the back of an opponent's head, and now faces expulsion.

It was a bloody conclusion to what had been an exhilarating and tense contest. Paxton Lynch, a Memphis quarterback, scored four touchdowns, went for another three and passed for more than 300 yards. BYU's Stewart threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns. Tom Holmoe, BYU athletics director, tweeted an apology: 'We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologise to Cougar Nation.' The outburst prompted a barrage of Twitter reaction and opinion columns in Salt Lake City, Utah, near where BYU is located. The Salt Lake Tribune's Gordon Monson wrote: 'It was sad. It was pathetic.' 'Totally disgusted with the BYU players complete lack of class,' one tweet read.

"Tournament host Ernie Els made the ideal start to his bid for a sixth South African Open title with an opening round of 67 on Thursday. Els carded six birdies and one bogey to set the clubhouse target of five under par at Glendower Golf Club in his native Johannesburg. The 45-year-old started on the back nine and recovered from a bogey on the 12th with birdies at the 13th, 14th and 16th to be out in 34, before picking up further shots on the second and fifth. Ernie Els tees off on his way to an opening round of 67 at the South African Open in Johannesburg . Els escapes from a bunker as he enjoys what he described as a 'nice' start to his home tournament . Els missed a good birdie chance on the seventh from 15 feet, but finished his round in style with a superb iron shot to two feet on the ninth for a closing birdie as he looks to make amends for a winless season in 2014 on both sides of the Atlantic. 'That was nice,' said Els, who failed to register a top-three finish on the European Tour last season for the first time since 1992. 'I was a little nervous here and there but it was so nice to play Glendower in front of my home crowd.' Els has reverted to a normal putter ahead of the ban on anchored strokes which comes into effect in 2016 and admitted short putts were 'still a little bit nerve-wracking'. However, the home favourite and four-time major winner was delighted with his iron shots on a course featuring thick rough surrounding the narrow fairways. Els carded six birdies and one bogey to set the clubhouse target of five under par at Glendower Golf Club . 'I have been working on that a little bit, taking a little distance off and trying not to hit them too hard,' he added on Sky Sports 4. 'Coming off the fairway they were coming out nice and crisp so I enjoyed my iron shots today. 'We have had a nice start now and I want to keep it up, get better on the greens a little more and see where we end up.' Els holds a one-shot lead over Spanish rookie Jordi Garcia Pinto, who had been four ahead of the field when he reached seven under par after 15 holes, only to bogey the 16th, 17th and 18th. Playing alongside Els, Italy's Edoardo Molinari finished eagle, birdie to card a 69 and share third place with Sweden's Niclas Fasth, France's Raphael Jacquelin and England's Tom Murray, while defending champion Morten Orum Madsen had to settle for an opening 73. Jordi Garcia Pinto held a four-shot lead after 15 before bogeying his last three for a round of 68 . Despite the demanding conditions, Els was not certain to remain top of the leaderboard, with fellow South African Erik van Rooyen moving into a share of the lead after 11 holes. Van Rooyen carded birdies at the second and third and recovered from a bogey on the fourth to pick up further shots on the seventh, eighth, ninth and 11th to join Els on five under. Compatriot Colin Nel was also four under after just six holes of his round, with Denmark's Lasse Jensen on the same score after 10 holes. Van Rooyen recovered from a bogey on the 12th with a birdie on the next and narrowly missed a chance to take the outright lead on the 16th before play was suspended at 1536 local time due to the threat of lightning. Nel had also moved to five under after a birdie on the second, his 11th hole, before the stoppage.","Ernie Els carded an opening round of 67  before weather stopped play .

"Overnight leaders Andy Sullivan and Jbe Kruger experienced wildly contrasting fortunes when the South African Open resumed in Johannesburg on Friday. England's Sullivan and South African Kruger both carded opening rounds of 66 at Glendower Golf Club to enjoy a one-shot lead over a chasing pack containing tournament host and five-time winner Ernie Els. But while Sullivan remained in pole position to challenge for his first European Tour title, Kruger crashed down the leaderboard and was facing a battle to make the halfway cut. Englishman Andy Sullivan carries a one shot lead heading in to the third round of the South African Open . Sullivan (left) shares a smile with playing partner Danie Van Tonder on his way to a second round 70 . Sullivan, who won a trip into space for a hole-in-one during the KLM Open last year, started on the back nine and picked up shots at the 11th, 12th and 17th to improve to nine under par. That gave the 27-year-old former Walker Cup player a three-shot lead over Denmark's Lasse Jensen, who had set the clubhouse target on six under after adding a 71 to his opening 67, with South African Colin Nel also six under with four holes to play. Overnight leader Jbe Krguger is in danger of missing the cut after a disastrous second round of 80 . Scotsman David Drysdale temporarily reached eight under par before falling back to five under . Scotland's David Drysdale had reached eight under par with four birdies in his first 11 holes, but dropped three shots in four holes from the fourth to fall back to five under. Kruger - who was second in this event last year - was having a far worse time of it with five bogeys, two double bogeys and a solitary birdie dropping him all the way to two over par and one shot outside the projected cut mark with two holes to play.

"Rory McIlroy revealed he is paying the price for an indulgent Christmas by sharing a picture of his rather sweaty gym t-shirt following a first workout of the new year. The world No 1 had plenty of reason to celebrate over the festive period having won both The Open and the US PGA Championship during a glorious year on the course in 2014. But, like everyone else who enjoyed a few too many mince pies in December, McIlroy is now facing up to shedding that holiday weight. Rory McIlroy shared this picture of his sweat-soaked t-shirt, and revealed 'my body hates me!' The Northern Irishman won The Open and the US PGA Championship during a stunning 2014 . 'First workout of 2015 in the books.... My body officially hates me after Christmas!' said the 25-year-old Northern Irishman on Twitter, alongside a picture of his used gym clothing. The t-shirt also bore the suggestive message 'F this' (thanks to a clever bit of colour contrasting) - but thankfully the sweat stains covering most of the shirt proves that McIlroy's attitude towards training is an awful lot better than his clothing suggests. McIlroy has recently been enjoying a spell back at home in Northern Ireland during golf's off-season. The Holywood-born superstar was spotted watching his favouite rugby team, Ulster, in action during the holiday period. But McIlroy also shared a picture of his clubs on a sunny open-air driving range, proving his time back in Britain has come to an end. 'First range session of 2015 done... First couple of swings after four weeks without touching a club were interesting!' he said. McIlroy is gearing up for his return to action at the big-money Abu Dhabi Championship later this month . McIlroy also revealed he is back on the driving range practising after four weeks without swinging a club . McIlroy is gearing up for his return to action in 2015.

The planet's best golfer he may be, but McIlroy will have to be at his best to win the first big-money event on the European Tour's 2015 schedule. World No 2 Henrik Stenson, No 5 Justin Rose and three-time champion Martin Kaymer will be among the 126-man field challenging for the title, which will be defended by Ryder Cup hero Jamie Donaldson.

"Paul McGinley insists he is yet to decide who he will be recommending to be Europe's 2016 Ryder Cup captain but says a new man will be appointed in the next two months. McGinley inspired Europe to a 16.5-11.5 victory over the United States in September and is now tasked with choosing a successor to lead the team in Minnesota next year. The selection panel will include former captains Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie, as well European Tour officials, but McGinley's opinion is likely to carry particular weight after his triumph at Gleneagles. Paul McGinley, pictured holding the trophy, captained Europe to Ryder Cup success during the summer . He said: 'I haven't fully made my mind up yet about who I'm going to recommend. 'We're still communicating, there are a number of people involved in making that decision - current players, potential players going forward, and people who are associated with the Ryder Cup. 'I'm gathering information from everyone and I want to get a really solid view of what everybody thinks before I bring my ideas forward. 'We're working on it and in the next couple of months we'll have a new captain in place and the wheels will be turning towards another Ryder Cup.' Darren Clarke is the strong favourite to take the post having played in the Ryder Cup five times and helped lead the team as vice-captain in 2010. McGinley's relationship with Clarke, however, remains strained after Clarke withdrew his support for McGinley's bid to lead the side in 2014 and suggested he may not have the presence to face America captain Tom Watson. 'Would Clarke be a good captain? The one thing I cannot do is express an opinion on that,' McGinley said. McGinley watches on as Englishman Justin Rose kisses the Ryder Cup trophy . 'I'll talk about it afterwards but at this moment it's only right I stay neutral and am fair to all the candidates. 'When I was trying to be captain, all I wanted was to be treated fairly by everybody so I think it's important I do the same now I'm involved in the decision making process.' McGinley drew on a wide variety of experience to help him lead at Gleneagles and he says he would be happy to offer his advice to future teams, but only if it was called upon. 'Of course I would be happy to help going forward,' McGinley said. 'I'm European through and through and have been involved in six Ryder Cups and have a lot of experience. 'Whoever is Ryder Cup captain though, it's important he captains how he sees fit and doesn't try to copy me or anybody else before. 'It's important the captain is true to himself and captains the way he thinks is best to get a result for Europe. Darren Clarke is the strong favourite to take the post having played in the Ryder Cup five times . 'But if anybody wants to have a conversation with me, I certainly would be very happy to do so.' In contrast to McGinley, Watson's leadership style was one of many factors blamed for America's loss last year and a Ryder Cup Task Force has since been established to unearth a way of beating the Europeans. McGinley, however, believes there is one explanation that may have been overlooked. 'For all the fall-out over there, there's never been a whole lot of recognition of what a formidable opponent Europe has become,' McGinley said. 'The European Tour is producing great players and then there are the experienced players who make the team time after time. 'We have the world number one player saying he was more up for the Ryder Cup singles than he was for the last round of two majors last year. 'That just shows how important it's become for Europeans. 'Our players are dominating the top of the world rankings and we were playing at home. We were a very, very tough opponent.'","Paul McGinley captained Europe to Ryder Cup success during the summer .

"Last year's runner-up Angelique Kerber claimed a remarkable comeback victory over wildcard Daria Gavrilova in a match finishing deep into the early hours of the morning at the Apia International. Heavy rain in Sydney caused significant delays to play later in the day and held up this second-round clash in which fifth-seeded German Kerber eventually triumphed with a 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 win against the young Russian in over two and a half hours. Kerber's triumph - in a match that finished after 3am local time - set up a quarter-final match against Garbine Muguruza, who successfully saw off 2013 winner Agnieszka Radwanska with a shock defeat. Angelique Kerber finally clinched victory at 3:10am against wildcard Daria Gavrilova in Sydney . Kerber wrote on Twitter: 'playing tennis all night long , finish my match at 3.10am!'

"UFC fans might not consider themselves a squeamish crowd, but even they were shocked when a cage match had to be stopped after a fighter's ear exploded. Leslie Smith was facing Jessica Eye at the UFC 180 in Mexico City, but the bout was ended in the second round after doctors were forced to intervene. The 28-year-old Eye landed a right-hand punch straight on her opponent's cauliflower ear, causing it to explode and cover the unfortunate Smith in her own blood.

Despite the shocking injury, the Bantamweight fighter from California said later that she had wanted to carry on. She revealed to MMA Fighting that she told the crowd in Spanish that she wasn’t hurt. The 32-year-old said: ‘I could still see. I still had my hands. I wanted to fight. I’m disappointed. It wasn’t the way I wanted that fight to end. I wish my ear hadn’t done that. Man, that ear was a bummer.’ She explained that she had been draining the cauliflower ear every night and said that it now looked ‘pretty gnarly’.

"Andy Murray has confirmed he will bid for a fourth Queen's Club title this summer at the AEGON Championships in London. The British No 1 has won the event three times in the last six years and another victory on the grass courts of west London this summer would bring him level with John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick as four-time champions.

"Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola has expressed his sympathy for England rival Ben Morgan after he suffered a broken leg last week. Morgan's injury, suffered during Gloucester's 24-23 win over Saracens on January 9, could pave the way for Vunipola to return to England's starting XV in time for the RBS 6 Nations. The Brisbane-born back-rower was the first choice in that position heading into the autumn, but he was usurped by Morgan after putting in a disappointing display against South Africa. Ben Morgan is likely to miss the entire Six Nations after the Gloucester forward broke a leg against Saracens . Billy Vunipola is primed to reclaim his No 8 jersey for England's Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff . And although the pair have been locked in a tense battle for months Vunipola, who scored a try for Sarries in the clash at Kingsholm, takes no joy out of Morgan's current predicament. 'I thought at the time it was a serious injury. I had a lot of sympathy for him and his mother, who I talk to quite a lot after England games. I hope he recovers well,' he told the Telegraph. 'I do feel sorry for him as it has happened to me before, two years ago, when I got injured before the French game and in the Ireland game. That is how life goes, how -people get opportunities and that is how I got mine when I first came through at Wasps. So yes, there is a degree of sympathy for him but I have to carry on.' Mogan suffered the injury in a tackle involving Saracens No 8  Vunipola last week . His attitude speaks volumes for the team spirit head coach Stuart Lancaster has cultivated since taking over. But despite Morgan's absence the Saracens man is not totally guaranteed a starting berth, with Wasps skipper James Haskell offering a versatile option and Harlequins' Nick Easter pushing hard for a recall after being in the international wilderness since 2011. Another player who has spent years on the fringes and is now looking for a way back is Danny Cipriani. The Sale Sharks fly-half, who travelled with the squad to New Zealand last summer, has been in sparkling form for the Salford-based side this season. Morgan was named England's player of the series after his superb display against Australia in November . He gave a timely reminder of his talents, both with ball in hand and from the tee, as Sale stunned reigning Aviva Premiership champions Northampton 20-7 last week. Cipriani's club team-mate and former England winger Mark Cueto told BBC Radio Five Live that the former Wasps man is overdue a recall. 'Absolutely no question. You want the best players in that team and the consistency that he has shown week in, week out for possibly 18 months now. I'm not saying he should be starting for England, but he should certainly be in the squad,' he said. Lancaster is due to announce his England squad for the Six Nations campaign next week.

"Aviva Premiership champions Northampton have announced the signing of England prop Kieran Brookes. Brookes, who has won six caps, will move to Franklin's Gardens from Newcastle in time for next season. The 24-year-old also spent two seasons with Leicester during his career, while additional representative honours include appearances for England Saxons and England Under-20s. Newcastle's Kieran Brookes takes on three London Welsh defenders during the Aviva Premiership match . Brookes (left-upper) will leave Newcastle to join Northampton from the start of next season . 'Kieran has steadily risen through the various England representative teams and has shown his quality at each level, building up experience along the way,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said. 'However, while we believe that he can contribute a great deal to our squad, we also think that Kieran has a lot more to come. 'We are looking forward to seeing him develop as a player at Franklin's Gardens.' All six of Brookes' England outings were off the replacements' bench, starting against New Zealand in Dunedin last summer, and continuing through to the recent autumn campaign when he featured against South Africa, Samoa and Australia. Brookes has vowed to give his all to help Newcastle finish this season as high as possible before moving on . 'I'm looking forward to joining Northampton Saints next season,' Brookes said. 'Their record over the last few seasons speaks for itself, and I am under no illusions of the quality of squad I'm going into. 'I've really enjoyed my time at Newcastle, and in particular working with John Wells and Micky Ward, both of whom have helped me massively, and in the meantime all my efforts will be concentrated on helping us finish as high up the league as we can.' Newcastle rugby director Dean Richards, meanwhile, has expressed his disappointment over Brookes' Kingston Park exit. Brookes has been capped six times for England, all from the replacements bench . 'We are obviously disappointed to see Kieran head to Northampton,' Richards told the Falcons' official website. 'We would have liked him to stay here, at the club that has helped him to develop into the full England international that he is today. 'Attempts were made to retain Kieran over a 10-month period, but during the course of the negotiations it became clear that he and his agent were looking to move.'","Kieran Brookes will join up with Northampton Saints from next season .

"Stand-in captain George Bailey has no concerns about his unusual status within the Australia squad. Bailey will lead his country in the Carlton Mid Tri-Series, starting against England at the SCG on Friday, and will continue throughout the World Cup if regular skipper Michael Clarke cannot prove his fitness by February 21. But should Clarke be ready to return by that deadline, Bailey faces the probability of dropping out of the side to make way. George Bailey (left) looks on as captain Michael Clake celebrates scoring a half century for Australia . Bailey is filling in as Australia captain, but might not make the World Cup team if Michael Clarke is passed fit . Unless form or other fitness issues intervene, Bailey is expected to be behind Clarke's Test deputy Steve Smith and former vice-captain Shane Watson in the pecking order, making him vulnerable to Clarke's return. 'Does it bother me? Not at all,' said Bailey. 'We have probably more captains in the side at the moment than you can poke a stick at, which is a wonderful position to be in. I think every person who is playing, regardless of any other positions, will just be looking to perform to make the case for retaining them within the XI pretty compelling.' Bailey is hardly an untested leader, having captained 24 of his 52 ODI matches due to Clarke's fragile body. 'I think the regularity of it has probably made it easier for me than what it would be otherwise,' he said. 'Unfortunately it has happened quite a bit over the last 12 months. 'It is something that we have been used to as a team, having to deal with not having a player like Michael in the side. 'I think we have responded pretty well when that has been the case.'

"Australia great Brett Lee has announced his retirement and named the 2005 Ashes series as his favourite memory in a 20-year career. Lee, 38, will send down his final ball in the Big Bash League this month, either in Sydney Sixers' final group game on Thursday or later if they reach the knockouts. Lee, one of the fastest bowlers of the modern era, is Australia's joint highest wicket-taker in one-day internationals, joining Glenn McGrath on 380 scalps. He also picked up 310 wickets in 76 Tests.

'I'm excited and emotional, certainly happy that I've made the right decision. 'I knew before this season it was going to be my last season and I think I've had more fun in the last six weeks than I have in the rest of my career.

Lee (right) sits with the late Phillip Hughes during an Aheses Test as they watch on during the game . Asked for his favourite moment, Lee was quick to recall the unforgettable series against England 10 years ago.

"Morne van Wyk scored an unbeaten century to steer South Africa to a 69-run win over West Indies in the T20 international in Durban to prevent a series whitewash. Van Wyk scored 114 not out from 70 balls, which included nine fours and seven maximums, as he steered the Proteas to an imposing total of 195 for three from their 20 overs. It meant West Indies won the series 2-1 ahead of the first of five one-day internationals between the two sides on Friday at the same venue. Morne van Wyk celebrates his 100 runs off 70 balls during the THIRD KFC T20 International match between South Africa and West Indies . Reeze Hendricks (42) ably assisted the free-scoring Van Wyk before David Wiese (21) pitched in towards the end of the Proteas' innings. West Indies started out brightly in their reply, but wickets fell at regular intervals after Dwayne Smith was bowled by Aaron Phangiso in the sixth over. Wiese then put West Indies on the brink of defeat with figures of five for 23 from his four overs and they were unable to build any momentum as their run rate and wickets continued to fall. Van Wyk scored 114 not out from 70 balls, which included nine fours and seven maximums . West Indies had won the toss and chose to field and could have rued that decision early on when it took until the 13th over to claim the first South African wicket when Hendricks was caught by Dwayne Smith off the bowling of Kieron Pollard for 42. By then, South Africa had already passed the 100 mark and the West Indies had to wait until the score was on 158 before they claimed their next wicket when Wiese was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 21. Rilee Roussouw was dismissed for a duck by Sheldon Cottrell the following over, with Jean-Paul Duminy (seven) joining Van Wyk for the last seven balls. In reply, the West Indies started brightly in their bid to reach the target of 196 to win but lost their first wicket on 48 when Smith (five) was bowled by Phangiso. The 35-year-old steered the Proteas to an imposing total of 195 for three from their 20 overs . Marlon Samuels (six) departed soon after, caught by Justin Ontong off the bowling of Wiese, before the right arm quick also accounted for Lendl Simmons for 49. That left the visitors stuttering on 68 for three and needing 128 to win from 68 balls. Following the flurry of wickets, West Indies' run rate dropped from nine an over to just over seven, and soon enough they were facing more of a struggle after Andrew Fletcher holed out at third man to give Wayne Parnell his first wicket of the match. That brought Pollard to the crease to join Bravo, who departed for 12, with new man Andre Russell out for the same score to leave West Indies with little hope on 100 for six. West Indies won the series 2-1 ahead of the first of five one-day internationals between the two sides on Friday at the same venue . Darren Sammy (eight) and Carlos Brathwaite (one) were both dismissed by Wiese in the 17th over to leave a near impossible task of scoring 80 runs from 18 balls. Ashley Nurse was caught by Duminy off the bowling of Marchant de Lange to leave West Indies on 125 for nine, and it was all over two balls later when Cottrell was clean bowled for a golden duck, leaving Pollard unbeaten on 20.","Morne van Wyk hits unbeaten century as South Africa defeat West Indies .

"Ian Bell admits he has fallen short of match-winning efforts too often as an England opener, but is ready to put that behind him after a record knock of 187. Bell hit 20 fours and three sixes in a 145-ball knock against an Australian Prime Minister's XI, and in the process registered England's best score in one-day cricket. It was enough to settle a high-scoring contest in the tourists' favour, by a margin of 60 runs, and ranks as a sizeable achievement for a player who was sweating for his place in the side a matter of weeks ago. Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after being caught out on 187 in England's exhibition game . Bell (left) and Moeen Ali (right) touch gloves during their knock against a Australian Prime Minister's XI . Bell pictured in action during his tremendous knock for England as World Cup preparations continue . Bell was not required for England last five matches in Sri Lanka before Christmas but earned a recall in the aftermath of Alastair Cook's departure as captain. Bell knows a record of three centuries in 150 one-day internationals is not enough for a player of his calibre and intends on changing that for the better in the forthcoming Tri-Series and World Cup. 'One thing I've probably been guilty of in the time I've been opening is getting to 60, 70, 80 but never really gone on and enjoyed myself the way I did today,' he said. 'I've been guilty in one-day cricket of getting a lot of 50s and not converting enough, but this is what I can do if I bat 45.5 overs or whatever it was. 'I've spoken to (coach) Peter Moores about that and I believe I can play at the top of the order for England. The thing is converting starts into match-winning scores. 'Today was pretty much perfect template-wise and that's how I'd like to play in one-day cricket. 'If i can do that a couple of times this winter, that's great for the team.' Bell was honest enough to accept he was not a certain pick in the first XI, with the Twenty20 opener Alex Hales having his supporters and Gary Balance also involved in the 15-man squad. Bell was unsure if he would make the team following the departure of Alastair Cook as captain . But Cook's replacement, Eoin Morgan, assured Bell he would have an opportunity to earn a starting place . But he has benefited from a vote of confidence from Cook's replacement as skipper, Eoin Morgan. 'Coming out here I didn't know where I was going to bat or if I would start, so it was nice to have a good chat with Morgs and for him to say I would get first crack at opening,' said Bell. 'That filled me with a lot of confidence. 'I've done a lot of netting in the last month or so but not a lot of game time. it was nice to get a really big score in a competitive match. 'You want it to be competitive, people playing for places. 'That's a good thing but it's nice to get on the tour and start well.' Australia paceman Pat Cummins played against Bell and joked he has got his runs out of the way on the tour . Opposition paceman Pat Cummins, who will be part of the Australia squad in the Tri-Series and the World Cup opener against England on February 14, praised Bell but made a cheeky prediction for the coming weeks. 'The innings he played was pretty faultless,' said the seamer, whose six overs cost 52. 'He hit the balls along the ground, picked the gaps and was very impressive.

"Bob Willis ponders the punditry style that has seen him consistently ruffle the feathers of the cricket establishment ever since he retired 30 years ago. ‘I’ve never been a fence sitter,’ he says with considerable under-statement. ‘It has got me into hot water at times over the years but I am always looking for an angle that will make people sit up and take notice. ‘It’s easy to describe what has happened but the way I like to come at it is trying to get inside the way people are thinking. So much of international sport is played between the ears and if I’m critical it’s because I’m questioning whether a particular player has the mental grit and strength to rise to the challenge.’ Cricketing legend Bob Willis spoke with Sportsmail about his views on England international cricket . Willis (bottom left) in action for England against the West Indies at The Oval in 1976 . It is a method that has made Willis, at 65, something of a cult figure of Sky’s comprehensive cricket coverage in a niche role that perfectly suits his talents. He is one of the best fast bowlers England have ever produced but to a whole generation of younger fans he is instead Charles Colvile’s outspoken sidekick on the verdict programmes that follow each day of international cricket. They have become a formidable partnership. Colvile will set things up and Willis, taking a deep breath and invariably starting with the words ‘Well Charles,’ soon comes steaming in off his long run, knees metaphorically pumping in the inimitable style that earned him legendary status at Headingley in 1981. ‘The verdict has captured people’s imaginations,’ says a man who has proved far more effective in the studio, fixing the viewer with a stare and providing thought-provoking analysis, than in his years in the commentary box. ‘It seems to have struck a cord with people and they can react to it. The format has evolved. It used to be mostly highlights and then a rushed chat but now we have four people dissecting decisions and techniques in far more detail. Nowadays the former England speed bowler is better known for his exploits in the commentary box . ‘We often have current players joining us and Charles will always try to eke out the odd dressing room secret while they will do their utmost not to give anything away. He usually gets something out of them. ‘I think it will be very popular during the World Cup because not too many people can sit up all night to watch a whole game. And we will be in an all singing and dancing studio, complete with bells and whistles.’ The last line is delivered dead-pan but with a hint of a smile. Willis is a far more engaging man than many realise, with a dry sense of humour and a warm personality that does not always shine through on screen. But his trenchant, forward thinking, sometimes radical, views have long challenged those in power. ‘I’ve always been a bit of a hot-head and I’ve tried to revolutionise the game from time to time since I retired as a player,’ says Willis. ‘I never got very far sitting on committees because I was just too impatient. They would always want to set up a working party whereas I would want to try to get things done. MS Dhoni is captain of The Chennai Superkings in the hugely successful Indian Premier League . ‘I do think there is something of a revolution around the corner, or at least an evolution. The success of the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash means that England will have to think very strongly again about franchises for Twenty20 cricket. There is ongoing change at the ECB and the mood for progress will prove irresistible. We might well see an English Premier League before too long.’ It is something he would welcome. ‘England came up with Twenty20 cricket but we have clearly fallen well behind,’ says Willis. ‘How well it has worked in India and Australia is clear for all to see but if we are to adopt something like that here then something will have to give. Willis also predicts something of an evolution in cricket following the success of the Big Bash . With ongoing change in Indian and Australian cricket Willis believes the English game has fallen behind . Kevin Pietersen in action for the Melbourne Stars during a Big Bash match against the Adelaide Strikers . ‘We have county captains in Marcus Trescothick and Rob Key in our studio and we talk about how their teams have to play in three different formats of the game in the space of seven or eight days. It can seriously stifle the development of young players. I’ve always been a fan of fewer but more meaningful championship matches with each game having a sense of occasion.’ It is the incredible rise of Twenty20 cricket that Willis believes has had a dramatic effect on the 50-over game and will define the World Cup that begins in exactly a month’s time in Australia and New Zealand. ‘For a while England had a good run in one-day internationals and got to the top of the world rankings a couple of years ago with Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott to the fore but the game has moved on a pace since then,’ he says. Willis believes England have failed to move on from their one-day international success . ‘Indian players are getting individual scores of 200 plus in one-day games now and there are light years between them and the way England play. ‘The limited-overs game has changed beyond all recognition. The adage used to be that you would get to 30 overs and then try to double your score in the last 20. But now, because of Twenty20, you must look to score at least a hundred in the last 10 overs and life is pretty tough for bowlers these days. ‘The old fogies in the commentary box will ask why aren’t more yorkers being bowled at the death but just look at what happens now if they get them fractionally wrong. They go out of the ground.’ Conversely, Willis offers hope when asked about England’s World Cup prospects. ‘They will be rank outsiders but every cricket fan will be willing them to do well because of the fresh look about the squad and the new faces who are prepared to take risks. England will have to be fearless but it is an exciting squad in many ways and the key could be how the middle order reacts under pressure. According to Willis England will be able to gain momentum under new captain Eoin Morgan (left) ‘I have sympathy for the selectors in many ways because clearly Paul Downton, Peter Moores and James Whitaker believe Cook is the natural leader of this group and they gave him every chance but it got to the stage where they had to make a change. The ambience under Eoin Morgan will be notably different. England’s fortunes Down Under will be dissected forensically by Willis, who has been with Sky virtually since their inception but remains as enthusiastic and passionate about English cricket as ever. ‘Sky have worked wonders with broadcasting this game,’ he says. ‘You hear people talking about cricket on free to air television but I’m not sure it’ s realistic for terrestrial channels to cover everything from international to county, women’s and Under 19 cricket. And we will have our own channel for the World Cup. I’m obviously biased but I think Sky are incomparable. ‘I’m not sure the younger generation know much about what Botham and Willis did now and I think we will soon be filed away alongside WG Grace in the dim and distant past. But I think I bring something fresh to the coverage and I’ d like to do it for as long as I can. Long may it continue!’ Well Charles, Bob Willis might be coming off his long run for some time yet.","In an exclusive interview Bob Willis opened up about his punditry style .

"The NASCAR driver known as 'The Outlaw' says his ex-girlfriend is a trained assassin who was dispatched on covert missions around the world and once returned to him in a blood-splattered gown. Kurt Busch appeared in court on Tuesday over Patricia Driscoll's request for a no-contact order. 'Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand,' Busch said when his attorney, Rusty Hardin, questioned why he still believed Driscoll is a hired killer. Kurt Busch has claimed his former girlfriend Patricia Driscoll is a trained killer . Driscoll has requested a no-contact order from the court against Busch . In an interview late Tuesday, Driscoll called Busch's assertion 'ludicrous,' saying he took it 'straight from a fictional movie script' she has been working on for eight years and that he has proofread. In court, Busch continued the push of his legal team to discredit his ex as a scorned woman out to destroy his career, portraying her as a character fit for a screenplay. Busch said Driscoll repeatedly asserted her assassin status and claimed the work took her on missions across Central and South America and Africa. He recounted one time when the couple was in El Paso, Texas. He said Driscoll left in camouflage gear only to return later wearing a trench coat over an evening gown covered with blood. A day earlier, Busch said his ex-girlfriend told him she was a mercenary who killed people for a living and had shown him pictures of bodies with gunshot wounds. Busch said on Tuesday that Driscoll had claimed that a female character in 'Zero Dark Thirty,' a film depicting the CIA's hunt for Osama bin Laden, was a composite of her and other women. Driscoll arrives at Kent County Family Court in America last December . Busch and Drisoll arrive for their protective order hearing last December . Last month, Michael Doncheff, who served as a personal assistant to Busch and Driscoll, said an ailing Driscoll told him in September that she had been picked up by a big man and slammed to the ground while helping round up immigrants at the Mexican border, a story Doncheff considered 'far-fetched.' Doncheff said Driscoll also asserted that she was a trained assassin for the U.S. government and once told him, 'I take down foreign governments. I own Washington.' During the hearing, which stretched over four days, neither Driscoll nor her attorney refuted the testimony. In a telephone interview with The Associated Press late Tuesday, Driscoll dismissed Busch's assertions. 'These statements made about being a trained assassin, hired killer, are ludicrous and without basis and are an attempt to destroy my credibility,' Driscoll said. 'Not even Rusty Hardin believes this.' 'I find it interesting that some of the outlandish claims come straight from a fictional movie script I've been working on for eight years,' Driscoll added. Busch testified Monday that he decided to end his relationship with Driscoll after a race last fall because she was monopolizing his schedule and he needed to focus on racing. Busch mingles with fans as he is introduced at a NASCAR Sprint Cup series event in November . Bush says he broke up with Driscoll to concentrate on his racing . Driscoll said Busch assaulted her in his motorhome at Dover International Speedway a week later, grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times. Busch and his attorneys have denied the allegations, which are the subject of a separate criminal investigation. Driscoll's attorney, Carolyn McNeice, cross-examined Busch on Tuesday, but few of her questions dealt directly with the assault allegations. Busch has testified that he repeatedly told Driscoll to leave after she showed up unannounced at his motorhome, finally cupping her cheeks in his hands, looking her in the eye and telling her she had to go. 'He advised that her head tapped the wall as he was doing that,' Detective James Wood testified Tuesday, recounting Busch's interview with Dover police in November. Richard Andrew Sniffen, a Christian music minister who performs at NASCAR outreach events and befriended Busch and Driscoll, said Driscoll told him on the night of the alleged assaul that Busch had pushed her and that she hit her head. Sniffen said Driscoll was upset, angry and brokenhearted, but that she never said she was afraid of Busch and seemed intent on reconciling. Busch poses with Monter Energy Girls before a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event in November . That attitude shifted in the weeks that followed, Sniffen said, with Driscoll going 'from a broken heart looking for love and reconciliation to anger and a little bit of revenge.' 'I will destroy him,' Sniffen said Driscoll told him, adding that she repeatedly said she would take Busch down. A court ruling on Driscoll's request for a no-contact order is expected later this month or in early February.","Patricia Driscoll has requested a no-contact order against NASCAR driver .

"When Ian Bell was dropped after two matches of England’s tour to Sri Lanka before Christmas, his World Cup place was very much in jeopardy. Now he has confirmed his role at the top of the order in emphatic fashion. Not only did Bell’s magnificent 187 at the Manuka Oval on Wednesday spoil Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s annual cricketing party but it proved that perhaps England can play modern one-day cricket after all. The giddy heights of 391 for six against a far-from-shabby Prime Minister’s XI was certainly a statement from an England side who seemed to arrive in Australia hoping once again that everything would be all right on the World Cup night. Ian Bell hits out on his way to a magnificent 187 as England beat a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra . Bell's innings dispelled any thoughts that he does not deserve a place in England's World Cup line-up . Nothing more so than the contribution of Bell, who was controversially handed Alastair Cook’s opening role here ahead of Alex Hales on the far-from- convincing evidence of just three centuries in 150 ODIs. Bell is England’s classiest Test batsman but he has never been as comfortable in coloured clothing and his selection seemed to provide more ammunition to those who feel England remain stuck in the one-day dark ages. This, then, was vindication for the selectors, who ditched their captain Cook before coming here but not their game-plan, and provided a little hope that this World Cup mission might not necessarily be doomed to failure. The opener's enormous score helped England reach a total of 391 for six at the Manuka Oval . Bell is congratulated by James Taylor after reaching his century against the Prime Minister's XI . ‘Of course I was worried about my World Cup place,’ admitted Bell afterwards. ‘The squad had to be narrowed down and a lot of people have come in and done well. Coming out here I didn’t know where I was going to bat or even if I was going to start, so it was nice to have a good chat with Eoin Morgan when he told me I was going to get first crack.’ The sight of Glenn Maxwell, far from certain of a place in Australia’s World Cup side, smashing 136 off 89 balls in reply ensured England did not get too carried away by their sudden show of batting strength. Another notable mention must go to Chris Woakes who managed to complete a stunning 'keepy-up' catch to dismiss Lega Siaka. Chris Woakes fumbles a catch in the field during the Prime Minister's XI clash in Canberra on Wednesday . The 25-year-old keeps his eye on the ball as it rebounds off his thigh after a wayward shot from Lega Siaka . Woakes manages to flick the ball with his feet back towards his grasp all in one motion . The 25-year-old fumbled Siaka's attempt for a boundary as the ball rebounded off his thigh and looked destined to be a missed chance in the field. However Woakes was able to flick the ball with his feet back towards his hands in one swift motion to complete an impressive recovery to add an extra gloss to the victory. More will become clear once England have faced Australia and India in the Tri-series, which begins tomorrow, but for now they can be satisfied with just about the perfect batting display even if their bowling here was not so effective. England want Bell to bat through an innings while others, notably his partner Moeen Ali, attack around him and the plan was executed spectacularly by the openers and a worthy accomplice in James Taylor. Woakes completes his remarkable recovery and catch to help dismiss Lega Siaka off Chris Jordan's bowling . Moeen said ahead of this final warm-up game that he would carry on being aggressive and he was as good as his word as he smacked 71 off 49 balls, including six fours in one frenetic nine-ball spell. Bell, meanwhile, moved to his hundred at just about a run a ball before accelerating to England’s highest individual score in a one-day match, hitting three sixes and 20 fours while consigning Hales very much to the subs’ bench. ‘One thing I’ve probably been guilty of when I’ve opened in the past is getting to 60 or 70 and not going on,’ said Bell. ‘But I enjoyed myself and if I can do that a couple more times it will be good for the team. It’s nice to have a good start but the big stuff starts on Friday.’ Stuart Broad (centre) celebrates with his England team-mates after dismissing Jason Behrendorff (14) Glenn Maxwell led the fightback for the Prime Minister's XI, hitting 136 off 89 balls . Matt Condon is bowled by James Tredwell (not pictured) for 19 runs as wicketkeeper Jos Buttler looks on . Only when he had reached 68 did Bell offer a semblance of a chance — Maxwell doing well to get a hand to a low drive — before guiding England to their equal highest score in a 50-over game, matching the 391 they smashed against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge in the heady summer of 2005. Taylor is another batsman who looked a long way from a World Cup place not so long ago but he came into the England side in Sri Lanka when Cook was suspended and has made the most of his unexpected opportunity. The biggest compliment that can be paid to Bell and Taylor is that they moved through the gears without fuss and as effortlessly as any of the leading exponents of the modern Twenty20-driven 50-over game. They added 141 in 24 overs, Taylor hitting 71 off 77 balls, as England impressively followed up the 364 they had scored in their opening tour match here in the Australian capital against rather more modest opposition. England's James Taylor hits out during his innings of 71 off 79 balls . Moeen Ali offered strong support for Bell with an attacking 71 runs off 49 balls . When England stood at 200 for one after 30 overs, a score of 400 did look on the cards and their failure to fully do themselves justice looked as if it might cost them dear when Maxwell set off in hot pursuit. The man known as the ‘Big Show’ in these parts is certainly a destructive performer and here he came close to taking apart a one-dimensional England attack lacking Jimmy Anderson, who is being eased back into competitive action. If Maxwell, one of two Australian World Cup players along with Pat Cummins in the PM’s side, had stayed for another five overs, England would have been in trouble. But once Stuart Broad had him caught at point, the home side had too big a mountain to climb. They finished 60 short on a day of 722 runs, Jos Buttler having earlier taking a spectacular running catch to dismiss captain Chris Rogers, and now England will travel to Sydney to take on Australia with just a little hope in their heart.

"Chris Rodgers does not conform to the archetypal image of a snarling Aussie, but he made it clear on Tuesday that his side have no intention of toning down their on-field conduct. Respected BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew hit out at the Aussies’ behaviour in the Test series against India, saying it set a bad example following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes. But Rogers, here to captain a Prime Minister’s XI in England’s final warm-up game before the tri-series against Australia and India, does not anticipate his team-mates changing. Australia's Chris Rogers said England had weaknesses that could be easily exploited . Australia opener Rogers in action during the fourth Test with India at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Rogers knows England batsman Sam Robson well from their days together at Lord’s . He said: ‘From the outside, it looks like a few flashpoints and a bit of spite but that’s just the nature of Test cricket. ‘Everybody goes out and competes as hard as they can and at times anger can rise to the surface. I’d think it was pretty hard-fought but everybody got on afterwards and what happened stayed on the field.Everyone is desperate to win and sometimes these things happen. With the fast bowlers we have in our side, it’s about being aggressive, getting to the opposition. I wouldn’t think things would change particularly with the Ashes coming up.’ Rogers, the Aussie opener with one foot in the English camp as a Middlesex stalwart, also insisted there are cracks in an emerging England side for the old enemy to widen when Test hostilities resume in July. Robson (seen here against India) has endured a difficult start to his life in England's Test side . New one-day captain Eoin Morgan, who took over from Alastair Cook in December . ‘There were good signs for England against India but there are still a few weaknesses,’ said Rogers. ‘They might be improving but they are nowhere near the highs of a few years back. ‘Your opening bowlers are particularly good but after that no-one has really nailed a spot. And the opening partnership is far from settled and that is going to be crucial if we bowl well.’ Rogers knows Sam Robson well from their days at Lord’s and even tried to persuade the Anglo-Australian to play for the land of his birth instead. He has watched his young colleague’s teething troubles in Test cricket with interest. Rogers said Cook was 'under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front' ‘Sam is under a bit of pressure at the top,’ said Rogers. ‘It is hard when you first play Test cricket and there are very few players who go in and dominate straight away. He’s still got a bit of work to do but he is the type of player who will find ways to get better.’ Robson looked to have a technical problem outside off-stump after the initial high last summer of a century against Sri Lanka. ‘He came back to Middlesex with a different technique to when he went into the England side,’ said Rogers. ‘A few things crept into his game which he should have been helped with but he wasn’t and that’s interesting. BBC Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew was disappointed by Australia's behaviour against India . Agnew believes Australia owe it to Phillip Hughes (pictured) to show respect to their opponents . ‘But it’s not all about Sam. Alastair Cook is under a lot of pressure and needs to be leading from the front, particularly with a young opening partner. Maybe some time away from this intense environment will enable him to relax and come back stronger.’ Rogers intends to retire from international cricket after the Ashes and then hopes to have one last season at Middlesex. And it is another man of Lord’s that he is backing to do well as England try to upset the odds and become World Cup contenders. ‘Eoin Morgan will do well as one-day captain,’ said Rogers. ‘I’ve played under him in the shorter forms and he’s a positive, relaxed guy who will help others and lead from the front.’","There are six months to go before the next Ashes series .

"Kevin Pietersen has risked further overshadowing England's preparations for next month's World Cup by claiming they'd 'love' him in their squad. The 34-year-old was unceremoniously sacked by the national side last year after a spate of public run-ins with the management and players. Pietersen said in his autobiography – published in 2014 – that there had been a bullying culture inside the England dressing room, throwing particular ire towards Matt Prior.

But he has since attempted to flirt with the new regime in a bid to regain a place in the squad at both Test and ODI level. That continued apace on Tuesday when, during a conversation with Ricky Ponting while commentating on the Big Bash, he suggested England captain Eoin Morgan wants him in the team for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. 'I don't know why I'm not playing for England,' he said. 'I know the current England captain (Morgan) would love me in the side. 'I was sacked - P45. I get on pretty well with most of the guys in there, if not all of them. 'I don't see why (I couldn't play again).' If the call came - only an injury could lead to that, because the final squads for all 14 competing countries have already been announced - Pietersen would still answer it. 'I want to play for England,' he said. 'If I get the opportunity to play for England ... I'm 34 years of age, Kumar Sangakkara is 38 and has just scored a double hundred. 'I honestly believe I'm batting as well as I've ever batted. 'I've got over my knee injury, which was huge - over the last 18 months, I'd just hated batting because my knee has been so sore. 'Given half an opportunity to go and play the way I'm playing at the moment, of course I would.' Pietersen is hoping to get back into both the England ODI and Test teams . Morgan in action during England's match against an ACT Invitational side at the Manuka Oval . Stuart Broad (left) speaks to former England teammate Pietersen prior to his axe from the international set-up . Pietersen's assertions come after Alastair Cook was relieved of his duties as one-day captain in December. The South African-born batsman was typically outspoken in his criticism of Cook and now wants back in. And he may have an ally in Stuart Broad, who couldn't understand the way in which Pietersen was sacked after the Ashes humiliation last winter. 'I just think the sacking became a media uproar,' Broad told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme. 'It just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player gets dropped for poor form, don't they?' But that is highly unlikely to happen, given the stress his words have put the England team under coupled with consistent poor form.

"Shane Long believes Southampton have what it takes to challenge for the FA Cup and maintain their top-four push in the Barclays Premier League. Saints have been one of the stories of the season, with a summer exodus and talk of a meltdown replaced by chatter about Champions League qualification. Sunday's 1-0 win at Manchester United proved to the doubters that Ronald Koeman's side are genuine top-four contenders, while another victory by the same scoreline at Portman Road ensured they would maintain a two-pronged attack. Southampton striker Shane Long celebrates after scoring the winner against Ipswich Town in the FA Cup . Long heads back for the restart after scoring only his third goal in all competitions since arriving at St Mary's . Saints set up an FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to Crystal Palace by emerging victorious from their third-round replay against Championship promotion hopefuls Ipswich. Long's impressive first-half strike was the difference in what may have been an 'ugly game', but one which keeps alive the Premier League surprise package's hopes of a trip to Wembley. 'It's only the early stages in the FA Cup now, but I think we've got a good enough squad to push for that,' he said. 'I suppose the first thing is the league, but it would be nice to get some silverware as well. 'The gaffer gave a few lads on the fringe of the first team a chance and I felt they came in and did brilliantly. 'Young Matty Targett on the left and Harry (Reed) in midfield were exceptional, and I think it was a chance for them to show the gaffer if he needs them they're ready to step up. 'It's nice for the lads to get a go in such a good cup as well. Hopefully they can kick on from here. Dusan Tadic pounces upon the rebound and converts to hand Saints the lead against Manchester United . Southampton players celebrate after taking the lead thanks to Tadic's strike and held on for an important win . 'I think it's important lads get a run out, 90 minutes here and there, and it's only good for the squad.' Long hopes his performance up front gives Koeman 'a little bit of food for thought' if he needs a different option to Italy striker Graziano Pelle. The Republic of Ireland international proved a nuisance throughout and took the winning goal wonderfully, striking first time after James Ward-Prowse was tackled. 'It was just more instinct and sometimes they're the easiest finishes when it just drops to you and you've no time to think about it,' Long said. 'It was nice to see it hit the back of the net and it took a bit of pressure off us and let us kind of control the game a bit more.

It was a result Ipswich goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski found difficult to argue with.

'It was probably a horrible game to watch but I thought we tested ourselves well against a top Premier League side,' Bialkowski told the club's official website. 'They scored a good goal but other than that, they didn't really trouble us too much. 'But that is why they are near the top of the Premier League. They have that little bit of quality to win a game.

"The term 'you want the ground to swallow you up' was coined for THAT moment at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night. Slumped on his knees, crestfallen on the floor, Roberto Soldado would happily have disappeared into the turf. How on earth do you hit the crossbar from six yards? By the look on the Spaniard's face, not even he could tell you. Spanish striker Soldado somehow manages to hit the bar from close-range when it appeared easier to score . With the goal gaping the 29-year-old could only hit the crossbar as he miss hit his effort . Tottenham - 59 apps, 15 goals . Valencia - 128 apps, 76 goals . Getafe - 60 apps, 29 goals . Osasuna - 30 apps, 11 goals . But it's a feeling that has become all too familiar for Soldado. Perhaps, not quite to the extent of his extraordinary miss against Burnley - but it is the lack of goals that has defined his Spurs career so far. Fifteen goals in 18 months isn't an impressive return on a £26million outlay. So, then, it's no surprise that manager Mauricio Pochettino is listening to offers for the striker this month. It just hasn't happened for the former Valencia man. The Spain international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as White Hart Lane . Soldado has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season . Having arrived in north london in 2013 as one of La Liga's most prolific marksman, Soldado's reputation has plummeted severely. He's gone from being one of the most sought after players in Europe, to a major financial liability for Spurs. Offloading Soldado will be easier said than done this month. Spurs know they'll have to take a significant financial hit on the £26million they splashed on him. Likewise, clubs prepared to match the player's £65,000-per-week wages are likely to be few and far between. A return to Spain seems the most likely destination for the striker. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is happy to persist with Soldado until the end of the season . Atletico Madrid have been linked with a move for the misfiring hitman, though there has also been an interest from Inter Milan. Who knows, maybe even they are having second thoughts after watching his incredible miss on Wednesday night. But it must be said that if a deal for Soldado to leave White Hart Lane this month isn't reached, then Pochettino is happy to persist with the Spaniard until the end of the season. The striker is a popular member of the Spurs squad, and Pochettino has been impressed with the Spaniard's attitude - which is more than can be said with regards to another White Hart Lane striker. His goalscoring apart, the other aspects of Soldado's play is certainly appreciated by his team-mates. Soldado scored 24 league goals in his final season at Valencia before securing Spurs move . And in the face of criticism following his embarrassing miss against Burnley, his colleagues have rallied round in his defence. 'I felt for him. I have been in that position before where just nothing will go in for you,' said Andros Townsend. 'He played well but as a striker I think he just wanted that goal. 'I just ran over to him as we walked off at half time and tried to keep his spirits up. I just told him to forget about the miss and keep going. 'I said I would try to put another cross in for him and that if he kept getting into the positions then he would get a goal. Andros Townsend said he offered some words of encouragement to Soldado at half time . 'That didn’t happen sadly but five minutes into the second half he put in an assist for Danny Rose. 'Look Robbie is a fantastic character, he will pick himself up and dust himself down. 'He continued to look dangerous in the second half and I was delighted he played well. We have seen in Spain he is a fantastic striker. He just needs the service and the game time. 'Then once he gets one or two goals I am sure the goals will start flowing.' Here's hoping, for Soldado's sake.","Roberto Soldado missed an open goal from six yards against Burnley .

"Celtic are likely to have to pay £250,000 if they want to land Gary Mackay-Steven this month. Parkhead boss Ronny Deila confirmed the champions’ interest in the winger this week, with contact already thought to have been made over a pre-contract offer that could see him switch to Glasgow in the summer. A quicker move to have Mackay-Steven on board for the title run-in would require an outlay, but could also cut off English competition at the pass. Celtic will have to pay £250,000 if they want to sign Dundee United winger Gary Mackay-Steven this month . The 24-year-old (left) is also the subject of interest from English League One outfit Sheffield United . Sheffield United want to sign the 24-year-old immediately and have seen an offer in the region of £100,000 rejected by the Tannadice club. It’s thought United would want more than double that amount before being persuaded to part with him during the current transfer window. Returning from the club’s training camp in Gran Canaria yesterday, Celtic No2 John Collins was reluctant to be drawn too much on the situation but admitted Mackay-Steven has attributes that appeal. ‘He’s a good football player. He’s got pace, he’s skilful, but he’s a Dundee United player. We’re looking for speed in the wider areas and at the top of the pitch. It’s very important and if we can find that it would obviously be very good for us.’ Celtic boss Deila reckons a move for Mackay-Steven would be a good call in the Premiership title race . Reports in Holland have also linked the club with a move for highly-rated AZ defender Wesley Hoedt. Lazio have bid £1million bid for the 20-year-old Dutch under-21 international, but Celtic, Ajax and Twente are also said to be interested. Any move would inevitably heighten speculation over the future of Virgil van Dijk but Deila reiterated his stance on the Southampton and Sunderland target when he said: ‘The most important thing is to keep our players. 'We start with that and then if we get some players who can make us better we will do it. When we come back now that’s the window starting – and then there will be something behind the rumours maybe.’ Meanwhile, Deila has revealed he is happier now to let his players blow off some steam and relax. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) is wanted by Southampton and Sunderland . He earned a hardline reputation for banning junk food and fizzy drinks from the players’ lunch menu. However, after allowing his squad to socialise and invite their families on the week-long sunshine break in Spain, he says his senior players have earned the right to some rest and recreation. ‘I’m not hard,’ claimed Deila. ‘If you are not fit then you have a problem. But these players in this squad now are fit. The things we were talking about six months ago are not there anymore. They look much sharper. ‘It’s not just about doing all the wrong things. It’s okay to relax. They eat very well, there is no problem with that. What this trip is all about is relaxing their head. ‘But they also have to be in shape and train and be prepared. We had some good training and played the games. We asked them questions in the summer – and they gave us good answers.’ Celtic squad recently enjoyed a week-long sunshine break in Spain and were allowed to invite their families . Returning to Scotland ahead of Saturday’s clash with Hamilton - and trailing Aberdeen by four points - Deila still has niggles affecting Charlie Mulgrew, Stefan Johansen and Anthony Stokes. Jason Denayer made his return from injury in a 3-2 defeat to Sparta Prague – but could be granted compassionate leave following the death of friend Junior Malanda. ‘Stefan Johansen has an issue with his ankle so we have rested him,’ added Deila. ‘He is training but we need everybody now to be 100 per cent going into this period. The injured players like Forrest, Charlie and Mikael Lustig are close now. It looks very positive so we are looking forward to the game on Saturday.’","Celtic are believed to have made a pre-contract summer offer for Gary Mackay-Steven .

"John Carver has defended Newcastle’s mid-season break in Dubai and warned his players they will be fined if curfews are broken. The Magpies – who have a two-week break having been knocked out of the FA Cup - fly to the United Arab Emirates 24 hours after Saturday’s home game with Southampton and will return to the north-east on Thursday. Caretaker boss Carver says the trip was planned regardless of whether they were playing in the FA Cup fourth round next weekend. Newcastle caretaker manager John Carver will fine players if they ignore curfews on their mid-season break . The Magpies have been forced to train indoors due to poor weather conditions in the north east . It was three years ago that Alan Pardew and the club came in for heavy criticism when they were pictured partying in Tenerife before returning to lose at Brighton in the FA Cup. But Carver says the warm-weather retreat will be beneficial to his squad. ‘This has been arranged from when Alan was manager,’ he explained. Alan Pardew was criticised after his players were pictured partying in Tenerife before their FA Cup clash . The Magpies lost the game at Brighton thanks to a goal from Will Buckley at Amex Stadium in January 2012 . ‘For the last three or four years we've had a mid-season break. We've got a hurricane out there to deal with and it's difficult to do good quality stuff with the wind howling. We've had to work indoors because it's just unbearable. ‘So this is a chance to go away and get some proper work done.’ Carver, though, said the trip is not an excuse to party. ‘People will be putting two and two together and thinking it's a jolly, but let me tell you, it's no jolly-up,’ he said. ‘There will be curfews and I will treat the players with respect, but if anyone oversteps the mark or breaks the curfew then they will be fined. We'd still have gone away even if we'd had an FA Cup game this week. It's just like a normal week and will mirror our regular work here. ‘The players will be off Wednesday and most will probably play golf. We'll have a team meal on the night and there will be a couple of glasses of wine with that, then we're back on the bus and back to the hotel before coming home on Thursday.'","John Carver defended the Magpies' custom of a winter break abroad .

"John Carver says that Jonas Gutierrez could be pushing for a first-team place before the end of January. Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that the Argentine’s contract – which expires in the summer – does not contain a clause which means one more appearance for the club will trigger an extension.

But with the 31-year-old able to play seven matches before such a clause is invoked, he could be back in the senior squad within the next few weeks. When asked if Gutierrez could again feature for Newcastle, caretaker boss Carver said: ‘Absolutely. He has played three reserve games and scored his first goal on Monday night. ‘He’s getting fitter and stronger and it’s part of his process. I am liaising with him all the time. ‘Players know better than I do in terms of fitness, but he is about two or three weeks away from pushing for a first-team place.’ Gutierrez made his return to action in an Under 21 game against West Ham United on December 22 .

"Oldham owner Simon Corney has reiterated his desire to sell the club in the wake of the Ched Evans saga. The League One club's chairman has previously said that should a buyer who can take Lee Johnson's side further forward than he can come along, he would happily listen to offers. And following the collapse of the controversial move for the 26-year-old convicted rapist, Corney has repeated his willingness to sell the cash-strapped club. Oldham Athletic owner Simon Corney (centre) wants to sell the club following collapse of Ched Evans deal . Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman and served half of a five-year sentence . Describing the events of the last two weeks, which saw Oldham catapulted into the public spotlight as 'an extraordinary period in our club's history,' Corney told the club's website that he took the blame for a 'loss of trust'. However, he added that he was going nowhere for the time being. 'My commitment to the club, its fans, staff and sponsors is total and my desire to ensure that the new North Stand development is completed remains as strong as ever,' he said. 'We continue to face significant challenges but I am genuinely excited about the future prospects for our club and the plans we have put in place to ensure its long term future without the need for further investment. Since his release, the former Sheffield United and Wales striker has found it difficult to find a new club . 'Of course, as I have always said, if a buyer for the Club comes forward who is able to take things on to another level then I will consider selling. That buyer has to be the right person and have the best interests of the club at heart. 'It is now time to draw a line under the events of recent weeks and move on. We have a club to run and goals to achieve and the board, staff and I are determined to see this great club prosper.' As revealed by MailSport, Oldham had agreed terms with former Sheffield United and Manchester City striker Evans, who has served half of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a North Wales hotel room. The Welsh international striker, for whom the Blades paid Manchester City £3 million in 2009, was set to sign a two-and-a-half year deal. Oldham fans unveil a banner during their home game against Doncaster Rovers, '70000...where are you?' But after the withdrawal of a series of sponsors which put the club's survival at risk, Corney decided, reluctantly, to pull the plug on the deal. Threats were also made to club staff and more than 70,000 signed a petition against the move. At Saturday's 2-2 draw with Doncaster Rovers, watched by a crowd of around 4,000, some Oldham supporters held a banner stating: '70,000 where are you?' A small group sang 'There's Only One Ched Evans' and were confronted by a number of fellow fans, one of whom left the ground in disgust.

"Oldham director Barry Owen has insisted he has no regrets over the club's aborted attempt to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Evans, who was released from prison in October halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011, looked poised to join the Latics on Thursday but the club pulled the plug on the deal after a storm of opposition. Chief executive Neil Joy said the move collapsed following 'vile and abusive threats, including death threats' to fans, sponsors and staff while also claiming 'proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence'. Ched Evans was released from prison in October, with his  return to football sparking widespread debate . Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey on Thursday, is still without a club after the deal fell through . The deal for convicted rapist Evans to join Oldham fell through 'purely to the finances' Evans' former employers Sheffield United had also come in for heavy criticism when they offered the striker a chance to train to with them - an offer which was later withdrawn - but Owen was adamant he did not regret the Latics' bid. 'I will never regret it,' he told the BBC's Football League Show. 'I am hugely disappointed for many reasons that I can't discuss. 'Oldham were going to get a footballer that in other circumstances they wouldn't have been able to afford. This was driven by football reasons.' Owen, who resigned as chairman of the club's supporters' trust last week but insisted that decision had nothing to do with the affair, admitted that, in the end, money was a big factor in cancelling the deal. 'We knew there would be a storm to bear and were prepared to accept a lot of that and take it on the chin because we believed strongly in the right to employ this man,' he said. 'We did not anticipate the amount of sponsorship pressure, which was understandable because they were under extreme pressure. 'In the end it came down purely to the finances. Barry Owen (far right) resigned as chairman of the club's supporters' trust last week . Oldham Athletic chief executive Neil Joy reads out a statement in relation to Evans on Thursday . 'We would have been in extreme financial difficulty with the withdrawal of sponsorships we would have had to withstand and it would have put the club into serious jeopardy.' More than 70,000 people signed a petition against the signing of Evans and, while Owen said he could understand their objections, he maintained the club were perfectly within their rights to pursue a deal. 'There is a fundamental right that the boy can work and I fully understand the opposition to it,' he said. 'I have seen the effects of rape on people, which is frightening. 'All those points came into the due diligence which we carried out. We looked and balanced everything against them but at end of the day there are no Football Association rules against the signing, no laws in the land. 'There is nothing in there to say how we should go along the rehabilitation process or anything stopping us from proceeding. 'We (the board) are all family men, we are a small club and do not have millions of pounds to withstand the pressure put on us. Every one of the directors have daughters, the chief executive has family, many members of staff have families and they were supporting this lawful act we were carrying out.' Oldham fans hold a banner in relation to a petition against Evans joining which attracted 70,000 signatures .

"Peter Clarke's first goal of the season boosted Blackpool's hopes of avoiding relegation from the Sky Bet Championship with a 1-0 win over fellow strugglers Millwall. The Seasiders had only won one of their previous 14 games in all competitions and earlier in the week owner Owen Oyston wrote an open letter to disgruntled Blackpool supporters.

Hughton, sacked by Norwich at the tail end of last season, was hired to replace Sami Hyypia following the former Liverpool defender's pre-Christmas resignation.

After a goalless first half, Nahki Wells put Huddersfield ahead before sub Odion Ighalo equalised with virtually his first touch.

"Fernando Torres scored in the first minute of each half as Atletico Madrid booked a place in the Copa del Rey quarter finals and ruined Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or celebrations. Back at Atletico on loan after an dreadful spell at Chelsea, the former £50m striker lashed a first-time effort high into the net past goalkeeper Keylor Navas to put Atletico 1-0 ahead on the night and 3-0 up on aggregate. The 30-year-old, included in the starting lineup in place of an ailing Mario Mandzukic, had never scored against Real at their Bernabeu stadium and, after Sergio Ramos made it 1-1, he restored Atletico's lead with a neat finish just after the interval. Click here for Pete Jenson's full match report . Host commentator . Simeone has pulled off a tactical masterclass at the Santiago Bernabeu. Torres' double proved to be significant as Atletico progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. Ramos and Ronaldo struck for the home side but they were unable to find a further three goals. Attention now turns to Barcelona's clash against Elche. Atletico Madrid are starting to control possession now. Real look extremely despondent. Not exactly a brave prediction but it does not look like Real are going to be able to pull the three-goal deficit (due to Atletico's away goals) back. They appear to have run out of steam with just under 10 minutes left on the clock. Ancelotti will have been extremely disappointed with his side's display today. His attacking trio of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema have failed to impress this evening. Just to remind you, Real need three goals in under 20 minutes if they are to progress to the next round of the Copa del Rey. The winners are likely to face Barcelona, who lead Elche 5-0 from the first leg. Benzema has to do better. The Frenchman blasts the ball over the bar from close range to the delight of Atletico's defender. Surely time for Hernandez to be given a chance. With 67 minutes gone, Ronaldo - despite scoring Real's second - has hardly had a sniff at goal. The Ballon d'Or winner will be extremely disappointed with how his night is panning out. Navas pushes a Griezmann free-kick over the bar. The away side have been able to get further up the pitch during the second half. Simeone's tactics have been spot on so far. Torres has been denied the chance of grabbing a hat-trick. Simeone has decided to replace his January signing with Turan. The former Chelsea striker was a staggering 250/1 to score a hat-trick before the match. This tie is just getting better and better. Bale crosses the ball to Ronaldo, who heads the ball past Oblak. 2-2 with 55 minutes on the clock. Torres worms his way into the box before the ball falls to Griezmann, whose deflected shot goes just wide. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Oh my, 37 seconds this time. Torres has silenced the Bernabeu. ""Fer-nan-do Torres!"" sing Atletico Madrid's 500 supporters.' Real Madrid obviously didn't learn from Torres' opener as the former Chelsea forward has scored a similar goal to his first. He links up with Griezmann again before slotting the ball under Navas' legs. Ancelotti does not have many attacking options on the subs' bench. He will surely turn to Hernandez during the second half.. Real's bench: Casillas, Varane, Coentrao, Khedira, Hernandez, Jese, Illarramendi . Simeone will be delighted with the scoreline at half-time despite the fact his side have been camped inside their own half during the first half. Torres opened the scoring inside the first minute before Ramos pulled a goal back 19 minutes later. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo's shot at goal appears to hit Miranda's arm. However referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz  waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Real Madrid appeal for a penalty as Ronaldo's shot at goal appears to hit Miranda's arm. However referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz  waves play on. It would have been extremely harsh on the Atletico defender. Karim Benzema has been extremely quiet during the first half. Ancelotti may decide to throw on Javier Hernandez after the interval. Atletico are finding it hard to get on the ball. The away side are hoping to hit Real on the counter attack, as they did with the first goal, but Real are not relinquishing possession. Real Madrid are still looking for a second goal. Ancelotti cannot fault the passion and effort of his players despite the early goal by Torres. 10 minutes to go until the interval. Atletico are doing everything they can to stop Real from going in front before the interval. They are finding it hard to get out of their own half due to the home side's eagerness to reduce the 3-1 deficit. Bale stretches his legs by bursting down the right at pace before picking out Ronaldo. However the Real Madrid man's effort at goal is deflected wide by Juanfran. Ramos has now scored six goals this season. A pretty good record for a central defender. Ramos really is a threat from set-pieces. He showed outstanding technique to head past Oblak. Ronaldo almost put his side in the lead, however his shot was cleared off the line by Mario Suarez. Momentum is building for the home side with 24 minutes gone. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Real Madrid need to repeat Champions League final scored here to go through and there is the first. Ramos from Kroos free-kick after Torres kicked Ronaldo. Curse of the commentator. Sergio Ramos leaps above Atletico's defence to head past Oblak and level the scoring. Game on! Atletico goalkeeper Oblak saves a Ronaldo shot from close range. The Slovenian goalkeeper will have to be at his best if he is to keep a clean sheet. 17 minutes gone and Real Madrid have not really peppered Oblak's goal. Diego Simeone will be delighted with his side's performance thus far. Griezmann, who set up the opening goal, appears to have a slight problem with his arm. Looks like he will be able to carry on though. Torres celebrated his goal in front of the Real fans, who didn't look too happy with the Atletico striker. Atletico are allowing their rivals to dictate play. The pressure is firmly on the home side after Torres' opener. Nearly 11 minutes gone at the Bernabeu. Real Madrid now need to score four goals if they are going to have any chance of progressing to the next round. A big task but anything is possible when you have Ronaldo, Bale and Co. Real Madrid will have been shell shocked by the speed of Atletico's goal. Torres, on the other hand, will take great confidence from his first goal since September 23. Fernando Torres has scored his first goal back at his former side inside the first 60 seconds. Griezmann goes on the attack before sliding the ball to Torres, who has the easy tack of placing the ball into an empty net. Ronaldo is currently on the Santiago Bernabeu turf - displaying his Ballon d'Or award to his home fans. Rodriguez, Ramos and Kroos are also showing off their trophies for being included in the world team of the year. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Mandzukic doesn't even make the bench having not recovered from a virus. Big night for Torres. Needs to stretch Real Madrid on the counter-attack as Ancelotti's team go for the big comeback. 'Big cheers as Bale's name is read out - Sunday's booing all forgotten. Ronaldo predictably gets the biggest cheer though.' Torres makes his second start since rejoining his boyhood side. It would be an ideal place and time for him to score his first goal back at the club. Bale's last match at his home ground saw Real fans jeer the Welsh winger for failing to pass the ball to Ronaldo. The former Tottenham star will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong against his side's rivals. Ronaldo, pictured arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu alongside Marcelo and Rodriguez, will be hoping to show why he was the worthy winner of the Ballon d'Or. The Portuguese superstar beat off competition from Messi and Neuer to win the prestigious award on Monday. Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: 'Madrid supporters packing the streets around the stadium as the team coach arrives at the Santiago Bernabeu. 'They need to overhaul a 2-0 first leg deficit against Atletico Madrid. Supporters will hold gold cards aloft before kick-off as Cristiano Ronaldo presents his Ballon d'Or to the home fans.' Hello and welcome to our live commentary of tonight's Copa del Rey tie between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.

"Stuart Pearce is entering what could well be the final weeks of his managerial career. After six weeks of sustained defeats, the boardroom tittering at Nottingham Forest is becoming more pronounced and a decision whether to cut short their relationship is drawing near. Pearce watched his side lose their fourth game on the bounce when the well-organised, albeit limited, Sheffield Wednesday scored twice in five minutes to stretch their hosts’ winless run to eight. Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce issues instructions to his side during their home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday . One fan shows her support to Pearce with a flag dedicated to the under pressure Forest boss . That includes an FA Cup humbling at Rochdale last week, as well as an alarming zero points from two games against Birmingham City. They have won just twice since September 17. Talk is growing louder that owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi is growing restless. It is a sorry state of affairs for a man whose popularity at the City Ground should not wane because of a gamble that has not paid off. For Pearce, Forest represents his last chance at building a career as a No 1. There would be no coming back if he were to be potted so soon in surroundings he should thrive in. ‘In myself, yes,’ Pearce said when asked if he believed he would still be in charge next week. ‘I don’t make that judgment call but the one thing this football club needs is togetherness. 'Any manager would be disappointed not to be given the time they need to finish a job, but if you’re asking me whether I’m very disappointed at this moment in time, yes, I am. Forest fans show their support to former player and now manager Pearce during Saturday's game . Pearce looks anxious as he watches his side crash out of the Capital One Cup to Tottenham in September . The Rochdale players celebrate with Peter Vincenti after his penalty gave the hosts a FA Cup win over Forest . ‘All eyes are on me, whether it’s the media, the boardroom, the players, the supporters. I have to be rock solid and I can tell you I won’t be buckling, and the players have to take strength from me.’ Pearce is idolised for playing glories - he spent 12 emotional years at the club - and that, quite rightly, will never change. But regardless of the past, those who control Forest need to stick or twist - and let their fanbase know why. It is not as if they haven’t been supportive. Yes, there were issues surrounding the sales and subsequent loans of Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles to Newcastle United, but Pearce was given in the region of £9million in the summer. Nottingham Forest owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi could sack Pearce if results do not improve on the field quickly . Britt Assambolonga, pictured here scoring against Fulham in September, cost Forest around £5million . Half of that was spent on Peterborough striker Britt Assombalonga; the idea was that this was an appointment for the long haul. Unfortunately such grand gestures cannot legislate for the results they are enduring. Something has to give, but nobody around the club is wholly sure what. Pearce points towards a lengthy injury list as reason why they have fallen 10 points behind the play-offs, while others suggest his tactics and inability to get the best of out of his substitutions. As ever, the truth lies somewhere in between. The supporters are now split. They are all willing the 52-year-old to do well and some assert that six months simply isn’t long enough to garner which direction this will eventually head. Others do not afford Pearce that sentiment. After waiting the best part of three years to at least show signs of competing at this level, the facts remain that results are not good enough and performances are lethargic. And any discussions as to whether Forest should part ways with a sixth permanent manager in three seasons will doubtless take into consideration mistakes of the past, including Steve McClaren’s farcical three-month reign. They are a club craving stability, but at what point do you draw the line and cut your losses? Pursuing a strong figurehead who assimilates what the club stands for is laudable - Forest clearly went into this with the best of intentions - but they’ve picked the wrong man. Next up for Forest is a trip to promotion-chasing Derby, a fixture former manager Billy Davies (above) was sacked after on the back of a 5-0 thumping back in March . Sean O’Driscoll, Billy Davies and now Pearce might have appeared the right fits at the time but football has moved on without them. It should not be overlooked that Pearce hadn’t been in club management for seven years prior to his homecoming and it’s showed. Sportsmail reported last week that Al-Hasawi took the unusual step of seeking counsel from first- team players over the former England international’s management style. ‘We are trying to imitate Manchester City at a lower level,’ the owner said last month. He was at the game on Saturday and may have to revise that statement following an afternoon where Forest managed just three shots on target. The word crisis is one banded about far too easily - they are nowhere near that state at present - although those at the top are twitching. What lies ahead at the iPro Stadium on Saturday should bring matters to a head. Davies was sacked after losing 5-0 against Derby back in March; the same fate may befall his successor if another east Midlands embarrassment is dished up by McClaren and co. In a way, it’d be somewhat fitting. Good week for... CREWE . Now out of the League One relegation zone, Crewe are on a four-match unbeaten run for the first time since the backend of last season. They have also managed to renew the loans of Nicky Ajose, Alan Tate and Jamie Ness until the end of the campaign. Crewe boss Steve Davis will be pleased to have seen his side move out of the League One relegation zone . Bad week for... CHARLTON . Another defeat - this time at the hands of Chris Hughton’s Brighton - meant the Addicks called time on Bob Peeters’ tenure as manager. Hardly surprising, really, given they’ve got steadily worse throughout the season. Peeters might’ve even taken them down. Bob Peeters walks off the pitch at the final whistle for the final time at Charlton boss after defeat to Brighton . TALENT SCOUT: Joe Bryan (Bristol City) Might have come to the attention this weekend because of his opening goal in the 4-0 win against Notts County, but Bryan has been a steady performer at wing-back for the Robins and helped Steve Cotterill’s side become the meanest defence in League One.

"Nottingham Forest have used their Sky Bet Transfer Fund to sign defender Todd Kane on loan from Chelsea. The 21-year-old full back will spend the rest of the season at the City Ground and will join up with his new team-mates on Thursday. The £250,000 prize was awarded to Forest last month when fan Shaun Lander won the Sky Bet random draw at Wembley. Nottingham Forest have signed Chelsea defender Todd Kane on loan using their Sky Bet Transfer Fund . Forest manager Stuart Pearce said: 'Todd is a player we know well and we are all looking forward to working with him. 'He will be a huge asset to the team and I'd like to thank Shaun Lander for participating in the Sky Bet Transfer Fund and helping the club to sign Todd.' Lander, a landscape gardener who also won £5,000, said: 'As a fan, I'm absolutely delighted I've played my part in helping to bring Todd Kane to the club - and all just by placing a £1 bet. Kane has yet to appear for the Chelsea first team but has had previous spells for Blackburn and Bristol City . 'Hopefully he can help our push for a play-off place.' Former England youth international Kane has yet to appear for Chelsea but has had previous loan spells at Preston and Blackburn and made seven appearances for Bristol City earlier this term.

Pardew will lead his first game with Palace after they agreed a £3.5million compensation deal with Newcastle . When discussions were ongoing on Friday caretaker manager Keith Millen said: ‘They’re still talking, but there are no problems. The lawyers are finalising the contract. The paperwork is taking longer than expected. ‘Alan has held a staff meeting when he spoke about a number of things. He spoke to the players, then we had training. ‘We’re preparing for the game on Sunday and I’m sure Alan will be taking the game. He’ll be taking training on Saturday. We’re hopeful the deal will be done for Sunday. ‘We’ve spoken about the team for Sunday’s game. He’s gone through the squad. He’s learning about the players, but he’s pleased with what he’s seen. He’ll pick the team. ‘Alan is excited because it’s Crystal Palace and the club means a lot to him, but it’s also exciting because of the players he’s inheriting.’ Caretaker boss Keith Millen took charge of Palace's 0-0 draw at Aston Villa on New Year's Day .

I felt that what we had here (when Pulis left) we could just keep going,’ said Parish. ‘Neil is a very nice guy, a really nice guy. I would have loved him to be a success. ‘Things haven’t gone so well, with Tony (Pulis) going just before the start of the season. It causes upheaval. I probably didn’t get the right fit with Neil.

"Chelsea and Manchester City are locked in a two-horse Premier League title race - exactly as predicted by the bookmakers before a ball had been kicked. But what would happen if the 20 top-flight clubs could only use local players, those who were either born or brought up within an hour of their stadium? If teams were only allowed to select truly local players, Swansea would be favourites to land the Premier League crown with bookies. Real Madrid's Gareth Bale would line up for Swansea if the Premier League clubs could only use local players . Chelsea would not be able to call upon the likes of Diego Costa, Oscar and Willian, all pictured above . Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart would feature for his local club Stoke City . The landscape would look very different, less glamorous without the likes of Diego Costa and Sergio Aguero, but more open and competitive. Imagine if Gareth Bale played for Swansea City, Joe Hart for Stoke City, Raheem Sterling for QPR and Michael Carrick for Newcastle United, because they were the closest Premier League clubs to their doorstep. How would the big boys cope? What would Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger do if they had to pick strikers raised within a 60-minute radius of their clubs rather than buy in Costa, Alexis Sanchez or even Danny Welbeck? We all love the Premier League of course but it can get a tad repetitive when you look at the final league tables in May. Just four clubs have been crowned champions in 21 of the last 22 seasons and that isn’t going to change this year. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney (left) and John Terry of Chelsea, would remain at their current clubs . FAVOURITES: Swansea 4/1, Manchester United 5/1, Crystal Palace 8/1, Arsenal 10/1, Southampton 14/1 . BEST OF THE REST: QPR 16/1, Newcastle 16/1, Tottenham 16/1, West Bromwich Albion 20/1, Everton 20/1, . RANK OUTSIDERS: Chelsea 25/1, Liverpool 25/1, Sunderland 25/1, Manchester City 33/1 Stoke 33/1, Aston Villa 40/1, West Ham 50/1, Burnley 66/1, Leicester City 100/1, Hull 1000/1 . *odds supplied by Ladbrokes . It is why, just for fun, Sportsmail worked out the possible line-ups for all 20 Premier League clubs if they were restricted to local players. And the result would be a greatly less predictable league. We also asked a leading betting company to price up the title race. And whereas Chelsea and Manchester City were 15/8 joint-favourites in the real world at the start of the season, Swansea City with Bale in their line-up are 4/1 favourites in this league, with Manchester United next best at 5/1 and Crystal Palace 8/1. Only Hull City – whose geographical location would make it much harder to find players – are considered no-hopers of the 20 clubs. James Milner would be the only Manchester City player who could turn out for the club under the proposed rule . Liverpool star Adam Lallana would be an option for Arsenal as he was born within an hour of the Emirates . In our teams, we have allowed clubs to keep players they already have born within an hour’s travelling radius. Hence John Terry and Wayne Rooney remain in the Chelsea and Manchester United sides. Other from that, players have been selected on proximity of location with past associations to a club also taken into account. Hence Sterling, who was brought up in Wembley, is selected for QPR rather than Arsenal or Chelsea on both of those criteria. Not surprisingly, Manchester City and Chelsea would be most seriously impacted. Yorkshireman James Milner is the only member of City’s current squad who would get in under the one-hour rule and as United seem to have picked up most Mancunian talent over recent years, City would be forced to rely on other players from the Greater Manchester or west Yorkshire, like Jordan Rhodes, Fabian Delph and Will Buckley. Not a David Silva or Aguero in sight. Man City would be among the clubs hardest hit - David Silva (pictured) for instance could not be selected . Eden Hazard's dazzled for Chelsea this year, but the Belgium international wouldn't be available for selection . Likewise, Roman Abramovich wouldn’t be able to dip into his pocket to sign Eden Hazard or Cesc Fabregas when he wanted to. He would have to make do instead with solid Londoners like Scott Parker or Steve Sidwell. Chelsea would be 25/1 for the title and Manchester City 33/1 under the different system. Of course, local teams are akin to fantasy football now. The days when Celtic could win a European Cup with a team of Glaswegians will never happen again and as the likes of Steven Gerrard leave their hometown clubs, the number of local players in their Premier League team is getting fewer and further between. Manchester United deserve credit for having seven players from the north-west born within 60 minutes of Old Trafford at the club – Phil Jones, Wayne Rooney, Tyler Blackett, James Wilson, Jesse Lingard, Ben Amos and Nick Powell, although the last three have not played for the first-team this season.

"Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running and is proving to be worth every penny of the £32million spent by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. But can he really be as good as Thierry Henry? With that in mind, Sportsmail asked Arsenal fan Bob Allcock of Just Arsenal to tell us what he makes of the idea. Can Sanchez become as big a legend as Henry? Let's see what Bob thinks. As the Arsenal and Chile international star Alexis Sanchez grabbed yet another game by the scruff of the neck and shook it mercilessly at the Emirates against Stoke City, he was watched by the last player able to thrill the Arsenal fans in a similar way: Thierry Henry. The former France international was there with another Gunners legend, Robert Pires, as a guest of the club and I wonder what they made of the latest incredible display by Arsenal’s new strike star. They cannot fail to have been impressed with Alexis putting in his usual workload, which any combative central midfield general would be proud of. And that is what really makes him different and suggests to the Arsenal fans that we have finally found a player that can have the same influence as the great man who recently hung up his boots. Alexis Sanchez celebrates scoring for Arsenal against Stoke City at the Emirates on Sunday . Sanchez, who cost £30m, has hit the ground running since joining Arsenal from Barcelona . Henry used to light up a pitch in the way that very few players can but Alexis has that too, like the incredible run and finish for his second goal against Stoke. Football fans always love a player who gives their all, but when that player can also do things that nobody else can, he truly becomes something special and we take him to our heart. As I remember, it took a lot longer for the Arsenal fans to really warm to Henry, although he was younger and was more of a winger or wide forward when Wenger brought him to the Premier League. With Sanchez, though, it was almost instant because of the effort and dynamism he showed from the very start. Thierry Henry celebrates scoring in 2012 for Arsenal during his second stint with the north London club . A cutting edge helps, of course, so when he scored the only goal of the two-legged play-off against Besiktas to book Arsenal another place in the Champions League group stage, another box was ticked off. Someone suggested on our website a few days ago that Alexis had yet to prove himself for Arsenal against the big teams to really start to be compared with Henry. But they seem to have forgotten his stunning volley that gave us the lead against Manchester City in September. How about the second goal against Borussia Dortmund in a massive game that kept Arsenal hopes of progressing to the knockout stage alive? To suggest that Sanchez does not have a big-game mentality is just wrong. Henry was spotted at the Emirates this week to watch Arsenal face Stoke in the Premier League . Henry and Robert Pires (right) watch Arsenal from the stands as the former Gunners visited the Emirates . I cannot think of a player with a better or more consistent attitude and I believe that he would give his all against Real Madrid in a final in the same way he would on an away trip to Doncaster in a rainy FA Cup replay, because he loves the game. And he seems to have found his perfect home with Arsenal, where he does not have to play second fiddle to Lionel Messi and is fully appreciated by his adoring fans. You can only wonder what the Barca fans now think after seeing him explode on to the Premier League stage, when they used to greet him with lukewarm applause at best. I firmly believe that Alexis can have the same sort of impact for Arsenal as Henry had. He may not have enough time to break the Frenchman’s scoring record and he needs to keep producing every season, but without injury problems to stop him and as long as he has the team-mates around to back him up, Alexis will be an Arsenal great and will surely lead the Gunners back to glory… .

"Sam Allardyce believes Winston Reid could make a U-turn and decide to stay at West Ham if they qualify for Europe. As it stands the West Ham manager is resigned to losing his key centre-back when he is out of contract in the summer. But West Ham are still in the hunt for a Champions League or Europa League place, currently sitting seventh in the table only three points off Manchester United in fourth. Winston Reid (second left) competes for a high ball against Swansea's Bafetibi Gomis at the Liberty Stadium . Arsenal and Liverpool are both interested in signing Reid when his contract runs out this summer . 'I think that the way the club has improved I think with him staying and what we've done this season - and hopefully finish the season strongly - might persuade him to sign for us,' Allardyce said. 'We're on the up at the moment and we've got a very big future ahead of us, moving into the new stadium so the club could be bigger than it has ever been in the next four to five years.' Allardyce is standing firm in his unwillingness to sell the player on the cheap during the January transfer window – with Arsenal and Liverpool both interested – which would leave Reid with a decision to make at the end of this campaign. Hammers manager Sam Allardyce believes Reid will stay with the club if they reach Europe this season . 'There's no choice for me, he stays and that's it,' Allardyce insisted. 'It would have to be a big offer but whether somebody makes a big offer then obviously the chairman decides then. But for me, he's staying . The chairman decides whether the money's big enough but for me, he stays.' Allardyce also ruled out moving for out-of-favour Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic. West Ham had discussions about trying to sign the centre-back in summer, but he ended up staying at City where he has only managed one appearance, in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal. Allardyce added: 'I don't think Nastasic wants to stay in this country is my opinion based on the talks about Nastasic I had last summer before the window shut. The word was that is he was going to leave Manchester City then he wouldn' t stay in this country.'

"Manchester City have failed to win a Premier League game without Yaya Toure since April last year following the weekend draw with Everton. And the bad news for City boss Manuel Pellegrini is that he could be without his talisman until they face Newcastle on February 21 as Toure takes part in the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast. City's failure to win without the midfield powerhouse will be of grave concern for Pellegrini in this crucial month in the race for the title. Yaya Toure played for Ivory Coast in an Africa Cup of Nations warm-up match against Nigeria on Sunday . Toure was named African Footballer of the Year for a record fourth time last week . Manchester City vs Arsenal - Jan 18 . Manchester City vs - Jan 24 . Chelsea vs Manchester City - Jan 31 . Manchester City vs Hull - Feb 7 . Stoke vs Manchester City - Feb 11 . City have back-to-back Premier League games against Arsenal and league leaders Chelsea either side of an FA Cup clash with Middlesbrough in the next three weeks. Toure was criticised earlier in the season after a dip in his typically exceptional form but the former Barcelona midfielder has since returned to his best, coinciding with a seven-game winning streak in the Premier League as City clawed back an eight point deficit on Chelsea. Manchester City have won nine of their last 11 league games and Toure was absent in the two matches that they failed to get the maximum - the 1-1 draw with Everton and the clash with Burnley on December 28 when City threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2. Ivory Coast captain Toure gives a speech after being crowned the best African player . Toure was absent as Manchester City lost ground on Chelsea after drawing 1-1 with Everton . During that impressive run, Toure was instrumental as he scored six goals in eight games to help fire City to within touching distance of Jose Mourinho's side. Toure was present in four games that City have failed to win this season, including a defeat by Stoke and the draw with Chelsea at the Etihad in September. Should Ivory Coast reach the final of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, Toure could miss five matches for City in what could prove a decisive month in determining the destination of the Premier League crown come May.","Yaya Toure could miss Manchester City's next five games .

"Even when posting a cute image of himself as a baby for fans on Instagram, Lewis Hamilton has his mind on repeating 2014's Formula One world drivers' championship triumph in 2015. Hamilton turned 30 on Wednesday and told fans 'I'm going for number 3!' at the end of a heartfelt Instagram post to his followers just over two months out from the first race of the season in Australia. The Briton, who was born in Stevenage on January 7 in 1985, had one hell of a year in 2014 winning not only his second world title ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg but the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ahead of Rory McIlroy. Lewis Hamilton posts an image of himself as a baby on Instagram to mark his 30th birthday . Capping off a massive year, Hamilton poses with his BBC Sports Personality award and his dog Roscoe . The Briton soaks up the adulation after confirming his second F1 championship in Abu Dhabi . With plenty to be thankful for, Hamilton paid tribute to his parents in a touching post on social media. 'It is hard to believe that 30 years have passed. So many great memories,' Hamilton wrote. 'I have lived my life to fullest and am grateful for the years I've had. 'I want to thank my beautiful mum for bringing me into this world lovingly, and my dad for being such a great father.' 'I hope I get to see many more years and create more memories.' Hamilton thanked his mother Carmen Lockhart 'for bringing me into this world lovingly' Hamilton also paid tribute to his father Anthony (pictured with his stepmother Linda and girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger) 'for being such a great father' Hamilton is in the process of negotiating a new deal with Mercedes on his own behalf after splitting with management company XIX last year. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has confirmed he is lining up Fernando Alonso in the event of Hamilton not choosing to stay with the team which dominated 2014, but it's believed an agreement is around the corner. But his mind isn't just on business and continuing to excel on the track, he has big dreams for the world as a whole. Hamilton brought in the new year with Scherzinger and posted this composite image of their celebrations . 'I want to see us all help heal this world,' says Hamilton, who has spoken of his plans to do humanitarian work when he's finished behind the wheel.

"The Korean Formula One Grand Prix has been formally dropped from the 2015 calendar after its surprise inclusion last month for contractual reasons. A revised 20-race calendar, starting in Australia on March 15, appeared on the governing International Automobile Federation's website. An FIA spokesman confirmed the race had been removed because it was not viable. The Korean Formula One Grand Prix has been formally dropped from the 2015 calendar . That came as no shock, with the sport's commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone telling reporters in December that the local South Korean promoters did not want to hold the May 3 race but he had to include it for legal reasons. 'We have a contract with Korea. We have to put it on the calendar,' he said then. 'If we hadn't have done they could have sued us. We let them off for a year on the understanding they would be back.' The race, first hosted at the southern Yeongam circuit in 2010, did not take place last year. Bernie Ecclestone recently revealed it was only included on the calendar for contractual reasons . The decision to axe it again from what would have been a record 21-race list leaves a three week gap between Bahrain on April 19 and Spain on May 10. Some Formula One teams had seen the decision to include the Korean race as simply a means of allowing teams to have five engines per car this season and avoid a planned reduction to four. The wording of the regulations had stipulated that the teams could have five engines if the calendar 'as originally scheduled' had more than 20 races. That move was subsequently rendered unnecessary by a decision to allow limited in-season development for the existing engine manufacturers, although McLaren's new partners Honda will not benefit from it. The race had been due to take place between Bahrain on April 19 and Spain on May 10 .","The Korean Grand Prix has been dropped from the 2015 calendar .

"Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool will remain an attractive destination for the game’s top players even when they lose one of their biggest stars. Liverpool’s manager was determined to move on this Thursday by drawing a line under the story of Steven Gerrard leaving, stressing it was time ‘to concentrate on football’ when asked about his captain’s revelation that he would have stayed had a contract been offered last summer. What Rodgers did recognise, however, is that 34-year-old’s move to LA Galaxy leaves a void on and off the pitch. One ramification is that he will never be able to use the line ‘come and play with Steven Gerrard’ again when making a big sales pitch. Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool is still an attractive proposition for the top players . Steven Gerrard's departure to LA Galaxy was confirmed on Wednesday and he will join in July . Jordan Henderson (right) is in line to replace Gerrard as Liverpool captain next season . Rodgers, though, is refusing to lose heart and he maintains Liverpool have a duty to be competing at the top end of the market. ‘We have to have confidence that in the time I have been here, there have been some outstanding players who have come,’ said Rodgers. ‘But there is no doubt we need to replace that quality, either through some young players getting an opportunity or our players stepping up to the mark. ‘But (it is) also (about) bringing in that quality. Time will tell on that. It has been difficult and over the last couple of years, some of our top players have gone out. No one knows that more than me. The likes of Suarez leaving and Carragher going in the first year. Mario Balotelli (left) controls the ball during training at Melwood on Thursday morning . Rodgers is keen to draw a line under Gerrard's summer departure and push for a top-four finish . ‘They were fantastic players. Steven is going to move on. I want to work with that level of player. As a coach and manager, I enjoy working equally with the stars and the world-class talent as I do with young players so I am not purely one who needs to work with young players. ‘If you speak with the elite and world-class players, they will say they enjoyed working with me. But for us it is something that needs to be done. This is Liverpool - we have to be in the running for the world’s best.’ Yet even with Gerrard, Liverpool have found it difficult to woo big names and in the last two years, for one reason or another, they have missed out on Alexis Sanchez, Diego Costa, Willian and Henrikh Mkhitaran. They struggle to complete deals but Rodgers says Liverpool’s name still appeals. ‘We have to believe it can be done,’ said Rodgers. ‘Last season after nearly winning the league and playing a game that excited people, we were in a great position to attract a level of player. The team has changed but the great name of Liverpool is still the same. Balotelli and Mamadou Sakho (left) share a joke at the training session on Friday . Daniel Sturridge touched down at Heathrow airport on Thursday (right) after posting a selfie while flying . ‘It is still a big attraction for players. Hopefully we can still keep moving forward and come the end of the season, we will be in the Champions League having won something as well. You have to keep working to find the players who’ll make you the best you can be.’ One positive for Rodgers is that he should soon be able to call on Daniel Sturridge again. The England international has returned from undergoing intensive rehabilitation in the United States and it is hoped he will be available ‘towards the end of January’. ‘We have to trust the work he has done,’ said Rodgers. ‘It has been very good and when he comes back he hopefully sustains his fitness.’ Meanwhile, Dr Zaf Iqbal, Liverpool’s first-team doctor since 2010 has left his post abruptly. No reason has been given for his departure.","Liverpool have missed out on a number of targets in recent seasons .

"Milos Raonic is through to the Brisbane International final after defeating US Open finalist Kei Nishikori in a pulsating encounter over three tie-break sets. The 24-year-old Canadian prevailed 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 7-6(4) in just over two and a half hours in a match of high-quality tennis as neither player dropped serve. Only two points separated the pair as Raonic reached the final on Sunday to take on 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer, who is aiming for a 1,000th career win. World No 8 Milos Raonic celebrates after his epic three tie-break sets victory over Kei Nishikori . Both Raonic and Nishikori won 77 per cent of their service points and matched each other saving all three break points faced on serve. Raonic, the world No 8, will need to replicate this fine form against Federer considering his negative head-to-head record of seven to one against the Swiss. In his 14th ATP World Tour final, Raonic will hope to deny Federer a 1,000th career win after the world No 2 defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-2 in the other semi-final on Saturday. The Brisbane International is used as a warm up event to the first Grand Slam tournament of the season, the Australian Open, which begins on January 19.

"Roger Federer, seeking an 18th Grand Slam title in his 18th season on tour, will ease into 2015 with a match against either a wild-card entry or a qualifier at the Brisbane International next week. Federer, who arrived in Australia on Saturday, has a first-round bye in the Australian Open tune-up tournament. Then the 17-time Grand Slam champion will play the winner of a match between Australian wild-card entry John Millman and a yet-to-be-determined qualifier.

Hewitt will have a tough time getting there, though, with potential matches against South African Kevin Anderson in the second round and Milos Raonic of Canada in the quarterfinals. Federer last won a Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 2012, but feels good about adding a fifth Australian Open title this year. Coming back from a disappointing 2013, Federer won more matches (73) than any player last year and moved back to No.2 behind Novak Djokovic.

"Roger Federer moved on to 999 tour-level victories as he beat Grigor Dimitrov 6-2 6-2 in the semi-finals of the Brisbane International on Saturday. The world number two will face Milos Raonic in Sunday's final, with the opportunity to join Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl as the only players to reach four figures in the Open Era. Federer, the top seed, needed only 53 minutes to see off number four Dimitrov, winning 75 percent of his service points and breaking the Bulgarian four times. Roger Federer acknowledges the Brisbane crowd after completing his 999th tour-level victory on Saturday . Having finished runner-up to Lleyton Hewitt in this tournament last year, Federer is hoping to go one better in order to seal his 83rd tour-level title.

Federer will play his 125th professional final against Raonic with a seven to one head to head in his favour ahead of the first Grand Slam of the season in Melbourne which starts on January 19.

"This year is shaping up to be a landmark 12 months for British sporting success. After an up and down 2014, which saw various highs and lows, 2015 is promising to be a time where those wrongs can be righted and legacies can be cemented. Below Sportsmail's experts pick who they believe could make this year their own. FOOTBALL - WAYNE ROONEY (By Rob Draper) The England record is a given. He is on 46 international goals and this year will surpass Sir Bobby Charlton’s mark of 49. But he needs only 24 goals to surpass Sir Bobby’s Manchester United record of 249 too - that should be expected, injury permitting, in 2015. All of which means that this year we will again spend time considering Rooney’s impact. A summary thus far might read: not quite as good as we had hoped for in 2004 but better than almost anyone else. His longevity knocks spots off Paul Gascoigne; his goal-scoring will be better than Gary Lineker and Kevin Keegan. You have to go back to 1966 to put Rooney in his place. Those who feared he would burn out were wrong. Rooney is the best we have - and we should be thankful. Wayne Rooney is on course to beat Sir Bobby Robson's Manchester United and England goalscoring records . ONE TO WATCH: MATT GRIMES . Until last week, Grimes, 19, was the best technical midfielder in League Two having been nurtured by Paul Tisdale at Exeter City. Swansea have now taken him to the Premier League. He’s already played for England’s Under-20s - and not many do that from League Two. Matt Grimes (right) left Exeter City for Swansea in a £1.75million deal on a four-and-a-half year contract . CRICKET - JOE ROOT (By Paul Newman) With the World Cup and the Ashes, this year should be a big one for the new crop of England players who emerged in 2014, but the most important man this year and for some time to come is Joe Root. Now the Yorkshireman is back in the middle order, he should continue to make big runs in all forms. Root is also highly regarded as a leader and favourite to succeed Alastair Cook as Test captain and would have become ODI skipper after the World Cup had Cook managed a decent score in Sri Lanka and stayed on. As it was, it was felt that throwing in an inexperienced captain would have been reckless and Eoin Morgan got the nod. Root’s time will come. England batsman Joe Root is expected to succeed Alastair Cook as a future Test captain . ONE TO WATCH: SAM BILLINGS . This should be the year when Billings, 23, gets his chance in limited-overs cricket with England. He is the sort of dynamic player they will need where his explosive batting and keeping should ensure a fruitful future. He is good enough to play alongside Jos Buttler just as a batsman, too. Kent's Sam Billings (left) is tipped to become an England limited-overs star this year . ATHLETICS - KATARINA JOHNSON-THOMPSON (By Martha Kelner) The only British athlete to top the world merit rankings for 2014 - despite spending much of the season injured - the 21-year-old completed just one heptathlon last year, winning the Hypo-Meeting in Gotzis, before being ruled out of the Commonwealths and European Championships with injury. Victory in Gotzis, with a personal best of 6,682 points, was a breakthrough and 2015 is where she is expected to win her first major senior medal. She will compete at the World Championships in Beijing in August, and former Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee believes Johnson-Thompson can win gold in Rio and break her own world-record score of 7,291, set in 1988. Heptathlon star Katarina Johnson-Thompson is expected to win her first major senior medal this year . ONE TO WATCH: THOMAS SOMERS . Over 200m, Somers became the second fastest 17-year-old in history last July - the only man to run faster at that age is Usain Bolt. He will bid for World Junior Championships gold this year. Thomas Somers became the second fastest 17-year-old in history over 200m . RUGBY UNION - STUART LANCASTER (By Chris Foy) The obvious choice is the only choice. The England head coach will find himself in the hottest of hot seats when it comes to the highlight of this sporting year - the rugby World Cup in this country in September and October. England must find a way out of Pool A containing mighty rivals in Wales and Australia. The doomsday scenario of the hosts being ditched from their own party so early is enough to keep the coaches and their RFU employers awake at night. Lancaster endured intense criticism in November and admitted that it served as useful preparation for what awaits him nine months from now. As a relative novice at Test level, he will face a monumental and very public challenge of his credentials. England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be hoping to lead the host nation to glory at the World Cup this year . ONE TO WATCH: SAM BURGESS . Bath’s cross-code recruit Burgess, 26, is undertaking a crash-course in the nuances of union, with his every move analysed amid a raging debate about his best position. Meanwhile, the England coaches are desperate to pick him as soon as he has shown the faintest grasp of a whole new ball game. His quest to claim a fast-track call-up for the World Cup is the most intriguing personal tale of the year. A nation is willing him on. Bath's Sam Burgess (left) is getting to grips with rugby union having only switched codes recently . GOLF - RORY MCILROY (By Derek Lawrenson) It is never easy following up a banner year but it will be surprising if Rory McIlroy does not manage it in 2015. OK, a date in a courtroom to settle a legal battle with his former management company is hardly the place a world No 1 should be in February, just two months before the Masters. Against that, the Northern Irishman could hardly have come up with a better set of major venues. Three will be on courses that fit his eye, with the fun beginning with his first tilt at the career Grand Slam at Augusta in April. And if he wins there, with St Andrews for The Open and Whistling Straits for the USPGA to come, he might never stop. World No 1 golfer Rory McIlroy will be aiming to complete a career Grand Slam at the Masters in April . ONE TO WATCH: DANNY WILLETT . A first invitation to the Masters was recognition of cracking the top 50 and if the 27-year-old keeps his focus, it might be the top 20 this time next year for the Englishman. Danny Willett's impressive golf form means the 27-year-old could break into the top 20 if he keeps his focus . TENNIS - ANDY MURRAY (By Mike Dickson) There cannot be many excuses for Andy Murray not producing his best. Losing members of his coaching staff and the slog towards the top after back surgery were mitigating circumstances last year, and finishing as world No 6 was commendable. But now he has had time to settle with new coach Amelie Mauresmo and if he is going to add to his two majors - his best chance remains Wimbledon - there is no time to waste because he is 28 in May. Adding a more aggressive dimension to his play means going against his counter-punching instincts, but he has to evolve. At 33, Roger Federer has shown it is never too late. Andy Murray will be looking to recapture the form of 2013 after a disappointing season last year . ONE TO WATCH: NICK KYRGIOS . Only 19 and very self-assured, Australian Kyrgios showed what he can do by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon. He has natural, easy power, and 52 is a precocious ranking for a teenager. But the year after a breakthrough can be tough. Nick Kyrgios caused one of the upsets of the season when he beat Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon last year . FORMULA 1 - JENSON BUTTON (By Jonathan McEvoy) F1 fans should thank the McLaren board members who outvoted chairman Ron Dennis’s intention to ditch Jenson Button. The result is a world-class showdown, for Button versus Fernando Alonso represents a test of each man’s mettle in the autumn of their careers. It is also a clash of styles. Button, 35 later this month, is a resilient character who accumulates points quietly. Alonso, 33, is fiery yet brittle. Button outscored Lewis Hamilton at McLaren. If he does the same against Alonso, rated the most complete driver by most, he might even get another contract. Jenson Button will be racing in Formula 1 next season after keeping his seat ahead of Kevin Magnussen . ONE TO WATCH: JOLYON PALMER . Britain’s first GP2 champion since Lewis Hamilton, Palmer, 23, will either be handed a drive this year - possibly by Force India, for whom he has tested - or will probably never be heard of in F1 again. 23-year-old Jolyon Palmer became Britain's first GP2 champion in 2014 since Lewis Hamilton . BOXING - AMIR KHAN (By Jeff Powell) If he can overcome all the boxing politics, this year could bring Amir Khan the opportunity to challenge the top two pound-for-pound fighters on the planet and perhaps even claim that mythical title for himself. Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are the greats in the sights of Bolton’s courageous ambassador for Anglo-Muslim relations. On the evidence of his victories in 2014 over Luis Collazo and Devon Alexander, he has the speed and maturing style to give them a helluva fight - unless they get in the ring with each other in the richest bout of all time. If that does get in Khan’s way, a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook could refill Wembley Stadium. Amir Khan (left) secured an unanimous points victory over Devon Alexander in Las Vegas last month .

"Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman has dismissed talk of a transfer to Manchester United, insisting it would be 'disrespectful' to be discussing a move at this time. The 24-year-old has long been linked with the Red Devils and speculation has mounted further since his former Holland manager Louis van Gaal took over  at Old Trafford. Strootman, however, has just returned from a long-term cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out of the World Cup, and says his primary focus is on playing for Roma and getting back to his best.

"Roberto Mancini was flattened by one of his own players on Sunday as his Inter Milan side continued their resurgence in Serie A with a 3-1 win over Genoa. With the score at 2-0, Genoa tried to unlock Inter's defence with a quick counter attack that was abruptly halted by defender Marco Andreolli. Andreolli cut across and went to blast the ball into the stands, but instead the ball flew straight into Mancini's face. VIDEO - Scroll down to see Roberto Mancini get hit in the face by the ball . Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini falls to the ground after Marco Andreolli's clearance hit him in the face . Mancini (second right) was not hurt and laughed off the incident as his team went on and won the game 3-1 . Rodrigo Palacio (centre) scored a rebound from close range to give Inter an early lead in the game . The power behind Andreolli's clearance meant that Mancini, renowned for a neat touch and clever anticipation as a player, had no chance of getting out of the way. But the Inter manager saw the funny side and burst into laughter as he rubbed his face. Rodrigo Palacio put Inter ahead after 12 minutes when he converted a rebound from a Mauro Icardi volley. And Icardi got his name on the scoresheet six minutes before half time with a powerful header. After the break, Genoa's attacking play improved. Maxime Lestienne struck the crossbar on 62, and five minutes before full time, they pulled a goal back through an Armando Izzo strike. The goal looked set to ensure a nervy finish at the San Siro, but former Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidic had other ideas.

"Former Olympic athletes Steve Cram, Dame Mary Peters and Wendy Sly are among the recipients of awards in the New Year Honours but reports that rugby star Jonny Wilkinson would receive a knighthood have proved groundless. Cram, the former world champion, 1984 Olympic silver medallist and world record holder at 1,500 metres, is made a CBE in recognition of his recent work as chair of the English Institute of Sport (EIS). Cram told Press Association Sport: 'It's really fantastic to have this recognition. A large part of my journey since then has been the EIS and we have put a lot of things in place to give support to our Olympic programmes.'

Sly, who won silver in the 3,000m at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, receives an MBE for services to athletics. Reports that Wilkinson would become 'Sir Jonny' prompted Sir Bob Kerslake, the outgoing head of the Civil Service, to say he would look into the issue of individuals being wrongly named as receiving honours.

Brendan Batson, the former West Brom defender who was one of the pioneers for black footballers in the 1970s also receives an MBE for services to football. Batson, previously an MBE, worked for the Professional Footballers' Association and more recently has been an adviser to the FA on equality and football development. Batson told Press Association Sport: 'When we look at the way things have evolved over the years as a whole I am very pleased with the development of black players but there is still a long way to go to address the lack of representation in coaching, management and governance.'

"Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has hinted he would be keen on linking back up with Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli by suggesting he is among the world's best players. Balotelli worked under Allegri during his brief stint at AC Milan before sealing a move back to the Premier League. The Italian international has been linked with a move away from Anfield after failing to hit the ground running on his return to England and Allegri has claimed he would be keen on coaching the 24-year-old once again. Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri insists Mario Balotelli is among the best players in the world . Balotelli, pictured playing against Sunderland, has scored just two goals in 18 appearances for the Reds . Allegri would be keen on signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Adnan Januzaj if they were made available . Allegri, speaking to Italian newspaper Tuttosport, said: 'Mario had a good season with me, I think. 'Unfortunately he's built up a character outside the world of football and everyone talks about what he does off the pitch. 'I think he has some good technical and physical qualities, but the time came when it was up to him to prove his worth. 'All coaches like to train the best players. But Balotelli is a Liverpool player and I think first he has to think about playing well, sacrificing and giving his best - especially to show everyone who says he is an important player.' Allegri has also stated he would be interested in signing Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj and Dortmund's Henrikh Mkhitaryan if they were made available by their respective clubs. He told La Gazzetta dello Sport: 'Mkhitaryan and Januzaj are two great players but I don't know if the clubs will sell them.'","Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has heaped praise on Mario Balotelli .

"Queens Park Rangers are hoping to take Chelsea winger Mohamed Salah on loan until the end of the season. Much depends on their budget though with QPR struggling to finance deals following the arrival of Mauro Zarate from West Ham. The 22-year-old Salah has made just the 13 Premier League appearances since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Basle a year ago and has also attracted interest from Sunderland, West Brom and Inter Milan. Mohamed Salah is wanted in a loan deal by QPR after failing to make his mark at Chelsea . Meanwhile, Chelsea youngster Todd Kane is joining Nottingham Forest on loan after being recalled from a spell at Bristol City. League One City wanted to keep the 21-year-old right back, who joined them in November, but Chelsea are keen for him to play in the Championship. Chelsea youngster Todd Kane, in action for Bristol City, will join Nottingham Forest on loan . Borussia Dortmund remain determined to keep hold of Mats Hummels this window despite Manchester United's desire to sign the Germany defender. Rumours are rife that United have made an offer but Dortmund are struggling to rectify a poor season and selling their captain now would only aggravate disgruntled fans further. The club also opened talks with Marco Reus about a new contract although he and his advisers have apparently asked that a buy-out clause remains intact, something the club is reluctant to agree. Manchester United target Mats Hummels is likely to stay at Borussia Dortmund in this transfer window . Andros Townsend's return to form means Tottenham are unlikely to consider letting him go this month. Several Premier League sides including West Brom, Crystal Palace, QPR and Everton hold an interest in the England international who had lost his way a little following injury last season. However, Mauricio Pochettino has been happy with the 23-year-old's performances of late and believes he has a role to play. Andros Townsend, racing past Burnley's Scott Arfield, has come back into form and will likely stay at Spurs . Townsend said: 'Unless the club come and tell me they want me to leave then I won’t be going anywhere. I’m fighting for my shirt. The last six or seven windows have been the same, with my name linked with other clubs.' Team-mate Aaron Lennon remains a target for West Bromwich Albion though. New manager Tony Pulis wants a left back, two wingers and a midfielder to bolster his squad. West Ham United midfielder Diego Poyet is wanted on loan by Championship side Watford. The 19-year-old has made four appearances since his summer move from Charlton and came on as a substitute for Matt Jarvis in Tuesday night's FA Cup draw with Everton at Goodison Park. He had a loan spell with Huddersfield earlier in the season and they are interested too. Watford, however, are fifth in the Championship, seven points off leaders Bournemouth, and believe a couple of shrewd acquisitions this month could give them the extra edge required to challenge for promotion. Diego Poyet, son of Sunderland boss Gus, is wanted by Watford on loan to aid their promotion push . West Ham are open to the loan as they want Poyet to keep developing and he needs competitive games for that to happen. Watford, meanwhile, are giving a trial to Vujadin Savic. The Serbian centre back played just over an hour in a back three for Watford Under 21s against Leeds United this week. They scored five first-half goals in a 6-1 victory in the Premier League Under 21 Cup. The 24-year-old Savic has previously played for Bordeaux and was on loan at Dynamo Dresden and Arminia Bielefeld. Stoke's ambitious bid to sign Xherdan Shaqiri could meet an abrupt end as the Switzerland international is poised to tell Bayern Munich he wishes to join Inter Milan. Bayern had hoped Liverpool would come to the table but that has not materialised and Inter have offered a £2m loan fee with £10m to follow over the next three years. Bayern winger Xherdan Shaqiri is likely to turn down the advances of Stoke in favour of a move to Inter Milan . Stoke expect winger Victor Moses and new signing Philipp Wollscheid to both be in training on Wednesday when the first-team squad reports back from a two-day break. Moses has been out since November with a thigh injury. Newcastle have no plans to sell Moussa Sissoko this month. There have been enquiries from agents looking to broker deals for Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal but it is understood that no formal approaches have been made. Talks are ongoing over a new contract for the 25-year-old who is valued at around £20m. Newcastle want to hang on to star man Moussa Sissoko in the face of interest from PSG and Arsenal . Southampton are looking to buy Dundee's teenage striker Craig Wighton. The 17-year-old has impressed scouts enough for the club to offer £200,000. Swansea City and Sunderland have also watched him closely over the past season and Dundee will find it hard to turn down offers but will look capitalise on one of Scotland's brightest young talents. Blackburn have shown an interest also. Brentford are battling it out with Red Bull Salzburg for Sturm Graz striker Marco Djuricin. Manager Mark Warburton has just two fit strikers and Djuricin, 22, is among the names on his radar. The Austrian Under 21 international is in the final year of his deal at Graz and is looking to move on this month.","QPR want Mohamed Salah on loan until the end of the season .

"The Premier League and Sky Sports have been told to stop playing matches on Remembrance Sunday and accused of lacking respect for the day. Four top-flight matches were played on November 9 last year, which marked Remembrance Sunday. Newcastle against West Brom and Swansea versus Arsenal were broadcast on Sky Sports. But Labour MP Sharon Hodgson on Thursday asked the House of Commons for a rule change which would see all matches played on the Saturday or Monday of the weekend nearest November 11. Bafetimbi Gomis scores for Swansea City against Arsenal on Remembrance Sunday in 2014 . Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West, is concerned that matches were played on Remembrance Sunday the past two years at Sunderland's Stadium of Light against Everton and Manchester City. In the two years previous to that another four fixtures were played on Remembrance Sunday around the country. In the past decade there have only been two occasions when Remembrance Sunday has not had any top-flight fixtures — in 2005 and 2011. Hodgson urged Sports Minister Helen Grant to speak to the Premier League and Sky Sports to convince them to not schedule matches on Remembrance Sunday this year — on November 15. Labour MP Sharon Hodgson made the complaint . Hodgson said: 'As we're well into the 100-year commemorations of the First World War would you re-assure the House, veterans in my area as well as my local armed forces network, that you will ask Sky to reconsider the scheduling of their broadcast of their matches on Remembrance Sunday — which has happened in Sunderland two years in a row — and instead schedule the games for the Saturday so as to respect the original intentions of this special day — remembering those who give their lives for our country.' Ms Grant replied: 'It is important to always remember those who sacrifice their lives for our country. I'm very happy to have a chat with you on those issues.' Sky Sports and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by Sportsmail. Surprisingly, the MP only mentioned football, failing to notice that the ATP World Tour tennis finals in London and horse racing meetings were also broadcast that day. In previous years there have been rugby internationals too. Football, encouraged by the Daily Mail, has done plenty to mark Remembrance Sunday in recent years. For the past four seasons, clubs have had the British Legion poppy emblem embroidered on shirts. Last year, the centenary year of the First World War, all Premier League clubs wore a special poppy on their shirts emblazoned with '1914-2014 Football Remembers.' Clubs up and down the country held a minutes' silence out of respect ahead of matches. Arsenal installed two giant poppies above Armoury Square overlooking Hornsey Road at their Emirates Stadium. The tribute remained in place until Armistice Day, on November 11. West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United in action during their clash on November 11 2014 . A Premier League spokesman said: . 'Remembrance weekend matches have long been part of English football, with fans and players alike using the occasion to pay their respects. 'Our clubs and their fans mark these occasions in a number of ways including raising money for the Royal British Legion, providing match tickets for service personnel and their families via Tickets for Troops, players wearing poppies on their shirts and clubs linking up with local regiments and giving them roles on a match day. 'It is hugely appreciated by the armed forces. 'Remembering those who fought and died in World War 1 has been an integral part of our Football Remembers work over the past year. This has included providing education resources for every school in the UK, and holding a Truce Tournament for academy boys from across Europe in Ypres, Belgium. This activity has been done with the full support, involvement and encouragement of the Sports Minister and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.'","Sky Sports show football on Remembrance Sunday every year .

Enrique himself was previously forced to deny he had received an ultimatum  after their 1-0 defeat against David Moyes's Real Sociedad and an apparent fallout with Messi, who started on the substitutes' bench. Enrique refused to comment on rumours of a row with Messi but said: 'I have not received any ultimatum, if I had it would have been the first time in my short career, but I have not.

Austin is way behind some of the biggest earners at Loftus Road. Joey Barton is the highest-paid player at QPR on £90,000-a-week and Croatian winger Niko Kranjcar is on just over £60,000. Austin signed a three-year deal worth £28,000-a-week when he joined from Burnley in a £4million move in 2013. Joey Barton (pictured) is the highest-paid player at QPR on £90,000 a week .

Rangers are in a relegation battle at the foot of the Premier League and Austin is one of the players they are relying on to get them clear of danger. Austin, who began his career in non-league football with Hungerford Town and Poole Town, has been tipped for a place in Roy Hodgson’s England squad for their next Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Lithuania in March.

"Alan Pardew's sudden departure as Newcastle manager on Monday has lit up social media after his shock move to become Crystal Palace manager. Former Newcastle players Michael Owen and Joey Barton have posted their support of Pardew's decision to return to Crystal Palace, where he played from 1978-1991, whilst Labour MP for Newcastle Central Chi Onwurah wished it was owner Mike Ashley leaving the club. Pardew ended four years at the helm at St James' Park on Monday following a £2million compensation settlement between the south London club and Ashley was agreed. Former Newcastle manager Alan Pardew acknowledges the home crowd at St James' Park on Sunday . Barton, who played for Newcastle between 2007-2011, posted a series of tweets on Monday evening praising the work of Pardew during his time as Magpies manager before attacking owner Mike Ashley. The midfielder, now playing for Queen's park Rangers, believes Tony Pulis should be given the job but inferred that the next Newcastle manager will have to accept Ashley's control on proceedings. 'But he will no doubt appoint somebody who he can control and that will accept transfers being out of their control. Pulis won't have that,' Barton posted on his Twitter. Former Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton posted this series of tweets after hearing Pardew had left the club . Another former Newcastle player Michael Owen, who endured an injury plagued four year stint at the club, posted his support for Pardew on social media following months of abuse from sections of the Magpies fans. 'Some may think it is strange for Alan Pardew to want to leave a huge club for a smaller one but the scar left by months of abuse will never heal,' Owen said on his Sportlobster account. 'Plus, the lure of going back to the club closest to your heart can never be underestimated,' added Owen.

"Burnley boss Sean Dyche is confident Danny Ings is not being affected by speculation surrounding his future. The striker's performances in his debut Barclays Premier League season have reportedly caught the eye of a number of clubs, with Tottenham, Liverpool and Newcastle all having been linked with the 22-year-old. Dyche insists there have been no inquiries since the transfer window opened, and player, manager and club have all continued to state unequivocally that Ings is going nowhere this month. Danny Ings' form this season has been attracting interest from a host of Premier League clubs . Ings scored his sixth goal of the season in Burnley's defeat of fellow strugglers QPR at the weekend . But, with the striker out of contract in the summer and having so far declined to sign a new deal, the speculation is certain to continue. Ings was critical of his own performance despite scoring his sixth goal of the season against QPR on Saturday but, asked if his star player was being affected, Dyche said: 'It doesn't look like it, his performances look pretty decent to me. 'He's quite demanding of himself, almost too demanding. I've told him to smile and relax and enjoy what he's doing, and that seems to work with him. His thirst to improve is there for all to see. 'It's an ongoing negotiation, like it is with a lot of players. We get on well with his agent, and that's an important thing as well. Clarets manager Sean Dyche is not worried that Ings will be affected by the speculation over his future . 'Everyone knows where it is and that's always been the case. We try and be open and honest in our dealings with players and we've certainly been that with him. Where it takes us, we'll see. 'We're quite secure. The good side of not spending millions and millions of pounds - we've spent a few quid by Burnley standards, but not by the Premier League market - is that we're in a good place financially. 'We're not under any questions of any of our players going out of the building. We're looking to recruit ones that can come in and help us to move forward.' Burnley have moved out of the relegation zone following a decent run of results in the league . Spurs are likely to get another close look at Ings on Wednesday when Burnley visit White Hart Lane for the FA Cup third-round replay, with Dyche not tempted to rest players. The Clarets moved out of the relegation zone with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over QPR last weekend and face another close rival, Crystal Palace, on Saturday. Dyche has stuck with broadly the same team all season and named an identical side for six games in a row over Christmas and New Year. He said: 'With the run over Christmas and the amount of games we played there, the same team was operating two and three days apart. Tottenham will get a chance to run the rule over Ings in their FA cup replay on Wednesday . 'The team we put out against Tottenham last time was the strongest team we could field because of injury and illness. That will be the same again. It's nothing to do with overthinking the games around us. 'We want to win the game. We've had a nice little run of performances and we've been getting rewards from our performances. 'But the team's not just rolled out, I can assure you. There's a lot of work goes into each performance and a lot of detail to make sure they have the best chance to go and operate again. 'We know the physical stats, the training volume. So if someone we think is really on the edge of their physical capacity, then there'll be a decision to make. So far they've been really good with it.' Sam Vokes (left) is hoping to get back in the team following a goal scoring return from injury . One player hoping to be given a chance at White Hart Lane will be striker Sam Vokes, who returned from a long-term knee injury last month and scored his first goal against Spurs to earn Burnley the replay. Vokes was back on the bench against QPR and may have to be patient again as he waits for his first start.

"CLICK HERE for the full match report . Victor Wanyama's hamstring injury marred Southampton's FA Cup third-round replay win at Ipswich for manager Ronald Koeman. Saints arrived at Portman Road riding the crest of a wave following Sunday's impressive victory at Manchester United. That win came at a cost, though, with influential centre-back Toby Alderweireld sustaining a hamstring strain which will see him miss up to four weeks. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Ipswich 0-1 Southampton . Victor Wanyama is expected to be sidelined for several weeks after suffering a hamstring injury . Ronald Koeman bemoaned his growing injury list despite defeating Ipswich in their FA cup replay . Wanyama is treated by medical staff before being forced off he pitch during Saints' 1-0 victory . It means Saints now have just two centre-backs available, while their defensive midfield options have been depleted by injuries to Morgan Schneiderlin and Wanyama. An adductor strain saw France midfielder Schneiderlin miss the 1-0 win at Ipswich on Wednesday - a match which saw Wanyama pull up with a hamstring injury just before half-time. 'It is really negative because already we have some other injuries,' Koeman said. 'I already spoke before the game with Victor and Steven Davis as I had made the decision to give both players 45 minutes. 'Then 12 seconds before half-time, he got his hamstring injury and, okay, you know if it is really a hamstring injury then he will be out for four or five weeks. 'I don't regret playing him. He had some calf problems out of the game against Man United, but he trained yesterday. 'But, okay, we know we have a tough programme and we don't have a big squad to resolve that kind of problem with injuries. 'Schneiderlin has a little bit the same as he had when he came back from the French national team. 'It is an adductor problem in his right leg and he will be out for three or four weeks, like Toby Alderweireld, but, okay, we have a lot of young players.' Saints striker Shane Long celebrates after scoring the winning goal at Portman Road . Southampton players celebrate as they head towards a FA Cup fourth round tie with Crystal Palace . Those three injuries will seriously test Saints in the coming weeks, starting at Newcastle on Saturday - a Premier League match followed swiftly by the FA Cup clash with Crystal Palace. Shane Long's first half goal secured their place in the fourth round, with Koeman satisfied by his side's display against Championship promotion chasers Ipswich. 'I think it was a very serious performance tonight,' the Dutchman said. 'It was lucky we scored out of the first chance we got in the game. 'After that, we defended well, had good organisation in the team. 'I think we had some good opportunities in the second half in the first 10 or 15 minutes to create something out of that counter-attacking. 'But I am proud of the team, the players and how we showed our character today. 'It was difficult, it was a typical English cup game - long balls, battles, but a great performance from the lads and that is very positive.' Southampton's other holding midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin (front)  is also sidelined with an abductor injury . Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy admitted the FA Cup clash had been a 'damp squib' for Tractor Boys . It was a solid display from Saints that Ipswich counterpart Mick McCarthy could appreciate, even though that organisation and Long's first-half goal made it a 'damp squib' of a cup replay. 'Of course it is disappointing for us all,' he said. 'Somebody said to me after (the home loss to Derby) Saturday 'oh, I am really disappointed' - well, we all are,' the Town boss said. 'We did not want that game to be like that. We wanted it to be a rip-roaring cup tie. They didn't allow it to happen. 'We should give a bit of credit to them. It is not always us that is to blame - we have tried our hardest, as we always do, but they had a damn good side. 'I watched them beat Arsenal, I watched them beat Manchester United, you know, so it is no great shame on us that we have lost to Southampton. 'The shame is, I guess, or the pity, is that we didn't have the exciting cup tie we were all hoping for.'","Southampton defeated Ipswich 1-0 in their FA Cup third round clash .

"Tim Sherwood is the leading contender to replace sacked Alan Irvine with West Bromwich Albion keen to make an appointment by the weekend. The former Tottenham Hotspur head coach came close to landing the Hawthorns job last summer but talks collapsed over wages and Sherwood’s desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. Those hurdles could be overcome on this occasion with the futures of current assistants Keith Downing and Rob Kelly uncertain. Alan Irvine has been sacked as manager of West Brom after a difficult start to the season . Former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is the early favourite to take over at the Baggies . 'The individual progress of our players such as Craig Dawson and Saido Berahino are testament to that. 'But sadly that simply has not translated into results and they remain the ultimate currency of Alan's position. 'Securing a sixth season in the Premier League is the over-riding target and sometimes unpleasant decisions have to be taken to serve that imperative. Irvine's team have been on a bad run and they were beaten 2-0 by Stoke in the Premier League on Sunday . The pair will take charge of West Brom for the clash with West Ham United on New Year’ s Day but a club statement announcing Irvine’s sacking failed to guarantee their futures. Tony Pulis is also in the frame but it is unclear how he would work within West Brom’s continental structure where head coach leaves transfers to the technical director, in this case Terry Burton. The club announced Irvine's departure with immediate effect on Monday night with the Scot being placed on gardening leave. 'We appointed Alan in the summer convinced that we had taken on one of the foremost coaches in the UK and nothing that has happened since then has altered our view,' technical director Terry Burton said. 'Alan has impressed everyone with his manner, dedication and diligence but he knows that results have simply not been good enough. 'We place on record our gratitude for his efforts and hold nothing but good wishes for his future endeavours. This was a decision taken with regret but sadly driven by necessity.' Defender Lescott looks dejected after West Brom concededed the second goal to Stoke on Sunday . Chairman Jeremy Peace, who fired both Steve Clarke and Pepe Mel last season, had been keen to make the summer appointment of Irvine work and knows the players have been fully behind his methods. But after travelling fans subjected Irvine to a barrage of abuse at the end of Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Stoke City, the 56-year-old's time at the Hawthorns has come to an end. Irvine has overseen a dismal run of results that have seen West Brom win just once in the last nine Premier League games, leaving the club one point above the relegation zone.","West Brom have only won once in their last nine Premier League games .

"Referee Bobby Madden defended  his decision on Friday night to start a snowbound Rangers-Hearts clash abandoned after 25 minutes. With the game the subject of a pre-match pitch inspection – while loud protests against the Rangers board took place outside – the Govan area was blasted by heavy snow an hour before kick-off. Acting on the advice of groundstaff, however, Madden decided to go ahead with the game in farcical conditions. Bobby Madden gestures for both sets of players to return to the dressing rooms after abandoning the match . Striker Kenny Miller (right) tries to avoid a tackle from Hearts' Alim Ozturk early on in the top-of-the-table clash . Loudly booed by a crowd of less than 20,000 when he called a halt to proceedings, the referee defended himself afterwards, insisting: ‘It was the right decision (to start). The fans were inside the ground. I made the final decision based on player safety. The information was it (the snow) was forecast to come back on. ‘There was a potential risk of injury. When you see the players running at 100 per cent, you see they are struggling. It was the best decision to start the game and see what happened. ‘When we arrived at the stadium we felt it was acceptable. ‘We were led to believe through the groundstaff that the snow would not come back – which it didn’t – and that the snow would melt once the players were on the field of play and through the undersoil heating. Hearts players applaud their travelling supporters after having their clash with Rangers was called off . ‘Unfortunately, after starting the match, it didn’t seem to improve. So the decision was taken to postpone the match. ‘Both coaches were concerned for the safety of their players and I took that into consideration because that is of paramount importance. ‘I spoke to both coaches on different occasions before we took the final decision.’ Hearts boss Robbie Neilson appealed to the official to call a halt to proceedings before he did so on safety grounds. Rangers fans gesture towards Hearts' travelling supporters after the match was cancelled . Police and stewards are forced to hold people back as Hearts and Rangers fans confront each other . Concerned that players might have suffered an injury, the Tynecastle manager defended Madden’s decision, saying: ‘I think Bobby made the right call at the start – you never know with snow as it can break up and melt and we could have had a decent game. ‘But tonight it just turned to ice. It was soft underneath and then hard on the top and it becomes a shambles. ‘Players were missing the ball and others were falling over it, but the real worry is that someone gets injured. Rangers fans display a 'Forever Ibrox' banner after continuing their pre-match protests during the game . ‘Alim (Ozturk) took a bad one on his shin with a 50-50 tackle when both players missed the ball. I think the ref made the right decision in the end. I feel we had to give it a go, we took the chance and it didn’t work out.’ Rangers announced later that fans who retain their ticket stubs will now gain free entry to the rearranged fixture, with a date still to be set. Expressing sympathy for the supporters robbed of the chance to see the game to completion, Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall said: ‘It’s expensive enough to go and see football in a normal situation but to get it cut short is not ideal.’","The match between Rangers and Hearts was abandoned after 25 minutes .

"Among the grand targets being pursued by Daryl Murphy, from career redemption to a place in the Premier League and a run in the FA Cup, is a piece of paper worth £100. Written on it are his name and a number that seemed unfeasibly high when he scrawled it last summer. Once folded, it was handed to Mick McCarthy with the cash. Like most aspects of life at Ipswich Town, it was the manager’s idea. ‘He called us together one day before the season started and told us all to do it,’ Murphy explains. Daryl Murphy hopes to take his scoring form into the FA Cup third round replay against Southampton . The Ipswich star has scored 17 times for his club this season and is the country's second top goalscorer . Chesterfield's Eoin Doyle tops the leader board for highest scorers throughout the English league . ‘Strikers had to put down what they were going to score this season, goalkeepers had to write how many clean sheets and so on. Then we each had to put £100 into the gaffer’s pot — it is going to charity if you don’t reach your number. Eoin Doyle (Chesterfield) - 18 . Daryl Murphy (Ipswich) - 17 . Andy Williams (Swindon) - 17 . Chris Martin (Derby) - 15 . Diego Costa (Chelsea) - 15 . Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) - 14 . Marc Richards (Northampton) - 13 . Jonathan Forte (Oldham) - 13 . Charlie Austin (QPR) - 13 . Britt Assombalonga (Nottingham Forest) - 13 . ‘If you reach it you get it back. You don’t put down a low number because it’s for charity and besides, the gaffer would never allow it. I put down quite a high number. I won’t tell you what it was as I’m not there yet but it looks like I might get there.’ Like a number of McCarthy’s decisions, it seems to have had a positive effect on the 31-year-old striker who was once drifting but is now the leading scorer in the Championship; a 17-goal spearhead in a team who sit third in the division. Tonight Ipswich try to accomplish what Manchester United failed to do and beat third-placed Premier League side Southampton, in an FA Cup third-round replay at Portman Road. It’s not bad for a club that was bottom of the Championship table when McCarthy arrived in November 2012. Only Tyrone Mings, a £10,000 signing from non-League Chippenham, commanded a fee. The rest of his recruits, including Murphy, cost nothing. For Murphy, the Championship player of the month for December, the goal rush is something he never saw coming. Chris Martin makes up a top four of goal scorers in England that contains no Premier League players . Chelsea star Diego Oscar (left) has had a perfect start to his Premier League career, scoring 15 goals . ‘I’m as surprised as anyone about how this season has gone,’ he says. ‘This is the best time of my career.’ The Republic of Ireland international spent the first few years bouncing from League Two with Luton to the League of Ireland, before McCarthy took him to Sunderland in 2005. It was good but not much more for a striker mostly playing on the left wing — if at all. He never scored more than three goals in a season and the games dried up. In 2010, Celtic’s Neil Lennon came along. ‘They were the team I supported as a boy, so I took a pay cut to go but it didn’t go well. When I was given a run in the team I scored two in three starts, but then I got injured. Sergio Aguero has netted 14 times for Manchester City despite spending a month out with a knee injury . ‘There was a game I was sitting out when we won 9-0 — the strikers, Gary Hooper and Anthony Stokes, scored a hat-trick each. I’m in the stands thinking, “How is your luck?” I didn’t play that next weekend, obviously, and the lads kept scoring. I couldn’t get back in and I accepted that.’ He spent two loan spells at Ipswich between 2010 and 2012 and it was during a third spell at the club in 2012-13 that McCarthy took over. The following summer the move became permanent. ‘Maybe I was destined to play for Ipswich,’ Murphy says. ‘I came here under Roy Keane. I got on brilliantly with him and do still. He gave me a copy of his book — a good read. I didn’t get a mention! ‘The gaffer now has done so much for me. On his first day here he called me into his office and said I would be a striker again, no more playing on the left. It was music to my ears. His faith in me has been so important.’ QPR striker Charlie Austin has been in spectacular form for Harry Redknapp's men this season . The result was 13 goals last season and a stunning run in this campaign. The signs are good, even if the challenge of maintaining their form will be increased by interest in Mings. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has admitted he is keen on the defender but Murphy said: ‘I don’t see why he should go when he is playing here every week. If you go to a big club you are probably going to be on the bench. In that position, I would rather play every week.’ The words carry weight from a man who has served his time on the sidelines. If Mings sticks around then Murphy will have a better chance of getting back to the Premier League. Either way, you would not bet against him getting back his £100.

"Kenny Jackett hopes Arsenal forward Benik Afobe can add firepower to his Wolves side after wasteful finishing almost cost them at Ewood Park. A David Edwards piledriver just after half-time ensured Wolves clinched a win which lifted them to within a point of the play-offs. But the victory should have been more comfortable with Wolves guilty of failing to take a number of clear-cut opportunities. David Edwards (right) celebrates putting Wolves into a 1-0 lead against Blackburn . Wolves boss Kenny Jackett gestures on the touchline during the Championship clash . And Jackett hopes the permanent signing of England Under-21 goalscorer Afobe from the Gunners, which could be sealed within 24 hours, will solve that issue. Afobe has scored 19 goals in 27 on-loan appearances for League One MK Dons, including two in their 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United in the Capital One Cup. ‘We’ve watched Afobe come through at Arsenal and seen his progress,’ Jackett said. ‘He’s proved an asset at MK Dons and is ready to (make the) step up.’ Rajiv van La Parra is tackled by Shane Duffy of as he attempts to run with the ball . Wolves were without seven-goal top scorer Bakary Sako who has linked up with Mali for the Africa Nations Cup but compatriot Nouha Dicko showed his early threat. Playing as a lone striker he burst into the box and forced Rovers goalkeeper Jason Steele to make a save smart at his near post. That seemed to rouse the home side into life and a deep cross into the penalty area from left-back Markus Olsson was flicked on by Rudy Gestede for fellow striker Jordan Rhodes, but he could only head over from close range. Ben Marshall went close for the hosts when he curled a spectacular 25-yard free-kick over the Wolves defensive wall, but visiting goalkeeper Carl Ikeme scrambled across his goal and dived to parry the ball to safety. Richard Stearman (third right) heads the ball against his own post during the match . Despite Blackburn’s pressure immediately before the interval it was Wolves who opened the scoring three minutes after the break with a well worked goal. Dicko’s clever pass found Edwards, who with a flick of his left boot took the ball away from Grant Hanley to open up space on the edge of the box and then with his right foot arrowed a low shot into the bottom-left corner. The Wolves fans in the Darwen End then breathed a sigh of relief shortly after when Richard Stearman misjudged a headed clearance and struck the post of his own goal. La Parra is fouled by Chris Taylor as he looks to evade the midfielder's challenge . A neat passing move from Wolves saw them create another gilt edge chance when Dicko spread the play out to James Henry who crossed for Edwards, and he somehow failed to hit the target from close range. Wolves sensed the chance to kill off the game and Dicko’s brilliant curling effort rattled the the top-right corner of the goalframe, with Rajiv van La Parra unable to profit from the rebound. Henry was the next Wolves player guilty of poor finishing with 10 minutes remaining when he fluffed his close-range finish from Dicko’s low cross. Blackburn pushed for an equaliser in the remainder of the game and went close when substitute Craig Conway outmuscled Kortney Hause and brought a near post save out of Ikeme. The Wolves keeper had to be alert again a minute from time as Josh King struck a powerful low effort from distance which Ikeme smothered, but the visitors hung on.","David Edwards scored 48th minute strike to give Wolves second half lead .

"Former Wolves owner and chairman Sir Jack Hayward died aged 91 on Monday. Hayward had been ill for several months and passed away in Fort Lauderdale in the United States. A boyhood Wolves fan, Hayward bought the club in 1990 before selling it to current chairman Steve Morgan in 2007. Sir Jack Hayward, celebrating promotion to the Premier League in 2003, has died aged 91 . Hayward celebrates promotion with then manager Dave Jones during an open top bus parade . Hayward celebrates promotion in 2003 (left) and outside the Old Bailey for the trial of Jeremy Thorpe . Hayward sold Wolves to current chairman Steve Morgan for £10 and a promise of £30million investment . During his 17-year spell in charge, Wolves were promoted to the Premier League in 2003 under then manager David Jones. Though they only spent one year in the top flight under Hayward's reign, he is credit with transforming the club and is much loved, with a street, Jack Hayward Way, and training ground named after him. Morgan hailed Hayward as 'one of the club's, and the city's, most cherished sons' and 'the most generous, humble and special gentleman you could ever wish to meet. And the reality is we may never see his like again.' He added: 'Sir Jack always said to me that he was a custodian of the Club during his ownership, he was merely looking after Wolves for the supporters. 'That philosophy shone through during his 17-year ownership of Wolves. Rather than trying to recoup some of his own huge outlay, he handed over Wolves in such a way that it secured even more investment into the club.'

Hayward was born close to Molineux, a ground he later transformed into one of the country's first all-seater stadiums after taking over Wolves. A renowned philanthropist, Bahamas-based multi-millionaire Hayward often gave money to good causes close to his heart. One of his most generous acts was to sell Wolves to Morgan for just £10, in return for a £30million investment. Morgan added: 'Our most sincere condolences go out to Sir Jack's loved ones at this very sad and difficult time. On behalf of everyone connected to Wolverhampton Wanderers: thank you, Sir Jack. You'll never be forgotten.' Hayward watches Wolves play in 2004 with his son Rick (left) Hayward, who remained honorary president of the club, gives a thumbs up to the crowd .

It is with great sadness and regret that Wolverhampton Wanderers today announce the passing of Sir Jack Hayward OBE, the Club's legendary former owner, Chairman, Life President and one of the country's great philanthropists. Sir Jack, who was 91 years of age, had been ill for several months and passed away in Fort Lauderdale on 13th January, 2015. Wolves would like to extend its deepest and most sincere condolences to Sir Jack's wife, Lady Hayward, his companion of many years, Patti Bloom, and all his family and friends at home and across the world. Born close to Molineux, Sir Jack Hayward was a Wolves fan from an early age and his deep affection and passion for all things Wulfrunian and British never faded. As a young boy, Sir Jack used to crawl under Molineux's turnstiles to grab a glimpse of his heroes and he retained this passion as a true Wolves supporter throughout his life. The Bahamas-based multi-millionaire and renowned philanthropist gave huge backing to many good causes over the years. During Sir Jack's 17-year ownership of Wolves, his vision and financial backing transformed a decaying Molineux into one of the first, and finest, all-seater stadiums in the Country. He gave successive managers money to spend on players, before in May 2003, his dream was realised as Wolves at last regained top-flight status, though it proved to be for only one season. In the summer of 2007, he passed on the baton to current Chairman, Steve Morgan, handing over the Club for just £10 in return for a £30 million investment into Wolves. This remains one of the most remarkable and generous acts, from any owner, in any sport. That selflessness paid off two years later when the investment played a big part in Wolves winning the Championship and, once again, returning to the top flight, where they remained for the following three seasons. STEVE MORGAN (Wolves chairman) 'Wolves are a family and we're united in mourning at the loss of one of the Club's, and the City's, most cherished sons. Our most sincere condolences go out to Sir Jack's loved ones at this very sad and difficult time. 'Sir Jack always said to me that he was a custodian of the Club during his ownership, he was merely looking after Wolves for the supporters. 'That philosophy shone through during his 17-year ownership of Wolves. Rather than trying to recoup some of his own huge outlay, he handed over Wolves in such a way that it secured even more investment into the Club. 'That kind of philanthropy didn't only extend to Wolves, of course. The purchase of Lundy Island for the National Trust and his huge donation to help re-build a Hospital after the Falklands War, were just some examples of where he made a real and long lasting difference to causes close to his heart. 'A few months ago Sir Jack visited the Wolves Museum and was shown his own tribute in the Hall of Fame. When asked to sign the visitors' book, his message was simple: 'Glad to have helped.' 'That was the measure of the most generous, humble and special gentleman you could ever wish to meet. And the reality is we may never see his like again. 'On behalf of everyone connected to Wolverhampton Wanderers: thank you, Sir Jack. You'll never be forgotten.' JEZ MOXLEY (Wolves chief executive) 'We're devastated at the loss of Sir Jack and, on behalf of everyone connected to the Club, our hearts go out to Patti and his family. 'Sir Jack was more than just my boss for a period of time, in the same way he was so much more than simply a Chairman to our legions of loyal supporters. 'Over the years he became a great friend and mentor, not only to me and my family but to many, many people associated with the Club and the City. 'He was one of this country's great, eccentric characters, philanthropists and football supporters who combined huge commercial vision in his business interests with the desire to put something back into his community and to make a real difference to the causes he loved. 'Wolves was obviously one of his greatest passions and he still retained the same love for the Club – the same glint in his eye – that he had as a youngster climbing underneath Molineux's turnstiles, despite the inevitable ups and downs associated with running a football club. 'He was a truly special man and retained to the end enormous optimism, conviction and enthusiasm for Wolves always tuning in live to watch or listen to the matches regardless of where he was in the world or what time of day or night it was. 'We're all united in mourning but at the same time it's a moment to celebrate his life and achievements, a life painted in bright colours, which made a huge difference to so many people at home and abroad. 'It's a time to reflect on everything Sir Jack did for Wolves and for the tremendous and unique legacy he has left behind for the Club and the City of Wolverhampton. 'Over the coming days the Club, and the City of Wolverhampton, will come together in various ways to fully recognise and celebrate his achievements – the 'Old Boy' will be greatly missed.'","Sir Jack Hayward was Wolves owner for 17 years between 1990 and 2007 .

The Toffees forward has been left devastated by the death of the 20-year-old Wolfsburg midfielder and is being supported by Everton as he comes to terms with the tragedy. Blues boss Roberto Martinez says Lukaku wants to play in Tuesday's third round fixture in honour of Malanda and told the Daily Mirror: 'We all knew that Rom had that relationship with Junior because it was a talking point when we played Wolfsburg in the Europa League, the two of them facing each other.

"Cardiff returned to their blue kit and duly ended a five-game run without a Sky Bet Championship win with a 1-0 victory over Fulham. Sean Morrison's first-half header proved enough to cap an emotional day in front of a bumper crowd at the Cardiff City Stadium. The Bluebirds played in front of their second highest home attendance of the season just 24 hours after the decision by club owner Vincent Tan to finally back down over his controversial change of team colours. Cardiff City supporters celebrate the clubs return to blue during the game on Saturday . Goalscorer Sean Morrison (right) celebrates with Cardiff boss Russell Slade at full time . And any hopes those supporters had that a return to blue from red would bring good fortune appeared promising as they opened the scoring in the 14th minute. Aron Gunnarsson launched an arching throw into the box and Morrison's header had enough to cross the line despite Marcus Bettinelli getting a hand to it. Cardiff tried the same again seven minutes later with another throw-in by Gunnarsson but this time Fulham's Kostas Stafylidis was on-hand to block Tom Adeyemi's header at the far past and then turn Peter Whittingham's effort for a corner. Ross McCormack used to score plenty of goals for Cardiff and looked to pull the strings for Fulham behind the two strikers while Ryan Tunicliffe had a decent effort from distance that had Simon Moore, in for the injured David Marshall, at full-stretch. Craig Noone provided plenty of width for Cardiff, forcing Shaun Hutchinson into conceding an early booking, and he almost set-up Kenwyne Jones for an easy finish. However Stafylidis was again on-hand to snuff-out the danger shortly before half-time. Kostas Stafylidis (left) of Fulham and Adam Le Fondre of Cardiff City in action . Peter Whittingham (left) of Cardiff City and Alexander Kacaniklic of Fulham vie for the ball . It was the last telling contribution by the busy Trinidad and Tobago striker, who failed to emerge from a knock for the second half. He was replaced by Alex Revell, who made his debut following his move from Rotherham, and the tall striker almost made a swift impact with a lay-off for John Brayford, who fired wide from the edge of the box. Left-back Scott Malone also made his first appearance after joining from Millwall. Whittingham felled former team-mate McCormack, who fired his free-kick on target but lacked the speed to beat Moore. Kit Symons rang the changes in a bid to spark his team into life with a double substitution, Alex Kacaniklic and Sean Kavanagh both coming on and were soon followed by Moussa Dembele. But it proved a fruitless effort from the Cottagers boss. Cardiff dominated possession and territory but could not find a second goal to ease the pressure for the final stages. Noone and Gunnarsson combined on the edge of the box but could not find a shot between them. Adeyemi rose highest at a corner only to head his effort over the bar while Revell fired a volley wide. Fulham launched a series of attacks in the closing stages but lacked the touch to find a late equaliser.","Sean Morrison's first-half header enough for Cardiff to beat Fulham .

It was the first time Manchester United failed to fire a single shot on target at home since May 2009 and Koeman believed the theme of Sunday's game was very similar to his side's previous meeting with Louis van Gaal's men earlier this season. The Saints had the better chances in the corresponding fixture at St Mary's at the beginning of December but two Robin van Persie goals, against the run of play, secured a 2-1 win for United despite Koeman's men dominating the match for long periods.

'In terms of the game itself, Burnley made it difficult for us and their style of play was tough to play against last week but at White Hart Lane we fancy our chances, especially with our recent home form going in our favour.'

"Jamie Carragher and Gleen Hoddle believe Jose Fonte was central to Southampton's historic 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford. The Saints centre back took home the man of the match award after a commanding display against Louis van Gaal's side who failed for land a single shot on target for the first time at home since May 2009. Carragher heaped praise on Fonte after his stellar display and insisted that the Portuguese defender has filled the shoes of Dejan Lovren with aplomb since the Croatian's departure to Liverpool during the summer. Jose Fonte (left) blocks Angel di Maria's attempted cross during the first-half at Old Trafford . 'We saw Lovren as the main man at the back (last season), but Fonte has taken that mantle,' Carragher told Sky Sports. 'There was no space for Wayne Rooney out there.' 'The reason they have the best defensive record is not rocket science; they're just so compact and organised.' Gleen Hoddle shared Carragher's thoughts on Fonte after his performance at Old Trafford. Hoddle added: 'The players all respect him. From front to back, he was the pick of the bunch.' Fonte (left) led from the back for Southampton and kept Robin van Persie from having any impact on the game . Fonte was delighted with Southampton's result as the win moved his team up to third in the Premier League standings. The visitors took the lead after 69 minutes as substitute Dusan Tadic capitalised on Graziano Pelle's rebound to slot home his fourth goal of the season. Juan Mata missed two great chances in succession as the hosts pressed for an equaliser with 10 minutes left, but Saints held on for all three points. Southampton players celebrate after taking the lead thanks to Dusan Tadic's 69th-minute strike . Fonte told Sky Sports 1: 'It's not every day you get a win at Old Trafford against a great team so for us it's a pleasure and something we should be proud of. 'There's a long way to go but it's another three points. We got a lot of confidence from this game.

"Morgan Schneiderlin's performances have been so good this season they prove he could play for any side in the Premier League, Gary Neville has claimed. The France international was again impressive as Southampton beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford thanks to a second-half goal from summer signing Dusan Tadic. Schneiderlin was courted by both Tottenham and Arsenal during the summer and Neville believes the 25-year-old would be more than capable of holding his own at any of England's top clubs.

They're composed and organised.' The victory was Southampton's first at Old Trafford in the Premier League era (they last won there in January 1988), but for Schneiderlin the most important factor was that the south coast side are putting a decent run together. He said: ‘To be honest, I didn't know that Southampton have never won at Old Trafford (in the Premier League). ‘Today we showed good resilience and great character. We had one opportunity and we scored. ‘We went through a very tough patch in December but we showed good team spirit and this result is a reward for the work we have put it.'

"Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his right shoulder following a nasty collision with the advertising boards during Arsenal's 3-0 Premier League win over Stoke. The French defender looked to have been pushed by Stoke midfielder Marko Arnautovic and suffered a heavy landing - leaving him holding his shoulder and with cuts to his face. Debuchy was treated on the sidelines for six minutes before being taken off on a stretcher and replaced by Hector Bellerin. He then had an X-ray in the Arsenal dressing room.

The fresh injury comes as a blow for Wenger, who was without Kieran Gibbs after an inflamed ankle ruled him out of the game. Wenger added: 'Monreal and Debuchy can play centre-back, but if Gibbs is not here Monreal cannot play centre-back and if Debuchy is not here he cannot play centre-back.

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report . The question was simple enough: with Manchester United’s five star forwards all fit and ready to start, who would Louis van Gaal leave out against Southampton? When the answer became clear an hour before kick-off on Sunday, it was bad news for Radamel Falcao. The Colombian was not only left out of the starting line-up, he wasn’t even on the bench. It soon became clear that he had been dropped and it is understood that Van Gaal had not explained the reasons why. ‘Falcao isn’t injured he’s just not selected in the squad,’ said the United boss, having admitted on the eve of this match that five players into four positions simply wouldn’t go. Radamel Falcao was not included in Louis van Gaal's squad to face Southampton on Sunday . Dusan Tadic (centre) strips off to celebrate his goal in Southampton's 1-0 victory over Unite . United players trudge off at Old Trafford after failing to register a single shot on target . Saints boss Ronald Koeman (left) would have enjoyed getting the upper hand over Louis van Gaal . ‘It’s much more difficult selecting a side but that’s the task of the manager and I have a staff who advise me as well.’ ‘We have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row. Then I have to compare players with each other. ‘Now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment. Next week is another moment,' he added after the defeat. ‘We have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row. Then I have to compare players with each other. ‘Now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment. Next week is another moment.’ The manner of Falcao’s omission was surprising, however, and will inevitably raise questions over his prospects of persuading United to part with the best part of £50million to turn his loan from Monaco into a permanent move at the end of the season. Having spent much of the season building up his fitness for the rigours of English football after a serious knee injury and then recovering from a calf problem, Falcao will have every reason to be rather perplexed over this snub. Teenager James Wilson was preferred for a place on the bench, and it was unclear whether Falcao was even at Old Trafford. He had started the previous five games despite the heavy workload over Christmas, scoring twice. It might not be quite £50m form, but he was certainly starting to find his feet in the Premier League after so many doubts had been raised. Falcao was a surprise loan signing  with United given the option to buy him outright at the end of the season . The on-loan Monaco striker has spoken of his desire to remain at Old Trafford beyond this season . The Columbia international has only started eight Premier League games since his arrival . Falcao has reportedly taken time to adapt to United manager Louis van Gaal's precise philosophy . In his absence, the rest of United’s expensive strikeforce looked very ordinary. They couldn’t even manage one shot on target, the first time that has happened since May 2009. Van Gaal deployed Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata in central midfield, and asked Angel di Maria to play off Robin van Persie after the £59.7m signing returned to action with a goal in the FA Cup at Yeovil last weekend. But Di Maria looked like a player who had been out of action for a while. So good at dead-ball situations usually, he threw his head back in frustration after firing one freekick straight into the legs of the first defender, and then failed to find Mata with a final ball nine minutes before half-time when Van Persie had lifted a pass over the Southampton defence. Rooney lacked the creativity he has shown of late from midfield and Mata was guilty of missing two clear chances late in the game. By then, Van Persie and Di Maria had both left the field, leaving Marouane Fellaini to partner Rooney up front.

But Southampton coped comfortably with the threat despite losing centre-back Toby Alderweireld to injury early in the game. They were compact and disciplined, with Morgan Schneiderlin the pick of a very good bunch in his defensive midfield role alongside Victor Wanyama. Ronald Koeman will certainly enjoy this tactical victory over his old Dutch adversary Van Gaal and his embarrassment of riches. Could Falcao have made a difference? Possibly. But the nature of his absence poses more questions than it answers.

"Leicester City have broken their transfer record to sign striker Andrej Kramaric in the hope that the Croatian will score the goals to help keep them in the Premier League. It's a calculated gamble from the Foxes, who have weighed up the £9million fee paid to HNK Rijeka against the cost of relegation back to the Championship. It's not the first time that a team in trouble has spent big in January. Here, Sportsmail looks at five other attempts by Premier League clubs to spend their way to safety. Andrej Kramaric arrives at Leicester City, where he's signed in a deal worth £9m pending a work permit . Kramaric scored 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season ahead of his Leicester City move . Kostas Mitroglou to Fulham (£12million) The Greek international came to Fulham on deadline day in January 2014 from Olympiacos, and the west London club had high expectations after paying a reported club record £12m. Prior to joining, Mitroglou had scored 17 goals in just 19 matches for the Greek champions, including a hat-trick in the Champions League. Fulham pinned their hopes of survival on the 6ft 2in striker, and he made his debut as Fulham drew 1-1 against West Bromwich Albion, coming on as a substitute for Hugo Rodallega. However, due to various fitness issues, Mitroglou only made two further appearances for the club, and one was off the bench. After his dismal first term at Craven Cottage, Mitroglou was loaned back to Olympiacos for the whole season, where the 26-year-old has once more, shown he is a top marksman, hitting 10 goals in his 18 appearances so far, including scoring the winner against Spanish champions Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Fulham paid £12million to Greek champions Olympiacos for Kostas Mitroglou in January 2014 . The Greece international made just three appearances for the west London club before going on loan . Danny Graham to Sunderland (£5million) With Sunderland desperately in need of a striker to help prevent relegation, manager Martin O'Neil turned to Swansea City's Danny Graham. The former Watford man had a decent record in his first season in the top flight, scoring 12 goals. However, in his second season with the Welsh club, he scored just three times in 18 appearances. With Swansea ready to offload the forward, Sunderland spent £5m on the 29-year-old but things did not go Graham's way. The known-Newcastle United supporter was booed by Black Cats fans on his debut after coming on as a substitute against Reading. And Graham never found his feet at The Stadium of Light, failing to score a single goal in 12 league appearances. The following season, he was loaned out to Premier League rivals Hull City, where he only managed one goal in 18 appearances. Loans to Championship sides Middlesbrough and Wolverhampton Wanderers followed, but Graham is yet to rediscover the form that earned him his Premier League status. Danny Graham was booed on his debut for Sunderland because of his known support of Newcastle United . And Graham endured a torrid time with the Black Cats, failing to score in his 13 appearances for the club . Christopher Samba to Queens Park Rangers (£12.5million) After previous success in England with Blackburn Rovers, and after a difficult period in Russia with big-spending club Anzhi Makhachkala, Christopher Samba earned a move back to England with Queens Park Rangers. However, the fee of £12.5m and his reported wages of £100,000 per week meant great pressure on his shoulders to keep the struggling Hoops up. Unfortunately for him, some of performances, especially in the 3-2 defeat to Fulham, came under considerable criticism and scrutiny. He was unable to shore up the west Londoner's defence or save them from relegation to the Championship. He was sold back to Anzhi for £12m. QPR boss Harry Redknapp said upon signing him: 'Chris is just what we need. He's a monster. Great in the air, quick, a leader, strong, fantastic in both boxes, hard as nails. He's a proper centre-half.' Unfortunately for Samba, that's not quite how he'll be remembered by the Loftus Road faithful. Christopher Samba enjoyed success with Blackburn Rovers but was less impressive for QPR . Samba fails to prevent then-Southampton striker Rickie Lambert from scoring at Loftus Road . Djibril Cisse to Queens Park Rangers (£4million) With QPR languishing just above the relegation zone when Mark Hughes took over in January, goals were a necessity. So he looked to French striker, Djibril Cisse. The former Liverpool striker went on a great scoring run in west London, finding the net six times in eight appearances. However, his time was blighted by two red cards in his first five matches, with QPR going on to lose those fixtures. The Hoops secured safety on the final day of the season, with a goal from Cisse, but despite his prolific start to his QPR career, the following season, he only managed three goals in 18 appearances, and was loaned out for the remainder of the campaign to Qatari club Al Gharafa. Djibril Cisse celebrates scoring against Manchester City on the day they won the Premier League . Cisse was prolific when he first arrived at the club but the goals dried up in his second season . Brede Hangeland to Fulham (£2.5million) Fulham were struggling in the league, especially defensively, so a defender was a must for Roy Hodgson, whose side were in 18th place when he took over. The answer was to be the Norwegian man mountain, Brede Hangeland, signed for an undisclosed fee on 18th January. He formed a good partnership with fellow centre back Aaron Hughes, as they fought to keep the west London club up. He would stay with the Cottagers for another six years, resisting temptations to move elsewhere when 'bigger' clubs were rumoured to come calling. On his debut at Bolton Wanderers, he was voted man of the match and until the beginning of this season, he was at the heart of the Fulham defence.

"Arsene Wenger would have been a cigarette and blindfold away from the firing line had Arsenal started  as diabolically as they did against Stoke City at the Britannia just one month ago. There, Arsenal were 3-0 down by half-time, their frail defence unable to cope with the presence of Peter Crouch and the runs behind of Bojan Krkic. There was no such problem at the Emirates with a back four consisting of Per Mertesacker, Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal and Hector Bellerin, replacing Mathieu Debuchy after 13 minutes, as they got revenge for the humiliation felt on December 6.

The 29-year-old was left on the substitutes' bench at the Britannia. Not this time. Without him Arsenal's win percentage is just 33 per cent, they concede 1.9 goals per game and they have three clean sheets since August 2013. With him it rises to 70 per cent, they concede just 0.7 and Stoke was their 20th clean sheet. Koscielny got his reward, too, creating and scoring Arsenal's opening goal with a free header after just six minutes. Stoke relied on set pieces, knowing you simply don't out-pass Wenger's Arsenal. Their reputation is for being overly physical, and Ryan Shawcross their cheerleader. Debuchy discovered that, receiving an unnecessary push from Marko Arnautovic to hit the electronic advertising boards and suffer a shoulder injury to complicate Wenger's  options. But it was Crouch vs Mertesacker that would also determine whether Arsenal could claim just their sixth Barclays Premier League clean sheet. A 6ft 7in striker against his 6ft 6in marker. The first test soon arrived. Hands all over one another, grappling in the box before the ball had even been delivered. But Stoke tried something new. It was cut back for Glenn Whelan instead of being thrown into the melee, though the 30-year-old midfielder hit it high, wide, and into the stands. Mark Hughes looked disgusted. No more of those, the Stoke manager shouted in more colourful language.

It was the first time he'd been given the chance, though it did not trouble David Ospina on his full Premier League debut. Ospina needed protection. Stoke needed to test the rookie. They never got the chance. Even Bellerin and Monreal were given the freedom of the wing, dominating both the left and right.

"Former Rangers boss Walter Smith admits he should never have joined Charles Green's Ibrox board. And the nine-titles-in-a-row manager also confessed he should have walked away much sooner before he did finally quit in August 2013. The 66-year-old returned to the club in November 2012 after being appointed a non-executive director by then chief executive Green - and he was then handed the chairmanship six months later. Walter Smith has revealed he regrets not leaving the Rangers board before August 2013 . Former Rangers boss Smith has ruled out the possibility of replacing Ally McCoist . But he soon resigned as he accused the Yorkshireman and former directors Brian Stockbridge and Bryan Smart of creating a 'highly dysfunctional environment' inside the Ibrox boardroom. However, speaking at the launch of former Rangers Director of Communications Jim Traynor's new PR firm Level 5, Smith said: 'Everybody talks about it being chaotic. Everybody can make up their minds about what happened. It was chaotic enough for me to resign. 'For my own embarrassment I maybe held on a bit too long. I should have resigned long before I did. 'But that happens. It was an error on my own part to get involved.' He added: 'Would I have done anything differently? Yeah, I probably wouldn't have joined the board at all. Why? Just the way everything turned out. 'I felt at the time that if I could help the club in any way with the circumstances it was in, it was the right time to do so. 'As it turns out, after a couple of months I discovered it wasn't the right time and I had to leave. 'That was my decision and I found out the boardroom aspect was a circumstance I wasn't particularly comfortable in.' Former Scotland manager Craig Brown reckons Smith should return to Ibrox for a third stint as boss now that Ally McCoist has been put on gardening leave. Smith won 10 Scottish titles during his time at Rangers and led the Scottish side to the 2008 Uefa Cup final . Craig Brown believes Smith should return to the club as manager following the departure of McCoist . But Smith - who won 10 Scottish titles and led the Light Blues to the final of the Uefa Cup in 2008 - said: 'I will go back to Ibrox to games but not in any official capacity. 'I wouldn't go back onto the board either. I have learned it is an environment I am not particularly comfortable in.' Green has now departed the scene but chaos continues to reign at Rangers. American financier Robert Sarver has pulled the plug on takeover talks after accusing the board of ignoring his requests for dialogue. That leaves the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - and oldco director Dave King to battle it out with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for control of the Glasgow giants. Smith insists he does not know what direction the club will take next, but does reckon Park's group would unite the Ibrox faithful. He said: 'The ideal outcome would be for Rangers to get back to where they were a number of years ago, challenging for the title, as quickly as possible. That's what every Rangers fan wants. 'How they get there I don't know. 'I don't know enough about what is going on in the background at the present moment to support one and not the other. 'I just wish everybody would get together and rid Rangers of the problems we have had. 'Can Douglas Park bring stability back to club and win over the fans' trust? Of course he can. He would do that as somebody known to supporters. 'But whoever comes in has to bring that back to Rangers, whether they are American or Scottish. They have to bring an element of trust back into the club again because supporters are now showing they are unhappy with what is going on. 'The trust issue is the big factor and the people who have been involved in this at the moment are the ones who the Rangers supporters would trust.'","Walter Smith regrets not resigning from role at Rangers before 2013 .

"US financier Robert Sarver has announced that he has pulled out of takeover talks with Rangers. In a statement given to the Stock Exchange shortly after midday, Sarver said: 'I'm disappointed the Rangers board has rejected my revised offer, which addressed the club's immediate and long-term needs. 'Clearly the current directors have a different path they want to go down. I hope for the sake of the club and the fans, who've been very warm and supportive towards me, that it works out. US Businessman Robert Sarver saw two previous bids of £18m and £20m rejected by the Rangers board . 'I wish the club and fans the best of luck. If they want my support in the future, then they only have to ask.' Sarver's statement also said that he 'reserves the right' to make another offer for the club within the next six months. In a separate statement issued by his Scottish PR advisor, Sarver also explained that the board's 'continued failure to provide a counter offer or engage in any meaningful negotiations' was behind his decision to walk away. Sarver, who already owns NBA side the Phoenix Suns, was made aware of the perilous state of Rangers finances by former Ibrox defender David Robertson, who now coaches at the club where the American banker's sons play in Arizona. He made his first move just after Christmas when he offered the board an £18m deal but saw it rejected last Tuesday. Rangers went into administration in February 2012 and were later relegated to the Scottish Third Division . But Sarver responded 48 hours later when he came back with an improved £20m bid that also included an immediate £6.5m crisis loan which would have allowed the club to see out the rest of the month. In return for this, Sarver - who is also chief executive of the Western Alliance Bancorporation - wanted the club to call an urgent general meeting to vote on proposals to hand him enough new shares to give him control of 51 per cent of Rangers. He then planned to make an offer to buy up all remaining stock at 20p per share. But the club's directors were left hamstrung by the decision to vote down their own resolution at last month's AGM which would have allowed them to issue new shares to fresh investors without first offering them to existing stakeholders. They were then blind-sided when first the Three Bears and then Dave King made two surprise share purchases, handing them control of 34 per cent of the club. In a 7am notice to the Stock Exchange, the club announced: 'The Board of Rangers has considered the revised possible offer from Robert Sarver (or a vehicle to be established and controlled by him) ('Mr Sarver') which Mr Sarver announced on 8 January. 'The revised proposal by Mr Sarver was similar to his first proposal in the respect that it sought a placing of 100 million shares (to be priced at 20p in this proposal) ('Placing') which, would require the approval of shareholders (at least a 75 per cent majority) at a general meeting. 'The Board of Rangers rejected the first proposal from Mr Sarver on 6 January on the basis that the Board felt it unlikely that the approval of shareholders holding sufficient shares would be forthcoming. Newcastle United and Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley looks likely to increase his stake in the Ibrox club . 'Following receipt of the revised proposal from Mr Sarver, the Board has sought the views of a number of major shareholders on this revised proposal and has reached the same conclusion, namely that the resolution to approve the placing is unlikely to achieve the 75 per cent majority required. 'Accordingly, once again, the Directors do not intend to hold the General Meeting which would be necessary to implement the revised proposal.' The question now for the board is one of how to raise the short-term cash they desperately need to keep the club afloat. The Three Bears have left a £6.5m investment plan on the table but the ruling regime could yet turn to Newcastle owner Mike Ashley for yet more help. Ashley, who owns 8.92 per cent of Rangers, has already handed the club a £3m loan as the Sports Direct tycoon seeks to protect his lucrative commercial contracts. But after placing associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach on to the board, he risks another confrontation with the Scottish Football Association - who have already charged him with breaching 'dual ownership' rules - if he deepens his Ibrox involvement while remaining in charge at St James' Park. He may, however, decide to work with the Bears who, along with King, are nearing the kind of shareholder support which would allow them to call an emergency general meeting and make wholesale changes to the Ibrox board.

"There’s no place like home, as Alan Pardew will testify. It’s two games, two wins for Crystal Palace’s new manager and his decision to quit Newcastle and return to the club where he spent five years as a player is looking an astute one. Having secured Palace’s first win in nine matches in beating Dover, he maintained his 100 per cent start to life at Selhurst Park with this victory over Tottenham. Having fallen behind to Harry Kane’s strike, Palace turned the game around. If Pardew’s Eagles aren’t quite soaring, their wings are finally flapping. And that is more than could be said for the side under former boss Neil Warnock. Alan Pardew celebrates with fans after winning his first Premier League match in charge of Crystal Palace . Harry Kane was on target yet again to give Tottenham the lead at Selhurst Park on Saturday evening . Alan Pardew has won 13 points from losing positions this season, more than any other Premier League boss. There is an inescapable sense that these players want to perform for their manager — to give him the homecoming he dreamed about. We won’t see the fruits of Pardew’s work on the training field for a few weeks, though keeping possession seems to be a key objective. Pardew said following the FA Cup win at Dover that his side would be taking risks on the ball. That was certainly the case on Saturday. One passage of play in the 14th minute, which saw Palace’s defenders pass their way out of trouble, drew applause from the supporters. Players were often satisfied just to clear their lines under Warnock. If Saturday is anything to go by, those days are gone. The reintroduction of Barry Bannan is an indication of the passing style Pardew wants to implement. The Scot was a peripheral figure under Warnock and Tony Pulis but has started both games under Pardew. Bannan isn’t one to hoof the ball — he saw plenty of possession before being subbed at half-time having picked up a yellow card. Palace boss Pardew has brought Barry Bannan in from the cold at Crystal Palace to start the last two games . Dwight Gayle shoots to score his penalty against Tottenham on Saturday evening for Crystal Palace . Bringing back Bannan suggests Palace will play with a technically gifted midfield pivot. Whether Bannan is that man long-term remains to be seen. He needs to cool his temper first. A clearer idea of how Bannan fits into Pardew’s plans will emerge once captain Mile Jedinak is back from Asia Cup duty with Australia. Indeed, the pending returns of Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Congo, will provide Pardew with a massive boost in the coming weeks. Bolasie, in particular, will add a fresh attacking dimension — not that Palace looked short of ideas against Tottenham. There was a tendency under Warnock to overuse the flanks, relying on the pace of Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha, Jason Puncheon and Dwight Gayle to get in behind the opposition. That remained a fruitful avenue on Saturday as second-half goal-scorers Puncheon and Gayle caused a host of problems. Gayle celebrates his equaliser for the Eagles against the north London side in the 69th minute . Jason Puncheon made it 2-1 against Tottenham as Crystal Palace continue to fight relegation . Likewise, Zaha’s blistering 20-minute cameo will raise hope the forward, on loan from Manchester United, can recapture the form that made him the most sought after youngster in the country two years ago. Pardew, though, is determined to strengthen his squad. Palace have been rebuffed in a loan move for Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert, though the club may revisit that deal later in the window. Wilfried Zaha made a positive impact from the bench for Crystal Palace on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis of Swansea is in the frame, but Jermain Defoe is likely to be out of Palace’s price range. Arsenal’s Yaya Sanogo is expected to arrive this week. Pardew said: ‘This result doesn’t change my mind about the transfer window. We still need one or two. That is progressing well and we hope to have some news this week. ‘I had a chat with Brendan Rodgers but Rickie isn’t going anywhere. I know Jermain from my West Ham days and I know what he can do.’","Alan Pardew won his first Premier League match in charge of Crystal Palace on Saturday with a 2-1 win against Tottenham .

"Ben Morgan looks certain to be ruled out of the Six Nations on Sunday after it emerged the England No 8 underwent surgery on his damaged left ankle on Saturday morning. The Gloucester star, who finished the autumn as England’s first-choice No 8 and was named QBE man of the series following a string of barnstorming displays, was injured during Friday night’s Aviva Premiership clash against Saracens and left the field on a stretcher requiring oxygen just after half-time. It is understood the 25-year-old was taken to hospital in Gloucester and underwent surgery in the early hours of Saturday morning to repair badly damaged ligaments. Gloucester's Ben Morgan leaves the pitch on a stretcher after he suffered a leg injury in the second-half . Morgan is likely to miss the Six Nations for England after having ankle surgery on Saturday morning . He now faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines and, although his World Cup participation is not believed to be under threat, his chances of playing in the Six Nations are ‘almost zero’. ‘Ben went under the knife soon after the game,’ said a source close to the player. ‘We’re waiting to hear the full extent of the damage but the fact he was sent for surgery so soon after the injury occurred is clearly not a good sign.’ Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys initially played down fears Morgan had broken his ankle but extensive ankle ligament damage has left England coach Stuart Lancaster needing to look elsewhere for a starting No 8 to face Wales in Cardiff on February 6. Gloucester fly half James Hook fires over a last-minute penalty to secure victory for the home side . Morgan (left) celebrates with Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson after his superb try in the first-half . Billy Vunipola (Saracens): Dropped during the autumn series but is back in form. Nick Easter (Harlequins): Turns 37 this year but continues to deliver. Thomas Waldrom (Exeter): Has scored nine tries in 12 appearances this season. James Haskell (Wasps): Powerful ball-carrying ability and experience. Tom Wood (Northampton): Normally on the blindside but a switch to No 8 could provide some spark. Dave Ewers (Exeter): A possible bolter for selection who has previously been praised by Stuart Lancaster. Uncapped at international level. Steffon Armitage (Toulon): The RFU state the France–based European Player of the Year will only be picked under ‘exceptional circumstances’. ‘When you see someone coming off on a stretcher it’s never a good sign,’ Humphreys said. A formal release is expected at some point Sunday. With Lancaster already sweating on the fitness of first-choice centre Manu Tuilagi (groin) and tighthead prop Dan Cole (foot), he will have to embark on the final Six Nations campaign before the World Cup without a host of star performers. England’s autumn was blighted by injury withdrawals and it looks as if history is repeating itself. Morgan’s anticipated withdrawal is hugely significant. With 27 caps now under his belt, the 19-stone powerhouse emerged as one of England’s most effective forwards during the autumn, scoring three tries while offering scrum ballast and a constant ball-carrying threat. Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola - his most likely replacement - has endured a difficult season, suffering back-to-back concussions either side of the autumn series and struggling to recapture the outstanding form of the past two seasons. Saracens No 8 Billy Vunipola (left) looks set to profit from Morgan's injury by reclaiming his England spot . Vunipola is finding some form again after losing confidence and suffering back to back concussions . The 22-year-old remains favourite to replace Morgan at the Millennium Stadium but he will need to show an improvement in form during Saracens’ upcoming European Champions Cup clashes with Munster and Clermont Auvergne over the next fortnight. He was subdued again on Friday night, despite insisting he has put his troubled autumn behind him. ‘I am going to make sure I am never again in the position I was in the autumn where I questioned my own ability,’ he said. ‘It was a tough time for me. Self-doubt started creeping in. I’d never had that before.’ The rest of England’s No 8 cupboard is not overly well stocked. At 36, Harlequins’ Nick Easter is still a hugely influential Premiership performer while Toulon’s Steffon Armitage remains one of European rugby’s outstanding back-rowers. Harlequins' Nick Easter is another contender for the No 8 role but has never been picked by Stuart Lancaster . Toulon’s Steffon Armitage (right) will only be picked for England in extreme circumstances . But both men appear to be off England’s radar, with Armitage unavailable due to RFU policy dictating that only home-based players can be picked while Lancaster has not named Easter in a single squad since taking over from Martin Johnson in 2012. Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom could provide similar attributes to Morgan while his heavyweight Exeter team-mate Dave Ewers has attracted plenty of attention this season. Wasps captain James Haskell has also enjoyed his best season for a number of years, although he has been starting on the openside flank alongside the hugely impressive Fijian-born No 8 Nathan Hughes. The make-up of Lancaster’s back row has been hotly debated, with many believing captain Chris Robshaw is better suited to the blindside flank, where Tom Wood has struggled in recent months. But with Morgan apparently one of the few names guaranteed a Six Nations start, his expected absence leaves Lancaster with even more head-scratching to do. Wasps captain James Haskell is enjoying an impressive season but has been playing on the openside flank .

"Anthony Crolla is aiming for a summer comeback as he continues his recovery from a brutal attack last month. The Mancunian was left with a fractured skull and broken ankle after pursuing two men who he saw in his garden after hearing his neighbour's burglar alarm going off on December 16. His long-awaited world title shot against WBA lightweight champion Richard Abril on January 23 was scrapped and his trainer Joe Gallagher admitted he was unsure whether the likeable fighter would even be able to box again.

And with champion Terence Crawford widely expected to step up to 140lbs in the near future, Crolla may be a step closer to resurrecting his shot at a world belt. 'It really cheered me up,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'Obviously, Terence Crawford is the champion, but it seems common knowledge that he's going to move up in weight. I could end up being right by the time that comes around. 'The plan is to get out in the summer, but we've not talked about opponents yet or what kind of fight it will be. It doesn't bother me.

READ: Sergio Aguero vs Alexis Sanchez ."
"Manuel Pellegrini described Arsenal’s talisman Alexis Sanchez as the best player in England this week, a comment which must have gone down like a lead balloon in his own dressing room where Sergio Aguero has his own claims on that title. Aguero had netted 14 times before suffering a knee ligament injury in December. He made his comeback in the 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend. Meanwhile, Sanchez has been adding weight to the argument that he is the Premier League’s finest with two goals and one assist against Stoke.

With Man City trailing league leaders Chelsea by two points and Arsenal on the fringes of the top four, the two sides meet at the Etihad on Sunday. It is a crucial game with many intriguing subplots, not least the meeting of Aguero and Sanchez - two of the league’s most prolific goal scorers. But which South American will come out on top? Sportsmail has a look at their credentials. PASSING . Aguero . A devastatingly accurate passer, with 83.38% of his passes this season reaching their intended target. Technically he is superb, finding space in tight situations to link up play. Combines particularly well with David Silva. SCORE: 9.5/10 . Sanchez . A fan of the short pass he plays key passes at important times and seems to have a sixth sense of where his teammates are, sometimes not even looking up to check their position before delivering pinpoint service. SCORE: 8.5/10 . Aguero scores against Sunderland, one of 14 Premier League goals this season . Sanchez has scored 13 Premier League goals for Arsenal this season since signing from Barcelona . SHOOTING . Aguero . A predator, anticipates well and rarely misses when given a sniff at goal. Incredible balance and able to confound keepers with either foot and in myriad ways, whether it be a strike from distance or a nerveless sliced finish inside the box. SCORE: 9/10 . Sanchez . A lethal finisher. For a small player, his rising header against Burnley in November showed his versatility in front of goal. The stats indicate the Chilean is more accurate at shooting than even Aguero. SCORE: 9.5/10 . PACE . Aguero . Able to produce a thrilling burst of pace, switch speed, turn and take on players. Can make defenders look sluggish if they switch off for even a split second. SCORE: 9/10 . Sanchez . Lightning quick and with a low centre of gravity, he is able to tear through the opposition’s defence with pace and power. Makes darting runs off-the-ball to free up other players. SCORE: 9/10 .

"Once again, the Aviva Premiership delivered high drama on Saturday as champions Northampton were beaten at Sale, Bath crushed Wasps to move to within a point of the Saints at the top of the table and Harlequins claimed a bonus-point home win against Leicester. The matches, following Friday’s thunderous and damaging Gloucester-Saracens encounter at Kingsholm, also provided further pointers for England head coach Stuart Lancaster as he prepares to name a revised Test squad next week. With the RBS 6 Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff looming on February 6, here is a run-down of the current selection issues… . Billy Vunipola is primed to reclaim his No 8 jersey for England's Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff . Ben Morgan is likely to miss the entire Six Nations after the Gloucester forward broke a leg against Saracens . Morgan was named England's player of the series after his superb display against Australia in November . TIGHT-FIVE TUSSLE . Alex Corbisiero is back in action for Northampton but he was in a beaten pack in Salford, not least in the scrum, and contributed to a team performance awash with basic handling errors. Joe Marler is on course to retain the No 1 shirt ahead of his Lions loosehead rival. Tom Youngs of Leicester is the form hooker in the country — while rival Dylan Hartley has been serving a ban — but his fellow Tiger, Dan Cole, missed the defeat at Quins and is unlikely to have time to usurp Bath’s David Wilson at tighthead. In the second row, with Courtney Lawes poised for an imminent Saints comeback, he and David Attwood, who reached a century of appearances for Bath against Wasps, are sure to continue their effective partnership, while Joe Launchbury continues his injury rehab. England loosehead Alex Corbisiero (left) is back in action for Northampton after a long injury lay-off . Graham Kitchener maintained his fine form for Leicester in the tussle for the replacement lock role, after George Kruis was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle on Friday night. Corbisiero, Rob Webber and Kieran Brookes are most likely to provide the front-row cover. Mike Brown (Harlequins); Anthony Watson (Bath), Luther Burrell (Northampton), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester); George Ford (Bath), Danny Care (Harlequins); Joe Marler (Harlequins), Tom Youngs (Leicester), David Wilson (Bath); Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton); Tom Wood (Northampton), Chris Robshaw (capt, Harlequins), Billy Vunipola (Saracens) BACK-ROW BLOW . The savage blow to Ben Morgan, who had surgery on Saturday after breaking his left leg at Kingsholm the night before, means Billy Vunipola will return to England’s starting XV against Wales. Quins’ win generated renewed calls for Nick Easter to be considered for a recall at the age of 36 after his latest supreme performance. Easter said: ‘Clearly the door’s been pretty much shut for quite a while, but as long as you are playing, there is always an option. It is up to the selectors — sometimes your face fits, sometimes it doesn’t.’ Bath lock Dave Attwood looks set to continue his second row partnership with Courtney Lawes . Unfortunately for Easter, it appears that his face doesn’t fit, despite his stellar form. As the summer approaches, Lancaster will consider bringing Steffon Armitage in from his French exile, and the coaches are bound to call up Nathan Hughes of Wasps when the mighty Fijian qualifies on residency next year. Captain Chris Robshaw played well on his Quins comeback on Saturday and he is surely secure at openside, despite Matt Kvesic’s personal resurgence at Gloucester. Tom Wood deserves to keep the blindside berth and James Haskell can cover all bases from the bench. HALF-BACK DUEL . It was a setback for Saracens and England when Owen Farrell had to pull out of Friday’s game in the West Country with a tight calf. Club and country need him to string together a long run of matches at No 10. However, England can take heart from George Ford’s sensational form at fly-half — with the master-class he produced against Wasps being the latest example. The Bath playmaker is riding the crest of a wave after his autumn exploits and he continues to find ways to carve open the best defences. George Ford is England's form fly half at present and looks set to start against the Welsh in Cardiff . While Freddie Burns is struggling to break into the Leicester team and revive his game, Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler are vying for the final squad fly-half place. Cipriani won the duel between the pair on Saturday, partly thanks to his pack’s controlling influence but also because his distribution, decision-making and kicking were assured. At scrum-half, Danny Care eclipsed Ben Youngs at The Stoop, but again he had his forwards to thank for creating the platform. Their battle for supremacy will go on and on. OUTSIDE-BACK RACE . The midfield conundrum never ends. Manu Tuilagi was again absent from Leicester’s line-up and he is likely to miss the start of the Six Nations, which is a major blow to Lancaster. Kyle Eastmond was missing from the Bath side and while Sam Burgess excelled as his try-scoring deputy he will continue to learn a new code before the Test call-up inevitably comes. Luther Burrell has impressed for the Saints in recent months and looks set to start at outside centre . Luther Burrell was untidy and hesitant at Sale, but his form has been so good all season that it is fair to regard his display as a brief blip. On Friday, Billy Twelvetrees had one of those games that so infuriates the England coaches; classy one minute, sloppy and rash the next. It is hard to see him retaining his starting place at 12. Brad Barritt is due back for Saracens next weekend and he will surely join forces with Burrell, although Jonathan Joseph and Henry Slade warrant consideration. Providing they are all fit, England are unlikely to find any reason to change their most recent back-three unit of Mike Brown, Anthony Watson and Jonny May.","Lions and England prop Alex Corbisiero is back in action for Northampton .

"Three explosive letters that highlight Mahatma Gandhi's deep concerns over the behaviour of his eldest son, Harilal, will go under the hammer next week. Mullock's Auctioneers, based in Shropshire, are hoping to fetch up to £60,000 for a set of three letters written by the man regarded as the father of India in June 1935. In the letters between the father and son, Ghandi accuses Harilal of raping his granddaughter and asks if he is still interested in alcohol and debauchery. The three letters Mahatma Gandhi (left) sent to his eldest son Harilal (right) in 1935 accuse him of rape, and are expected to fetch up to £60,000 when they are sold next week by auction house Mullock's in Shropshire . Historic: The letters are written in Gujarati and one says: 'Please let me have pure truth. Please tell me if still you are interested in alcohol and debauchery. I wish that you better die rather than resort to alcohol' In one of the letters, Gandhi writes: . 'You should know that your problem has become much more difficult for me . even then our national freedom. 'Manu is telling me number of dangerous things about you. She says that you had raped her before eight years and she was so much hurt that medical treatment had to be taken.' In another he writes: 'Please let me have pure truth. Please . tell me if still you are interested in alcohol and debauchery. I wish . that you better die rather than resort to alcohol in any manner. And one dated November 11, 1930 reads: 'Women have done more work than us. Even . so much remains to be done. The modern world has as yet seen the like of . India's woman power. I am convinced they will go much further ahead and . I will be very surprised if you do not play a very big part in this.' The earliest letters date back to 1920, . but others are from 1930s and the majority date from the crucial period . of 1938-1944 in the Indian national movement. Family rift: One of the letters which will be sold next week together with its translation into English . Granddaughter: Another of the letters says: 'I can never believe that Manu [would tell] a lie' Rape allegation: The third of the letters says his granddaughter was saying 'a number of dangerous things' The series of letters is part of Mullock's Historical Documents Sale at Ludlow Racecourse on May 22. It also includes another set of 27 autographed letters to Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru, some written by Gandhi from prison. A spokesperson for Mullocks said: 'The letters are written in Gujarati and . are in good condition. These have come via descent from a branch of . Gandhi's family to the present vendor. 'As far as we are aware they have . never before been seen in public and as such they provide remarkable new . information on the troubled relationship Gandhi had with his son. It is thought Harilal . had wanted to go to England to study to become a barrister like his . father but Ghandi had firmly opposed this, believing a Western . education would not be helpful in the struggle against British Raj. Father of India: The letters were written at the height of Mahatma Gandhi's prominence in the 1920s and 30s . This . led to Harilal renouncing all family ties in 1911, and his troubled . relationship with his father continued throughout his life. Richard . Westwood-Brookes, the auction house's historical documents specialist, . told MailOnline: 'One of the things I obviously did check out was that . the letters were genuine. 'They . have been shown to Harilal's biographer and to someone from Gandhi's . Ashram and he's confirmed that they are 100 per cent genuine. 'His relationship with his son was quite well-known to be pretty fraught, to say the least.'","Letters to son Harilal ask if he is still interested in alcohol and debauchery .

"Gary Cahill was lucky to stay on the pitch during Chelsea's surprise 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on New Year's Day, after  kicking out at Harry Kane. With the score at 4-2 the England defender was tussling for the ball with Spurs' two-goal hero when the striker fell to the floor. Cahill, who had earlier conceded a penalty for fouling Kane, took a swing at the forward, clattering him in the back. Gary Cahill and Harry Kane fall to the floor as the pair struggle for the ball on the touchline . After getting back to his feet Cahill swings at Kane, who is still lying on the floor, between Cahill and the ball . The England defender makes a heavy contact with the Spurs striker's back, nowhere near the ball . With the ball a good yard away it is difficult to see how Cahill could claim to have been attempting to play it, particularly with Kane's whole body between the defender and the ball. Cahill then appeared to stamp on the prone forward's leg, although that was at least closer to the ball, and could have been an attempt to retrieve it. However, referee Phil Dowd seems not to have seen the incident, failing to punish the centre half for the violent play. However, Cahill's reprieve did his side little good, as Nacer Chadli added a fifth goal to Kane's double, Danny Rose's strike and Andros Townsend's penalty. Kane reacts in obvious pain, but neither the referee or his assistant seemed to notice the offence . With Kane writhing on the floor, Cahill then attempts to play the ball, but actually stamps on the forward's led . After the incident Cahill, apparently repentent, checked that his opponent was not seriously hurt .","Gary Cahill kicked Harry Kane in the back with the score at 4-2 .

"Robert F Kennedy was shot dead by two gunmen and not just 'lone wolf' Sirhan Sirhan, a witness stood just metres away from the presidential candidate in a Los Angeles hotel has claimed. Nina Rhodes-Hughes, of Vancouver, Canada, is convinced Sirhan - sentenced to life imprisonment after the killing - was the not the only man firing shots that fateful 1968 day. She told CNN: 'What has to come out is that there was another shooter to my right. The truth has got to be told. No more cover-ups.' Scroll down for video... Claims: Nina Rhodes-Hughes (left), pictured with Robert F Kennedy (centre), has said the presidential candidate was hit by two shooters . Aftermath: Robert F Kennedy in the moments after he was shot in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles . Rhodes-Hughes, now 78, claimed she had told FBI investigators she heard much more than eight shots, which was the maximum Sirhan could have fired with his small-caliber handgun. The former television actress, who was working as a volunteer fundraiser for Kennedy's campaign at the time, also said some of the '12 to 14' shots came from a different location to where the convicted murderer was standing. But the 'official reporting' of the incident has left her frustrated after it was changed by the FBI, she claimed, to say that she only heard eight shots. She added: 'For me it's hopeful and sad that it's only coming out now instead of before - but at least now instead of never. 'I never said eight shots. I never, never said it. There were more than eight shots. There were at least 12, maybe 14. And I know there were because I heard the rhythm in my head. 'When they say only eight shots, the anger within me is so great that I practically - I get very emotional because it is so untrue. It is so untrue. Tragic: Robert F Kennedy's casket arrives at St Patricks Cathedral, New York, for his funeral . She said she ran out of the pantry, where the shooting took place, yelling: 'They've killed him! They've killed him! Oh, my God, he's dead! They've killed him!.' 'Now, the reason I said, 'they' is because I knew there was more than one shooter involved. Although it was 44 years ago, I will swear that this is exactly what happened. Convicted: Sirhan Sirhan is trying to appeal his sentence . 'I remember it like it was almost yesterday, because you don't forget something like that when it totally changes your life forever. 'It took a great toll on me. For a while, even the backfiring of a car would send me into tears.' Sirhan Sirhan, now 68, is currently serving a life sentence at Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California. He was the only person arrested, tried and convicted for the murder, and never contested the case, during his 1969 trial, that he was the only gunman. Initially handed the death sentence, it was reduced to a life sentence in 1972. But he is now trying to engineer his release on the grounds that he was not the only gunman and that it was not him that killed Kennedy. He is now awaiting a U.S. District Court ruling which could see him released, re-tried or granted a hearing. The hearing would take place on the production of new evidence - including Rhodes-Hughes' eyewitness account. His . lawyer William Pepper called the alleged FBI alteration of her story . 'deplorable' and 'criminal' and said it 'mirrors the experience of other . witnesses'. Other witnesses . have also mentioned hearing more than eight shots, but these have only . been detailed in Los Angeles Police Department summaries and not FBI . reports. These included Estelyn Duffy LaHive, who . thought she heard 10 shots, and Booker Griffin who said there was 'two . quick shots, followed by a slight pause, and then another 10 to 12 . additional shots'. Brotherly love: The Kennedy siblings John F Kennedy (left), Robert Kennedy (centre) and Ted Kennedy (right) A recently uncovered tape recording at the Ambassador Hotel's pantry by freelance journalist Stanislaw Pruszynski also suggests there were 13 shots on June 5. Analysis has revealed five of the shots could have been fired from another direction to where Sirhan's weapon was positioned. Kennedy's autopsy report also revealed . his body and clothing were struck from behind, at right rear, by four . bullets fired at upward angles and at point-blank range. But witnesses said Sirhan fired somewhat downward, almost horizontally, from several feet in front. Rhodes-Hughes, . whose witness account is now being reviewed by the federal judge, first . met Kennedy two-and-a-half years before his death at NBC-TV studios in . Burbank, California. In the . make-up room being prepared for her role in Morning Star, she said she . was 'starstruck' when he entered. He was there to pre-record an . interview. Dynasty: Edward M Kennedy (centre) poses with brothers U.S. Attorney General Robert F Kennedy (left) and President John F Kennedy at the White House in Washington in 1962 . She said: 'I saw Robert Kennedy and everything else disappeared from view. There was an aura about him that was very captivating. He kind of pulled you in. 'His eyes were very deep set and they were very blue. And when you looked at him, you got very drawn in to him.' She said it was at that point she decided to help Kennedy, who was then a Senator for New York, should he ever decide to run for the top job of President. Kennedy, the most seriously wounded of the six people shot, was gunned down just moments after claiming victory in California's Democratic primary election. He died the next day, while the other victims survived. Although Sirhan's lawyers are calling for his release, Rhodes-Hughes, who was never called to testify at the trial, said he should remain in prison. She said: 'To me, he was absolutely there. I don't feel he should be exonerated. There definitely was another shooter. The constant cover-ups, the constant lies - this has got to stop.'","Sirhan Sirhan was not only gunman, claims eyewitness Nina Rhodes-Hughes .

"A heartbroken father claims a police officer shot his family’s dog ‘in cold blood’ in a gruesome act by a local police officer - all caught by his home security cameras. Raul Ayala of Lyman, Nebraska, said he had gone into town on September 22 with his wife and children, leaving his 18-month-old Rottweiler, Bos, in the yard. He later received a call from his brother-in-law, saying that he had heard shots being fired and went to the house to find Bos was dead. Scroll down to watch the video (WARNING: Graphic content) Mourning: Raul Ayala says his dog Bos was murdered 'in cold blood' by a police officer, who shot the animal about four times . Shots fired: Mr Ayala's security video shows the officer firing several shots at the dog, who can be seen spinning in place before collapsing . After returning to his house, Mr Ayala looked at his home security tapes, where he saw the officer fire about four shots from close range. Bos can be seen spinning in place before collapsing and writhing on the sidewalk. The video was also posted on YouTube on October 14 by Pittsburgh Cop Block, an organisation dedicated to naming and shaming police officers believed to have used excessive force or brutality. Proud dog owner: Raul Ayala holds up Bos, who was shot dead on September 22 by a police officer at Ayala's home in Lyman, Nebraska . Cruel? As the dog lay dying, Officer Huffman can be seen dragging its body to the grass . Mr Ayala told the Star-Herald that the cop 'murdered my dog in cold blood.' The police officer, Ray Huffman of the Lyman Police Department, claimed that he had only shot Bos after pepper spray was ineffective - and that the dog had lunged at him. Cleaning up: After leaving the dog in the grass, the officer can then be seen using a hose to wash the blood off the concrete where Bos was shot . A post on the ‘Justice for Bos Ayala’ Facebook page reads: 'He protected us with all he had he wasn't just a . dog he was more like family my baby who didn’t deserve what happen . (sic).' Family tragedy: The Ayala family looked to Bos as a guard dog . Also on the video, . the officer comes into the shot as Bos lays dying, grabs the animal by . one of his back legs, and drags him off to the side. He then takes a hose that was hanging nearby and uses it to rinse the blood off the concrete. He tosses the hose on the ground just before the video ends. Police said that Huffman washed the blood away because he did not want the family to see it. The family is now calling for Huffman’s dismissal from the Lyman Police Department. But the village won’t budge, saying that it has numerous witnesses 'who saw the dog acting aggressively and that it was not the first time.' The Village of Lyman said in a statement that it ‘supports the actions taken by Officer Huffman and will defend such actions unless it is proven that Officer Huffman acted negligently in his duties as a police officer.' But Ayala claims the security tape shows that the village is wrong, and that the shooting was not justified. Mr Ayala told the Star Herald: 'Nothing in the Village of Lyman’s statement is consistent with what is shown on my video. Furthermore, nothing said by Mr Huffman is consistent with what is being shown on my video.'

"Leicester manager Nigel Pearson called for the introduction of video technology after his side fell victim to two terrible penalty decisions in Thursday's 2-2 draw at Liverpool. Leicester were particularly incensed by referee Mike Jones’ decision to award a 17th minute spot kick for handball when the ball clearly hit Wes Morgan in the face. That provoked Match of the Day’s Gary Lineker, himself an ex-Leicester player, to tweet: ‘Worst penalty decision ever as Mike Jones gives handball against Leicester’s Morgan at Anfield when it hit him in the face. Wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on MOTD. I reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night.’ Liverpool were the beneficiaries of a decision that Gary Lineker described as the 'worst penalty decision ever' The ball hits Wes Morgan (right) in the face but Mike Jones gave Liverpool a penalty . Leicester players surround the official after Liverpool were given a penalty in the first half . Pearson added: ‘It’s unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that, The game could be a lot easier if we used what is available to us. This is the problem the game has because we expose human beings to making errors. The officials are there to do a job and we could make it much easier if technology was utilised.’ ‘We’ve got it [as a coaching staff]. It takes a couple of seconds. That could have been reviewed instantaneously. ‘In European games, we have seen the introduction of further assistants in the penalty area. It’s a question for the governing bodies of the games. Do i think it should be there? Yes.’ Leicester were 2-0 down at half-time after Steven Gerrard converted the two spot-kicks but recovered in remarkable fashion, as long-distance strikes from David Nugent and Jeffrey Schlupp salvaged a draw. Referee Jones awarded the controversial penalty . Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened. Steven Gerrard stepped up and scored the penalty against Leicester that should never have been . Gary Lineker was incredulous after the award of Liverpool's first penalty . Lineker vented his frustration after Jones awarded another penalty for Liverpool, which Gerrard scored . Lineker joked 'some of them (referees) may have been celebrating too hard last night' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who admitted the ball struck Morgan’s head, hit out at his team’s complacency as they missed a golden opportunity to close down the gap between themselves and the Champions League places. They are remain 8th and seven points behind Southampton . ‘I thought we got what we deserved in the end,’ Rodgers said, ‘I don’t think we played well and Leicester played very well. We gave away poor goals, giving the ball away very cheaply. We didn’t play well enough to merit a win. ‘We had a plan in place for after we score or after the opponent scored and a clear idea of what to do but kept giving way simple possession. Even things like ten yard passes, we would recover the ball and lose it again. The lead should be enough but we just made too many mistakes.’","Liverpool were awarded a penalty by referee Mike Jones in the 17th minute .

"Mark Hughes accused referee Michael Oliver of denying Stoke ‘two clear-cut penalties’ as they drew with Manchester United at the Britannia Stadium. Hughes was furious that Oliver did not penalise Chris Smalling for handling Peter Crouch’s header in the second-half, and also claimed that Geoff Cameron was fouled as he attempted to score from close-range when another Crouch effort hit the post. ‘We had two clear penalty claims that should have been given, certainly the first one,’ said the Stoke manager. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction from Mark Hughes and Louis van Gaal on penalties . Stoke manager Mark Hughes was furious his side were not awarded at least one penalty at the Britannia . ‘Chris Smalling has lost Peter Crouch on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. It’s a goalbound header and he’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down. ‘The referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know. ‘It’s a waste of time (speaking to Oliver about it). I’m sure he will say something like the lad couldn’t get out of the way because he was so close but I don’t think that’s the case. Peter Crouch's header clearly hits Chris Smalling's arm during the second-half at the Britannia . The ball clearly hits the arm of Manchester United defender Chris Smalling on the way through . ‘Then we hit the post from Peter’s header and it’s come back out and Geoff Cameron has been taken out. He was just waiting to put the ball over the line. From our point of view it’s two clear-cut penalties. ‘If you look at those two situations and then the opportunities in the first half, overall I think we were the better team. ‘Mame Diouf goes through and should have done better. It’s disappointing because at 2-0 we would been in a situation where I don’t think United would have been able to come back given the way they performed.’ Stoke City players surround referee Michael Oliver after he failed to award a penalty at the Britannia . Hughes can't hide his frustration as referee Michael Oliver refused his Stoke side a penalty . Crouch backed his manager’s point of view, saying: ‘I thought it was a definite penalty. It was a yard away from me and I knew I won the header cleanly. I think Smalling had his hands up.’ United manager Louis van Gaal claimed that he did not see the incident but questioned whether Smalling’s actions were deliberate. ‘Why did he raise his hand?’ said Van Gaal. ‘I don’t think that it’s always a penalty when the ball is hitting the hand or the arm or something like that. I have to see it, and I haven’t seen I yet.’ Ryan Shawcross reacted first as the ball fell kindly to him to put Stoke ahead after just two minutes .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce has revealed the club have not given up hope of persuading Winston Reid to sign a new contract, but insisted the player is in control of the situation. Reid was again impressive as the Hammers drew 1-1 with Everton in their FA Cup third round clash at Goodison Park. where goals from James Collins and Romelu Lukaku ensured the tie will be replayed at the Boleyn Ground in a week's time. Allardyce had previously said he would rather let the New Zealand defender leave for free at the end of the season than sell him in January, but it appears the club still harbour ambitions to retain his services beyond the summer. Sam Allardyce revealed the club have not given up hope of persuading Winston Reid to sign a new deal . Hammers manager Allardyce was talking on BT Sport ahead of the game against Everton . James Collins scores the opening goal of the game during the FA Cup clash at Goodison Park . Speaking on BT Sport, Allardyce said: 'It’s still an ongoing scenario with the club. I think that it’s neither one way or the other as far as Winston's concerned, we’ll just have to wait and see. Like every player he's in the driving seat.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez, meanwhile, was delighted with his team's strength and character, but felt they were unlucky to have a goal disallowed. Romelu Lukaku had his header chalked off after a supposed push on Aaron Cresswell, although replays suggested there was little in it. 'It feels very unfortunate not to be able to allow Romelu Lukaku’s goal in a physical game,' Martinez said after the final whistle. 'It was such a physical game. That (the foul) was not at the level that the game was played. It’s a normal contact, it should have been allowed. The former Wigan boss was pleased nonetheless, and felt the Lukaku's late equaliser could be a turning point in their season. ‘In the middle of a period where we are low on confidence it was a phenomenal reaction and it could easily be a turning point in our season,' he added.

"Jose Mourinho launched another attack on referees on Thursday night after Chelsea were beaten 5-3 at White Hart Lane. The Chelsea manager, who claimed Anthony Taylor should be ‘ashamed’ after failing to awarded a penalty in the 1-1 draw at Southampton, told Phil Dowd he was ‘too slow’. Chelsea’s poor Christmas run means they are now level on points with defending champions Manchester City after they beat Sunderland 3-2. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho on Eden Hazard's penalty claim . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was furious after Eden Hazard was denied a second-half penalty . Immediately after Hazard collided with Federico Fazio in the second-half Mourinho launched into a tirade . This incredible defeat is only the second time in Mourinho’s history as top class manager that one of his teams has conceded five times in a game. Mourinho’s side took the lead at Tottenham through Diego Costa and the Chelsea chief claims his side should have been given a penalty when Jan Vertonghen appeared to handle. He said: ‘I can go in another direction and say what we all know, which is, with the result 1-0, one clear action could make it 2-0. Mourinho launched into a tirade at fourth official Andre Marriner after the incident involving Chelsea's Hazard . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho directed a furious tirade towards fourth official Andre Marriner in the second-half . ‘Normally, at 2-0, the result would be completely different and the history of the game would be different. ‘You are talking about handball. Why do you want me to speak? You all know. ‘I don't think we need clarification when there are no doubts. When you have doubts, when the situation is not clear, I think the discussion comes good. This is the moment that angered Mourinho, when Hazard tumbled under the challenge of Federico Fazio . Hazard fell into the penalty area after the collision but it was unclear where contact had taken place . ‘Everyone can have a different opinion. The same way against Southampton there was no discussion, today there was no discussion too. ‘We are speaking about two matches, six points, we had one out of six when two crucial decisions would give us six points. ‘What matters are the points. The decisions, the normal tendency is for people to forget the decisions.’ Mourinho also hinted that Eden Hazard, who scored in the draw at Southampton and was excellent again here, is being driven out of English football because of persistent fouling. He added: ‘People in love with football in this country, people must be in love with Eden Hazard. Hazard falls after contact with Fazio, who appears to win the ball, so Phil Dowd didn't award the Blues a penalty . ‘The way match to match he's being punished by opponents and not protected by referees, maybe one day we won't have Eden Hazard. ‘It's one, two, three, four, five or 10 aggressive fouls against him. They kick and kick and kick, and the kid resists. ‘He's a very honest guy in the way he plays, but that's another problem.’ Chelsea’s bench demanded a red card when they mistakenly believed Federico Fazio had taken out the Chelsea forward when he was in on goal. Mourinho continued to berate the officials and referee Phil Dowd after his side weren't awarded a penalty . The Blues boss, complaing to Dowd, failed to contain his anger during the match at White Hart Lane . Mourinho added: ‘Hazard, honest as always, tells me in his opinion that it was not a foul or a red card. So that is good, in spite of the fact Mr Dowd was too slow to follow that ball. ‘He was 40 yards away, but made the right decision. It was the decision when he was 10m away (the penalty) he couldn't make.’ Incredibly Mourinho missed Gary Cahill twice kicking man of the match Harry Kane during an ugly incident in front of both technical areas. Instead the Chelsea manager snapped: ‘I didn't see that. But it was like the back - not like Sterling in the face?’. Mourinho claims he missed this incident when Gary Cahill appeared to kick Harry Kane in the back . Jose Mourinho complained there was a 'clear campaign' against his Chelsea side following the draw at Southampton. Press Association Sport assessed whether key decisions were fair during the Premier League clash between Tottenham and Chelsea. OFFSIDE? Eden Hazard narrowly kept the ball in out wide and whipped a shot past Diego Costa - the striker was being marked by Kyle Walker - which rebounded off the post to Oscar. His shot was tapped in by Costa. Spurs defenders' appeals were in vain. Decision: Goal for Chelsea. Correct. HAND OF JAN . Jan Vertonghen fell on to a ball after blocking Oscar's run on to the ball, with the Brazil playmaker and Mourinho appealing for a penalty. No-one else nearby did and referee Phil Dowd was unmoved. Decision: Play continued. Correct. ON THE SPOT . Gary Cahill flew in late on Harry Kane and Dowd had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. The Chelsea defender's challenge gave him no choice in the moments before half-time, but Mourinho came out for the second half talking into the official's ear. Decision: Penalty. Correct. DISAPPEARING BALLS . Mourinho continually complained in the second half when Hugo Lloris took his time to put the ball back into play with a goal kick. Decision: Play continued. Mourinho had a point. HAZARD HACKED? The Chelsea boss erupted when Hazard burst forwards and went down under the challenge of Federico Fazio. Mourinho complained to fourth official Andre Marriner and wanted a red card as the Spurs defender was the last man, but replays showed Fazio won the ball. Decision: Play continued. Correct. SPORTING PLAY . Vertonghen kicked the ball out because Costa took a blow to the head. Rather than return the ball, Fabregas took the throw-in as normal and won a corner, which Spurs cleared. Decision: Play continued. Grey area, and in Chelsea's favour on this occasion. Mourinho continued to unleash his anger towards the linesmen and fourth officials at White Hart Lane . That was a clear reference to Raheem Sterling’s slap on Federico Fernandez during Liverpool’s victory over Swansea, for which he went unpunished. Mourinho also refused to criticise Manchester City after they signed Frank Lampard for the rest of the season from his parent club New York City. He added: ‘If UEFA and the Premier League allow it, they allow it. I think any player from the New York team, if Manchester City wants them, they can bring him. ‘If they do it with other players, they do well. If they are allowed to do that, they'll do that.’ The Chelsea boss refused to criticise former Blues star Frank Lampard's transfer to Manchester City . Mourinho was animated on the touchline throughout the 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane . The Chelsea boss had to be restrained from going onto the pitch by one of his coaching staff . The first-half performance was too much for Mourinho as he stormed off down the tunnel before the whistle . Spurs chief Mauricio Pochettino admitted he was stunned by the result as Chelsea slipped to their second defeat of the season. They were beaten 3-0 at Stamford Bridge on December 3, but this was a convincing performance at White Hart Lane. He added: ‘The most important thing is to congratulate my players. There was a great atmosphere out on the pitch and for our supporters to. ‘For me, it's only three points. It is a good victory against Chelsea, one of the best teams in the world. But this is nothing. It's only three points. ‘We've started to improve a lot in the last few months. I think that we are more strong now.’ Hazard, scoring Chelsea's second, wasn't awarded a penalty in the second-half which incensed Mourinho .

"Think of the Premier League's fastest players and the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Agbonlahor are almost certain to spring to mind. The trio frighten defenders with their pace and direct running, bursting into space and taking on opponents at lightning speed. They are among the division's quickest, but cannot quite keep up with one man - Newcastle's Moussa Sissoko.

Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling (right), pictured against Leicester, ran at 35kph in his side's win at QPR . The Magpies powerhouse midfielder was clocked running at 35.3 kilometres per hour during his side's 1-0 win against Leicester in October - the fastest speed recorded by any player this season. The 25-year-old, who has attracted interest from French giants Paris Saint-Germain, may not be renowned for his pace but he put the afterburners on against the Foxes to beat Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha by just 0.1kph. The on-loan winger ran at a top speed of 35.2kph during the Eagles' 1-1 draw with Stoke in December, 0.1kph faster than West Ham's Stewart Downing and Leicester's Marcin Wasilewski have managed this season.

West Brom's Cristian Gamboa has only made 10 appearances so far but he, along with Tottenham's Eric Dier and Liverpool forward Sterling, has clocked up a 35kph sprint. Speed merchant Sanchez ran at 34.6kph against Newcastle last month - 0.2kph slower than Agbonlahor did against Southampton - leaving him just off the pace of Everton's Ross Barkley (34.9kph) and Chelsea's Diego Costa (34.7kph). Costa's top speed was matched by Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero when he faced Tottenham in mid-October and scored all of his side's goals in a 4-1 victory.

Sergio Aguero, pictured completing his hat-trick against Tottenham, ran at a top speed of 34.7kph . But it's not just speed that matters out on the pitch, it's also how much of it you're able to cover. Mark Hughes has turned Stoke into a more stylish side since taking over from Tony Pulis in the summer of 2013, but the Potters remain one of the hardest-working teams in the Premier League. That is perfectly illustrated by Steven N'Zonzi, who has covered 227 kilometres in his 20 appearances - the most by any player this season. The Frenchman is a key part of Stoke's midfield and has played every minute of every top-flight game so far, helping Hughes' men to wins against champions Manchester City and Arsenal. Stoke midfielder Steven N'Zonzi (left) chases down Manchester United star Juan Mata at the Britannia Stadium . N'Zonzi, pictured tracking back to challenge Arsenal forward Sanchez, has covered 227.1km this season . The former Blackburn man finds himself just ahead of Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas, who as well as providing a league-high 14 assists, has covered a massive 225.3km. Another of the league's most creative players, Spurs' Christian Eriksen, has also shown he's not afraid to work hard for his manager, having run 222km - the equivalent of over five marathons. Perhaps the most surprising name on our countdown is Robin van Persie, who has covered a greater distance than any other Manchester United player despite only completing 13 full games. The Dutchman has managed 187.1km so far, although that is only enough to beat Manchester City's Yaya Toure (179.7km) and Leicester defender Paul Konchesky (173.1km).

Mathieu Flamini has only completed 12 games for Arsenal but he is still the Gunners most hard-working player, having covered 191km for Arsene Wenger's side.

"Think of this as the third and final stage of Lionel Messi’s Barcelona career. We’ve had the shy and awkward boy wonder, we’ve had the fully developed, four- time Ballon d’Or winner, now we are in the age of Messi the leader. He’s in charge, and he’s not very happy. The Barcelona board and their chosen coach are the principal reasons why he has started to wonder, since the middle of last season, if his future might lie somewhere else. It was in December 2013 when, amid talk of a contract renewal, one of the club’s vice-presidents, Javier Faus, said he saw no reason ‘why the contract of this gentleman should be improved when it was revised only two years ago’. Superstar Lionel Messi, arriving at the Ballon d'Or ceremony, is the man who drives Barcelona on . But Barcelona talisman  Messi has cast doubt over his future with the Catalan giants . Messi had his partner Antonella Roccuzzo with him for the award ceremony in Switzerland on Monday . It was the sarcastic reference to ‘this gentleman’ that particularly riled Messi. It suggested a change in attitude towards a player who previous president Joan Laporta had always treated as the club’s favourite son. More important than the reluctance to improve his terms was the flippancy of the dismissal. The tone fitted the theory that the board would not be wholly against the idea of selling Messi. There is a new stadium to be built at a cost of £330million, after all, and what if his best years are behind him? ‘Senor Faus knows nothing about football,’ responded Messi. ‘He wants to run Barcelona like a business, which it is not.’ Messi, celebrates Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre), scored in the weekend win over Atletico Madrid . Messi has cast doubt over his Barcelona future, admitting on Monday 'I don't know where I'll be next year' The player spent December 2013 in Argentina recovering from injury and when he came back he couldn’t prevent the team finishing the season without a trophy. Messi feels that this board has neither backed nor protected him. He has brought some of the off-field problems on himself by failing to declare the correct amount of tax during a three-year period. But when that indiscretion encouraged a campaign against him that even had one newspaper, El Mundo, linking his father to a money-laundering ring connected to a drugs cartel, there was no closing of ranks around the star player as there would have been in the past. This season the board has been the lesser evil, with coach Luis Enrique taking charge of the team in the summer. Cristiano Ronaldo with Messi during the Ballon d'Or ceremony on Monday, which the Portuguese star won . Barcelona manager Luis Enrique (right), arrived as manager this summer, has fallen out with star player Messi . Enrique left Messi on the bench for the first match of the new year - a defeat by Real Sociedad . The man who managed to fall out with both Francesco Totti and Daniele de Rossi at Roma picked 27 different teams for his first 27 matches in charge, antagonising senior dressing-room figures in the process. He allowed Neymar and Messi to come back two days later than originally planned from the winter break but then left both out of the first game of the new year, which the team lost 1-0 to David Moyes’s Real Sociedad. ‘So now I’m OK to play?’ Messi is understood to have told his manager when, 1-0 down, he asked him to come on at the break. That first match of 2015 was a tinker too far. Across the great La Liga divide at Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti tends to pick his best players for every game. Luis Enrique’s rotation has smacked of trying too hard to impose himself on a squad of superstars. The 27-year-old (centre) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for Barcelona last season . Gerard Pique, Dani Alves and Ivan Rakitic had also been victims of the chopping and changing and none have adequate replacements in a squad poorly assembled by the since-ousted sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta. Messi rowed with his coach on the Friday before the Sociedad game, tensions were strained on the Sunday of the match and instead of training the following day, he stayed at home and followed Chelsea on Instagram. Add that piece of social-network manoeuvering to the decision to name Jose Mourinho — for so long pantomime villain of the Clasicos, not least when he poked the late Tito Vilanova in the eye — as third on his list of top coaches, and it is little wonder the seeds of doubt have started to sprout. Messi celebrates after scoring for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid during Sunday's victory at the Nou Camp . The idea that Messi would never work with Mourinho was quashed in one fell swoop. The Chelsea coach has already rubbished the idea that Financial Fair Play restrictions would ever allow Chelsea to make such a move. That is true if Messi’s price were his buy-out clause of £195m. But if he handed in a transfer request the price would fall. The player’s long-term partner Antonella Roccuzzo certainly wouldn’t object to being closer to her best friend Daniella Semaan, the partner of Cesc Fabregas. Could London really be calling? Playing the transfer-request card is the only way it could happen and that remains the player’s very last resort in this power play. Messi (right) celebrates with Barca team-mates Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar on Sunday night . End-of-season elections will bring change to the club. Former president Laporta is poised to stand and Messi will back one candidate in June and that candidate will win by a landslide. Anyone who can guarantee that he stays will be given the electorate’s seal of approval. For that to be the case, however, the possibility of him walking away has to exist. Hence the occasional ‘I don’t even know where I will be next year’ admissions. All great clubs follow the lead of one individual. Sometimes it’s a gregarious owner or president, sometimes it’s a charismatic manager and sometimes it’s an exceptional player. There is a power void at Barcelona and Messi is ready to fill it. Now is the winter of his discontent — if he gets the president and coach he wants, in June it will be a glorious summer.","Lionel Messi has fallen out with Barcelona boss Luis Enrique .

"The beauty queen who was born a boy won't be kicked out of the Miss Universe Canada competition after all. Jenna Talackova, 23, was thrown out of the pageant, founded by Donald Trump, when organisers found out she had undergone surgery to become a woman. Officials denied charges of discrimination and said the reason why a male-to-female transgender contestant could not compete was because Miss Talackova lied on her application form.

"It is almost impossible for westerners to gain access to Iran first-hand, but these pictures aim to take us right inside their private lives. Iranian photographers have shared what life is like for ordinary young people by taking pictures of a place foreigners would rarely ever see - their living rooms. Western understandings of Iran tend to be dominated by the aggressive rhetoric of outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmedinijad and controversy over the country's nuclear capabilities. Beauty salon owner Zohreh, right, sits at her desk in her home with her customers - once they leave the salon they will have to cover their newly-done hair, and their arms .

Saghi and Barbod love music and dancing, although western pop music would be very difficult to get hold of . Yasmin lets her hair down to dance around in her house . The outside world is used to seeing pictures of ordinary Iranians covered-up, or in crowd and street scenes, but rarely of them at up-close and at leisure. The pictures published in a book called Iranian Living Room by 15 local photographers . give an insight into everyday Iranian life, often on the edge of what is permitted by the Islamic regime. In Iran Islamic law is strictly enforced, but in their homes many Iranians choose to relax the rules. In public, men should wear long trousers and long-sleeve shirts, but pictures of them behind closed doors show them in their more western-style clothing, baring their arms and legs. Teenagers Yasmin, right, and Negar, left, smoke and check Facebook. Iran's president-elect Hassan Rouhani has said that Facebook and other social networking sites should no longer be frowned upon . Young woman Saghi, right, puts on her modest outerwear to go shopping while the others talk and cook in the kitchen . Cultural strictures are even tighter for women. In any public place they must cover their heads with a headscarf, wear trousers or a floor length skirt, and a long-sleeved tunic down to their mid-thighs. Each summer as the heat bears down . and makes it difficult for women and men to stick to their . forced Islamic dress code, the religious police go out on to the streets . to watch out for loose hijabs, inappropriate dress or hairstyles.

"It may look like a dirty yellow rock - but this 'stone' could be a piece of whale sick worth £100,000. When Ken Wilman's dog Madge dug up the 'horrible' smelling object during a walk on Morecambe beach, he dragged her away. But when he got home, the intrigued Lancashire walker looked up the mysterious find online. He was amazed to learn that the misshapen rock is probably a piece of rare and valuable sperm whale vomit nicknamed 'floating gold'. Mystery: Ken Wilman and his dog with the strange yellow rock they uncovered on Morecambe beach . Ambergris, or 'grey amber', is used in perfumes such as Chanel No. 5 to amplify the scent. While the vomit is said to smell like old wood or fungus, it acts as a vital stabiliser when combined with other ingredients. A French dealer has now offered Mr . Wilman 50,000 euros if the 3kg lump turns out to be ambergris - but it . could be worth twice as much. Mr Wilman's boxer Madge found the lump while they were out walking near The Battery. Mr Wilman, from Morecambe, said: 'It was like walking on the beach and finding a bag of £50,000 in cash, 'I didn't actually realise what it was at first, I couldn't understand why Madge was so interested in it. 'It smelled horrible. 'I left it, came back home and looked it up on the internet. When I saw how much it could be worth, I went back to the beach and grabbed it.' Mr Wilman, who is unemployed after hurting his back in a motorbike accident, now plans to send a small sample of his discovery to France to have it checked. Valuable: The rare and strange-smelling lump of vomit could be worth up to £100,000 . 'If he verifies it, it could be like winning the Lottery,' he said. Chris Hill, curator at the Aquarium of the Lakes in Cumbria, said: 'It's quite a find. 'How much it's worth will depend on how fresh it is, but it's potentially $180,000. 'There are places in Europe that will buy it from you. They will age it, like a fine wine, and then test it for perfume.' Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of . sperm whales, which they eject into the ocean, usually when they have a . stomach or throat problem. It can then float around undiscovered for years in the water, where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour. Waste not, want not: Ambergris is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales, which they eject into the sea when ill . Professor Callum Roberts, a marine biologist from the University of York, told Radio 4's Today programme that the 'sick' is, in fact, more like excrement. 'It is extraordinary valuable because it is the perfect stabiliser for perfume,' he said. 'All sorts of things have been mistaken for ambergris - dog poo, dead animals... 'You mix it with perfume. It doesn't have much smell of its own - it smells a bit like fungus or old wood - but it amplifies scents around it. 'It generally appears in small lumps, about fist or football size, but pieces of up to 200 kilos have been found. 'Not all sperm whales produce it,' he added. In 2006 a couple walking on an Australian beach found a 32-pound chunk of ambergris, which netted them $295,000.","Ken Wilman's dog Madge dug up the 3kg lump of 'ambergris' during a walk .

"Challenging: Justice Antonin Scalia was asked by a student about his opposition to gay marriage . A gay college student questioned conservative Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia about a previous ruling where he wrote in favor of anti-sodomy laws. In that landmark 2003 case, which ended up overturning anti-sodomy laws in Texas and 13 other states, Scalia voted against the majority, writing that moral objections to sodomy should be considered as valid as moral objections to bestiality and murder. In Monday's lecture at Princeton University, the 78-year-old judge Said his method of argument was 'effective'. The comments now have many liberal campaigners worried as the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear two cases on same-sex marriage in the coming year, and his comments show that it is reasonable to expect a dissent from Scalia. 'I don't think it's necessary, but I think it's effective,' Scalia said, adding that legislative bodies can ban what they believe to be immoral. Scalia has been giving speeches around the country to promote his new book, 'Reading Law,' and his lecture at Princeton comes just days after the court agreed to take on two cases that challenge the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Some in the audience who had come to hear Scalia speak about his book applauded but more of those who attended the lecture clapped at freshman Duncan Hosie's question. Scholarly: The lecture took place at Princeton University, a place that freshman Duncan Hosie says he 'loves' Instigator: Hosie, who identified himself as gay and said on his Facebook page that he voted for Mitt Romney in the recent election, said that he was not convinced by Scalia's reasoning . 'It's a form of argument that I . thought you would have known, which is called the `reduction to the . absurd,'' Scalia told Hosie of San Francisco during the . question-and-answer period. 'If we cannot have moral feelings against homosexuality, can we have it against murder? Can we have it against other things?' he said according to the school's paper, The Daily Princetonian. Scalia said he is not equating sodomy with murder but drawing a parallel between the bans on both. Then he deadpanned: 'I'm surprised you aren't persuaded.' Hosie said afterward that he was not persuaded by Scalia's answer. He said he believes Scalia's writings tend to 'dehumanize' gays. As Scalia often does in public speaking, he cracked wise, taking aim mostly at those who view the Constitution as a 'living document' that changes with the times. 'It isn't a living document,' Scalia said. 'It's dead, dead, dead, dead.' Hot topic: The issue of gay marriage is expected to be an upcoming consideration of the Supreme Court . He said that people who see the Constitution as changing often argue they are taking the more flexible approach. But their true goal is to set policy permanently, he said. 'My Constitution is a very flexible one,' he said. 'There's nothing in there about abortion. It's up to the citizens... The same with the death penalty.' Scalia said that interpreting laws requires adherence to the words used and to their meanings at the time they were written.","Student questioned conservative justice about a 2003 decision where he wrote in favor of anti-sodomy laws .

"Burglars who break into country homes can expect to be shot at by their victims, a judge warned yesterday. Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency for a career criminal who he claimed had been blasted with a shotgun in ‘a form of summary justice’. The judge replied: ‘If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’ Burglars: Joshua O'Gorman, left, and Daniel Mansell, right, who were . both jailed yesterday after they were shot by the owner of the house they . were trying to steal from . The case reignited the debate over the rights of homeowners to defend their properties from intruders. Daniel Mansell, 33, and Joshua . O’Gorman, 27, were sentenced to four years in prison following the . masked raid on the cottage in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, . Leicestershire. Their victims, Andy and Tracey Ferrie, were arrested after Mr Ferrie opened fire on the pair during the midnight break-in. They were held on suspicion of causing . grievous bodily harm and spent 40 hours in custody before prosecutors . decided they had acted in ‘reasonable self-defence’ and lifted the . threat of charges. The couple emigrated to Australia on . Monday amid fears of a revenge attack. Cannabis addict Mansell was shot . in the right hand while O’Gorman was shot in the face during the . incident earlier this month. Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey: Both were held for 40 hours after Mr Ferrie shot two burglars with a shotgun as they tried to raid his country home . Both men were out of prison on licence when they struck at the Ferries’ 200-year-old rented home. Judge Pert backed householders’ rights . to defend their home from intruders, telling Mansell and O’Gorman: ‘I . make it plain that, in my judgment, being shot is not mitigation. 'You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’ He spoke out after Andrew Frymann, . defending O’Gorman, suggested his client’s ‘near death experience’ should be ‘taken into consideration’ by the judge when sentencing. Mr Frymann said O’Gorman had suffered . serious facial injuries including permanent scarring. He added: ‘He was . shot – without any warning or foresight – in the face with a shotgun. 'This is a form of summary justice or punishment which I submit should be taken into consideration.’ Leicester Crown Court yesterday heard . Mansell and O’Gorman fled empty-handed from the cottage and were . arrested hours later when they went to hospital for treatment. 'Their injuries were clearly visible . as they stood in the dock. Mansell – who has a tattoo reading ‘Big Man’ on his neck – wore his arm in a sling, and O’Gorman has a scar from his . right eye to his ear. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said the . Ferries were woken by the sound of breaking glass as the raiders forced . their way into their home with a garden fork handle. As they made their way downstairs, Mrs . Ferrie, the registered keeper of the shotgun, handed the weapon to her . husband. Mr Murphy said: ‘Mr Ferrie described seeing three men in the . hall or kitchen wearing some form of face coverings. ‘One of the men was reaching into a drawer that held a number of knives. As a result Mr Ferrie fired his shotgun.’ The farmhouse in Welby, Melton Mowbray, where Andy tried to defend his home from intruders by using his shotgun . Mr Ferrie, 35, who owns a motorhome repair business, then called the police, and he and his 43-year-old wife were arrested. O’Gorman had 16 previous convictions . involving 27 offences. He was on licence at the time he broke into the . cottage, having been released early from a 14-month prison sentence for . dangerous driving. Mansell has eight previous convictions . involving 19 offences. He was freed on licence following a conviction . for causing grievous bodily harm. Mansell and O’Gorman, both of Leicester, admitted burglary with intent to steal. Last night Mrs Ferrie’s mother, Hazel . Towell, 63, said the couple had moved to Perth in Western Australia . because they feared for their safety. Police are pictured searching the ground for clues at the remote house near Melton Mowbray. O'Gorman was shot in the face and Mansell was hit in his right hand during their attempted burglary . The retired cashier, from Burton, Staffordshire, added: ‘They’ve moved as far away as possible. The fear was real enough for Andrew . and Tracey to stay in a different hotel every night until they flew to . Australia on Monday. They felt safer if they moved around.’ Tory MP Alan Duncan spoke in defence . of the Ferries, his constituents, while the couple were in custody. Yesterday he welcomed the judge’s robust comments. ‘Three cheers for the judge,’ he said. ‘Justice has been swift in this case and draws a clear distinction . between the culprits and the victims.’ Two other men, aged 23 and 31, who . were also arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary, are set to . answer police bail next month.

"If you ever feel like you’re surrounded by people who are smarter, sexier and more well-read than you are, don’t worry. According to a new study, most of them are just putting it on - and it’s probably because they are trying to impress you. Poll results show eight in ten of us lie to seem cleverer and more attractive than we really are in social situations. Over half of those surveyed admit to changing their appearance to try and come across as clever - including wearing glasses even if they are not needed (posed by model) Two thirds of respondents even admitted to pretending they have read worthy books such as Tolstoy’s War and Peace. Researchers say that we feign intelligence in a bid to be more sexually attractive to potential partners. A sixth of those surveyed admitted to exaggerating their academic achievements or fluency in foreign languages. A further 11 per cent inflated their job status and role, while a similar proportion owned up to bragging about their knowledge of wine. Over half - 53 per cent - of those surveyed admit to changing their appearance to try and come across as clever. Tactics include wearing sober business suits or other such smart outfits and glasses even if they are not needed. One in 20 men has tried growing a moustache or beard and three per cent of women have changed their hair colour from blonde to brunette. Three quarters of Brits say they find intelligence attractive while 70 per cent would choose brains over beauty in their partner. Behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings said: ‘The study shows that being intelligent has never been more sexy and that the vast majority of us are working hard to appear smarter than we actually are. One in eight has turned to a thesaurus to make their writing sound more impressive. A show-off five per cent recite poetry while three per cent hide low brow books in their homes . ‘From expertise in literature and wine . to a penchant for correct grammar and art-house or foreign language . films, wannabe geeks are exaggerating their worldly qualities in order . to appear more nerdy.’ Other . sneaky tricks to appear intelligent and worldly include correcting . other people’s grammar and dropping famous quotations into conversation. One in eight has turned to a thesaurus to make their writing sound more impressive. And eight per cent admit to dismissing popular films as ‘rubbish’ - while secretly enjoying them. To . fake a detailed grasp of current affairs, six per cent re-tweet news . and features from sources that seem clever while five per cent research . topics before dinner parties. A show-off five per cent recite poetry while three per cent hide low brow books in their homes. And two per cent are wannabe wine buffs who put on an excessive show of swirling and gargling their drink to appear sophisticated. Over half of us - 52 per cent - display books at home that we have never read, the survey of 2,000 people found. The most popular book to brag about is George Orwell’s 1984, followed by Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations. Women are more likely than men to bluff that they are well-read when they have often only seen literary classics dramatised in films or on TV. But men are more likely to fib when bragging of their academic achievements and jobs. They are also twice as likely as women to cite famous quotations to appear wise and worldly. The survey was commissioned to mark the launch of American geek sitcom The Big Bang Theory season 6 on DVD this week.","Researchers say that we feign intelligence in a bid to be more sexually attractive to potential partners .

"The parents of a pregnant mentally-disabled woman are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby. The Nevada couple are the legal guardians of their 32-year-old daughter, who has the mental capacity of a six-year-old, and have exclusive authority over her health care decisions. Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker . lacks the authority to decide whether the woman should be allowed to give birth, according to a . motion to halt the proceedings that they have filed at the Nevada Supreme Court. Big issue: The parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six are trying to block a judge from holding hearings they fear could result in the compulsory abortion of her baby . The woman was living in a Reno group home when she wandered away from it and became pregnant 13 weeks ago. The child's father has not been identified. It is unknown whether . the pregnancy resulted from rape or consensual sex, according to the couple's attorney Jason Guinasso. The circumstances are under investigation by the county public guardian's office. Both the parents and the woman want her to carry the baby to term in line with their Catholic religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has set a deadline of noon today for the judge and county officials to respond to the request to halt evidentiary hearings into the woman's health. The hearings are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The couple acknowledges the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby. But they say medical experts back them in their decision to continue the pregnancy. Mr Guinasso said: 'Does she understand all the risk? I doubt it. 'But we do know the guardians understand the risk, and they're the ones given the authority and responsibility to make the decision. They have a perfectly healthy baby and mother.' Six couples have expressed an interest in adopting the baby, the woman's parents said. Deadline set: A district judge lacks the authority to decide whether the woman should be allowed to give birth, according to a motion to halt the proceedings that they have filed at the Nevada Supreme Court (pictured) At a court hearing on Thursday, two medical experts testified that the pregnancy carries risks because the woman has epilepsy and is on medication. But they were split on whether the pregnancy should be terminated. The court gave the woman's parents guardianship for her when she became 18. Last month, the judge denied the couple's request to allow the woman to move back home with them and to halt the proceedings. Deputy District Attorney Dania Reid stressed there has been no motion or discussion to order an abortion in the case. She noted Judge Walker appointed the county public guardian's office as a 'neutral fact-finder' to investigate the pregnant woman's condition in regard to her medical, psychiatric and group home care. Mrs Reid said: 'It's not the county's role in this case to make any findings of conclusions whether or not this pregnancy should continue. That's entirely up to the court.' Olivia Gans Turner, spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based organisations National Right To Life and American Victims Of Abortion, said the Nevada couple have drawn the support of pro-life advocates nationwide. She said: 'This is a cause we support. It's definitely their right to protect their daughter's right to have a child and to protect the life of their grandchild. 'There's no reason for this woman to be subjected to the danger and risk of an abortion because someone else thinks she's not worthy of having a child because of her mental condition.'","Nevada couple are legal guardians of their daughter, 32 .

"The federal government has shut down, closing national parks and monuments and furloughing hundreds of thousands of employees, including airline safety inspectors.

"With the shutdown in its fifth day, the GOP-run House passed a bill today that would make sure the 800,000 sidelined government workers get paid for staying off the job. The measure comes with one caveat: the furloughed employees will get reimbursed for lost pay only once the government reopens. The White House backs the bill and the U.S. Senate was expected to approve it, too, but the timing was unclear. Bipartisan move: Democrats and Republicans in the House voted 407-0 to make sure federal workers are reimbursed for lost pay during the shutdown . The 407-0 vote in the House was uniquely bipartisan, even as lawmakers continued their partisan rhetoric. ‘This is not their fault and they should not suffer as a result,’ Rep. Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, said of federal workers. ‘This bill is the least we should do. ‘Our hard-working public servants should not become collateral damage in the political games and ideological wars that Republicans are waging.’ Republican Rep. Michael Turner, of Ohio, said federal workers shouldn't have to worry about paying their bills while Congress and the White House fight over funding the government. ‘They have child care expenses, house payments to make, kids that are in college, and while the president refuses to negotiate, while he's playing politics, they shouldn't worry about whether or not they can make ends meet,’ Turner said. Warring factions: US House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (left) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (right) speaks after the passage of the bipartisan bill . Statesmen: U.S. House Speaker John Boehner (center), Republican of Ohio, and Representative Rob Bishop (2nd L) walk through Statuary Hall as the House votes on a bill to ensure back pay for furloughed workers . But even as Congress and the White House rallied around the bill, one outside group said it ‘demonstrates the stupidity of the shutdown.’ Making the shutdown less painful for 800,000 federal employees will encourage Congress and the White House to extend it even longer, driving up the cost, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ellis said ‘essential’ federal workers who stayed on the job ‘will feel like suckers because they've been working while the others essentially are getting paid vacations.’ Adamant: President Obama said Friday he won't negotiate on the temporary spending bill or upcoming debt limit measure . The White House has opposed other piecemeal efforts by House Republicans to restore money to some functions of government during the partial shutdown. White House officials have said the House should reopen the entire government and not pick agencies and programs over others. In the 1995-96 government shutdowns, furloughed workers were retroactively given full pay. Despite the White House's declared appreciation of the essential the role of federal workers, there appeared no sign of a breakthrough in getting them back to work. Lawmakers keep replaying the same script on Capitol Hill: House Republicans pass piecemeal bills to reopen popular and politically sensitive programs, while Democrats insist that the House vote on a straightforward Senate-passed measure to reopen all of government. ‘We know that there are enough members in the House of Representatives - Democrats and Republicans - who are prepared to vote to reopen the government,' Obama said Friday. ‘The only thing that is keeping that from happening is Speaker Boehner has made a decision that he is going to hold out to see if he can get additional concessions from us.’ There seemed little chance of that. For one thing, flinching by either side on the shutdown might be seen as weakening one's hand in an even more important fight looming just over the horizon as the combatants in Washington increasingly shifted their focus to a midmonth deadline for averting a first-ever default. ‘This isn't some damn game,’ Boehner, R-Ohio, said as the White House and Democrats held to their position of agreeing to negotiate only after the government is reopened and the $16.7 trillion debt limit raised. Republicans pointed to a quote in The Wall Street Journal from an anonymous White House official that ‘we are winning ... It doesn't really matter to us’ how long the shutdown lasts. Outspoken: Marisa Gonzalez, left, and Leonor Ramus, right, join others as they hold a rally in support of federal workers outside the office of Sen. Ted Cruz in San Antonio Thursday . At issue in the shutdown is a temporary funding measure to keep the government fully open through mid-November or mid-December. More than 100 stopgap continuing resolutions have passed without much difficulty since the last shutdown in 1996. But tea party Republicans, their urgency intensified by the rollout of health insurance marketplaces this month, are demanding concessions in Obama's health care law as their price for the funding legislation, sparking the shutdown impasse with Democrats. Mr Obama has said he won't negotiate on the temporary spending bill or upcoming debt limit measure, arguing they should be sent to him free of GOP add-ons. Congress, whether controlled by Democrats or Republicans, routinely sent Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, ‘clean’ stopgap spending bills and debt-limit increases. House Republicans appeared to be shifting their demands, de-emphasizing their previous insistence on defunding the health care overhaul in exchange for re-opening the government. Instead, they ramped up calls for cuts in federal benefit programs and future deficits, items that Boehner has said repeatedly will be part of any talks on debt limit legislation.","House voted 407-0 to reimburse 800,000 government employees sidelined by impasse .

"Click here for all the best facts and stats with our fantastic Match Zone service . A golden age of Belgian football has been threatening to dawn and it did so brilliantly in the 90th minute of this dense struggle against the dark, growling Russian bear. That blood-red sun is unlikely to reach its zenith here but this young team of so many talents are going where Roy’s Boys are not – onto the last 16. In two years’ time at the Euros they should be championship contenders. Hopefully their glittering light will stay high in the sky over  Russia 2018.

They will benefit hugely from qualifying for the knock-out stages at Brazil 2014,  mature faster and  grow stronger from the experience. If Russia are to go through with them, Fabio Capello, none other,  will have to find a way for them to beat Algeria next Thursday. Good luck, lads. Between them, without hitting the exciting heights of so many of these beautiful games in Brazil, Belgium and Russia contested an absorbing match which came to the thrilling climax of that late, late winner. When Belgian manager Marc Wilmots decided he had seen enough of a disappointing Romelu Lukaku, he found his match-winner. Substitute Divock Origi blasted high into the net from Eden Hazard’s brilliant run and low cross. There was plenty for the folks back home in Blighty to cheer. Top of the world: Skipper Vincent Kompany celebrates following full-time in the Maracana . Prayers answered: Eden Hazard laid on the winner for Origi which sends Belgium into the second round . As an antidote for the withdrawal symptoms being suffered by English football fans as Hodgon’s men make ready to break camp and retreat from Rio, the Belgians came to the Maracana with their team-full complement of 11 Premier League players. Five  of them started against Russia –  one each from Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Everton. Six more were on the bench – two each from Manchester United and Spurs, one each from  Everton and Liverpool. And since that did not include a goalkeeper make it a round dozen by throwing in Thibaut Courtois, who Jose Mourinho says will be back at Chelsea next season after three years on loan to Atletico Madrid. Presumably they were being roared on in the pubs and bars from the King’s Road to Moss Side, from White Hart Lane to Merseyside as they  joined Argentina, France, Holland, Chile and – as if we could forget - Costa Rica – among those who have made it to the last 16 before their third group game. With only three of their 23-man squad based in their own domestic league, Belgium are the most cosmopolitan team at Brazil 2014. In addition to those taking the English club game by storm, they draw on players from leading clubs in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal and Russia. They are the cuckoos of the world game, occupying the nests of others and plucking priceless experience for themselves.

The only odd bird here with them Is their manager. Our former and unlamented friend Signor Capello. Whatever language he uses to address his new charges, be sure it is not Russian or English. Nor Flemish. Joke all you like about this Low Country but there is nothing boring about Belgian football. Russia were playing not only to stay in the tournament but to promise they will be able to compete as well as host the next World Cup. Belgium recalled Thomas Vermaelen for this outing in Rio, apparently en route from Arsenal to Manchester United. He looked as comfortable taking over from Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen at left back as he did at centre half  in his early days at the Emirates. In curious circumstances, Vermaelen and Vertonghen swapped bench for pitch places again after only half an hour. Vermaelen appeared to strain a knee during the pre-match warm up and the condition must have worsened in those 30 minutes. VIDEO Belgian fans dare to dream in Rio .

Unabashed at picking up the first yellow card of the match, Glushakov launched the cross which should have given Russia the lead a minute before half time.Centre-forward Kokorin held in his hands the head with which he steered the ball wide when unmarked at close range with only Courtois to beat. Lukaku is looking out of his depth at this level and as Russia began to exert control he was replaced by Origi just ten minutes into the second half. Belgium appeared to be beginning to fade. With the temperature climbing to the mid-80s it would be easy to blame the lunch-time heat but Russia come from an even colder clime and they were getting stronger by the minute. Eshchenko, a substitute for Kozlov, drew a deep-throated roar from the Russian contingent with a fierce cross shot. But the effort drained them and Belgium found a second wind. Another substitute, Mirallas, hit a post from a free kick and Hazard fired wide from close in before setting up Origi and starting the Belgian beer-fest.","Victory for Marc Wilmots' side in the Maracana moves them onto six points at the top of Group H .

"This photograph, released by the White House on Thursday, reveals the terrible moment when President Barack Obama was told the shocking news about the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The President, who has described the day of the shootings as the ‘worst day of my presidency,’ is seen bowing his head and closing his eyes as John Brennan, his deputy national security adviser, informs him about the tragic events unfolding in Newtown, Connecticut. In the wake of the tragedy, the president has tasked his deputy Joe Biden with leading a task force to look at proposals to tighten current firearms legislation. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'The worst day of my presidency': Barack Obama receives the horrific news about the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Back to school: Sandy Hook students wave on their way to their new school, with one young boy holding up his fingers in a sign Americans recognise as a peace sign . In Newtown, the surviving children of the Sandy Hook . Elementary School massacre returned to classes on Thursday for the first time . since the killing, relocating to a refurbished school in a nearby town. On . a day laced with worry for the families, children were pictured . boarding buses, while police officers stood guard outside the school to . check IDs of parents dropping off their sons and daughters. In . one particularly striking image, a young boy aboard a yellow school bus . held his fingers in a peace sign as the vehicle passed memorials and . welcoming signs on its new route. With . their original school still being treated as a crime scene, the more . than 400 students are now attending a school, formerly known as Chalk . Hill School, in the neighboring town of Monroe. The site has taken the name Sandy Hook . Elementary School - known as the place where six staff members and 20 children lost their . lives on December 14 - after discussions with staff. Police officers have been guarding the new school and a senior officer described it as 'the safest school in America'. Journey: Parents were encouraged to put their children on the bus so they can return to their normal routines . Warm welcome: Signs dot the roads in Monroe, Connecticut, where the new Sandy Hook school is located . A student looks from a bus while signs welcome children to their classrooms at the former Chalk Hill School . The school district said parents who . wanted to be close to their children could stay in classrooms or an . auditorium throughout the first day, but they were encouraged to take . their children to the bus to help them return to their routine. Newtown Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson said the school has been transformed into a 'cheerful' place for the students to resume normal school routines. She said mental health counselors are available for anyone who needs them. 'We will go to our regular schedule,' she said. 'We will be doing a normal day.' Teams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom . floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets. The students' desks, backpacks and other belongings that were left . behind following the shooting were taken to the new school to make them . feel at home. Thoughts: A bus traveling from Newtown stops in front of 26 angels, representing the victims . New school: A police road block is at the entrance to the new Sandy Hook Elementary School in Monroe . Arrival: Students walk into the former Chalk Hill School, a disused school refurbished for the students . Security: Police officers wait outside the school to welcome students and check parents' IDs . Several signs welcoming the students to their new school were . posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly . residential neighborhood. One said 'Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,' while a similar sign added 'You are in our prayers.' On Wednesday, the students and their . families were welcomed at an open house at their new school, and students . received gift boxes with toys inside and shared joyful reunions with . teachers. One father, Vinny Alvarez, thanked his third-grade daughter's teacher, Courtney Martin, who protected the class by locking her classroom door and keeping the children in a corner. 'Everybody there thanked her in their own way,' he said. Of his eight-year-old daughter, Cynthia, he added: 'I'm not worried about her going back. The fear kind of kicks back in a little bit, but we're very excited . for her and we got to see many, many kids today. The atmosphere was very . cheerful.' 'New old principal': Donna Page, left, has stepped in as acting school principal after Dawn Hochsprung, right, was killed at the school. Ms Page said she felt compelled to come out of retirement to step in . On Wednesday, numerous police officers on guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about seven miles from the old school, and told reporters to stay away. 'I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,' Monroe police Lt. Keith White said. Acting . Sandy Hook principal Donna Page wrote on the school's website: 'Be . assured that the towns of Monroe and Newtown are working night and day . to ensure the facility is safe, secure and fully operational for our . return.' She took on the role after the . elementary school's principal Dawn Hochsprung was killed in the attack . and parents are now calling Ms Page the 'new old principal' as she led . the school for 14 years before retiring in 2010.

Never forget: One of the many memorials for the 20 Sandy Hook students killed in Newtown on December 14 along with six teaching staff . School superintendent Janet Robinson said the decision to re-name the new school as Sandy Hook Elementary School was taken by the teachers from the previous school . There had been concern about who would lead the school, parent Karen Dryer told ABC News. 'We got a voicemail from Donna . reintroducing herself and saying that when she heard [about the . shooting] she knew it was the calling that she needed to come out of . retirement and take the position of head of school,' Dryer said. 'I started crying when I heard the message. It's still emotional. It was such a blessing and such an amazing relief because it was like, ""Oh my, now we can breathe. They're going to be okay"".' Robinson . announced on Wednesday that the former Chalk Hill Middle School in . Monroe had been renamed after a decision was taken by staff from the . previous Sandy Hook school. 'That's who they are,' she said. 'They're the Sandy Hook family.'

President Barack Obama holds his shave ice as he greets people outside Island Snow yesterday . Robinson added that renaming the Chalk Hill school will allow staff and students to keep 'their identity and a comfort level'. The . school where the shootings occurred remains closed and guarded by . police. Newtown officials haven't decided yet on the building's future. Teachers are returning as well, and . some have already been working on their classrooms. At some point, all . those will be honored, but officials are still working out how and when . to do so, Robinson said. 'Everyone was part and parcel of getting as many kids out of there safely as they could,' she said. 'Almost everybody did something to . save kids.

"Newark Mayor Cory Booker on Saturday formally announced he's in the race to finish the U.S. Senate term of the late Frank Lautenberg. The 44-year-old Democrat made his candidacy official at a news conference Saturday in Newark, New Jersey's largest city. He was joined by former U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley, a former pro basketball player who for 18 years held the seat Booker is seeking. Bradley, who endorsed Booker, called him 'the right person for the right office at the right time.' Running: Newark Mayor Cory Booker announces his plans to run for the U.S. Senate seat that opened with the death of Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) during a news conference in Newark, N.J. on Saturday . Booker began raising money for a Senate run even before Lautenberg, who died Monday, announced retirement plans in February. He had raised $1.9 million by the end of the last reporting period in March. Reps. Frank Pallone and Rush Holt are also planning to enter the Democratic primary. Booker is considered the early front-runner. Pallone, 61, had $3.7 million in his campaign coffers at the end of March and has deep union support. Holt, 64, a former research physicist, had $800,000 on hand. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, announced this week that there would be party primaries Aug. 13 and a special general election Oct. 16th. Moving on up:  Booker, 44, is currently serving in his second term as mayor. At right is former Sen. Bill Bradley . The only Republican running so far is Steve Lonegan, a former Bogota mayor who runs the New Jersey office of Americans for Prosperity. Booker, 44, has 1.4 million followers on Twitter - or five for every resident of the city where he's the mayor. He tweets frequently, answering questions about city services, posting about his workouts and, perhaps most often, trying to provide inspiration. Networker: Booker's critics in Newark see him as an ambitious interloper who spends too much of his time outside the city . He's frequently gotten public attention, from staging a hunger strike to protest drug-dealing to rescuing a woman from a burning home last year. His life story is also captivating. He grew up in Harrington Park as the son of civil rights activists who were among the first black executives at IBM, went to Stanford, was a Rhodes Scholar, earned a law degree from Yale and took a job with the Urban Justice Center, which provides legal and other services to the vulnerable. He also moved to a public housing complex in Newark. Booker started fundraising for a 2014 . Senate campaign after announcing he would not run against Christie for . governor, citing his desire to finish his term in Newark. The term . expires in June 2014, meaning if he wins the Senate election he'll go . back on his word. Booker's critics in Newark see him as an ambitious interloper who spends too much of his time outside the city. According . to a Senate campaign filing made in May, Booker has brought in $1.3 . million for 90 speeches he has given around the country since 2008. His . campaign says he has donated the majority of that money to charities . that serve Newark. Booker's campaign has said that the networking he does ultimately helps the city. In . 2010, he was seated next to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a . dinner during a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. Two months later, . Zuckerberg announced a $100 million donation to improve education in . Newark.","44-year-old Democrat made his candidacy official in Newark, New Jersey's largest city .

"High earner: Danny Simpson is pictured getting into his white Audi R8 in Manchester city centre earlier this year . A Premier League footballer facing a driving ban told magistrates he could not afford a chauffeur - despite earning a reported £10,000 per week. Newcastle United defender Danny Simpson was expected to have his licence taken away after being caught doing 48mph in a 30mph zone. The 24-year-old defender already had nine points in his licence but pleaded that a ban would cause him 'exceptional hardship'. Despite being given a further four points he did not have his licence taken away immediately under the 'totting up' procedure because his lawyer announced that he would be appealing. Pleading for leniency, the footballer told Newcastle Magistrates' Court yesterday he could be sold by his club and that fears for his baby daughter's health had caused tension between him and his girlfriend Stephanie. Standing in the dock he revealed how his daughter Skye has just been . released from intensive care after being born three months premature. He said the baby suffers from a . bowel disorder which requires regular medical attention - meaning he has . to make emergency dashes to hospital. He told the court: 'It's been tough for both of us. Our . baby girl came out of hospital a few weeks ago but then she caught a . virus and had to go back in. 'She came out on Friday but we have to take her to hospital at least twice a week. 'She's still only seven and a half pounds and has problems feeding.' He added: 'She has problems feeding. My partner can't just get up in the morning and feed her and take me to training. 'With everything going on we have . been arguing a lot, there's things we need to work on but it's not about . us. It's about our little girl.' 'Exceptional hardship': Danny Simpson, pictured here in action for Newcastle, told the court he could not afford a chauffeur. He earns a reported £10,000 per week . When asked by prosecutor Fiona Varley . if he could not hire a chauffeur if he lost his licence, Simpson replied: 'I don't see a . chauffeur as an option because they cost a lot of money. 'I'd have to rely on teammates and taxis. I earn less money than most Premiership players although I am on good money.' Simpson's barrister Michael Conlon later . put it to him that he's no Wayne Rooney in terms of his salary. He replied: 'No I'm not. The money I've got I want to invest for the . future'. He was caught by a speed camera . doing 48mph in a 30mph zone in his Audi near the club's training ground . on April 13 this year. The right-back, from Ponteland, Newcastle, admitted the charge, but claimed 'exceptional hardship'. The court heard the footballer has nine points on his licence including an offence of speeding in May 2008. Magistrates gave him four points for the speeding offence - giving him 13 in total. Drivers with 12 points usually lose their licence - unless they can show 'exceptional hardship'. Simpson was also ordered to pay a fine of £333, prosecution costs of £30 and a victim surcharge of £15. He was given a six-month driving ban which was suspended pending an appeal to the crown court.","Newcastle star Danny Simpson escapes immediate ban after launching appeal .

"The U.S. Department of Justice has offered major news organizations a chance to sit down with Eric Holder, the embattled attorney general, for a briefing a Q-and-A session about his agency's intrusive surveillance of reporters, but there is one catch: The entire session must be 'off the record,' meaning reporters couldn't write anything at all about it. Most of the media outlets invited to the meeting have announced that they're boycotting it, including the Associated Press and Fox News - the two whose phone records and emails were secretly seized as part of DOJ investigations into national security leaks. And Brad Woodhouse, the communications director for the Democratic National Committee, is angry. He tweeted Thursday that President Barack Obama asked Holder 'to review how leak investigations are done but some in the media refuse to meet with him.' That, Woodhouse said, '[k]ind of forfeits your right [to] gripe.' Cue the outrage, which came equally from journalists on the political right and left. Brad Woodhouse, the Americans United for Change spokesman who now flacks for the Democratic National Committee, didn't make any friends in the media on Thursday . Woodhouse started the fracas by slamming the Associated Press, Fox News, the New York Times, the Huffington Post and other news outlets that refused to attend an 'off the record' briefing with Eric Holder, the embattled attorney general . Don Surber, an editorial writer at The Daily Mail - not this news organization's print edition in London, but a daily newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia - snarked in a tweeted reply that 'forfeits your right' is 'the motto of this administration.' 'Oh, and Brad Woodhouse,' Surber followed up in a later tweet, 'your rights come from God. You cannot forfeit them.' Politico media reporter Dylan Byers was more succinct. 'Jesus, Brad,' he tweeted. Gregg Keller, the executive director of the American Conservative Union, seemed to take joy in seeing the left-leaning Politico cross swords with the Democratic Party. His tweeted response consisted of one long guffaw: 'HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.' Byers' news organization is among a list of very few that have said they will meet with the attorney general on his terms. Others include ABC News, the Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and the LA Times and Chicago Tribune, which share a Washington bureau chief in common. Politico's Dylan Byers, who reports on the media, is on a first-name basis with the top Democratic communicator but didn't like what he heard . Buzzfeed's Andrew Kaczynski slapped back, referring to the Department of Justice's now-scandalous seizure of phone records and emails from AP and Fox News journalists . 'TV's Andy Levy,' as he's introduced each night on the Fox News program 'Red Eye,' took a break from his daily yuk-fest to launch a serious barb in Woodhouse's direction . CNN, CBS News, Reuters, McClatchy, The New York Times and The Huffington Pot have joined Fox News and The Associated Press in refusing to attend. The Washington Post's agreement to meet with Holder has raised eyebrows in the nation's capital, but Post executive editor Marty Baron defended his decision on his newspaper's media blog. 'I prefer that any meeting be on the record,' Baron said. But 'journalists routinely participate in off-the-record sessions, whether they prefer those conditions or not, and then continue to report on events. 'I am going to this meeting in order to represent our interests as journalists and to raise our concerns. I’ll also listen to what the Attorney General has to say. I trust that our journalists will report on this as vigorously as they would any other subject. Ron Fournier, the editorial director at National Journal and a respected voice inside the DC beltway, took isdue with how Woodhouse suggested government should balance the press's First Amendment protections with national security issues . Is Woodhouse right? Journalists do meet with sources for 'off the record' conversations all the time ... There's the rub: Reporters set the terms. Sources can't force journalists to listen -- something he thinks an experienced political spokesman should know . Andrew Kaczynski, a BuzzFeed Politics journalist who is a widely acknowledged master of reporting on political archival videos, connected the DOJ's request for secret meetings with its equally secretive snooping on the AP and Fox News. If Holder and his staff want reactions from journalists, he tweeted, 'I suppose they can just find how they feel via subpoenaed email and phone records.' The Daily Caller's house blogger, Sean Medlock - a conservative humorist who writes under the pseudonym 'Jim Treacher,' was quick to pour salt in Woodhouse's wounds. 'Notice how people on both sides of the aisle are pointing out how dumb that is?' he wrote. 'You must be doing all kinds of things right.' Conservative partisans aplenty complemented journalists from left-leaning outlets like Politico and Buzzfeed. Surber is an editorial writer for that 'other' Daily Mail, the newspaper in Charleston, West Virginia . Josh Earnest, the White House's principal deputy press secretary, took questions from reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday, and the topic quickly turned to Holder's attempted charm offensive aimed at journalists. 'You can understand that a meeting about concerns journalists have about the First Amendment being off the record is sort of on its face hypocritical, don’t you?' asked one reporter, according to the White House's transcript. 'No,' Earnest replied. 'I don’t actually see that. ... I don’t think there's any doubting the seriousness with which the attorney general is pursuing what he has identified and what the president has identified as a genuine priority. And we are genuinely interested in the input, the opinion, the advice, the expertise of leaders of prominent media organizations.' 'Is the President at all concerned that Holder is just under so much scrutiny at this point that it might affect his ability to get his job done?' the reporter pressed Earnest? 'Not in the least,' came his reply. New York Post columnist and Commentary magazine editor John Podhoretz sniped at the Democratic spokesman's tweet-grammar, among other thigns . The AIDS Policy Project took issue with Woodhouse and hat-tipped the New York Times for being among the first to show 'some spine' in turning the administration down flat . But reporters themselves - those who tweet, in any event - saw the White House as hypocritical and Woodhouse as foolish. 'Wow,' Fox News personality Andy Levy, a co-star of the nightly show Red Eye, tweeted at Woodhouse. 'It's hard to believe Americans are cynical about politics with people like you around.' National Journal editorial editor director Ron Fournier, a former Associated Press bureau chief in Washington, checked his sarcasm at the door and engaged Woodhouse seriously. 'The balance between security/liberty deserves better than your spin,' he wrote. There's 'lot of spin on both sides, Woodhouse wrote, in the his only tweeted reply to a reporter. 'Are journos not going saying they never meet with subjects off the record? Happens everyday.' 'On our terms,' Fournier snapped. 'Not the government's.' Lorem ipsum dolor . 'Jim Treacher,' The Daily Caller's pseudonymous in-house humor blogger, noted the bi-artisan tsunami and kicked Woodhouse while he was down. his Twitter avatar is a nod to President Obama's autobiographical confession that he once ate dog meat while growing up .","'Some in the media refuse to meet with' Eric Holder, wrote top DNC flack Brad Woodhouse.

"Like many real ales, its quirky name helps it to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately for a brew branded 'Top Totty', it stood out a little too much for one female Labour MP who has managed to have it banned from a House of Commons bar. Kate Green, the party's equalities spokesman, said she found the beer – which has a pump plate with a cartoon picture of a bikini-clad bunny girl – offensive, adding later that it 'demeans women'. Off the menu: The pump plate for Top Totty beer, which was banned from Parliament's bars after a complaint from Labour shadow minister Kate Green . 'Demeaning to women': Kate Green, Labour's equalities spokesman, said she found the beer offensive . Despite never having even seen the . pump in question – and the bar not receiving a single complaint – Miss . Green yesterday stood up in the Commons chamber to demand it be removed . from sale. Last night, however, her stance . provoked a backlash from men and women alike who branded her . 'humourless' and criticised her 'knee-jerk puritanism'. Slater's Ales, . meanwhile, the ale's family-run Staffordshire brewery, said the outcry . had seen its orders double. The £2.70-a-pint beer was banned from . the Strangers' Bar, where MPs can take guests, within an hour of Miss . Green's complaint. Leader of the House Sir George Young intervened to . rid Parliament of what he called 'offensive pictures'. Miss Green, MP for Stretford and . Urmston in Greater Manchester, brought up the issue at business . questions in the Commons, where she called for a debate in the House on . 'dignity at work in Parliament'. She took up parliamentary time to say: . 'I was disturbed last night to learn that the guest beer in the . Strangers' Bar is called Top Totty, and that there is a picture of a . nearly naked woman on the tap.' She said later on Twitter that it . 'demeans women'. But many MPs did not share her . outrage. Tory Tracey Crouch asked on Twitter: 'Why is a beer called Top . Totty offensive & now banned from Commons?' Furore: Ms Green called for a debate on 'dignity at work in Parliament' and asked Sir George Young to back her demands for Top Totty to be withdrawn . Sally Bercow, Commons Speaker John Bercow's wife, wrote on Twitter: 'Cannot *believe* that there's a beer called Top Totty on sale in the Commons! Outrageous - does Mr B know?' Fellow Conservative MP Nadine Dorries . tweeted: 'Westminster = sense of humour-free zone. Banning of the Top . Totty beer was weak PC decision and gives sensible pro-women advocates a . bad name.' The ale – described as 'blonde, full . bodied with a voluptuous hop aroma' – had been introduced as a guest ale . by Tory Jeremy Lefroy, MP for Stafford, where it is brewed. Mr Lefroy said: 'These guest ale slots . offer a very welcome opportunity for small independent breweries like . Slater's to reach a wider audience with their products, some of which . have cheeky names.' The ban was also denounced by Mike Nattrass, Stafford's UKIP MEP, and Claire Fox, director of think-tank the Institute of Ideas. Mr Nattrass said: 'Miss Green really . is a humourless sort.

"England are on the verge of winning their bid to host the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020 but one of Scotland, Wales and Ireland are poised to miss out on staging matches at the tournament. The Football Association's bid for Wembley to stage the climax of the event, which is being held in 13 cities across Europe, will be decided at UEFA's executive committee meeting in Geneva on Friday. Only Munich stands in Wembley's way, but the German FA (DFB) has effectively agreed to stand aside in return for support for its bid for Euro 2024. Wembley looks set to host the Euro 2020 final . FA chairman Greg Dyke will find out on Wembley whether the bid has been successful . The bids for Glasgow's Hampden Park, Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and Dublin's Aviva Stadium to host three group games and a knockout match each appears less clear-cut. Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan acknowledged it was 'highly unlikely' that all four British and Irish bids would be successful. Scotland have the most to fear after the commercial side of their bid was described as 'inadequate' in UEFA's technical reports. Regan said: 'There are four bids from the UK and Ireland and I think it is highly unlikely all four are going to be hosts. 'It's a difficult one to call. We have gone from over 30 countries down to 19 and we have read all the technical reports and there are pluses and minuses in most of them. 'It is out of our hands, but in our favour we have the history and heritage of Glasgow including some of the most famous European club and international games. Because it is the 60th anniversary of the European Championship we think history will feature very heavily in its branding. 'We believe our bid is technically strong. There were a number of concerns raised about the bid but there were concerns raised about almost all of them.' Glasgow's Hampden Park hopes to win the right to host some Euro 2020 games . The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff could stage some tournament football . The Allianz Arena in Munich is Wembley's only potential opposition to host the semi-finals and final . Wales' bid was given a boost by the UEFA technical report, which rated the Millennium Stadium third overall and in terms of income generation to UEFA. Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales, said: 'We know that we've got a very strong bid. We also know that the Millennium Stadium was third ranked as far as the income generation to UEFA, based, of course, across the capacity and hospitality offering that we have in the city. 'We've done all we can. 'I've gone about our political campaign in a very professional manner. We've met with every single executive committee member and we've presented our case to all of them. I've written now, probably, three times to them. 'The English bid, the Welsh bid, the Scottish bid, the Irish bid - they're all strong bids. 'The issue now is about the politics behind it and it's whether or not the British are perceived, with Scotland, England and Wales all bidding, as having too many in what some still regard as one country.' UEFA's 17 executive members will vote on the 13 host cities, but if their countries are involved they will not be allowed to take part. It means 15 members can vote for the host city for the final, but only eight members initially in the vote for the group stage hosts. It is expected that votes will be done on a 'ranking' basis, with members ranking their top four venues in terms of preference.","Wembley and Allianz Arena in Munich the only cities in the running to host the semi-finals and finals .

"England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate hopes UEFA's insistence on an earlier 5:45pm kick-off for the first leg of their European Championship play-off against Croatia will not impact on fans being able to get to Molineux. The Young Lions finished top of Group 1, undefeated with nine wins from their 10 matches conceding just two goals and so were among the seeds for the play-off draw. The Football Association had requested the fixture, which takes place 24 hours after England's Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino at Wembley, kick off at the normal slot of 7:45pm evening slot. Gareth Southgate hopes supporters will still turn up for England's clash against Croatia despite the early start . However, governing body UEFA ruled all matches must start no later than 6:45pm Central European Time to avoid clashes with any of the other senior ties elsewhere in Europe - which include Netherlands versus Kazakhstan, Italy versus Azerbaijan and Wales against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Despite the somewhat awkward scheduling, Southgate hopes England supporters will nevertheless be able to make it to Wolves, with tickets priced at £10 and £5 for concessions. 'It is a very important game for us and I am delighted Wolves have agreed to host it. Molineux is a special stadium with fantastic fans, and it would be great to a get a big crowd to support the team against strong opposition,' Southgate said. 'We would have preferred to kick-off later, but I hope that supporters from across the Midlands will still be able to get to the game as we look to qualify for next summer's finals in the Czech Republic.' England will play the second leg away to Croatia, who edged Group 5 ahead of the Ukraine, on Tuesday October 13.","Coach Gareth Southgate hopes fans still turn up in their droves .

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke will back moves to bring video replays in to help referees for key decisions such as awarding penalties. Dyke is uncertain about FIFA president Sepp Blatter's idea to allow managers a number of challenges to referees' decisions but believes video replays should be brought in. The FA has a powerful voice as it has one of the eight votes on the International FA Board (IFAB), the game's law-making body, along with Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and FIFA, which has four votes. The IFAB is due to discuss proposals in March. Greg Dyke agrees with Sepp Blatter that referees should get to use video replays to get decisions right . FA chairman Greg Dyke doesn't think a challenge system is the best way forward, unlike the FIFA proposals . Dyke told Sky Sports News: 'I for instance would allow a referee to go straight to the cameras [replay] for a penalty but you can't do that for every decision or the match would never finish. 'You don't want to throw the game away - you have seen in rugby where referees hardly make a decision about tries now, that wouldn't be a good idea for soccer but I do think use of technology should be considered carefully. 'In 10 years' time I think we will look back and think ""wasn't it quaint we didn't use technology to help make certain decisions"".' Asked about Blatter's idea for allowing challenges by coaches, Dyke added: 'I'm not sure about managers being able to throw in the towel and say 'we want to challenge that'. Sepp Blatter has announced his intention to run again as FIFA President at the age of 79 next year . 'I do think the laws on technology will change but it will take time and we have to do it slowly, try certain things and see if it works because you could disrupt the game completely if you are not careful.' Meanwhile, Dyke reiterated his view that it is 'a mistake' for Blatter to stand for a fifth term in office but did not back the one other person who has said he will stand for FIFA president, the French former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne. Dyke said: 'I think it's a mistake, I don't think he should be standing. He stood last time on the basis that he would not be standing again. He is 78 and will be 82 or 83 when the term finishes and it always good to let younger people have their time. 'The FA would like to see another candidate and a proper competition. The FA will decide who it supports at a later stage if we think there is a serious candidate but he [Blatter] is probably going to win if anybody stands anyway.' England were unable to sell out Wembley against Norway and face another low attendance for San Marino . Dyke also said the pressure that had been building on England manager Roy Hodgson had been totally lifted by the 2-0 win in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland. 'You could feel the pressure building up on Roy and that one result has killed it. It was a very good performance and our younger players played very well in what was the hardest match in the group. 'We now have a very good chance go to France with a young side and hopefully do well.' Dyke admitted that England's next home match against San Marino would be 'a hard sell' to fans, but added: 'It would have been a much harder sell if we had not won in Switzerland. San Marino's a hard sell at the best of times.'","Greg Dyke supports replays for officials .

"Controversial: Women can now buy a morning-after pill that works for up to five days after sex - without having to see a GP. This picture is posed by a model . Women can now buy a morning-after pill that works for up to five days after sex – without having to see a GP. From today, any woman aged 18 or over will for the first time be able to buy the powerful medication – called EllaOne –from certain branches of the Co-operative Pharmacy. But campaigners say that because it can be taken so long after conception it is an early form of abortion. There are also concerns that it will encourage unprotected sex as women will see it as a ‘safety net’ – leading to higher rates of promiscuity and sexually transmitted infections. EllaOne can be taken longer after sex than the conventional morning-after pill – which works for three days – and is up to twice as effective at preventing pregnancies. Until now it has only been possible to get EllaOne with a prescription from a GP – or from an obscure London-based website which also sells Viagra and weight-loss drugs. But from today it will be on sale for £30 in some 40 Co-op branches in southern England and Wales in areas with high rates of unwanted pregnancies. It works by thickening the entrance of the womb, preventing sperm from entering and swimming up to fertilise the egg if taken in the first day or so after sex. In addition, it changes the womb’s lining, meaning that if the pill is taken up to five days after sex, a fertilised egg cannot implant itself and develop into a foetus. But Norman Wells, director of the charity Family Education Trust, described it as an early method of abortion, and said there was no evidence that these sorts of pills reduced unwanted pregnancies. ‘Instead, young people in particular have been lulled into a false sense of security, taken a more casual attitude to sex, and become exposed to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections,’  he added. Maria Macgregor, of the charity Life, said: ‘Ethical concerns around these kind of pills are often overlooked. One of the ways in which they can work, as the manufacturers themselves say, is by preventing the implantation of an already fertilised embryo. Powerful: From today, any woman aged 18 or over will for the first time be able to buy the medication - called EllaOne - from certain branches of the Co-operative Pharmacy . ‘There is even some evidence that . provision of these pills can actually worsen rates of unplanned . pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. ‘This may be due to risk-compensation, when the existence of a perceived safety net encourages less cautious behaviour.’ Jane Devenish, clinical service pharmacist at the Co-operative Pharmacy, said: ‘It is not our place to make a judgment on people’s motives or lifestyles and there can be numerous reasons for seeking medical help. ‘Its use is an emotive subject and we believe that this service will be an important step to offer women access to a wider choice of emergency contraception in a community pharmacy to enable them to make an informed decision.’ Women wanting EllaOne will be questioned by a pharmacist to check their age, and that they aren’t already pregnant or on any medication which could cause complications. If pharmacists think someone is under 18 – and they cannot provide ID to prove otherwise – they will be refused the pill, as it has not been properly tested in younger women. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, mood swings and back pain, similar to the conventional morning-after pill. Studies have shown that 0.91 per cent of women who took EllaOne became pregnant, compared with 1.68 per cent of those who took the conventional morning-after pill.","Any woman aged 18 or over .

"(Really) under construction: Capitol Hill is at a standstill, with Republicans insisting on changes to Obamacare and Democrats standing their ground but considering a sneaky tactic to break the logjam . With no end to the government shutdown in sight, Democrats in the House of Representatives are working on a strategy that would force Republicans' hand and give the Obama administration what it wants dearly: an up-or-down vote on legislation re-opening the government with no strings attached. The ploy they're exploring would mirror the unconventional – and, Republicans have claimed, sneaky – method Democrats used to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2009. Democrats hope their silver bullet is a so-called 'discharge petition,' a congressional maneuver designed to break logjams when leaders of the party in power want to shelve a bill favored by a majority of legislators in the House. The White House has demanded all week that Republicans pass a 'clean' funding resolution, free of Obamacare-related demands. The GOP has thumbed its nose at that idea, with House Speaker John Boehner relying on a modern tradition that suggests he shouldn't call a vote on a bill that a majority of his own caucus opposes. So that unadorned funding bill, unencumbered by anti-Obamacare language, sits in limbo while Boehner has maintained his demands for a shifting series of proposed . changes to the health insurance overhaul law using the federal budget as leverage. He draws complaints, meanwhile, that insist – in one of the Democrats' online ads, at least – that he's behaving like an obstinate crybaby. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama wants it his way: The White House isn't listening to suggestions that it should offer Republicans more carrot and less stick, insisting that the GOP cave on the government shutdown without negotiation . Speaker of the House John Boehner (R) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (C) are holding the line and insisting on changes to Obamacare as a condition for reopening the government. Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford (2nd-L) has become a pawn of Democrats, who will hollow out one of his bills and use it to force a vote on a funding resolution that leaves Obamacare out of the equation . Although all 200 House Democrats would vote 'aye' on a government funding bill that preserved Obamacare as-is, the 232 Republicans could easily overrule them. The White House, however, has insisted that if that funding resolution were put to a House vote, enough Republicans would defect from their leaders' hard line to end the budget stalemate that seized the administration's checkbook at 12.01am on Tuesday. Enter the discharge petition. Satisfying certain conditions would force President Obama's preferred funding bill out of committee and straight to the House floor without Boehner's approval. House Democrats need to collect the signatures of 218 House members – a plain majority of the 435 seats – even though three seats are vacant. But the fly in the ointment is a second requirement, stating that a bill must languish in committee for at least 30 days before it can be discharged to the House floor through a petition. Democrats plan to sidestep that rule with a sleight-of-hand exercise that recalls the Obamacare fight four years ago. Instead of waiting for their 'clean' resolution to ripen over 30 days, they have located another much older bill that has grown dusty since March. The Government Shutdown Prevention Act, proposed by Oklahoma Republican Rep. James Lankford, attracted only 16 co-sponsors. It proposed to keep government funding on autopilot if Congress should find itself at the end of a fiscal year without an agreement on how to move forward. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney (R) has nearly run out of new ways to say that the president wants an up-or-down vote on a 'clean' funding resolution . Origination clause: Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts ruled in 2012 that Obamacare was constitutional because it levied taxes, not penalties. But the law is still uncertain because only the House of Representatives can originate a new tax -- and Obamacare had its genesis in the Senate, in the same kind of maneuver House Democrats are working to end the shutdown stalemate . Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and George Miller of California attached a discharge petition to that bill on Friday afternoon. Miller told reporters on Friday that the two plan to scoop out its innards before it reaches the House floor, and . replace it with the bill they want Boehner to put to a vote. 'We will have a complete substitute for that language,' said Miller, talking about the long-ignored Lankford bill, 'which will be a clean continuing resolution to open up the government.' After the discharge petition sits in the House . Rules Committee for 7 days, they can make a motion on the floor to . present it for a vote. That vote could happen as soon as three days . later, on Oct. 14. Should the maneuver succeed, it would end the shutdown showdown, send Republicans away with their tails between their legs, and void their last, best chance to strip Obamacare of its immediacy and economic power. Rep. Miller boasted at a press conference that it wouldn't be hard to collect 218 signatures and move the discharge petition forward. 'We expect we can get them all in one day,' he said. But finding 18 Republicans who are willing to buck their leadership will be no easy task. Publicly defying the House speaker is usually the quickest way to backbencher status, and can sometimes cost veteran legislators their committee chairmanships. Speaker Boehner's spokesman, Brendan Buck, isn't impressed with the discharge-petition idea, although it did grease the skids for the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law in 2002 . Rep. George Miller (L) and Rep. Chris Van Hollen (R), are leading a curious Democratic charge to force John Boehner's hand and give the White House the up-or-down vote it wants . The House Republican Caucus has spoken with near-unanimity in a strategy designed to take one controversial part of the shutdown after another off the table by funding them individually. GOP members cast a total of 1,588 party-line votes and just 2 'nays' this week in a series of measures continuing funding for veterans programs, national parks, the National Institutes of Health, the Washington, D.C. government, salaries for National Guardsmen and military reservists, nutrition programs for women and children, and military paychecks. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hollowed out a veterans tax-relief bill and dropped Obamacare inside. Now House Democrats aim to do the same thing in order to move a discharge petition in less than the standard 30 days . The president has welcomed only the last bill, signing the military salary protection measure  into law two hours before the shutdown took effect. He has threatened vetos of all the others. If, somehow, Van Hollen and Miller were able to find 18 Republicans willing to rock the boat, it would mark the second time Obama's health insurance overhaul was advanced by hiding one bill inside the shell of another. The Affordable Care Act itself was passed by shoehorning language into a hollowed-out bill. It originated as a House measure called the Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009, a proposal from New York Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel to give tax credits to soldiers, sailors and Marines who wanted to buy homes. The House passed it unanimously in October 2009. By the following month, however, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had renamed the bill the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, gutted it completely, and amended it by filling the empty space with Obamacare's legislative language. Conservatives have held out hope that Reid's maneuver will ultimately prove to be Obamacare's downfall. A lawsuit from the Pacific Legal Foundation, currently pending in a federal appeals court, contends that by leaving the bill's number as the only portion of the Obamacare that originated in the House, Reid violated the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution's 'Origination Clause' states only the House can originate bills that levy taxes on the American people. The tax issue only entered the controversy in 2012 when Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that penalties associated with Obamacare's individual health insurance mandate were actually justifiable taxes. It was this feature, Roberts ruled, that made the law permissible in the first place. Some Democrats, including White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, don't care how Boehner caves, as long as he does. House Democrats including New York Rep. Steve Israel (L) have screamed at the Republican majority that they want a vote on reopening the government without clamping any restrictions on the Obamacare law. The GOP wants a delay in implementing the most crucial part of the health insurance overhaul . 'What I can tell you is they ought to just act and let the majority speak and let the bill pass,' Carney said Friday, 'and the president will sign it. However that comes about is fine with us.' But he is certain that if the president's long-awaited 'clean' funding bill comes to the House floor, it would pass despite influences from the tea-party-influenced right wing of the GOP. 'We're confident, and I think Republicans across Washington are confident, that if the Speaker put that bill on the floor, it would pass with Democratic and Republican votes,' Carney predicted.. 'And by some Republican estimates, many Republican votes.' Approximately 20 Republican House members have said publicly that they would vote to re-open the government if they had the chance, with or without changes to Obamacare. Democrats are about to learn if they are willing to put their status in the GOP leadership's pecking order where their mouths are.","House Republicans want changes to the Obamacare law as a condition of funding the federal government in the new fiscal year .

"After suffering life-changing injuries at the hands of the Boston bombers, you would think that that fateful day would be one of pain in the memories of Caroline Reinsch and Christian Williams. But the couple, who both sustained serious leg injuries, have said that it will always be one of joy - as they learned Reinsch was pregnant with their first child after she was rushed to the ER. 'Any pain or suffering I felt has been . replaced with joy,' Williams told the Boston Globe. 'Discovering that I was going to be a . father is how I'll always remember the Marathon.' Learning to move on: The couple say they will 'never quite return to 100per cent' of what they were before the Boston Marathon bombings . Reinsch, 39, and Williams, 41, who met through Williams' sister years prior, attended the marathon on April 15 to cheer for a friend. They settled beneath the flags near to the finish line. As the terrifying blast went off, Williams' legs and right hand were ripped open, and Reinsch suffered a bloody hole in her thigh and a split quad muscle. Images from the day show her being rushed away on a stretcher, while Williams is seen on the ground; she went to Faulkner Hospital and he was taken to Beth Israel. 'Is there a possibility you are pregnant?' an X-ray technician asked her when she arrived at the hospital, and she answered that no, she didn't think she was. Moving on: The couple, pictured in Boston this June, both suffered leg wounds in the blast . Content: The couple eat lunch in Copley Square by the bombing memorial site . The couple told the Globe they had been trying to conceive since last fall without any luck. When she left the hospital after 11 days, her first stop was Beth Israel, where she had an emotional reunion with her boyfriend, who was coming out of his sixth surgery. He had survived the blast but doctors were still trying to save his right leg. A few days later, her doctor called to talk over her discharge papers, the Globe reported. 'Did they give you a pregnancy test?' the doctor asked, adding that records showed a 'slight positive' for pregnancy. It was too early to tell if she was pregnant, but it looked possible, the doctor said. Flashback: Mr Williams (circled) near the marathon finish line following the blast on April 15 . Safety: Ms Reinsch is pictured on the day of the bombings, unaware she was a couple of weeks pregnant . 'You might want to take a home pregnancy test,' she added. She took one - which was positive - at home, before taking another in a hospital restroom down the hall from Williams' room. Again, it turned positive. Back in his room, she told him: 'I have something for you' - before handing over the little stick. She learned that she must have been just one or two weeks pregnant when the bomb went off. She is now more than two months along. The couple must wear leg braces and their limbs are still scarred, but Williams told the Globe that the pregnancy has changed his life and he has never felt such joy. Big surprise: Ms Reinsch's doctor told her to take a test after her discharge papers showed a 'slight positive' for pregnancy . They decided to go public with their brilliant news this weekend - Father's Day - and to share their story of life amid the tragedy of the bombings. The couple has shared their progress on a blog on their fundraising website - revealing their happiness at being reunited and their battle to get back to normality. 'The best part of the last three weeks at home had nothing to do with being home and everything to do with seeing Christian every day,' Reinsch wrote after leaving hospital. 'Seeing him graduate from hospital to rehab, from bed to walker, from walker to cane, and this past weekend…from rehab to home.'","Caroline Reinsch was just two weeks pregnant when the bombs exploded .

"A Southern California high school basketball coach has been suspended and faces accusations of mercilessly running up the score after his team won a game 161-2, one of the most lopsided scores in state history. Arroyo Valley High girls' coach Michael Anderson was suspended for two games after the victory last week against Bloomington High. Anderson said that he wasn't trying to run up the score or embarrass the opposition. His team had won four previous games by at least 70 points, and Bloomington had already lost a game by 91. Rout: Arroyo Valley High girls' coach Michael Anderson was suspended for two games after the victory last week against Bloomington High. The team posted this picture of the scoreboard after then game . 'The game just got away from me,' Anderson told the San Bernardino Sun  Friday. 'I didn't play any starters in the second half. I didn't expect them to be that bad. I'm not trying to embarrass anybody.' He says if he had it to do again, he'd have played only reserves after the first quarter, or 'I wouldn't play the game at all.' But Bloomington coach Dale Chung says Arroyo Valley used a full-court press for the entire first half to lead 104-1 at halftime. 'People shouldn't feel sorry for my team,' Chung said. 'They should feel sorry for his team, which isn't learning the game the right way.' Anderson has served one game of the suspension, a game his team won 80-19. He'll return after sitting out one more. 'He's a great X's and O's coach,' Chung said. 'Ethically? Not so much. He knows what he did was wrong.' In the first game without their banned coach, they beat Indian Springs 80-19.

"Erica Faith Hagan, 22, a psychology graduate from Kentucky, was dead on Saturday morning . A young American woman whose body was found in her Chile apartment may have been murdered, according to authorities. Erica Faith Hagan, 22, a psychology graduate from Kentucky, was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco on Saturday morning. She was working as an English instructor at a secondary school in Temuco, 700 kilometers (450 miles) south of Santiago. 'The investigation so far has shown that she had at least three wounds on her head that were caused by a blunt object,' said local prosecutor Cristian Paredes. 'That means we are looking at potential homicide.' AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the apartment. Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky this year and went to Chile in July as a teaching assistant in English. She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December. Her family were informed of her death on Sunday and are now flying out to South America.

"Tottenham's Belgian duo Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele have urged World Cup referees to give greater protection to team-mate Eden Hazard. Playmaker Hazard was given a torrid time by Algeria’s defenders before setting up the Red Devils’ winner in last week’s come-from-behind 2-1 win. Belgium’s golden generation will qualify for the last 16 with victory over Fabio Capello’s Russia in Rio on Sunday, with Felix Brych of Germany to officiate, and Dembele said: ‘Everybody knows Eden is an unbelievable talent and we also know he is going to get kicked. I hope the referees protect him a bit.’ Target: Eden Hazard was on the receiving end of some meaty challenges against Nigeria . Scare: Belgium's Eden Hazard had a scan on toe injury and missed training on Wednesday . Fierce opponents when competing against each other at club level, Belgium’s spate of Premier League superstars are learning to gel as a team under skipper Vincent Kompany. Vertonghen says Hazard could be the man to take them far in the tournament — provided the Chelsea midfielder, who plays on the left for his country, is given the chance to display his mercurial talent. ‘Eden is the kind of player who is going to get kicked and, if I was a right-back, I think maybe I would do the same,’ admitted Vertonghen. ‘He is a player who can be very dangerous.’ The Spurs defender, who gave away the penalty that handed Algeria the lead last week, is adamant his country can cope with growing expectations back home. ‘There is a lot of pressure on us and it was difficult to play against Algeria who were very defensive,’ said Vertonghen. ‘We have a lot of experience in the Champions League, Europa League, the Premier League and other top leagues but the World Cup is a bit different.’ Marouane Fellaini will again lead the line after rescuing Belgium with a 70th-minute equaliser against Algeria. All week long, his teammates have been singing the praises of the £27.5million Manchester United midfielder who had such a disappointing first season at Old Trafford. Protection: Mousa Dembele and Jan Vertonghen want to see Eden Hazard protected by referees . Mucking about: Marouane Fellaini playing with a sprinkler during a training session . Heading for a win: Marouanne Fellaini climbs to score for Belgium as pull level against Algeria on Tuesday . ‘It is a big confidence boost for Marouane of course. He is training so well, we know he is hungry,’ said Dembele. ‘You don’t know what happens over there at United. We all know he is a very good player.’ Dembele and Vertonghen can’t wait to start work under new Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino following the sacking of  Tim Sherwood. Vertonghen is understood to have fallen out with Sherwood and is targeting a top-four finish next season under the new manager. ‘I have spoken to the new manager, I think he has been in touch with a lot of the players,’ said Vertonghen, who despite speculation may now stay at White Hart Lane. ‘It was good to speak to him but he has left me to focus on the World Cup now. ‘We have all been very impressed by Southampton in the last year or two, impressed with the style they play and with their manager, so I think we made a good move to get him to Tottenham.’ Commiserations: Vincent Kompany was saddened to see England bow out of the competition so quickly . Belgium skipper Kompany, who led Manchester City to Premier League glory last term, said he was sad to see England exit the World Cup at the first hurdle. ‘The [English] players that I have as friends and that I have a lot of respect for meant I wanted them to have a good competition and I’m very saddened as much as the English fans about the exit of England,’ he said.","Chelsea forward was targeted by Algeria during Belgium's 2-1 victory .

"A mother whose conjoined twins were separated at just a few hours old spoke yesterday of her joy at their ‘amazing’ recovery. A life-threatening blockage in Rosie and Ruby Formosa’s shared intestine meant the girls had to be taken for emergency surgery the day after their birth. The delicate operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London – one of the  world’s leading centres for the procedure – took five hours, and was so successful that the sisters left hospital just two weeks later and are now ‘thriving’ at home with their parents Angela and Daniel Formosa. Scroll down to 'meet' the family . Delighted: Parents Angela and Daniel Formosa, whose conjoined twins were separated at just a few hours old spoke yesterday of their joy at their children's 'amazing' recovery. They are pictured with Rosie and Ruby . Mrs Formosa, 32, said of the girls, who are now two months old: ‘They are really well, they are putting on weight. They are normal bubbly babies who are starting to smile and cry when they want something.’ A scan before their birth revealed the babies were joined and had a low chance of survival. After a ‘textbook’ pregnancy with her first child, Lily, now five, Mrs Formosa said the discovery was a shock. The mother-of-three, from Bexleyheath, Kent, said: ‘Between 16 and 20 weeks we found that they were joined. I was shocked and I felt sad. We didn’t know what to expect until they were born – the doctors could not tell where they were connected.’ It was decided that the girls would be . delivered early, at 34 weeks, by Caesarean section at University College . Hospital in London. Worrying: A life-threatening blockage in, left to right, Rosie and Ruby Formosa's shared intestine meant the girls had to be taken for emergency surgery the day after their birth . It turned out they were joined at the abdomen and they were transferred to Great Ormond Street for surgery. Mrs Formosa discharged herself from hospital the day after her Caesarean so she could be by her babies’ bedside as they recovered. Paediatric surgeon Professor Agostino Pierro, who led the surgical team, said: ‘We are delighted with the outcome of the operation. The babies will need further treatment in the future but we expect that they will both be able to lead happy and normal lives. ‘They are now able to feed normally, they are at home with their parents and they are thriving.’ Good job: Great Ormond Street Hospital surgeon Edward Kiely and Professor Agostino Pierro hold the twins . Success: The delicate operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London - one of the world's leading centres for the procedure - took five hours. The hospital is pictured . Mrs Formosa said she and her husband, a 36-year-old taxi driver, were ‘happy and relieved’ to take them home, and were ‘incredibly grateful’ to the doctors at Great Ormond Street. ‘When I was pregnant they were saying that the survival chances were quite low,’ she said. ‘For them to have been operated on and doing so well – it is amazing.’ VIDEO: Angela and Daniel Formosa describe the tense wait as the twins were separated .","A life-threatening blockage in Rosie and .

"A judge branded Snoop Dogg a 'misogynist wretch' as he launched into a bizarre rant at the rapper while sentencing a female fan for drunkenly punching a policeman. Simone Campbell, 18, drank eight glasses of wine and 'a quantity' of Captain Morgan spiced rum on the night of a Snoop Dogg concert at Ebrington Square, Derry, in October last year. Campbell admitted punching a police officer on the ear, as well as resisting arrest as she tried to make her way home from the gig. A judge branded Snoop Dogg a 'misogynistic wretch' as he launched into a bizarre rant at the rapper . At the hearing at Derry Magistrates' Court yesterday, judge Barney McElholm took a moment to vent his views on the controversial rapper, the Belfast Telegraph reported. Giving Campbell a 12-month probation order, the judge said: 'Despite the bad behaviour espoused by his lyrics there was no excuse for this. 'Why any woman would want to go to a concert to listen to this misogynist wretch escapes me. 'Why he was allowed into the country in the first place is another matter.' Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus Jnr and is also known as Snoop Lion, was banned from the UK in 2006 after an altercation at Heathrow Airport which led to him spending a night in the cells. He was allowed back into Britain in 2010, however some of his entourage are still said to be banned from flying with British Airways. Judge Barney McElholm laid into the rapper as he sentenced a woman at Derry Magistrates' Court . His visit to Derry, part of a wider tour of the UK, was slammed by women's groups who called for the concert to be cancelled. A spokesman for Foyle Women's Aid said at the time: 'His lyrics are demeaning and they objectify women and he has a history with drugs.' Judge McElholm has a history for odd remarks during court cases, saying in 2011 that young men are too fascinated by martial arts and 'Ninja Turtles' as he sentenced a man for putting a police officer in a headlock. The late judge James Pickles was known for his colourful remarks . Judge McElholm is not the first judge to appear out of touch during a court hearing. The late judge James Pickles was well-known for his colourful remarks, particularly when is he is said to have asked a barrister: 'Who are the Beatles?' He also jailed the mother of a 10-week-old baby for six months, saying that he did not want women believing they could avoid custody by becoming pregnant. The sentence was later reduced to a probation order. In 2003, Judge Huw Daniel demanded a juror leave Mild Crown Court for wearing a shirt with the 'FCUK' logo. Once the juror had been stood down, Judge Daniel explained his actions. He told the court:  'I stood one of the jurors down. He didn't take the oath properly. 'Secondly, the mode of dress was a potential source of distraction. 'The mis-spelling of a basic Anglo Saxon word on a garment hardly dignifies the court proceedings. 'It is beyond me why anyone can think that they should wear anything like that in public, particularly in court.'","Snoop Dogg branded a 'misogynistic wretch' in bizarre rant by judge .

"Bishop, who is accused of passing classified military information to a Chinese lover 32 years his junior . U.S. officials say a 27-year-old university student from China started a relationship with a civilian defense contractor more than twice her age and then found out classified information on U.S. nuclear weaponry, missile defenses and war plans. But is she a spy? It is clear the Justice Department believes the woman's boyfriend broke the law, but the criminal complaint that outlines the charges against him never formally accuses her of any crime. It just paints a picture of a young woman who seems to be involved in espionage. A Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing says the government knows the woman's location and is continuing to investigate her role. Her identity and whereabouts haven't been released, and U.S. authorities also haven't said publicly whether they believe she is working for the Chinese government. She lives in the United States as a student on a J-1 visa, according to an affidavit the FBI filed this week by the FBI in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. Her boyfriend, Benjamin Bishop, a 59-year-old civilian defense contractor who works at Pacific Command, met the woman at a Hawaii conference on military defense issues. Scroll down for video . US Attorney Florence Nakakuni said Bishop had been charged with giving defence secrets to his Chinese lover . The counterintelligence agent . investigating Bishop said the woman may have been at the conference . specifically to meet people like Bishop, who work with and have access . to certain classified information, the affidavit said. They began an intimate, romantic . relationship in June 2011, according to the affidavit. At the time, . Bishop was working at a Pacific Command office that develops plans to . deter potential U.S. adversaries, according to his LinkedIn profile . online. Bishop is scheduled to appear in . federal court Friday for a hearing on whether he should stay in . detention while prosecutors pursue their case. Birney Bervar, Bishop's attorney, . said he planned to seek bail but wasn't optimistic he would be . successful. Bervar declined to discuss details of the case, saying he . had not yet spoken in depth to his client. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 1. The affidavit says the woman told . Bishop repeatedly she didn't want him to tell her anything classified . but continued to question Bishop about his work. Bishop, on the other hand, told her he wouldn't give her any classified information but did so anyway, the document said. Bishop, a lieutenant colonel in the . U.S. Army Reserve, is accused of telling her secrets about U.S. nuclear . weapons, missile defenses, war plans, early warning radar systems and . other issues. Last month, the woman asked Bishop . what western countries knew about a Chinese naval asset. This fell . outside the scope of Bishop's work but he conducted open source record . research for her and collected and reviewed classified information on . the topic, the affidavit said. Bishop's security clearance required . him to disclose his contacts with foreign nationals, but the affidavit . says he failed to let officials know about his relationship with the . woman. The FBI declined further comment on Tuesday. A Justice Department spokesman in Honolulu did not return a call seeking comment. Bishop was married until last year, . according to state documents in Utah. His ex-wife declined comment when . approached by The Associated Press on Tuesday at her home in Odgen, . Utah. Her neighbor, Sandra Doyle, said it . was clear Bishop was having an affair with a Chinese woman prior to the . divorce. Doyle, who said she is friends with the ex-wife, said the . girlfriend was a university student in the District of Columbia, though . she didn't know which school. Doyle said neighbors knew Bishop worked for the government in Hawaii but were unclear on his exact job. Larry Wortzel, a member of the . U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said China has used . sexual entrapment as a means to gather intelligence before and the . allegations aren't surprising. As an Army reserve officer and . defense contractor, Bishop would have received security briefings on . this and understood 'how sex may be used for intelligence targeting,' Wortzel said. Whether U.S. national security was . damaged by any of the alleged disclosures would depend on how detailed . the information was and whether the woman knew any of it was classified, . said Carl Baker, director of programs at Pacific Forum Center for . Strategic and International Studies. Information on weapons could be . harmful because it could tell a potential enemy what U.S. weapons system . can do as well as what capabilities the adversary would need to develop . to counter U.S. capabilities, he said. Bishop's position wouldn't have given him access to specifics about weapons technology, though, Baker said. Leaked details on military plans might also be detrimental. 'That's an important part, because if . you divulge enough information about the planning process, you end up . giving information that reveals a strategy and how you could counter . that strategy,' Baker said. The key issues for any trial will be Bishop's intent and the sophistication of the information he passed on, Baker said. Bishop is charged with one count of . communicating national defense information to a person not entitled to . receive it and one count of unlawfully retaining national defense . documents and plans.

"One of the men shot and killed by a 14-year-old boy during a deer-hunting trip in northeastern Oregon was the teenager's foster father, authorities revealed today. The boy, who has not been named because of his age, allegedly shot his foster father Michael Piete, 43, and Kenneth C. Gilliland, 64, at midnight on Wednesday. A hunting rifle and a revolver were used in the incident and one of the men was shot inside their cabin while the other was shot outside, Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer said. Killed: Michael Piete, 43, has allegedly been shot dead by his foster son as they took a deer hunting trip in northeastern Oregon. The boy, who is 14, also shot dead another man before trying to flee . Great outdoors: Photos of Mr Piete's Facebook page show him hunting, fishing and enjoying nature . After the shootings, he fled the cabin but accidentally shot himself in the leg. He returned to the cabin to pleading for help, but another member of the hunting party inside tied him up with duct tape and held him at gunpoint.

"Julian Assange's Wikileaks Party has come under fire after it emerged that it sent a delegation led by his father to Damascus to meet President Bashar Assad. John Shipton, father of Mr Assange, was pictured sitting alongside the Syrian dictator in a photo circulated on Twitter by the regime that was apparently taken on December 23. Mr Shipton is on the national council of the Wikileaks Party, which was set up to contest Australia's senate elections in September but polled just 0.7 per cent of the vote and gained no seats. Poor judgement? Syrian President Bashar Assad with John Shipton, the father of whistleblowing activist Julian Assange, during the visit to the war-torn country by a delegation from Australia's Wikileaks Party . Reports claimed Mr Shipton said on Syrian TV that Wikileaks plans to open a Damascus office 'to show the solidarity of the Australian people and the Wikileaks Party with the difficulties that Syria is having at the moment.' He reportedly told Syrian English-language news programme The News: 'I think that the Syrian people in their courage are an example to the rest of the world in how to resist this plague of terrorism which is sweeping the Middle East and Central Asia. 'We'll continue to expose the truth to the Australian people and to our international audience and next year we'll set up an office in Damascus.' As controversy boiled over the visit, Mr Shipton today told the Sydney Morning Herald that the visit was being used for propaganda purposes by the Assad regime, and that the delegation was not trying to side with the government. 'He [President Assad] invited us to call in and have a cup of tea and it was difficult to snub him,' he said. 'We just went along, said hello, didn't say anything much actually. If something is central to the prosperity of the west and the world and could lead to a world war, then you've got to look at it whatever way you can. 'Our commitment is to peace and the unfolding of the facts and the Syrian people, not to a particular government.' Trapped: Julian Assange waves from a window as he stands by Ecuador's foreign minister Ricardo Patino at the country's embassy in London. The Wikileaks Party was set up to allow him to run for the Australian Senate . Matt Watt, the Wikileaks Party's national secretary, said the visit was a 'fact-finding, rebuilding, reconstruction and peace mission', but he admitted that the regime's help had been sought in gaining access. According to reports, the delegation toured the sights of Damascus and met with Antiochian Orthodox patriarch John X, Syrian prime minister Wael al-Halqi, deputy foreign minister Faisal Miqdad and the speaker of the Syrian People's Assembly Jihad al-Laham. 'They have had to be very careful on this trip,' Mr Watts told The Australian. 'Obviously you can't just walk across the border, so it is an organised trip with the government to gain access, and that's put some restrictions on them.' Mr Shipton said that he and his fellow travellers had also met with opposition figures, but he admitted that 'of course people are going to use you.' 'What they do with our visit in Syria, you can't stop. You have no control over that,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Wikileaks distanced itself from the actions of its political offshoot, saying on its official Twitter account today: 'Peace brokering a good idea, but (it was) obvious (the) meeting would be spun without care. 'Did not know or approve.'","John Shipton seen alongside Syrian dictator in photo circulated on Twitter .

"A Missouri woman is to face court this week for bringing her new born child to the courthouse for jury duty because she was breastfeeding. Laura Trickle, of Lee’s Summit, delivered her daughter Axel in March and was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in August. She asked to be exempt from appearing, as she was breastfeeding, but received notice that she must report to court to fullfill her civic obligation and serve jury duty, according to the Kansas City Star. In limbo: Laura Trickle was charged with contempt after bringing her newborn baby Axel to jury duty because she was breastfeeding. Now she might wait a year to find out the judge's verdict . Trickle was told to either arrange for child care or bring somebody with her who could care for the child during jury selection. On September 3, she appeared for jury duty with her child, but according to the ensuing court order, she ‘willfully and contemptuously appeared for jury service with her child and no one to care for the child’. Trickle will now face Jackson County Presiding Judge Marco Roldan on Thursday at a hearing at the Jackson County Courthouse downtown. Those who skip jury duty can be found in contempt of court and ordered to pay a fine of up to $500 and maybe even be arrested. The mother insists she is not a criminal, saying ‘I’ve never even had a speeding ticket’. Before making his verdict: Jackson County Presiding Judge Marco Roldan said he would wait to see if legislators offer a jury duty exemption for breastfeeding mothers . Breastfeeding women are exempted from jury duty in 12 states. New . legislation introduced by a St. Joseph physician and state senator, Rob . Schaaf, would exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty across . Missouri. Such an exemption would help encourage more Missouri mothers to breastfeed, said state Sen. Rob Schaaf of St. Joseph. ‘Babies . who are breastfed generally are healthier, are less likely to have . certain health problems and will cost the state less resources,’ said . Schaaf to the Kansas City Star. ‘Jury duty is a roadblock to that.’ Missouri statutes allow for exemptions when a juror would face ‘an undue or extreme physical or financial hardship’. 'Not a criminal': Laura Trickle says she has never even had a speeding ticket . Judge Roldan said he has on some occasions excused potential jurors who just had a death in the family, or teachers who were scheduled to give midterm exams. While keeping some jurors, he often has sought to accommodate their needs, he said. One juror who told Roldan he could not sit for extended periods received a seat in the back row of the jury box, where he was free to stand occasionally, even during testimony. Some health advocates appreciate the accommodations the court makes. ‘Providing . a room for mothers to breastfeed or pump is good, and we very much . encourage that,’ said Anne Biswell of the Mother & Child Health . Coalition, which promotes wellness in the Kansas City area. Court date: June 6 next year is the date set by the judge at Jackson County Courthouse (pictured) to review the case . Roldan, while declining to discuss Trickle’s specific case, said breastfeeding Jackson County mothers have the option of using occasional breaks during jury service to use a private room to pump milk and store it, feeding it to their children later. They are also allowed to bring a caregiver to the courthouse to watch the child during trial proceedings and then take the child to a private room to breastfeed. But Trickle said she has no child care options, and stays at home while Axel’s father works. About 1,000 potential jurors report downtown every month, but the number of judges needing juries varies, and sometimes fewer jurors may be assigned to cases. ‘About 50 per cent are not even going to go upstairs to a case,’ Roldan told the Star. Trickle is one of two breastfeeding Jackson County women who recently have faced possible penalties for not serving jury duty. It’s not that she isn’t willing, she said. ‘The issue is the timing,’ she said. ‘I just can’t do it right now.’","Laura Trickle, of Lee’s Summit, was breastfeeding when she was called for jury duty in August .

"A police chief has come under fire for threatening a man who accused the department of spending too much time worrying about minor drug offenders in a Facebook post. Reuben Santiago, interim police chief in Columbia, South Carolina, told resident Brandon Whitmer that his complaint - that local police were too concerned with 'stoners' and should focus on more serious crime because '(marijuana) will be legal here one day anyway' - left the officer with 'reasonable suspicion' he might be a 'criminal' too. 'Thank you for sharing your views and giving us reasonable suspicion to believe you might be a criminal,' the post said. 'We will work on finding you.' The post, published from the official Columbia Police Department (CPD) Facebook account, was quick to cause chaos on the page and be deleted. But followers began attacking the department for making unnecessary threats. Trouble: Reuben Santiago, interim police chief in Columbia, South Carolina told, threatened to hunt a Facebook user down after the man questioned police priorities . Now deleted: This is the post that started the Facebook fiasco. Followers were quick to call the police response an unnecessary threat . But despite the drama, Chief Santiago went back online to announce that the original police post had indeed been written by him. 'This is Interim Chief Santiago posting, I was just notified that one of my staff members deleted my post,' he wrote. 'I put everyone on notice that if you advocate for the use of illegal substances in the City of Columbia then it's reasonable to believe you MIGHT also be involved in that particular activity. 'Threat? Why would someone feel threaten (sic) if you are not doing anything wrong? Apply this same concept to gang activity or gang members. 'You can have have gang tattoos and advocate that life style, but that only makes me suspicious of them, I can't do anything until they commit a crime. 'So feel free to express yourself, and I will continue to express myself and what we stand for. 'I am always open to hearing how our citizens feel like we can be effective in fighting all crime.' While attempting to quell the uproar, Santiago only fueled it. 'I'm smoking weed as we speak!' one person posted. 'Come find me...Disregard the murderers and rapists, us pot smokers are the real threat.' Making a major backtrack, Santiago told The State newspaper he had posted his reply late at night while watching television. He later sent an apology to the first man and said he has since learned a lesson in what not to say on Facebook. Interesting twist: After the original post had been deleted, Columbia Police Chief Reuben Santiago went back on Facebook and posted this message, which seemed to only make matters worse . In a statement released to media, the CPD's public information officer admitted the Chief had written the comments himself, but said they had been misunderstood. 'Chief was trying to say that he puts would-be-criminals on notice,' he said. 'If you commit a crime or plan to commit one, CPD will work hard to investigate and press charges according to the law. 'It's easy for social media posts to be misunderstood.' Whitmer's complaint was made in response to a post published by the CPD promoting their recent seizure of '$40,000 of marijuana' and arrest of its owner. Whitmer commented that police time would be better spent tracking down 'the people shooting people in [local district] Five Points instead of worrying about a stoner that's not bothering anyone'.","Police in Columbia, South Carolina, promoted a recent seizure of '$40,000 worth of marijuana' on their Facebook page .

"Claims: Scotland Yard were set to interview the solider about his alleged claims over Diana's death before he allegedly left the country . The SAS soldier who made astonishing claims Princess Diana was murdered by special forces has apparently fled Britain just days before he is set to be questioned by police. The former sniper, known only as soldier N, is said to have left the country as Scotland Yard launches a new investigation into the Princess' death. He allegedly told his wife that a member of an elite unit shone a light in her chauffeur's face causing him to crash in August 1997. The . wife claimed her husband had told her the 'hit' had been . instructed by someone in the  royal inner circle because they did not approve of Diana's relationship with Fayed. Soldier N was due to meet Scotland Yard's DCI Philip Easton but is understood to have left the country on Monday or Tuesday. A source close to the investigation told The Sunday People: 'Soldier N is key to this inquiry as he is the person who made the claims about Diana's murder. 'Pressure on him has been mounting since the original story broke last month. He was aware police wanted to interview him.' It is thought Soldier N may be have travelled to the United Arab Emirates while his partner and her children are still at their home in Hereford. Scotland Yard reportedly decided to review the case, 16 years after Diana's death in a Paris underpass, after interviewing the woman who insists her former husband's claims were true. She alleged a white car and . motorbike were involved in the plot which enlisted the services of one . of Soldier N's former SAS colleagues. When asked by officers why she hadn't reported her husband's theory earlier the woman said she had been sworn to secrecy. In a dramatic twist, the investigation could also unearth recordings of the . crash after security experts revealed Diana's phone was bugged. Soldier N is also alleged to have stolen money while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Crash: Soldier N allegedly told his wife about the 'hit' after he had taken Prince William on an advanced driving course in 2008 . His wife reportedly told officers that when he returned from a tour of duty in Iraq in 2004, she was asked to pay 13,000 Iraqi dinars (around £7,000) into his personal bank account. The conversation took place in 2011 but the couple have since separated. When the woman quizzed her husband . about his theory he reportedly told her the SAS had been following Diana . and Dodi Al Fayed, who was also killed in the accident. The . forthcoming investigation, which was prompted by the claims, will look into allegations from a  source in . the UK security industry that GCHQ was remotely taping Diana and Dodi up . until the moment of the crash. A source told a national newspaper said Diana was a prime . intelligence target, GCHQ operatives 'would have wanted and had the . capacity to listen live to the conversations in the car as it sped away . from the Ritz.'. Couple: Diana and Dodi pictured on CCTV at the Ritz Hotel in Paris just hours before the fatal crash . At the time IRA terrorists were driving vehicles packed with explosives around the UK in plots to blow up city centres - and senior military commanders had to find a way to thwart them. One source said: 'The SAS had to develop a series of tactics for every eventuality. In the 1980s the IRA were driving bombs to targets around Britain.' Diana, . 36, Fayed, 42, and their driver Henri Paul, 41, were killed in the . crash in 1997. The Princess' bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was seriously . injured. Al Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed has . always asserted the pair's deaths were the result of a planned murder . at the hands of the British Establishment and MI6, and similarly claims a . white Fiat was involved in the crash but has never been traced.","Solider N was due to be interviewed by Scotland Yard for new investigation .

"Denied: Leslie Van Houten was denied parole for the 20th time 44 years after going to prison for the LaBianca murders . Charles Manson's youngest follower is today set to appeal for parole for the 20th time, four decades after she helped participate in the murders which shocked America when she was just a teenager. Leslie Van Houten faces fierce opposition to her bid for freedom, but she insists she is sorry for her crimes and is now a changed woman. At the hearing at the California Institution for Women, a prosecutor will argue that the Tate-LaBianca murders of 1969 were so shocking that Van Houten must not be released from prison. Her attorney, Michael Satris, said Van Houten plans to speak to the parole board on her own behalf, explaining that she has become a different person dedicated to doing good works. 'She is living a life of amends for her crime on a daily basis,' Mr Satris said. 'Everything she does now is to be of service and benefit to the world.' He said Van Houten's value system is the complete opposite of 1969 when 'she was following the teachings of a false prophet.' Van Houten has been commended for her work helping elderly women inmates at the California Institution for Women where she and other followers of Manson women have been incarcerated. She earned two college degrees while in custody. Other members of Manson's murderous 'family' have lost multiple bids for parole. One former Manson follower, Bruce Davis, was approved for parole last year only to have California's governor Jerry Brown veto the plan in March. Fresh-faced: Van Houten, right, enters court in 1969 with Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel . Ringleader: Charles Manson led the three young women in a spate of vicious murders in 1969 . The Tate-La Bianca killings became among the most notorious murders of the 20th century and continue to draw public attention. Van Houten was convicted of murder and conspiracy for her role in the slayings of wealthy grocers Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. They were stabbed to death in August 1969, one night after Manson's followers killed actress Sharon Tate along with celebrity hairdresser Jay Sebring, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, filmmaker Voityck Frykowksi and Steven Parent. Van Houten did not participate in the Tate killings, but went along the next night when the LaBiancas were slain in their home. She was portrayed by her defence lawyers as the youngest and least culpable of those convicted with Manson, a young woman from a good family who had been a homecoming princess and showed promise until she became involved with drugs and was recruited into Manson's murderous cult. Smiling: Van Houten at a previous parole hearing in May 2002; this is her 20th parole denial . Van Houten was convicted along with Manson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkle - they were all sentenced to death, but their sentences were reduced to life in prison when the death penalty was briefly outlawed in the 1970s. Atkins died of cancer in prison. Krenwinkle has been denied parole repeatedly and Manson, now 78, has stopped coming to parole hearings, saying that prison is his home and he wants to stay there. Manson's lieutenant, Charles 'Tex' Watson, was convicted separately and has been denied parole many times. Decades ago, one of the original prosecutors in the case, Stephen Kay, said there would come a time when Van Houten would be ready for parole. But parole officials, while giving her high marks for her accomplishments in prison, have refused her bids for freedom 19 times. Her last hearing was in 2010 at which she said, 'I apologise for the pain I caused.'","Leslie Van Houten seeks release from prison 44 years on from murder trial .

"He has one of the most glamorous day jobs imaginable and rarely has it looked more appealing than this week. Twelve months ago, Rory McIlroy said that he had seen enough lawyers to last him a lifetime. So you can imagine what it has been like sitting in legal offices during the past six weeks poring over documents relating to his bitter dispute with his former management company, Horizon Sports. ‘Annoying and frustrating,’ is how the 25-year-old summed up being forced to sit out the first two events of the European Tour’s Final Series in China. It will be costly too, if he finishes on the losing side in the Dublin courtroom showdown, scheduled for February. Rory McIlroy signs the guest book at the official opening of the new clubhouse at Jumeirah Golf Estates . McIlroy is back on the golf course after a distracting few weeks focusing on a court case . Those in Ireland who have been following the various machinations closely estimate he could be as much as £25million worse off if the worst-case scenario unfolds. ‘Of course I’m annoyed that it is still going on but there’s nothing I can do about it,’ McIlroy said. ‘We tried our best a few weeks ago to come to some sort of resolution and it didn’t work out. So yeah, it’s not the best thing to be going through but it will be over and done with a good bit before I have to go down Magnolia Lane (for the Masters) in April. As long as I’ve got a clear head going there, I’m happy with that.’ While he was away McIlroy was formally declared the winner of the Race to Dubai. And, free of legalese here for a few days at least, he will hope to add the season-finale DP World Tour Championship title to his Race win, as he did in 2012, and be handed both prizes at Sunday’s presentation. ‘I’m still very motivated to go out this week and perform well,’ he said. ‘There would be no point me showing up if I thought I had already won something and was just here for a good time. It has been such a fantastic year I want to round things off and get two trophies rather than one.’ 'Team McIlroy' - Caddie JP Fitzgerald, coach Michael Bannon, McIlroy and sports scientist Stephen McGregor . McIlroy in action during the pro-am event prior to the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai earlier this week . The blisters on McIlroy’s right hand are evidence of how hard he has been working since arriving in Dubai a week ago, as was a wonderful stroke he played on Monday. The tour had organised for some of the leading players to replicate iconic shots in the tournament’s history. They all got to try Henrik Stenson’s extraordinary three wood to the par five 18th a year ago that saw him wrap up the Race to Dubai with a tap-in eagle three. No-one got close. Well, not until Rory casually coaxed yet another majestic fairway wood shot from 260 yards to within an arm’s length of the hole. It underlined his liking for an Earth course where he has compiled some jaw-dropping figures. He is 74 under par for his 20 rounds of golf here, with nothing worse than a 72 — and only one of those. In the other 19 rounds, he has had five 66s, five 67s, two 68s, two 69s, and five 71s. And maybe those six weeks away will work in his favour. ‘I’m sure there are some tired minds and bodies among the players who competed in the last three events in China and Turkey and I am hoping to take advantage,’ McIlroy said. He has also underlined his commitment to European golf. As the new host of the Irish Open, he has persuaded charismatic American Rickie Fowler to pitch up at Royal County Down next May. And the Scottish Open in July will definitely form part of McIlroy’s schedule in the build-up to the defence of his Open title at St Andrews. All good news surrounding the world No 1, then, apart from that ugly legal battle. Let’s hope good sense prevails between now and next February, because the one certain loser if the combative lawyers get to stand on their feet will be the game itself.

"A one-legged Paralympian known for his hilarious Halloween getups that utilize his disability has bested himself with an amazing flamingo costume. Using a bright pink body suit, similarly colored crutches, and a slipper made to look like the tropical bird’s head, Josh Sundquist does a striking impression of a flamingo. But only when he flips upside down. Scroll down for video . Hilarious: Cancer survivor, motivational speaker, and Paralympic athlete Josh Sundquist has topped his previous funny Halloween costumes with this awesome flamingo disguise . Tradition: Sundquist has gotten lots of media coverage for his costumes before, like his half eaten gingerbread man in 2010 and the leg lamp from A Christmas Story in 2012 . The Paralympic ski racer uses his athleticism in this year’s costume. When he inverts his body, his leg looks just like the long neck and curved bill and head of the bird. In 2010, Sundquist made his national debut as a Halloween champion as a half-eaten gingerbread man. Accomplished: After losing his leg during a battle with childhood bone cancer, Sundquist trained hard and became a Paralympic athlete. He has since become a motivational speaker, bestselling author, and founder of a social media site for amputees . In 2012, he lit up Halloween as the famous leg lamp from A Christmas Story. In addition to his Sundquist Halloween costumes, Sunquist’s trademark is his remarkable story of survival and triumph over disability, one he goes into a length on his website. Diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer at age 9, Sunquist was given a 50 percent chance of survival. But he survived and after losing his leg to amputation he’s put his disability to good use: he’s now a motivational speaker, a member of the US Amputee Soccer Team, bestselling author, YouTube personality, and founder of LessThanFour.org, the world's largest social networking website for amputees. While his latest costume pales in comparison to these achievements, it still manages to be just as uplifting.
