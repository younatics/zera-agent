"Everton’s record signing Romelu Lukaku can expect a rapturous welcome from supporters when he is presented at Goodison Park today ahead of team-mate Leon Osman’s testimonial against Porto. Lukaku, who completed a £28million move from Chelsea last week after a successful loan spell at Everton last season, will be joined on the pitch before kick-off by American World Cup hero Tim Howard, who has returned to Merseyside early to support Osman’s big day. Belgian striker Lukaku, 21, scored 16 goals for Everton last season and his return to Goodison Park on a permanent basis is a real mission statement by manager Roberto Martinez, who is looking for him to form a lethal partnership with rising England star Ross Barkley. Signal of intent: Roberto Martinez's Everton signed Romelu Lukaku for £28m from Chelsea . Happy to be here: Lukaku posted this picture on Instagram on Saturday ahead of the testimonial . Ovations: Lukaku will be presented at Goodison Park on Sunday along with USA World Cup hero Tim Howard . Lukaku decided to leave Stamford Bridge after Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told him he would not be guaranteed first-team football following the £32m arrival of striker Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid this summer. The added presence today of goalkeeper Howard, who was given an extended break by Martinez following his exploits in Brazil over the summer, where he made a record 16 saves during defeat by Belgium in the last 16 of the World Cup, underlines the popularity of 33-year-old Osman, who made his Everton debut in 2003 and is one of the Premier League’s longest-serving one-club men. Proceeds from today’s 4pm kick-off will go to a number of charities, including the renowned Claire House Childrens’ Hospice which is located on the Wirral across the River Mersey from Liverpool. Legend: Leon Osman's testimonial is between Everton and Porto .","Lukaku will be presented ahead of Leon Osman's testimonial against Porto .

"Manchester City fans will be gratified to learn their new midfield powerhouse Fernando earned his nickname of The Octopus after a particularly stirring display against rivals Manchester United. United were Champions League holders when they faced Porto in the 2009 quarter-finals, narrowly winning the tie 3-2 on aggregate after an extraordinary individual display from the long-legged midfielder in the Portuguese ranks. ‘The fans started the name because I stole so many balls from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney,’ he recalls. ‘They said it was like I had so many legs. ‘Octopus has stuck ever since. I don’t mind, I get the same thrill from stopping a goal as strikers do from scoring.’ Powerhouse: Fernando could prove to be a shrewd acquisition for Manchester City . Pedigree: Fernando was nicknamed 'Octopus' after a series of superb displays for Porto against United in 2009 . Fernando is one Brazilian who can defend which is why Premier League champions Manchester City made him their first signing of the summer by meeting a £12million buy-out clause while Arsenal were paying big money for an exciting forward like Alexis Sanchez. Boss Manuel Pellegrini watched his side score 149 goals last season but couldn’t repeat their Premier League title success in the Champions League, which is the club’s holy grail. Defeats against Bayern Munich and Barcelona – and losing twice to Chelsea in the league - proved to Pellegrini that holding midfielders Yaya Toure and Fernandinho weren’t strong enough against elite opposition, which is where Fernando comes in. ‘The manager told me direct that he needed a player that was good defensively to improve the team,’ explained Fernando. ‘City have a really good team. They are the champions. But I feel I can bring a better balance, defensively. ‘I get my pleasure from stopping the ball and passing it to allow strikers to score.’ In short, Fernando is the extra insurance policy City need as they attempt to successfully retain the Premier League for the first time in their history and show Sheikh Mansour that a £1billion investment deserves European success. Toure’s reluctance to chase back with the same relish as he powers forward is well known. Fernandinho was exposed during the World Cup, particularly in Brazil’s humiliating 7-1 defeat against Germany, as someone who likes to go box-to-box rather than being a natural holder. Quality: Fernando has already impressed for City on their pre-season tour . Brazil could have done with Fernando in the tournament but he wasn’t considered by Felipe Scloari, a consequence of an earlier indiscretion when the player pushed a referee during an under-20s international and received a long suspension. The 27-year-old promises a similar mistake won’t happen in England. ‘I am a man now, before I was just a little kid,’ he reflects. ‘Unfortunately it happened and I wasn’t selected by Brazil after that. ‘It’s definitely had an impact on my career but it also made me more determined to do better and succeed. I am not the same young and fiery player now who loses his temper like that. 'My concentration now has to be playing for Manchester City but at the same time I hope my club performances here will open the door to playing for Brazil in the future. Of course I would love to play for them.’ Naturally relaxed and smiley, Fernando has been likened physically to a young Barack Obama. He has been learning English since January in anticipation of a move to City and been a popular “tourist” on the club’s current pre-season tour to America. On Tuesday, he joined in a coaching session for local kids at a park next to the iconic Yankee Stadium, watched closely by former Newcastle player Warren Barton, now an American TV pundit with ESPN. Full steam ahead: Fernando makes his way past Michael Carrick during the 2009 Champions League quarter-finals . His back story is interesting. Unlike many Brazilian players who grow up in poor neighbourhood favellas in sprawling cities like Rio and Sao Paulo, Fernandinho’s childhood was spent in the eco-town of Alto Paraiso (Highland Paradise), known as Brazil’s mystical capital. It is visited by thousands of tourists attracted by alleged sightings of flying saucers and other unidentified flying objects. Surrounded by forests and waterfalls, it has become a major eco-centre with interest in hallucinogenic and other natural remedies that grow all around. Fernando is a bit sceptical of the flying saucer brigade, saying: ‘It’s friendly, everyone knows each other and you can turn up uninvited to people’s house. ‘It’s very beautiful and we do get a lot of tourists. They try to find spaceships but I must admit I’ve never seen one!’ Solid: Fernando will not be afraid to get right in the thick of it for City in a hugely competitive Premier League . The 6ft destroyer nearly came to England a year ago when Everton applied for and gained a work permit for him on the final day of the transfer window. But Porto grew impatient after there was a delay in Everton selling Marouane Fellaini to Manchester United. By the time The Merseysiders had got the Fellaini money, Porto had changed their mind. ‘Talks were very advanced but at the last minute, Porto did not want to sell me,’ says Fernando now. It’s clearly worked out for the best. This season he will step out for the champions. Despite the reputation of his hometown, he is rooted in reality and will be one of the first names on Pellegrini’s team sheet when the big games come around this season. ‘The target is to win the Champions League or at least to do better than last year,’ he said. ‘I’ve been in Europe since I was 19 and know the style even better than in Brazil. ‘I am excited because I’ve noticed that fans in England love players who tackle hard. That is my job.’","Manchester City's new midfielder will already be know to Manchester United after a stirring display against them five years ago .

"It says a lot about the reputation of Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston among supporters that Roy Chubby Brown is no longer regarded as the most tasteless comedian in the entertainment capital of the north. Somehow one of English football’s great traditional clubs has turned into a laughing stock under Oyston’s stewardship. It has left thousands of fans desperately worried about the future of their famous old club who supplied two of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad, Alan Ball and Jimmy Armfield. Laughing stock: Blackpool have turned into something of a mess under chairman Karl Oyston . Brave face: Manager Jose Riga has been in dispute with Oyston over the club's transfer policy . On Friday, beleaguered manager Jose Riga worked with just eight senior professionals at the club’s dilapidated training ground near Blackpool Airport. The numbers were swelled by trialists begging for contracts, and youth team players. Those who chose to shower afterwards found only two temperatures available, freezing cold or scorching hot. With trial goalkeeper Ben Alnwick suddenly jumping ship, last season’s youth-team goalie Connor Hunt was needed between the sticks so the few outfield players present had at least the semblance of an ordinary training session. With just a fortnight to go before the kick off of the Championship season, Blackpool have played just one pre-season friendly, a meaningless kickabout against non-league Penrith in which Riga deliberately left out some of his contracted players. They were originally meant to be at a training camp in Majorca yesterday but that was cancelled a long time ago due to lack of numbers. Despite a total breakdown between Oyston and Riga, the Belgian coach and four members of his backroom staff have not walked and turned up to work every day, cheerful and enthusiastic. Oyston can’t or won’t sack Riga without first finding someone else prepared to work with him. The stand-off has left Blackpool odds-on favourites for relegation and even though the club have offered two-year season ticket sales for the price of one year, numbers are well down on the 11,000 last season. Ruin: A skip at Blackpool's training ground . Rundown: The outside of Blackpool's Training Ground and Centre of Excellence . Falling apart: A scene from the club's training ground . Fans primarily blame chairman Oyston, whose father Owen – the club’s owner - was paid £11million when Blackpool were relegated from the Premier League in 2010/11. They are convinced that when the final parachute payment of about £9million is paid in early August, it will somehow end up in the pockets of the Oyston family rather than invested in new players. The few that have sympathy for Oyston are suspicious that Riga’s transfer targets are unrealistic and will see money paid to agents. His only ‘buy’ so far, Estonian international Sergei Zenjov, is a lightweight winger who cannot be guaranteed to be successful in the Championship. Stuck in the middle of the dispute between chairman and manager are the fans. An inaugural meeting of the Blackpool Supporters’ Club at a working man’s club near Bloomfield Road a fortnight ago attracted 500 people. Chairman Tim Fielding said: ‘Our job is to hold the owners to account. We would either ask the Oystons to put the football first or let someone else take over. I think it is fair to say we are not happy with them.’ Fielding hasn’t bought a season-ticket for the first time in 25 years. He will go to home games on a match-by-match basis and attend all the away games. ‘The only people at Blackpool who have benefited since we were in the Premier League are Karl Oyston and his family,’ he says. ‘He promoted his new manager as the Riga revolution when he appointed him a few week ago and almost from day one we are in a situation where he isn’t backing him. The Mexican stand-off has been going for seven weeks – it is beyond bizarre.’ Short on numbers: Blackpool have had to field a large number of trialists in recent friendlies . Youngsters: They have just eight first-team players currently on their books . Meanwhile, the triallists continue to turn up and pray they will get a contract. They include midfielders Jacob Mellis and Tomasz Cwyka who both played for relegated Barnsley last season. In an ultimate insult, former Blackpool favourite Steven Dobbie is set to turn down an offer from the club to join League One neighbours Fleetwood instead. At the stadium, they are working on the pretence of business as usual. Oyston has built all the trimmings onto the stadium; a hotel, spa, conference rooms that can be hired for meetings and functions, all against a tangerine backdrop. But the Blackpool fans now refer to their home ground as Doomfield Road, rather than Bloomfield. They would be happy to allow Latvian Valerie Belokon take over. He owns 20 per cent of the club but has failed to persuade the Oystons to give him any more.","Desperate fans worried about the future of their club after a period of unrest .

"Cardiff will sell Chile World Cup midfielder Gary Medel to Inter Milan for £10million. Medel, 26, played 34 times last season but the club accepted it was unrealistic to keep him following relegation. He was Cardiff’s record signing a year ago when he moved from Sevilla for £11m. It has been reported in the Italian media that Medel will take a paycut to join the Serie A side. Serie A swoop: Gary Medel looks set to sign for Inter Milan from Cardiff fo a fee of £10m . Big loss: Steven Caulker is just one of the Cardiff players who have already left, joining QPR . Galatasaray were also interested in the Chile star, while Inter were at first keen to take him on loan. Fraizer Campbell and Steven Caulker recently left Cardiff for Crystal Palace and QPR respectively, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hope to keep hold of other stars. David Marshall will miss the start of the season after dislocating a finger.","Medel was record signing last season but will move on after relegation .

"Bojan Krkic’s decision to leave Barcelona and join Stoke City may appear strange – particularly as the 23-year-old should be about to enter his prime. But he’s not the first footballer to undergo a transfer that has left everyone else open-mouthed and scratching their heads. See if you agree with our list of the 10 great jaw-dropping moves. Bit of a gamble: Bojan Krkic has officially made the move to Mark Hughes' Stoke from Barcelona . Big move: Once first-choice ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic the transfer is somewhat of a surprise for most . Simonsen was one of the game’s superstars and had been crowned European footballer of the year in 1977. When Diego Maradona joined Barcelona in 1982, he had to make way but nobody could have predicted he would turn up next at Second Division Charlton Athletic. Alas, it didn’t work out. Great Dane Simonsen only played 17 times before the south-east London club were unable to pay his considerable wages. To prove there were no hard feelings though, Simonsen has been back to The Valley since as a fan. Ill-fated: 1977's European Footballer of the Year, Barcelona's Allan Simonsen, played just 17 times for Charlton . 2 DIDIER DROGBA – CHELSEA TO SHANGHAI SHENHUA, 2012 . Drogba chose a radical new challenge after scoring the decisive shoot-out penalty for Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final that cemented his status as one of the club’s greatest-ever players. His arrival at Shanghai Shenhua was meant to revolutionise Chinese football in a similar way to David Beckham and the MLS. But the partnership failed to work and Drogba headed back west to Galatasaray just six months into his contract despite protestations from Shanghai. Chelsea to China: Didier Drogba went from scoring the 2012 Champions League winning penalty to Shanghai . 3 JUNINHO – SAO PAOLO TO MIDDLESBROUGH, 1995 . Some questioned the midfielder’s sanity when he swapped the passion and excitement of Brazil’s largest city for industrial Teesside, attracted by the Bryan Robson revolution that was going on. Thousands of Boro fans turned out to see their diminutive new star arrive and the hospitality worked. Juninho fell in love with the north-east, and ended up having three spells with the club. Famously he helped them reach two cup finals in 1997 and was left in tears when they were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the same season. Surprise: Brazil star Juninho made the move from Sao Paulo to Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough . 4 JONATHAN WOODGATE – REAL MADRID TO MIDDLESBROUGH, 2007 . This is not  meant to be a personal attack on Middlesbrough, but how many players would have considered moving from the Santiago Bernabeu to The Riverside. Being a local boy like Woodgate helped and the defender was tempted by home comforts after three injury-plagued years in Spain, where he played in a Galactico side alongside the likes of Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham. Real big move: Jonathan Woodgate transfered from Zinedine Ziidane's Madrid to his home town . 5 GLEN JOHNSON – CHELSEA TO PORTSMOUTH, 2007 . Glen Johnson had been Roman Abramovich’s first signing after taking over at Chelsea and was tipped for great things at Stamford Bridge. But when he fell out with Jose Mourinho, he was persuaded by sweet-talking Harry Redknapp to leave the King’s Road and play his football at ramshackle Fratton Park. In the short-term, the move seemed to work with the player winning the FA Cup in 2008. But Pompey were living beyond their means and Johnson quickly joined the exodus from the south coast to join Liverpool. Bridge to shore: Harry Redknapp and Portsmouth snagged Roman Abramovich's first Chelsea signing in 2007 . 6 KEVIN KEEGAN – HAMBURG TO SOUTHAMPTON, 1980 . Keegan was the biggest superstar of his day; the reigning European player of the year and famous enough to make a pop record that went into the charts. His club Hamburg had just played in the European Cup final and were considered one of the biggest teams in Germany at the time. So Keegan was the last person on journalists’ minds when unfashionable Southampton called a press conference – they thought it was to do with ground redevelopment at The Dell. There were audible gasps when Keegan, England’s captain, walked in with his new manager Lawrie McMenemy. Chart-topper: Kevin Keegan was a superstar in Europe and England captain when he joined Southampton . 7 MICHAEL OWEN – REAL MADRID TO NEWCASTLE, 2005 . Michael Owen was from the Ian Rush school of not fully appreciating foreign countries and was desperate to return to England after 12 months in La Liga. The best financial offer on the table was from Newcastle so Liverpool legend Owen bit the bullet and signed on for manager Graeme Souness and chairman Freddie Shepherd for a club that hadn’t won a trophy since 1970. He didn’t endear himself to Geordie fans by continuing to spend time in the north-west and flying up to training by helicopter. And a dismal four years was capped by relegation in 2009. Dismal: Michael Owen's illustrious career has a black and white hole in it that ended with Newcastle's relegation . 8 IVAN CAMPO – REAL MADRID TO BOLTON, 2003 . The bushy-haired Campo had won the Champions League in five successful years in Madrid but when he fell out of favour at the start of the Galactico era, he decided Sam Allardyce and Bolton were for him. After a year’s  loan to bed in, Campo joined on a permanent basis and became a huge favourite with Bolton fans, who turned up to matches wearing wigs in his honour. Allardyce also found a new role for Campo in holding midfield and he stayed at The Reebok for five seasons. Beloved: Bushy-haired Ivan Campo won the Champions League with Madrid but Bolton are glad he left . 9 CRAIG BELLAMY – LIVERPOOL TO CARDIFF, 2012 . New Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wanted to keep Bellamy at Anfield where he’d just won the League Cup. But the Welshman wanted to be closer to his family in south wales and harboured a dream of helping his local club reach the Premier League for the first time, something he’d been unable to do in an earlier loan spell. So Bellamy swapped the “This is Anfield” sign for the more modest trappings of Cardiff and had the last laugh when City won promotion under Malky Mackay, something the forward rated as the best achievement of his career. Homecoming: Craig Bellamy was wanted by Liverpool but wanted more to help Cardiff get promoted - and did . 10 ROBERTO MANCINI – LAZIO TO LEICESTER, 2001 . Mancini was regarded as one of the best Italian players of his generation with 35 international caps and 15 years service with Sampdoria before moving to Lazio. At the age of 36, he was persuaded by  Leicester manager Peter Taylor to come to England, the move suggested by Mancini’s former boss Sven Goran Eriksson who had worked with Taylor for the England national team. Mancini’s legs had gone by the time he arrived in the east Midlands and he played only three times for The Foxes. On the plus side, he formed an unlikely friendship with another Leicester player, Robbie Savage, that lasts til this day. Past his prime: Roberto Mancini wasn't at his finest when he got to Leicester from Lazio .","Krkic joined Mark Hughes' Stoke City from the Nou Camp on a four-year deal .

"Louis van Gaal has given himself the chance to claim his first trophy at Manchester United just three weeks into the job. And to add to the intrigue, it will be United’s most-detested rivals Liverpool trying to stand in his way. Winning the International Champions Cup, a glorified pre-season tournament in America, may not be the main reason United turned to Van Gaal after 12 months of David Moyes, but it’ll still be a nice start to the Dutchman’s time at Old Trafford if his side win the final in Miami on Monday. United qualified for the showpiece game by defeating Real Madrid in front of a record crowd in Ann Arbor on Saturday night and will now face their north-west neighbours who topped the other group in the eight-team competition. Scroll down for video . United's hero: Ashley Young struck twice to help his side beat the reigning European champions Real Madrid . Packed to the rafters: 109,00 spectators watched the match unfold at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor . In focus: The two teams line up in front of a capacity crowd at the Michigan Stadium in Detroit . Having a good time: Two United fans cheer on their team during the Guinness International Champions Cup . Not impressed: Ronaldo started the match against his old side on the bench for Real Madrid . Watching on: The former United star looked keen to be involved as his side went behind early on . MANCHESTER UNITED (3-4-1-2): De Gea 7; Keane 5.5, Jones 7, Evans 6 (Blackett 45mins 6); Valencia 5.5 (Lingard 61mins 6.5), Herrera 7 (Cleverley 45mins 6), Fletcher 7.5, Young 7 (Shaw 45mins 6.5); Mata 6.5 (Kagawa 61mins 6.5); Welbeck (Zaha 41mins 5.5), Rooney 6 (Hernandez 61mins 7). Goals: Young 20, 37, Hernandez 80. REAL MADRID (4-1-4-1): Casillas 6; Arbeloa 6 (Ronaldo 73mins 6), Pepe 6, Ramos 6.5, Fernandez 7; Alonso 7(De Tomas 55mins 7.5); Carvajal 6.5, Illarramend 6, Modric 6, Bale 7; Isco 6. Goals: Bale (pen) 27. Booked: Arbeloa, Isco. Referee: Hilario Grajeda 7. Man of the match: Darren Fletcher. Ashley Young was United's unlikely hero with two goals against Real where the other main source of interest was the size of the attendance inside the University of Michigan’s American football stadium, 109,318. It was the biggest crowd ever seen for a “soccer” game in America and represented the largest attendance for any United match since 1957 when they travelled to Real’s Madrid’s Santiago Bernabueu in the fledgling European Cup. On this occasion, Real were without their talisman Cristiano Ronaldo until the closing stages and looked a pale shadow of the side that lifted the Champions League in May. Gareth Bale was clearly their best player, winning and scoring a penalty to briefly make the game 1-1. But their manager Carlo Ancelotti never got to grips with the 3-4-3 formation Van Gaal is using to try and get the best out of his array of attacking players. Breaking the deadlock: Young opened the scoring for United with a crisp finish past Casillas . Celebrate: Young's team-mates rush over to congratulate him after he put United ahead in the first half . Burst of pace: Gareth Bale draws a foul from Michael Keane inside the penalty area . Cool customer: The former Spurs man made no mistake with his penalty that brought Madrid level . Calm reaction: The Welshman celebrates after firing his penalty past David de Gea . The setting was worthy of arguably the two most glamorous teams in world football, and star names like Bale and Wayne Rooney. The giant cavernous arena, an hour outside Detroit, is known locally with good reason as The Big House and United’s skipper Darren Fletcher admitted before kick-off: ‘You think you’ve done it all with Manchester United and all over the world, but this is going to be a unique occasion.’ There was some disappointment that Ronaldo wasn’t fit enough to start because of his knee injury picked up at the World Cup. Capacity crowd: Two former Southampton players jostle for the ball as Luke Shaw shields it from Bale . Dictating play: Rooney put in a good performance for Van Gaal's side as they upset Madrid in Detroit . Friendly: Danny Welbeck and Pepe challenge for a cross as United have the best of the early exchanges . Acrobatic attempt: Gareth Bale forced David de Gea into action with an ambitious overhead kick . Nice turn: Welbeck spins away from Alvaro Arbeloa for United during the first half in Detroit . Spanish armada: Juan Mata, left, and Xabi Alonso, right, watch the run of the ball during the match . In flight: Dani Carvajal heads the ball to a team-mate after wanting it more than his opponent Young . But it didn’t stop thousands of fans drinking beer and enjoying barbecues around the stadium in the hours leading up to kick-off. Despite the numbers attending, what followed still felt like a pre-season friendly, but United would have been heartened to see red shirts greatly outnumber white on all four sides. United had already beaten Roma and Inter Milan in the competition and knew a draw would be good enough to see them through to Florida. The goal that gave them the lead after 21 minutes was good enough to grace any competition, a superb team effort involving six different players. Phil Jones and Antonio Valencia began the move inside their own half and Fletcher then carried the ball towards the danger-zone, playing a one-two with Rooney and advancing to the edge of the Madrid penalty area via a clever back-heel from the England man. Fletcher thought momentarily about a shot but instead slid a pass across to Welbeck. It proved the right call, Welbeck played in Ashley Young on the overlap and while his low finish wasn’t particularly well-placed, it was struck firmly enough to beat Iker Casillas. Despairing dive: Casillas did not expect Young's cross to bounce past Rooney when United went 2-1 up . Back in front: Rooney points to Young after his cross evaded Casillas and bounced in at the back post . Bright start: Rooney congratulates Young after his cross inadvertently put United back in front against Madrid . Without Ronaldo watching from the sidelines, it was up to Bale to provide the spur. And he did just that after 27 minutes. The super-charged Welshman, the world’s most expensive player at £86million was far too quick for Michael Keane, not for the first or last time. And as the United defender put out his arm to try and hold Bale back, the Madrid No11 didn’t need much encouragement to hit the floor. After a couple of moments of deliberation, referee Hilario Grajeda pointed to the spot. Bale trotted up as if he was in the local park rather than in front of a six-figure audience, and calmly sent David de Gea the wrong way from the spot. Suddenly the game was easing through the gears, and United restored their lead after 37 minutes. Cometh the hour: Ronaldo made a surprise appearance against his old employers but had little impact . Star turn: The Portugal captain did not push himself too hard as he continues his preparations for the season . Still a threat: Shaw and Tyler Blackett keep a close eye on Ronaldo as he dribbles with the ball for Madrid . Young, one of those deemed under threat in the new Van Gaal regime, scored again. Wayne Rooney tried to head his left-wing centre and even though he didn’t make contact, the striker did enough to distract Casillas and allow the cross to trickle inside the far post. Rooney held up his hand in celebration, confusing the stadium announcer who thought he might have scored, but the player indicated to Young it was the winger’s goal. As often happens on these occasions, the second half was affected by a mass of substitutions. Van Gaal took off his two most potent forwards Young and Rooney, and Madrid fought hard to level. Bale set up Isco with a scorching run but the Spaniard couldn’t convert. Bale was then denied by a fine save. The crowd came to life when Ronaldo, who hadn’t played since the World Cup because of a knee injury, came on for the last 16 minutes, looking every inch the Hollywood star. Heading home: Javier Hernandez beats Casillas to the ball to make it 3-1 to United at the Michigan Stadium . Praise the provider: Hernandez points to Shinji Kagawa after heading home the Japan international's cross . All smiles: Shinji Kagawa hugs Javier Hernandez after he scored United's third and final goal with his head . Respect: Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos congratulate Hernandez after his goal in the closing stages for United . But he didn’t have much of an impact. Instead, his former United team-mates scored a third goal after 80 minutes when Shinji Kagawa floated in a delightful cross which Javier Hernandez bravely headed in from close range. Eyebrows were raised when United appointed Moyes because he had never won a trophy. For Van Gaal to start work on July 23 and pick up silverware on August 4 would be impressive, even if Liverpool will have something to say about that.

"Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba asked for the sprinklers to be turned on as he made his Besiktas debut in the unlikely surroundings of Macclesfield's Moss Rose stadium on Wednesday night. Ba, who cost the Turkish giants £5million, was given a rousing reception on the Conference ground as he played the second 45 minutes of a 1-1 draw against Bundesliga side Mainz 05. It was vital preparation for the 29-year-old Senegal star ahead of next week's key Champions League clash against Feyenoord and he made a point of telling the Macclesfield's ground staff to give the turf an extra watering before he made his entrance.

"Everton defender Leighton Baines admitted a clean sheet was almost as important as their first home Barclays Premier League win of the season after a catalogue of defensive errors left the players scratching their heads. The England left-back provided assists for the first and last goals, scored by Phil Jagielka and Seamus Coleman, in the 3-0 win over Aston Villa as the Toffees recorded only their second shut-out in 11 matches across all competitions. Injuries to key defensive personnel has not helped, but throwing away leads in particular has cost them at least four points, which would have put them within touching distance of the top four. Leighton Baines provided two assists in the 3-0 win, but was more pleased with Everton's defensive solidity . Baines celebrates with fellow full back Seamus Coleman after making the third goal for his team-mate . A second league win has lifted them into mid-table and Baines is looking for more defensive stability in the future as they look to put the errors behind them. 'We have conceded some strange goals this season and I am not sure, if you look at it, we have given up many more chances than we would usually, but for some reason we have been conceding,' he said. 'You go away and look at all the stats and analyse things and it is just fine margins in football. 'It was nice to get back to normal and keeping a clean sheet is something we will look to replicate in the next few games.' Of just as much significance was the timing of Everton's goals as, after Jagielka's stooping 18th-minute header from a right-footed Baines cross, Romelu Lukaku grabbed his first for a month just three minutes after half-time. Everton were much-improved against Villa, after previously going three Premier League games without a win . Romelu Lukaku scored his first goal for Everton in a month to put Everton two goals up at Goodison Park . That was enough to finish off a poor Villa performance and Coleman's close-range conversion of Baines' cross - this time with his preferred left foot - with 14 minutes to go ensured there were no late nerves. Lukaku's goal was just the morale-booster he needed after struggling for form as a result struggling for fitness after the World Cup and Baines knows if they keep providing chances for the Belgium striker he will deliver. 'When you are bossing games you have to score goals, because the longer teams stay in it the more chance you have got of them nicking the goal and then they can sit in and defend,' he added. 'We got our goals at important times against Villa to finish the game off and we were in control. 'Rom was great for us last season and has a really impressive goalscoring record in his time over here so we know goals aren't a problem, we just have to keep giving him opportunities. Baines praised Lukaku for his brilliant form last season, and says he will keep improving with opportunities . Visiting manager Paul Lambert said Ron Vlaar's return was a bonus but he will take time to be back to his best . 'He is a goalscorer and he can score all different types of goals, left foot, right foot, in the air, and he puts fear into defenders and him scoring goals is good for us, because you need your strikers to score. 'I personally didn't feel any lag (after the World Cup), but Rom came back later than myself, Jags (Jagielka) and Ross (Barkley), so he started the season probably having only been with us a week. 'Bear in mind some of the other lads had been back training seven weeks, so in that respect it is only just starting to level out really and we hope we will get him scoring goals because he is vital for us.' Villa's Belgium striker Christian Benteke is feeling his way back into football and his start at Goodison Park was his first since rupturing his Achilles tendon in March. Christian Benteke returned to the Villa starting line-up for the first time since March but had little impact . Aside from one smart chance when he smashed home a rebound after his own shot came back off the crossbar - having already been penalised for a foul on Antolin Alcaraz - the powerful front man was starved of chances. However, manager Paul Lambert hopes he will be back on top form soon as Villa have now lost four successive league matches without scoring a goal, something they have not done since January 2001. 'It might take him half-a-dozen games as he's been out for five or six months, but he has got to get fit somewhere so it is good to get him back,' he said. 'Ron Vlaar (coming back from a six-week lay-off with a calf injury) is a bonus, but losing Nathan Baker (to an ankle injury) so early in the game is a blow.'","England defender pleased with 3-0 victory over Aston Villa .

"Tennis commentator Barry Cowan has got under Andy Murray’s skin again – by knocking his mum Judy out of the Guinness Book of World Records. Cowan, who once took Pete Sampras to five sets at Wimbledon, had his world record for holding the largest-ever tennis coaching session ratified by the Guinness authorities on Tuesday. Beaten: Judy Murray is no longer the record holder for the largest-ever tennis coaching session . He and his fellow trainers simultaneously coached 680 children in Liverpool before the city’s Hope International tournament last month, surpassing the previous highest of 406 trained by Judy in New York earlier this year. If anyone was going to be miffed about his mother losing her record to 39-year-old Cowan, it will be the 2013 Wimbledon champion. Murray has not failed to disguise his irritation with Cowan in the past and sent a scathing tweet about his work on Sky Sports during a match between Rafael Nadal and Thomas Berdych in Italy last year: ‘Was pumped 2 watch nadal berdych but barry cowans commentating has killed match..poor guy has no idea what’s happening #clueless” Cowan had previously said the Scot had to play more aggressively to win Grand Slam events. Record holder: Barry Cowan has taken Murray's mantle in the Guinness Book of World Records . The coaching record, which will now appear in the renowned Guinness Book of World Records, was set in Liverpool on June 18 when organisers invited local schools to take part in the mass training session under Cowan’s charge. Tournament chief Anders Borg was delighted the record has been accepted. ‘It is now official. 680 kids from Liverpool schools can now say they are part of a world record. Barry was in charge of the coaching team.’ Cowan, who was born in Southport and is a lifelong Liverpool fan, reached a career high of 162 in his tennis career and took Sampras the full distance in his most famous match on Court One in 2001. He has since developed  a reputation for being an opinionated but knowledgeable pundit on television including Sky Sports.","Barry Cowan holds the record for the largest-ever tennis coaching session .

"Stoke City’s former Barcelona whizzkid Bojan Krkic has reclaimed the No27 shirt he wore when tipped to be the next Lionel Messi. Bojan has signed for Mark Hughes after failing to live up to the early hype when he made his Nou Camp debut at 17. In a live webchat with Stoke fans on Friday night, Bojan predicted the good times would return for  him in The Potteries and explained why he’s chosen to wear the 27 shirt this season. Scroll down for video... No 27: Bojan Krkic wants to get back to his best after picking his old Barcelona shirt number at Stoke . Wonderkid: The Spain youngster was tipped for great things when he started his career at the Nou Camp . ‘It was my first number at Barcelona and because this is the start of a new era, I thought it would be nice to have it again. I wore 11 at Ajax on loan last season. ‘I still feel the same player as I did when I began at Barcelona and I feel I have more experience now that will hopefully help me here.’ Though unflattering comparisons have been made between Barcelona and Stoke, 23-year-old Bojan has been impressed with the quality of his new team-mates in his first day in training. ‘I saw that the idea here is to get the ball down and play good football,’ he said. ‘There are many good players here who want to play with the ball at their feet. I think that will suit the style I want to play. ‘I know what I am capable of on the pitch. I like to get the ball on the ground, make good plays and move the ball around the pitch quickly at a good tempo. I like to build good relationships with other players too, which is important.’ Prodigy: Bojan Krkic was younger than even Lionel Messi (R) when he made his Barcelona debut . Bojan beat Messi’s post-war record when he made his Barcelona debut in La Liga aged 17 years and 19 days. He was capped by Spain at 18 and was originally named in their Euro 2008 squad as a teenager before withdrawing because of fatigue. But he’s not lived up to his teenage promise since, having spells at Roma, AC Milan and Ajax before Barca decided to sell him to England for a nominal fee. Part of the problem the player believes is that he’s been used as a winger too often and he is adamant he would like a more central role at Stoke. ‘I like to play as a striker or second striker. In recent seasons, I have played out wide but I do feel that my best position is in a more central role,’ he said. Pot luck: The 23-year-old has consulted former teammate Marc Muniesa (L) before signing for Stoke . Bojan consulted with former Barca team-mate Marc Muniesa who joined Stoke last season before agreeing his own switch. The forward whose own idol growing up was Patrick Kluivert was also aware that manager Mark Hughes played for Barca in the 1980s. ‘I wanted to come here to play for a team on the up,’ he said. ‘The Premier League is somewhere I always wanted to play, so this is a good opportunity for me. ‘It is a very exciting league and one I am excited to play in. Mark also told me of the ambitions here and that was important to me.’ Great expectations: Stoke will be hoping to improve after signing the likes of Mame Biram Diouf . Muniesa also joined in the webchat and warned Bojan that he may need to toughen up. He said: ‘I understand that the managers like the players to be stronger maybe than in Spain, and over the 12 months, I did a lot of gym work that has helped me.’ Stoke finished ninth last season and Hughes is hoping to go even higher this season having already signed five new players including Bojan and ex-Manchester United striker Mame Biram Diouf.","Former Barcelona striker Bojan Krkic has signed for Stoke City .

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day. Saturday saw a remarkable result at St Mary's as Southampton put eight past hapless Sunderland, while Sergio Aguero scored four of his own and Chelsea maintained their cushion at the top with a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace. There were wins also for West Ham, Everton and Newcastle, while Arsenal and Hull City shared four goals at Emirates. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: Now Aguero is 100 percent fit he'll be unstoppable . GK - Joe Hart (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 9 . Although Sergio Aguero will steal the headlines for his four goals in City's impressive win, the England goalkeeper deserves credit for the two or three crucial saves he made to ensure Tottenham weren't allowed a route back into the match. Not least was his penalty save from Roberto Soldado on the hour mark, which would have pulled the scores back to 2-2. Joe Hart gets down to save Roberto Soldado's penalty as Manchester City won 4-1 against Tottenham . DEF - Kieran Tripper (BURNLEY vs West Ham) - 7.5 . Burnley may have lost 3-1, but Trippier caught the eye with his performance both defensively and going forward. He delivered 13 crosses and set up three chances for the Clarets. Kieran Tripper was impressive for Burnley despite their 3-1 home defeat by West Ham . DEF - John Terry (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) 7.5 . Making his 500th appearance as Chelsea captain, Terry was his usual influential self as the Blues preserved their five point lead at the top. His one black mark was when he chopped down Frazier Campbell, having been well and truly beaten for pace. But otherwise another performance of consistency like the 499 that came before. John Terry produced a typically influential performance in his 500th game as Chelsea captain . DEF - Michael Dawson (HULL CITY vs Arsenal) 8 . Dawson was rock solid at the back as the Tigers almost held out for all three points at the Emirates and he had already departed injured by the time Danny Welbeck equalised in stoppage time. The centre-half won pretty much every header and made clearance after clearance as waves of Arsenal attack were kept at bay. Michael Dawson beats Jack Wilshere to a header in Hull's 2-2 draw with Arsenal at the Emirates . DEF - Leighton Baines (EVERTON vs Aston Villa) 7.5 . Another accomplished all-round performance by the England left-back, delivering the ball that was headed in by the increasingly prolific Phil Jagielka on 18 minutes after he had turned Ashley Westwood inside out. Also delivered the ball that Seamus Coleman hooked in for 3-0 in the second half. Leighton Baines celebrates with Seamus Coleman has Everton took a three-goal lead at Goodison Park . MID - Gabriel Obertan (NEWCASTLE UNITED vs Leicester City) 7.5 . Obertan ended a very long wait of 32 months for a top-flight goal as Newcastle recorded their first Premier League win of the season against Leicester. Gliding infield from the left, he fired beyond Kasper Schmeichel from 20 yards to settle the contest. Gabriel Obertan ended his goal drought as Newcastle recorded their first Premier League win of the season . MID - Cesc Fabregas (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) 8.5 . Was given licence to pull the strings in the final third and took full advantage to continue his - and Chelsea's - excellent form. He combined nicely with Loic Remy in the same way he has linked with Diego Costa all season. Took his goal wonderfully, fooling Julian Speroni to round off a flowing move. Cesc Fabregas celebrates his goal in Chelsea's win at Crystal Palace as they maintain their five-point lead . MID - Frank Lampard (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 8 . Only lasted 27 minutes before going off injured but was exceptional in that time. Involved in City's first goal and then won the penalty for their second, converted by Sergio Aguero. Frank Lampard goes down under the challenge of Erik Lamela to win Man City's first penalty against Tottenham . MID - Oscar (CHELSEA vs Crystal Palace) - 8 . Showed Brazilian class to curl home the free-kick that gave Chelsea the lead at Selhurst Park, sending the ball across Speroni rather than over the wall and in. Played a bit deeper but to good effect, dictating the pace of the game. Oscar celebrates after curling home a free-kick for Chelsea's opener at Selhurst Park . FWD - Dusan Tadic (SOUTHAMPTON vs Sunderland) - 8.5 . There were many candidates in the Southampton team that put eight past Sunderland but the Serb Tadic was the stand-out. Not only score during the second-half but contributed four asissts, equalling a Premier League record in so doing. Tadic has proved an inspired buy over the summer and Ronald Koeman's side look mightily impressive. Dusan Tadic celebrates with Graziano Pelle during Southampton's eight-goal rout of Sunderland . FWD - Sergio Aguero (MANCHESTER CITY vs Tottenham) - 9.5 . Very nearly a perfect 10 for the City striker, whose four goals inspired the win over Spurs. His penalty miss was the only blot that prevented him getting a top mark. Was brimming with confidence and unplayable all afternoon, showing composure with his finishing from 12 yards and beyond. Sergio Aguero scored four goals as Manchester City beat Tottenham at the Etihad .","Sergio Aguero scored four goals as Manchester City beat Tottenham .

"Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace is poised to receive an annual bonus package worth £160,000 from the cash-strapped Ibrox club. Currently caught in the crossfire between potential rival saviours, Dave King and Mike Ashley, the former Manchester City executive is entitled to a discretionary performance-related bonus of up to 100 per cent of his £315,000 annual salary. Rangers sources have confirmed to Sportsmail, however, that Wallace has had a scaled down cash payment of £100,000 ratified by the board’s remuneration committee. Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace could be in line to receive a bonus worth £160,000 from the club . In recognition of the club’s perilous financial position, he has asked for a further £60,000 to be paid in market value shares in a move yet to be waved through by shareholders – one of whom, Ashley, is seeking to remove Wallace and financial director Phillip Nash from the board at an EGM. The Union of Fans are angered by Ashley’s moves to flex his muscles and last night accused the SFA of facilitating an abuse of their rules on dual ownership of football clubs. Ashley, the billionaire owner of Newcastle United, has increased the heat in the Ibrox boardroom by demanding the removal of Wallace and Nash. Now in control of 8.9 per cent of Rangers’ shares, Ashley’s move is being viewed as a direct hit on two men sympathetic to seeing the club refinanced by sources other than the deep pockets of the sportswear tycoon. Wallace is set to receive £100,000 in cash and £60,000 in shares from the cash-strapped Scottish club . Sportsmail revealed yesterday that former directors Dave King and Paul Murray, together with shareholder George Letham, are heading an investment group willing to sink an initial £16million into the club – in return for a 51 per cent stake acquired via a new share issue. It has been claimed however that, if successful, Ashley’s motion will scupper this potential source of investment. And last night, the UoF, the supporters’ umbrella group, claimed Ashley’s actions this week made a mockery of SFA rules banning any individual from owning more than 10 per cent in two clubs. ‘The move by Mike Ashley to grab power in the Rangers boardroom is extremely concerning,’ a statement read. Mike Ashley is flexing his muscles with regards to Rangers,demanding the removal of Wallace from the club . ‘The SFA’s special dispensation, which allowed Mr Ashley to purchase up to 10 per cent of the club, was clearly designed to mirror UEFA rules on dual ownership. ‘These rules do not allow anyone to exert a “decisive influence” over the decision-making of two clubs. There can be no more obvious attempt to exert “decisive influence” over another club than to try remove its executive directors. ‘Charles Green and the previous board, as placemen for shareholders currently represented by Sandy Easdale, have already allowed Mr Ashley to plunder the club for onerous merchandise contracts and virtually free stadium-naming rights. He also has full control of the club stores. ‘We firmly believe that it is Mr Ashley’s intention to now attempt to grab ownership of the club’s trademark rights including our name and badge. We believe he is deliberately attempting to hamper the efforts of others to invest in the club so that he can provide a loan on terms which will allow him to demand these trademark rights. Ashley currently owns 8.9 per cent of the Scottish club, but is interested in increasing that stake . ‘The SFA has a duty to Rangers to rigorously enforce both its own and UEFA rules on dual ownership. We believe Mr Ashley’s EGM call is a breach of those rules and we have written to the SFA calling on them to take appropriate action.’ Rangers striker Kris Boyd, meanwhile, will be available for the visit of Raith Rovers next Saturday after a charge of violent conduct levelled against him in the wake of last month’s defeat to Hibs was found not proven. Boyd had been offered a two-game suspension after being charged with an altercation with ‘headbutting or attempting to headbutt an opposing player’ but he opted to fight the charge. And a Disciplinary Tribunal was unable to prove his guilt in the incident involving Jordon Foster. However, Ibrox defender Bilel Mohsni will serve a two-game suspension after accepting a violent conduct charge for swinging an arm at centre-back Liam Fontaine in the same match. Rangers are second in the Scottish Championship, six points behind Hearts and two ahead of Raith Rovers .","Rangers chief executive set to receive his annual bonus .

"As a man not unaccustomed to the fortunes of National Hunt racing, Ally McCoist well knows the wisdom of paying scant regard to the opening few furlongs of a chase. No bookmaker in the land will make good on a wager until the winning line has been breached. Accordingly, the Rangers manager believes those viewing Monday’s clash with Hibernian at Ibrox as some kind of title eliminator aren’t so much jumping the gun as calling the race before the protagonists are even in the stalls. Alan Stubbs’ team have managed just two wins from six thus far and currently sit seventh in the Championship – a long way from the form expected and certainly far removed from that which will cement an immediate return to the top-flight. Ally McCoist looks on during Friday's training session ahead of Rangers' clash with Hibernian on Monday . The Ibrox manager insists it is too early to write off Hibernian, even though they have struggled this season . Yet, even if defeat on Monday were to widen the gap between them and Rangers to 10 points after just seven matches, McCoist feels the Easter Road side would still remain part of a chasing pack eminently capable of making up the ground over the course of 36 matches. ‘No matter how the game goes on Monday, there is far too long to go in the Championship to start ruling anyone out at this stage,’ the Rangers boss insisted. ‘We’ve seen how difficult it has been and is going to be. With 15 minutes to go at Alloa, we would have taken a point all day to get out of there. I know Hearts had chances at Dumbarton, but Dumbarton had a couple of their own, too. ‘There are Edinburgh derbies to play, we’ve got to go through to Tynecastle and Easter Road — there’s a massive, massive distance to go.’ Nonetheless, those predicting that Hibs would arrest their decline to race neck-on-neck with their rivals from Ibrox and Tynecastle from the outset have been forced into a quick revision. Alan Stubbs' Hibs side have endured a frustrating start to the season and are 7th in the Scottish Championship . Despite Stubbs’ imaginative appointment, old habits – mostly bad – have died hard. Yet McCoist feels anyone anticipating some kind of uncontested three-way slug for first place makes no allowance for the environment in which the big guns are now operating. ‘I think it says more about the opposition and the standard more than anything else,’ he added of Hibs’ form. ‘I’m certainly not going to be critical of Hibs who have played better football against us than probably anyone else this season. In the (Challenge) Cup game, I felt they played exceptionally well at times. ‘We’ve known all along that going to places like Alloa and Queen of the South is extremely difficult as these teams, if they play well, can surprise anyone in the country.’ If Hibs were able to cast off that previous 2-1 Ibrox defeat with a degree of nonchalance given the second-rate competition it took place in, another loss would hugely lengthen the odds on them pipping their rivals at the post come May. So do Rangers anticipate facing a Hibs side even more focused than that which they defeated in August? Rangers midfielder Lewis Macleod (right) injured himself last weekend but should be back for Monday's clash . ‘It’s still really early in the season, but I don’t think Hibs will be wanting to win any more than they would normally when they come to our place,’ McCoist added. ‘They were here earlier in the season and for long periods played really well. I would imagine Alan would have been delighted with that level of performance, if not with the result. So I don’t think because of their league position they will come and play any harder.’ Not that Rangers can afford to lose any more ground on leaders Hearts, either. A poor performance in a 1-1 draw at Alloa last weekend left the Ibrox men three points and three goals behind a Tynecastle side which entertain Livingston on Saturday. For so long the runaway leaders of Leagues One and Two, Rangers now find themselves recast as the men with ground to make up. ‘It’s not something that’s a shock to us,’ McCoist insisted. ‘We knew the league would be a massive step-up from the previous two seasons and when you lose the first game to Hearts, chances are you will be chasing them for a wee while anyway. Rangers' defeated Falkirk 3-1 in the League Cup on Tuesday with Dean Shiels grabbing the second goal . ‘We’re six games into it, it’s not really started the campaign, really. There are lots of points to be won and dropped. Hearts drew at Dumbarton and I felt the same way last week after the Alloa game - that might turn out to be a good point rather than two dropped. ‘Hearts are at the top and playing very well consistently. They had a good second half against Cowdenbeath last weekend. For the first time in a couple of years we are looking above us but it’s not a major shock or something we’re overly concerned with this early in the season.’ Regardless of the off-field concerns that are just part of the fixtures and fittings of Ibrox these days, Rangers fans at least have competitive football to embrace each week. If there was initially a novelty about turkey shoots against plumbers and plasterers of the lower divisions, it soon passed. McCoist (left) knows that there is a long way to go in the Scottish Championship season and Hibs could recover . Now engaged in what’s already an intriguing battle for an automatic return to the top flight, the days when indifferent league results just didn’t really matter are a thing of the past. ‘I think our players, in terms of their own self-motivation, have been commendable in the last couple of years,’ McCoist offered. ‘To go through a league season undefeated and with three draws would tell you that the motivation to go and play in all these league games has been fine. I really do think that. ‘You can argue about our levels of performance, of course you can, but in terms of motivation to go and play, the boys have been fine with that. ‘But I also think they are aware of the increase of the standard of the opposition and the better quality of grounds that we are going to, generally speaking, like Falkirk, Tynecastle, Easter Road and places like that. ‘So there’s an obvious step-up in everything. I think our motivation over the last two or three years has been absolutely fine, but it will have to stay at that level.’","Ally McCoist's Rangers  host Hibernian on Monday .

"Scotland's capacity to score goals that somehow manage to be both wondrous and worthless seemingly knows no bounds. From Archie Gemmill’s majestic solo strike against Holland in Argentina in 1978 to Gordon Strachan’s inch-perfect finish against the Germans in Mexico eight years later, Scotland seem to have cornered the market in tear-stained souvenirs for generations. When Ikechi Anya raced clear to beat Manuel Neuer and make it 1-1 in Dortmund last month, it briefly looked like the age-old script had been fed to the shredder. Sadly, it proved to be wishful thinking. Ikechi Anya scores past Germany for Scotland during their Euro 2016 qualifying match in Dortmund . Ikechi Anya can barely believe he scored against Germany for Scotland during their Euro 2016 qualifying match . Still, in the aftermath of that 2-1 defeat to the newly-crowned world champions, the Watford man rightly basked in his moment of glory. He took to Twitter to proclaim his amazement at putting one past the world’s finest goalie, something he admitted he couldn’t even do on his FIFA computer game. Endearing though Anya’s reaction was, nothing could dress up a familiar failing for the national team - that far too many of our finest moments down the years have ultimately counted for nothing. Sitting inside Ibrox on Monday, the kid from Castlemilk reflected on the high watermark of his football career with a rueful smile. When the subject turned to the need for it not to be merely a flash in the pan, he was typically on the front foot. ‘When you have that feeling you want to work twice as hard to relive it,’ he said. ‘I don’t want to be just the person who scored against Germany. Ultimately we lost the game so it wasn’t even a winner. ‘I’d like to be remembered as one of the team who qualified for 2016. The work ethic stays the same and nothing changes. Ikechi Anya sent this Tweet out after scoring against Germany for Scotland during Euro 2016 qualifying . Ikechi Anya took to Twitter to announce his surprise at scoring for Scotland against world champions Germany . ‘I don’t think the goal will change me drastically. When you play with higher quality players you will improve. I don’t think the confidence given to me by the gaffer will change. The view that we can achieve anything remains the way this squad feels.’ It’s not hard to see why Strachan has hung his hat on the 26-year-old. Notwithstanding the fact this boy can shift at a fierce rate of knots, he can play and he can finish. He also possesses an engaging, effervescent personality, and is a beacon of positivity and belief. The type you can’t have too many of. Such has been his impact for his country over the past year that, despite Watford sitting fourth in the Championship, Strachan feels bigger clubs – Celtic for one – would be a better fit. ‘In football, rumours are spread around all the time,’ Anya straight-batted. ‘Until things are concrete, I don’t think you can speculate. ‘I phoned him (Strachan after his comments) because I just wanted to thank him personally for what he’s said. The game against Germany was a year to the day basically to when I made my debut against Belgium. ‘I thanked him after my first cap and then when I saw the selfless comments I wanted to thank him again. He could play Premier League players ahead of me but he has faith and for that I’m grateful. ‘Having the confidence of a manager of that pedigree is only going to give you confidence. There is no fear when you walk onto the pitch and that is the best thing a player can have. That particularly applies to a player in my position, where you have to make things happen.’ Ikechi Anya: ‘I don’t think the goal will change me drastically. When you play with quality players you improve' Championship side Watford's winger Ikechi Anya is grateful to have his chance to perform for Scotland . Not a day passes when Anya doesn’ t reflect on his eventful journey to this point – via Castlemilk, Wycombe, Halesowen Town, a string of B teams in Spain then redemption via Glenn Hoddle’s academy that preceded a move to Watford. ‘I used to have to get three buses when I started my apprenticeship at Wycombe and I decided to live at home,’ he recalled. ‘I had to get up at 5.30am and get one bus to Oxford city centre, one to Wycombe and then another to the training ground. I’d always get there early and that’s why now I’m still at the training ground early.’ All those hard miles have been worth it in the long run. As the son of a Nigerian research assistant and a Romanian economist, Anya’s formative years were spent dreaming of one day running out at Ibrox. Come the visit of Georgia next month, he’ll finally have his way. ‘I didn’t go to games as a kid. I didn’t start playing football until I went to England because my dad wanted me to concentrate on my studies first. I used to watch the games on TV, though. ‘I hope my first game at the ground will now be for Scotland. This is the first time I’ve been in the stadium. ‘It is a bit crazy. As a kid, this is the team you support. When I approached the stadium today, I was like: “Wow!”. This is quite a big deal.’ Come October 11, the old place should be pulsating. If Germany away on the opening night was a shot to nothing, the clash with the Georgians offers no room for error. Home games against the flotsam and jetsam of Group D have to serve up no less than three points if qualification is to become a reality. Scotland face Georgia in their next Euro 2016 qualifying match on October 11 after the narrow Germany defeat . Scotland lost 2-1 to World Cup winners Germany but will look to take something from the Georgia clash . ‘Even against Germany, we went into that with the intention of trying to win it,’ Anya continued. ‘First half we were maybe a little tentative but we put on a good performance in the second - and we’re going to go into these two games (against Georgia and Poland) to win them. ‘I saw an interview with Stevie Naismith a couple of weeks back when he said this Scotland squad has more quality than any other he’s been in. ‘I haven’t been in previous squads but I know when I come here there is such intensity and quality in training. I am always impressed. ‘I can’t compare it to anything else and it is all relatively new to me, but I think we have as good as chance as anyone to qualify. ‘It is part of the progression going on in Scottish football that it will be regarded as failure if we don’t qualify. We need to assume that responsibility and qualify. If we use the performance against Germany as the bar, we’re going to win a lot of games.’ Tickets for Georgia v Scotland at Ibrox on October 11 are now available on public sale via www.scottishfa.co.uk or 0844 875 1873 .","Ikechi Anya scored past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, then took to Twitter to post: 'WOWWWW I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT ON FIFA'

"Had circumstances been different, Ronny Deila would have spent this week crawling around the cutting room floor seeking to lay his hands on the out-takes from last season’s ignominious League Cup exit to Morton. When things are so fragile and uncertain in the here and now, however, there is no need to rake throw the annals for examples of how it can all go so horribly wrong. Celtic presently have sufficient examples on file. If Sunday’s uninspiring display against Motherwell was perhaps understandable given its close proximity to a fine 2-2 draw in Salzburg, then the sequence it continued – just won win in seven competitive games – is a long way from what’s regarded as acceptable even in a period of transition. Ronny Deila's  will name a strong side for the visit of  Hearts  on Wednesday in the Scottish League Cup . Kris Commons scored a second-half penalty against Motherwell to salvage a point for Celtic at the weekend . It’s not hard to have a degree of sympathy with the Celtic manager’s current dilemma. Caught in the middle of a blizzard of games, the Norwegian’s instinct is to mix and match in the hope the burden can be shared with no adverse effect on results. The reality though – as the aforementioned results have underscored – is that even Deila’s first 11 barely stands up to scrutiny at this juncture. Far less when it relies heavily on the make-weights and the jersey-fillers. Hearts, like Morton a year ago, come to Glasgow’s East End tomorrow as a Championship club but that’s where the similarities end. The undefeated leaders and top scorers in the second tier, Robbie Nielson’s side would not cause the earth to stop spinning on its axis were they to win the tie. The Glasgow club suffered a humiliating 1-0 cup defeat to lower-league Morton exactly a year ago, and want to avoid a repeat against Scottish Championship side Hearts . For Deila, then, the only way to approach a potentially tricky chicane on what’s proving a difficult journey is to press the foot firmly to the floor. The experiments, such as initially omitting Scott Brown and Kris Commons as he did on Sunday, can wait for now. ‘We try to do that every time,’ Deila replied when asked if he’d field his strongest team. ‘This is an important game.’ Many of Deila’s predecessors uttered those same words ahead of games in this competition without truly believing them. Yet where the Norwegian differs from Martin O’Neill, Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon is that those men had the safety net of domestic and European success to fall back on if their fourth priority of the season came unstuck. Deila can ill-afford to be so choosy. For all he is being granted a degree of understanding by Celtic fans – with his eventual record at Stromsgodset being the sole basis for that faith – he appreciates that the promise of ‘jam tomorrow’ has a hollow ring at the club who now employ him. Celtic's players look relaxed in training, but they have struggled to click as a team this season . ‘This is the first trophy we can win and, as I’ve said all the time, both (domestic) cups are important,’ he added. ‘I know the League Cup is sometimes used for playing younger teams but we have used a lot of our squad the whole time. ‘I said when I came here this (the Treble) was a big goal for me and it’s a huge goal for the players as well. I think it has only been done three times before in the history of Celtic. Martin O’Neill the last in 2001? It would be fantastic if we could achieve that.’ In a league without Rangers, it’s by no means inconceivable that even this inconsistent, unconvincing Celtic side could yet come good and sweep the boards. But for that to happen, a radical improvement from all concerned would not come a minute too soon. ‘Some have done well, some have had ups and downs,’ Deila said of his fringe players. ‘Consistency is important and when we’ve changed a lot we’ve had some bad performances. ‘It’s much easier when you have the central line together (the spine of the team) then put players on. Deila has rotated his squad constantly this season, and has not yet settled on a regular 11 . ‘But against Inverness and Motherwell there were maybe too many changes. You saw it – when they are staying far back it’s hard to open them up when you don’t have the leadership from the centre. So that’s important. But if we play with more consistency it’s easier for them to adapt and get a good performance. ‘We want to (change the approach) but there are a lot of reasons why we do it. We’ve a long hard match programme and you have to give some players the opportunity to get match fit. That’s something we’re thinking of all the time. But this game (against Motherwell) there were maybe too many changes, you could see that in the first-half.’ That it’s taking time for Deila’s methods to take root should come as no surprise to anyone who studied his fortunes at Stromgodset. Winning the title with the little known side from Drammen was miraculous but it did not happen overnight. For the first two of Deila’s six years there, avoiding relegation was the priority. It goes without saying that Glasgow isn’t quite so tolerant. Winger Wakaso scored for Celtic against Salzburg on Thursday in the 2-2 Europa League draw . ‘Every day we get to know one another better and every day we work on improving one another individually and collectively,’ Deila said. ‘It’s not starting now, it’s a process all the time. I think the second-half on Sunday was a good performance. The defence was very good and we opened them up as well. But we needed the second goal and we didn’t do that. We made it difficult for ourselves in the first-half. ‘I want us to play even more together and be even better physically. Some of those players are coming in and some have been injured for a while. So they need to adapt and get fit and that’s taking more time than I would’ve wanted.’ If his own side have only impressed in fits and starts thus far, Deila appreciates that Hearts already have the look of a well-oiled machine. Genuine title and cup contenders without question. ‘I saw the game against Hibs on television and they played well that day and we had people at their match on Saturday to watch them,’ he said. ‘We have a good knowledge over how they are playing and they are doing very well this season so far. ‘It’s going to be a tough game - the players and I know it - but I’m looking forward to playing another game so we can bounce back from the result on Sunday.’","Ronny Deila will name a strong side for the match against Hearts .

"Joachim Low has spoken of his fear that his all-conquering German side will experience burn-out as they seek to add the European Championships to the World Cup they lifted in Brazil back in July. Jerome Boatang, Mats Hummels and Sami Khedira will sit out their country’s clash with Argentina in Dusseldorf on Wednesday evening – although only the latter remains a doubt for the Euro 2016 curtain-raiser with Scotland in Dortmund on Sunday. Just 52 days after watching Philipp Lahm lift the game’s biggest prize in Rio, Low is deeply concerned that a lack of proper rest for his star performers coupled with the demands of elite club football will adversely affect their chances of a smooth qualification passage. And Low – who has named Bastian Schweinsteiger as his long-term skipper despite the Bayern Munich man also being currently sidelined – intends to counter the burn-out issue throughout the qualifiers by drip-feeding uncapped players into his squad. Fears: Germany coach Joachim Low is worried his Germany players risk burn-out ahead of Euro 2016 . Management: Low intends to blood uncapped players throughout Euro qualifying to restrict their workloads . ‘It’s exciting that the Bundesliga has just begun but it’s clear there is a World Cup aftermath – the effect of playing lots of games in such a short period of time,’ he said. ‘Many players need more rest. Many have approached the season with knocks and problems that they probably inherited from the World Cup. ‘That will be a factor in the next few weeks and months. ‘It will be difficult for me and the Bundesliga coaches to bring all the players in their squads up to the same level. ‘We respect the qualifying system. But we have many young players trying to get into the squad, like Erik Durm (of Dortmund). ‘We have to give these players an opportunity when the established ones are ruled out for whatever reason. ‘So we definitely need this qualifying process to take the up and coming players by the hand – and allow them to be blooded for the highest level. ‘Look at Toni Kroos, for example. We might need to leave him out if he’s irreplaceable for Real Madrid. I have to accept that because sometimes World Cup tournaments can affect players’ stamina and physical condition. ‘It’s difficult for them to have just three weeks’ holiday and then go into pre-season training. They’ve been thrown into the deep end again very quickly. Out of action: Sami Khedira (left) and Mats Hummels (right) are among Germany stars out of action this week . ‘So it’s likely that they’ll fall into a “performance hole” and suffer a little crisis. That’s when other players have to step up to the mark. ‘For the established players, it’s been very hard for them to get back to normal in the Bundesliga so I need potential candidates in my squad to fill their positions.’ Low’s immediate thoughts are with a rematch against the nation they defeated in Rio to lift their fourth world title. But, with the more meaningful game against Gordon Strachan’s side lying around the corner, he admitted the Scots would not have been the team of choice to face in the first competitive game since the triumph in Brazil. ‘Scotland is the kind of team Germany have always struggled against,’ he added. ‘With Scotland’s sheer commitment and their running – they are a team who never give up no matter what the score is – then they are difficult opponents. Tight unit: Low and his now captain Bastian Schweinsteiger will lead the next wave of Germany players . ‘Their fans get right behind them and drive them on. ‘If you look at this group and the likes of Scotland and Ireland, they come across as similar teams. ‘They have similar playing styles, who excel for their passion and the physicality of their football. ‘We know this group is anything but easy because all the teams will try as hard as they can to make life difficult for us. ‘The likes of Scotland have not been at the last few tournaments so they will give their all to be at the next European Championships.’ While the focus must now be on the Euros, Low feels drawing a psychological line under what went on in South America may prove easier said than done. ‘It’s nothing that comes automatically and it’s almost impossible to tell players to forget the World Cup,’ he conceded. Last time out: Now-retired captain Philipp Lahm holds the World Cup trophy aloft in Rio de Janeiro . ‘It’s difficult for players to motivate themselves and be fully aware of the situation. ‘It won’t be easy but we want to win the game on Sunday. ‘Despite the fact we have some players missing we still have enough quality to beat opponents such as Scotland. ‘But, that said, it won’t be easy over the next few months. ‘We won’t have players playing at the same level because some will have personal ups and downs, physical difficulties. ‘Their bodies will demand a longer period of rest, so things will be different in the months ahead. ‘The players will be robbed of physical strength because of the World Cup. Rio was really great but the message has to be – let’s now focus on Paris 2016.

"Liverpool legend John Barnes believes Reds captain Steven Gerrard has been subject to unfair criticism following his side’s slow start to the 2014/15 Premier League campaign. Gerrard was criticised for a lacklustre performance last weekend as Liverpool lost 3-1 against West Ham in a game that saw the midfielder lose possession on 14 different occasions while winning just 25 per cent of his tackles. The 34-year-old has played every minute of Liverpool’s campaign so far, which has seen the Merseyside club lose three of their opening five Premier League games, but Barnes believes Gerrard can’t be the only player to shoulder the blame. John Barnes says it is unfair for Steven Gerrard to be the only one criticised for Liverpool's recent results . Barnes played for Liverpool for 10 years and scored 84 Premier League goals for the club . Speaking at the unveiling of Wembley’s new EE LED lighting system, Barnes told Sportsmail: ‘To say Gerrard is tired already is ridiculous.’ ’You can’t just criticise him, the team as a whole haven’t been playing well. ‘Gerrard is the best in the Premier League in that deep-lying role and it’s just a matter of the team getting confidence back.’ The former Liverpool and England winger is also confident his old club can recover from their slow start, but doesn’t think Rodgers’ side will be challenging for the title this season. Liverpool’s second-placed finish last term saw the Reds push Manchester City to the final day, but after three defeats in five games so far, Barnes believes a summer of changes will leave his old club battling for nothing more than a top four finish. Brendan Rodgers speaks with Gerrard during Liverpool's 3-1 defeat to West Ham last Saturday . Barnes says he still won't rule out Liverpool winning the Premier League title despite their bad start . ‘I make Chelsea favourites with City just behind them,’ Barnes added. ‘That’s not to say that Liverpool won’t get back to the form they were in last season, because they will. ‘It will just take time for the new players to get used to each other - there were a lot of changes of the summer, but I think Liverpool will still finish third or fourth. After losing £75million striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Rodgers looked to replenish his squad with seven new faces including former City forward Mario Balotelli, who sealed a £16m deal from AC Milan. Despite his bad-boy reputation, Barnes is confident Balotelli can become a star of the Kop, as long as the Italian ‘knuckles down’. He added: ‘I expect Balotelli to knuckle down and become a top player for the club. ‘I know that he’s a great player and if there’s a club where he can do right both on and off the field then it’s Liverpool. ‘Rodgers won’t be like Roberto Mancini and try and fight him in training. He will be handled in the right way. Mario Balotelli has arrived for £16m from AC Milan and Barnes expects him to shine at Anfield . Rodgers will probably deal with Balotelli in a different way to how Roberto Mancini did... Barnes (right, with Le Tissier and Le Saux) was speaking at the unveiling of Wembley’s EE LED lighting system . Speaking underneath the updated Wembley arch, which will now see thousands of LED lights react to moments such as goals scored, crowd noise and social media sentiment, Barnes believes the new technology will help the atmosphere at the iconic stadium. ‘This new technology will make watching a football match become an even more interactive experience as the lights change when the crowd cheer. ‘I can’t so that I’d have noticed such a thing as a player as I’d be concentrating on scoring, but I’m sure it will attract more fans to Wembley.’ The superfast 4G and fibre broadband provider, EE, has installed the world's fastest interactive LED lighting system on the Wembley arch.

"Neil Lennon quit as Celtic manager amid fears of cuts to his budget for the new season and the prospect of losing his most influential players ahead of a crucial Champions League qualifying campaign. Just hours after Sportsmail exclusively revealed Lennon’s impending departure, the news was confirmed in a lengthy club statement. Despite the amicable separation, it is understood there were frustrations behind the scenes. Certainly, after leading the current Scottish champions to three successive titles and two Scottish Cups as well as a place in the last 16 of the Champions League, Lennon was left wondering how much further he could take Celtic. But those concerns were magnified by his fears he would not have the financial clout to make the Champions League group stage for a third successive year — especially if key players Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk are sold this summer. VIDEO Scroll down for an emotional Neil Lennon praises staff as Celtic win the SPFL . Going out on a high: Neil Lennon has ended his four-year reign as Celtic manager . ‘I have supported Celtic all my life . and the club will always be part of me,’ said Lennon. ‘It was an . absolute honour to play for this great club, to captain the team and of . course to become Celtic manager, a position which I cherished dearly. ‘However, I feel the time is now right to move on to a new challenge. ‘Serving . the club was always a privilege. I have always given my best and aimed . to do all I can to ensure success for Celtic; as a supporter it was all I . wanted. ‘I will assist . the club in appointing my successor. As ever, we will need our fans’ support and I am sure they will give the club and the new manager the . same great backing which they gave to myself.’ Now the search is on for a new boss with club legend Henrik Larsson strongly linked with the post.Larsson . — currently in charge of Swedish club Falkenbergs — refused to rule . himself out of the running last night and said: ‘I can see myself back . at Celtic, but whether it’s now or in the future time will tell.’ Sportsmail . understands, however, Celtic have also made discreet enquiries via . third parties over former defender Malky Mackay’s availability. Mackay joins Owen Coyle, Jackie McNamara and Steve Clarke on an exhaustive list of potential appointments. Grateful: Lennon thanked all of his Celtic players as well as the 'magnificent' supporters . Former . Manchester United manager David Moyes will not put himself forward as a . candidate for the post, although Wigan boss Uwe Rosler is understood to . be interested. Lennon . will fly off on a family holiday today to consider his options ahead of a . stint as a BBC analyst at the World Cup Finals. He had been strongly . linked with the Norwich City post but that job was last night given to . Neil Adams, who had taken charge after Chris Hughton’s sacking. Lennon’s agent Martin Reilly said: ‘He has nothing lined up. Neil just feels now is the time to move on to the next challenge.’ Celtic . chief executive Peter Lawwell thanked Lennon for his efforts and said: . ‘When we appointed Neil as manager we did so knowing exactly what the . club meant to him and knowing he would give all he had. ‘He has delivered great success to our supporters domestically and has brought us back to the table in European football. ‘He will always be a part of the club and we wish Neil and his family nothing but success in the future.’ Lawwell will be keen to find a replacement soon with Champions League qualifiers beginning in just eight weeks’ time. ‘We . now embark on a new and exciting chapter for the club,’ Lawwell said. ‘We are sure our fans will give us their usual support as we aim to . bring them more and more success and continue to make Celtic a club they . can be proud of.’ Returning hero? Henrik Larsson has been installed as favourite to become new boss . Larsson . would be a popular appointment with the fans, although many question . his lack of experience for filing a high-pressure post. Sportsmail understands the Swedish icon is not a front-runner for the job despite bookmakers making the 42-year-old odds-on favourite. ‘When . I stopped playing and went into management I knew the Celtic job was . one that I would be linked with,’ Larsson said. ‘I have, and always will . have, a strong affection with the club. It’s not a question of whether . I’d be up for it. ‘At . the moment I’m only focusing on the job at Falkenberg. I can see myself . back at Celtic, but whether it’s now or in the future, time will tell.’ Falkenbergs . sporting director Hakan Nilsson has already denied contact from the . Parkhead club. Asked if he himself had held any talks, Larsson said . enigmatically: ‘Let me put it this way, I always have had good contact . with the people at Celtic and I continue to have good contact with the . club. ‘That’s all I am going to say. It’s up to you to work out if there’s been contact.’ The . Celtic legend took control of Falkenbergs in March after a spell at . modest outfit Landskrona. Neither club compares to the scale or demands . at Celtic and there is little in Larsson’s managerial career to suggest . he should be appointed as Lennon’s successor. Meet the new boss? Jackie McNamara and former team-mate Lennon discuss the good old days last month . In the running: Malky Mackay has been touted for a Celtic return too . Lisbon . Lion Bertie Auld addressed those concerns when he said of the Larsson . speculation: ‘Henrik Larsson is a fabulous name and the Celtic legions . adored him as a player. ‘However, the club need a steady pair of hands at the moment, someone who can hit the ground running. ‘With the greatest of respect, Henrik is not that man. ‘Sure, . he might put bums on seats, but my old club need a manager who can come . in right away to take control and start to organise things.’ Meanwhile, Dundee United defender Andrew Robertson insisted his boss Jackie McNamara has unfinished business at Tannadice. A . former Celtic captain, McNamara has had an impressive first season on . Tayside, and recently turned down an approach from Blackpool who were . impressed by his work building a thrilling side packed with talented . kids. Yet while . Robertson can understand why bigger clubs like Celtic would be very keen . to land the 40-year-old, he expects McNamara to be his boss next . season. ‘The manager is . going to be linked with Celtic but I think he is happy at United — and . he’s got unfinished business, as do we as players after the Scottish Cup . Final defeat. ‘But I . can understand 100 per cent why he would be linked.

Unfortunately for Lampard, the last thing on his mind was celebrating such a feat as he all but apologised for scoring his side's equalising goal against his beloved Chelsea. The 36-year-old has now overtaken former Manchester United striker Andy Cole, who held the record with goals against 38 different clubs.

The majority of Lampard's goals came during his fruitful 13-year spell at Stamford Bridge, where he became Chelsea's all-time record scorer with 211  in all competitions. The second-half strike was also his 172nd Premier League goal, putting Lampard just three goals away from joining Wayne Rooney and Thierry Henry as joint-third top scorers in Premier League history. Lampard, who played 648 times for Chelsea, came on for David Silva after 78 minutes with City trailing 1-0 but seven minutes later he scored to make it 1-1, which was how the game ended.

The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Stewart Downing, West Ham (34.1) Stewart Downing continued his bright start to the Premier League season with another assist during West Ham's win. The English winger also made two successful dribbles and produced two successful crosses on a memorable evening for the West Ham faithful. 8. Nikica Jelavic, Hull City (34.7) Nikica Jelavic scored a stunning volley to give his side a second half lead against Newcastle on Saturday in a performance that earned the striker a 34.7 score with EA's PPI index. The Croatian forward converted one of his two shots at St James' Park before seeing his side lose a two-goal lead after a double from Magpies striker Papiss Cisse. Nikica Jelavic (above) celebrates after his stunning volley against Newcastle last weekend . 7. Mile Jedinak, Crystal Palace (38.3) Neil Warnock's Crystal Palace side claimed an impressive scalp on Sunday with Mile Jedinak at the heart of his side's 3-2 win against Everton. Jedinak pulled his side back into the game with a 30th minute penalty while making five successful tackles as goals from Frazier Campbell and Yannick Bolasie ensured Palace would leave Goodison Park with a valuable three points. 6. Papiss Cisse, Newcastle United (38.7) Papiss Cisse may have finished just sixth in EA's PPI index, but his contribution will mean an awful lot more to under-fire Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. The Senegalese frontman pulled his side and his manager's future at St James' Park back from the brink with a second half brace to earn Newcastle a 2-2 against Hull. With the score at 2-0, Cisse scored in the 73rd and 87th minute to secure a point and keep Pardew in a job for another game. Cisse also managed to score his two goals from his only two shots at goal. Newcastle's Pappiss Cisse (above) saved a point for the Magpies with a brace against Hull . 5. Mesut Ozil, Arsenal (41.3) Mesut Ozil has been under scrutiny for the early part of the season after a number of lackluster performances. However, the German seemed to thrive in the No 10 role on Saturday as Arsenal romped to a 3-0 win against Aston Villa. Ozil managed one goal and one assist while completing 52 passes in Villa's half with a 92 per cent pass completion. 4. Danny Welbeck, Arsenal (41.5) Danny Welbeck moved a step closer to proving that he can be Arsenal's main man this season with his first goal in a Gunners shirt. Welbeck was central to Arsenal's first half salvo which saw Arsene Wenger's side three goals ahead with just 36 minutes on the clock. The former Manchester United man also made 25 passes in Villa's half with an impressive 96.9 per cent pass completion. Arsenal duo Danny Welbeck and Mesut Ozil (left) both feature in the Player Performance top ten . 3. James Morrison, West Brom (46.8) West Brom midfielder James Morrison scored his side's winning goal on Sunday as the Baggies grabbed a shock three points against Tottenham. Morrison's 74th minute striker was enough to earn West Brom their first Premier League win of the season as the Scottish international controlled play with 89.4 per cent pass completion rate. Leicester's Leonardo Ulloa scores from the penalty spot to make it 5-3 against United on Sunday . Ulloa continued his brilliant start to the season with two goals against Louis van Gaal's side . 2. Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester City (49.0) Leonardo Ulloa continued a brilliant start his his Leicester career with two goals for the Foxes as they stormed to a 5-3 win against Manchester United. The former Brighton striker pulled his side level with a 17th minute header before sealing Leicester's memorable victory with a penalty in the 83rd minute to give his side a 5-3 lead. 1. Jamie Vardy, Leicester City (60.9) Jamie Vardy deservedly takes this week's top spot with a PPI score of 60.9. The Foxes forward was a constant thorn in United's side on Sunday and was vital to Leicester's victory. Vardy managed to bag four assists as well as a goal for himself as Leicester returned a 3-1 deficit into a 5-3 victory. Rafael and Tyler Blackett fouled Vardy to hand the hosts two penalties, which were dispatched by David Nugent and Ulloa respectively. Vardy, who was plying his trade in the seventh tier of English football four years ago, also found the net in a frantic final half hour, as did Esteban Cambiasso, who was making his full debut. Vardy bagged one goal and four assists during the match as he steered Leicester to victory .

"It's far from the glamour tie Liverpool fans would have dreamed of upon the club's return to Champions League football as Brendan Rodgers' side take on Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets on Tuesday night. The Bulgarian champions earned their place in this season's top European competition thanks to a dramatic Champions League play-off win against Steaua Bucharest in August. Here, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about the 13-year-old club about to make their Champions League debut. Cosmin Moti (above) celebrates his first penalty save against Steaua Bucharest in August . The Romanian defender stepped in to help Ludogorets qualify for the Champions League group stages . Who are they? Their name is PFC Ludogorets Razgrad, to be precise, and they will be just the second Bulgarian team to make an appearance in Europe's elite competition - the other being Levski Sofia in the 2006-07 season, and they didn't gain a single point. That means, Ludogorets, which translates to 'The Wild Forest', only need to record one draw against Liverpool, Real Madrid or Basle to better their compatriots. Founded in 2001, the Razgrad club are just 13 years old. To put that in even starker context ahead of Tuesday, Steven Gerrard had already been playing in Liverpool's first team for three years. Their ground in Razgrad only holds 8,000 people and they will have to play their Champions League matches in the capital Sofia. Founded in 2001, Ludogorets will make their Champions League debut against Liverpool on Tuesday . Some teams have a bloke in a costume as their mascot, Ludogorets, known as The Eagles, have the real deal. After beating Lazio in Rome in February, the Italians were so impressed they gave their opponents a live eagle. Fans named it Fortuna, but they may have missed a sponsorship opportunity — one of the other names suggested was Nike. How did they get to the Champions League group stage? Promoted to the Bulgarian First Division in 2011, Ludogorets have managed to make history by winning three successive titles, largely thanks to the investments of businessman Kiril Domuschiev. Ludogorets' summer campaign to claim a place in this season's Champions League group stages caught the neutrals' eye after a dramatic penalty shootout win against Steaua Bucharest in August. As the tie was forced into extra-time, Romanian defender Cosmin Moti came to his side's rescue following the 119th minute dismissal of goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov. Moti, forced to wear the shirt of substitute keeper Ivan Cvorovic, was the hero of the night, scoring the first penalty for his side before making brilliant diving saves to deny Paul Pirvulescu and Cornel Rapa as Ludogorets won the shootout 6-5 to spark wild scenes. The club’s ground seats only 6,000 people and does not meet UEFA requirements, so their home games will be played 200 miles away in Sofia. Domuschiev has plans to build a new stadium for the club and one of the stands will be named after Moti. Brazilian playmaker Marcelinho (above) will be Liverpool's biggest threat at Anfield . Bulgarian league: 3x Winners 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14 . Bulgarian Cup: 2x Winners 2011-12, 2013–14 . Bulgarian Supercup: 2x Winners 2012, 2014 . One to watch . Brazilian forward Marcelinho has the creativity to cause Liverpool problems if he's given too much time on the ball. And with Rodgers claiming 'we have to defend better,' following Liverpool's 1-0 Premier League defeat against Aston Villa on Saturday, Marcelinho will be hoping to find the gaps between Liverpool's midfield and defence. Who will be kicking Mario Balotelli into Row Z? As long as he doesn't have to make another memorable cameo appearance in goal, Moti will be the one to let Super Mario know he's in a game. Ludogorets captain Svetoslav Dyakov will try and fill holes, but he may be pre-occupied with the forward running if Liverpool's man of the moment Raheem Sterling. Mario Balotelli (right) and Raheem Sterling will have to avoid the tough tackling of Cosmin Moti . Roman Bezjak (left) was the Europa League's third-highest goalscorer last season . How will they line-up? Georgi Dermendzhiev's side are likely to line-up in a 4-2-3-1 formation with their 2014 Europa League talisman, Slovenian striker Roman Bezjak, leading the line. Tuesday night's away side will try and settle into their own half and wait for chances on the counter-attack to make the most of their pacey wingers. Should Liverpool break down Ludogorets' defence, you'd expect Balotelli and Co to end up on top as the Bulgarians have a habit of conceding late on. Season so far . The Bulgarian champions haven't had the best of starts to their 2014-15 domestic campaign. Ludogorets have won just 15 points from eight games but that's enough to keep them in fourth, just two points off the pace behind CSKA Sofia.","Ludogorets will make Champions League debut vs Liverpool on Tuesday .

"Daniel Sturridge's latest injury while on international duty with England means the Liverpool striker has now been sidelined 11 times in the 20 months he's been at Anfield. The 25-year-old quickly became a fan favourite at Liverpool, scoring 36 goals in just 52 games following his £12million move from Chelsea in January 2013. His latest thigh injury, however, will keep Sturridge out of action for at least three weeks and has even prompted Reds boss Brendan Rodgers to hit out at England's treatment of the striker during the two week international break.

The former Manchester City youngster has now suffered six separate thigh injuries while at Liverpool adding to his previous hip, hamstring and ankle problems. Despite playing the full 90 minutes in each of Liverpool's three Premier League games so far and 89 minutes for England against Norway, Sturridge clearly has to be managed carefully if Rodgers is to get the most from his considerable talents. Discussing his player's latest injury, Rodgers said: 'We’re disappointed because we feel it’s an injury which could have been prevented . 'I think clubs work differently at times to international teams. It’s more the recovery strategy. When we look at our players here, we look at them individually in terms of what their needs are.'

"Manchester United head to the Black Country and a game at West Brom on Monday night with manager Louis van Gaal hoping for a performance and a result that will kick-start his reign at Old Trafford. The Dutch coach has said he needs a result similar to the Champions League win at Juventus that suddenly fired his Bayern Munich team in to life in December 2009. The Hawthorns may seem a long way from the Stadio Olimpico in Turin but if Van Gaal is to see his new team produce the first comprehensive performance of his time in the Barclays Premier League then here are five things that must happen. Radamel Falcao celebrates after scoring his first goal for Manchester United to secure a win against Everton . UNITED MUST KEEP GOING . After years of seeing United snatch results at the end of games, the reverse has been true this season. Sir Alex Ferguson revealed last year that his United teams actually used to practice scoring late goals in training. Van Gaal's players, though, don't seem to be able to play beyond an hour, having failed to score a single goal after 63 minutes in any competition all season. Juan Mata lifts a weight in training as Manchester United's players work on their strength and fitness . Their last two home games – wins against Everton and West Ham – saw United hanging on at the end, saved by goalkeeper David de Gea and a linesman's flag in those matches. Whether it is a psychological issue – indicative perhaps of a lack of confidence – or something to do with physical fitness, it is hard to say. Van Gaal's messages regarding his training sessions have been contradictory though – saying last Friday he has had to lower the intensity at Carrington – and he needs to find a way to get 90 minutes out of his players tonight. Louis van Gaal (left) and Ryan Giggs are yet to see United score after the 63rd minute this season . FIND THE REAL ROBIN VAN PERSIE . When Van Persie dived to head in Holland's equaliser in their opening World Cup game against Spain back in June, the bond between the United striker and his coach for club and country seemed clear. Since then, though, Van Persie has done little to suggest a return to the scoring heights of his first United season two years ago is imminent. He has not been dreadful this season, far from it. He has scored two Premier League goals, which is only one less than Wayne Rooney and is one more than Radamel Falcao. Robin van Persie has only netted two goals in six Premier League appearances under Louis van Gaal . However, the Dutchman is not the free-running irresistible force of two years ago and it is tempting to wonder if he would actually start on Monday night were Rooney not suspended. Rumours persist of ongoing problems with Van Persie's knee while an argument with team-mates during last week's Holland win over Kazakhstan saw him criticised by former captain Mark van Bommel. As we know, Van Persie likes to be the star of the show. Time to show that he deserves to be, perhaps. Van Persie (second from left) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring against Leicester City . KEEP THE BALL . Van Gaal is nothing if not honest and recently he hinted at a modern United issue when he said: 'I want to improve so we don't lose the ball so easily. That is our problem, not our defence. We are easily losing the ball but that is also the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline.' The days of United smothering opposition with possession seem a long time ago now. David Moyes' team certainly didn't do it and even the latter years of the Sir Alex Ferguson saw United play much more counter attacking football than they wished. Falcao, pictured tussling with Gareth Barry, may not be used to his defensive duties at Old Trafford just yet . Now that United have a team packed with ball players, it shouldn't be that difficult but one wonders if the likes of Falcao, Angel Di Maria and Juan Mata are prepared to do as much work in their own half as the Premier League tends to ask. After all, the first things good teams – really good teams – tend to do when they lose the ball is get it back again. FIND A SCREEN . United are away from home on Monday night and that usually dictates that a team will have to spend some time in their own half. West Brom may not be the most glamorous or talked-about team in the Premier League but they are quite happy to get on the front foot in front of their own supporters and that will certainly be the case early on at The Hawthorns. When that happens, United need to find a way to screen the back four. With Van Gaal playing so many attacking players each week, the demands on more defensively-minded players like Daley Blind simply increase. Daley Blind (right), pictured in action against QPR, has impressed in a defensive midfield role so far . Blind looks to be an exceptional purchase so far, a hard-working, intelligent player who buys in to the team ethic naturally and is happy to do his bit without the need for fanfare. However, against the Baggies he will need some help from whoever players alongside him. Ideally it would be Michael Carrick, who brings some height and physicality to the role. However he is not quite fit so if the Spaniard Ander Herrera is pressed into action despite the pain of his rib injury he will need to sacrifice a little of his naturally offensive tendencies to help protect what continues to be a rather uncertain United back four. Ander Herrera may need to play a more defensive role against West Brom at The Hawthorns . KEEP THE ANGEL FLYING . With Rooney serving the second game of his suspension and nobody sure what we are going to get from players like Van Persie and Mata, it is imperative that the talented Di Maria continues his good form. Di Maria has taken to life in the Premier League without breaking stride and his performances for Van Gaal have been a consistent bright spot of United's rather up and down season so far. Angel di Maria has three goals and three assists in five Premier League appearances for the Red Devils . The great thing about a free-running forward like Di Maria is that he attracts players to him when he has the ball – and to a lesser degree when he hasn't – and that spreads uncertainty in a defence and, of course, leave spaces open for other players to exploit. United haven't really had anything like this since Cristiano Ronaldo left and the similarities between the two players are clear. Ronaldo could be devastating away from home as United flew at teams on the counter and Di Maria can be the same in the Black Country. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Graziano Pelle would likely be selling coffee out of a van on the sandy-coloured streets of Lecce, in southern Italy, with his father Roberto had he not met Louis van Gaal in 2007. If he had listened to his mother he may not even have been a footballer - she wanted him to become a professional dancer. At the age of 13 he was Italy's Latin-American dance champion, partnering his older sister Fabiana. His father wanted him to play football and he choose that route instead. But it has been far from a straightforward one. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Koeman praising Pelle impact . Louis van Gaal talks to Graziano Pelle while the two were at AZ Alkmaar together in Holland . The Southampton forward celebrates scoring the winning goal against Malta on his debut for Italy . The Southampton striker's career was floundering in Italy, struggling for consistent form at Lecce, who he joined as a teenager, and during loan spells at three lower-league Italian sides. But then Van Gaal, in charge at AZ Alkmaar, brought a 22-year-old Pelle over to Holland and while he was still not prolific in front of goal he helped them win the Eredivisie in 2009 during a four-year spell. Van Gaal is renowned for his faith in young players and it was for that reason that Pelle decided to leave his native Italy to try elsewhere. The Italian forward has been a huge success at Southampton, scoring five goals in his first eight games . The 29-year-old poses with his September Premier League player of the month award at St Mary's . VIDEO Koeman praises Pelle impact . 2005-06: Lecce, 10 apps, 0 goals . 2005-06: Crotone 17 apps, six goals . 2006-07: Cesena, 37 apps, 10 goals . 2007-08: AZ Alkmaar, 27 apps, three goals . 2008-09: AZ Alkmaar, 20 apps, three goals . 2009-10: AZ Alkmaar, 13 apps, two goals . 2010-11: AZ Alkmaar, 18 apps, six goals . 2011-12: Parma, 11 apps, one goal . 2011-12: Sampdoria, 16 apps, one goal . 2012-13: Parma, one app, 0 goals . 2012-13: Feyenoord, 29 apps, 27 goals . 2013-14: Feyenoord 28 apps, 23 goals . 'If he'd never met the Dutch guru [Van Gaal], as well as Ronald Koeman, maybe my son would now be a carpenter or he'd be sitting with me in my van, selling coffee,' said Pelle's father in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport. Pelle had managed just 16 goals in two seasons in Italy, but the move to Holland is considered to have launched his career – and it is where he was given his 'Italian Stallion' nickname, which needs little explaining. But if the Manchester United manager is to take the plaudits for introducing Pelle to the Dutch league, it is Koeman who must be given credit for sculpting him into the fearsome goalscorer he has become. Pelle has been a very late developer in the game when it comes to finding the net. After AZ he returned to try his hand in Italy once more, this time for Parma, but was again frustrated and loaned out first to Sampdoria before Koeman – at this point in charge at Feyenoord – took him on loan in 2012. Pelle scored  50 goals in 57 games for Dutch side Feyenoord before Southampton paid £8million for him . Ronald Koeman must also be given some credit for developing Pelle both at Feyenoord and Southampton . It was then, just two years ago, that everything clicked into place. Pelle netted 11 times in his first 10 games, had agreed a deal to make the move permanent by January and ended the season as the Eredivisie's second top-scorer with 27 goals. During his two seasons in Holland he scored 50 goals in 57 league games before Koeman took Pelle with him to Southampton for £8million. Five goals in his first eight Saints games finally earned him a first call-up to the national team, at the age of 29, by Italy manager Antonio Conte, where he scored the winner against Malta. Despite numerous attempts to prove himself in his native country, Pelle always struggled in Serie A . Pelle is modelling himself on Luca Toni, a similarly powerful forward who also blossomed late in his career . 'Finally somebody has noticed that there was an Italian who scored 64 goals [in all competitions] in Holland,' Roberto added. 'It's going to be good fun with Conte. Graziano has confided in me that he sees a lot of Van Gaal in him.' After the match, presenter Donatella Scarnati, on Italian TV channel RAI, introduced him as a 39-year-old by accident. Pelle responded to questions about his age with, 'Better late than never.' He is looking to Luca Toni, similar in his powerful forward play and in developing late, as inspiration and wants to win as much as he did. Toni, who lead the line for Italy between 2004 and 2009, has the 2006 World Cup plus Bundesliga trophies to his name. 'Dancing with the Stars can wait,' Pelle added to Scarnati, with a smile.","Graziano Pelle could have sold coffee for a living or been a dancer .

"Selhurst Park reduced Luis Suarez to tears and bore witness to John Terry curling up into a ball like an upset child last season. In both instances it was was the theatre in which Crystal Palace performed minor miracles to derail two title challenges and save themselves from relegation. When Jose Mourinho told his Chelsea players they were away to Palace in March, most of them had no idea where it was. Crystal Palace will be determined to use home advantage to shake up the Premier League again this season . John Terry curls up in a ball having headed the ball into his own net to hand Palace all three points last term . Luis Suarez is reduced to tears ad helped by  Steven Gerrard following Liverpool's capitulation at Selhurst Park . Scroll down for a brief history of the Eagles . They were on a title charge; top of the league since the beginning of February and with only six games remaining. Mourinho looked set to display yet another stroke of genius by winning the Barclays Premier League in his first season back without a striker of any form or ability all season. But then they met Tony Pulis's team full of guts and bravery who battled to 1-0 win – thanks to Terry's own goal – which sent Chelsea off course. The Palace fans still sing about it, fondly remembering Terry curled up – both hands clasped around his head – in his own penalty area after heading past Petr Cech. Afterwards, Mourinho was asked what his players lacked and simply wrote 'balls' on a piece of paper. Terry climbs above Palace midfielder Joe Ledley in a bid to clear the danger but heads the ball into his own net . Goalkeeper Petr Cech speaks to Terry following the own goal as the Chelsea skipper puts his hand on his head . Most of the Chelsea squad had no idea where Crystal Palace was ahead of last season's clash in March . Members of the Blues squad weren't aware Selhurst Park was just 9.7 miles from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, asked what his players lacked at Palace, simply wrote 'balls' (below) It's safe to say this season his squad will not need an A to Z of London to find Selhurst Park and they will be sure to pack a few extra match-day balls on the team bus. Chelsea are steamrollering the league with six wins and a draw in their seven games, but Neil Warnock, who replaced Pulis, is not about to let his side be flattened. 'It has got to be a super-human effort,' Warnock said. 'Jose is on about players going through brick walls for him. 'You want your players to do things on a match day and show how much they care, and it's lovely when that happens.' Chelsea have rocketed to the top of the Premier League with six wins and a draw in their seven games so far . Diego Costa, who arrived at Stamford Bridge from Atletico Madrid, is the current Premier League top scorer . But he will not be going back through a DVD of the match last season for any tips on how to mastermind victory. 'No I won't,' he added. 'Some of our players are different. Certainly some of their players are different. You have got to concentrate a little bit more on yourself than the opposition. 'I thought they would have won the league last year with a striker.' Crystal Palace's famous red and blue support will be out in force this Saturday for the visit of Chelsea . Crystal Palace boss Neil Warnock admits it will have to take a super-human effort to defeat leaders Chelsea . Selhurst Park was pivotal yet again in the title race when, with two games to play, top-of-the-league Liverpool visited. In the famous 'Crystanbul' night, dubbed so by Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel, they came from three goals down to draw, with three goals in the final 10 minutes. The result left Suarez weeping on the pitch. The body language of the shellshocked Liverpool players suggested they feared the worst and Rodgers conceded the title race in his post-match interview. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez sobs on the picth after Crystal Palace staged an incredible comeback to draw 3-3 . Reds captain Steven Gerrard consoles a devastated Suarez as the Liverpool went on to miss out on the title . Crystal Palace striker Dwight Gayle shoots and scores to  level the scores on the night of 'Crystanbul' They must put something in the water at Selhurst Park; the old-style stands get filled to the rafters with 26,000 fans whose energy crackles and sparks through the cold autumn and winter air. Warnock said: 'If you're an away team manager, you don't even know when to leave your hotel; it could take half-an-hour or two hours. The dressing rooms have hardly changed. It brings people down to earth. It’s special. It’s intimidating. It’s an old-fashioned ground. 'Palace fans love the name, love the club and they love the ground. It’s still the worst place in the world to get to!' Perhaps Mourinho will pack the A to Z on Saturday afternoon, just in case. Having said last season that some of his players hadn't heard of Crystal Palace before their shock 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park, Jose Mourinho will surely have told his side to brush up on their history before Saturday's clash. Here's 10 things his players should know about the south London club... 1. Crystal Palace were founded in 1905. 2. Palace first reached the old First Division in 1969. 3. In 1973, under the management of Malcolm Allison, Palace change their kit from white with a red and blue sash to their current red and blue stripes. They also changed their nickname from the Glaziers to the Eagles. 4. After winning promotion back to the First Division under Terry Venables in 1979, Palace were famously dubbed the 'team of the Eighties'. Two years later, Palace were relegated after Venables had left for QPR and England left back Kenny Sansom had joined Arsenal, sparking a player exodus. 5. Their highest League finish is third place in 1990-91, the same season they won the Zenith Data Systems Trophy at Wembley. 6. That season Palace finished above Manchester City (5th), Manchester United (6th) and 20 points clear of Chelsea in 11th. 7. The year before, Palace reached their one and only FA Cup final, losing 1-0 in a replay to Manchester United. 8. Palace hold the record for the highest number of points to be relegated from the Premier League with (49 in 1992-93, a 42-match season). 9. The only time four teams have been relegated from the top flight, Palace finished fourth-bottom (1994-95). 10. Twelve players have earned England caps while at Palace, the last being Wilfried Zaha in November 2012.","Crystal Palace derailed Liverpool and Chelsea title challenges last season .

"Roy Hodgson insists he did not mean to cause offence by making his ill-judged comment about Wayne Rooney's Scouse accent – because his wife is from Liverpool. The England manager was defending his captain's ability to get his message across to the players when he said: 'Everyone knows Wayne is not the sort of person, with his Liverpool accent, who is going to be able to stand up in front of a lecture room of people. 'But he doesn't need to. All he has to do is make certain the players he is talking to understand where he is coming from.' Hodgson, in his pre-match press conference ahead of England facing San Marino on Thursday night, revealed that he offered an apology to Rooney. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson say he didn't mean to offend Wayne Rooney . Roy Hodgson says he did not mean to cause offence when he commented about Wayne Rooney's accent .

The England squad arrived at Watford on Thursday ahead of tomorrow's match at Wembley Stadium . Rooney (centre) will lead England for the second time since his permanent appointment as captain . Hodgson said: 'Wayne knows I would never wish to offend him or anyone from Liverpool – my wife is from there. 'I apologised to him for the headlines but he didn't even want one. And I've had no problem with my wife.' With Kevin Pietersen's allegations of bullying in the England cricket dressing room still fresh in the public consciousness, Hodgson was quick to point out that he has never had any such issues with the Three Lions and insisted the spirit within the dressing room was good. Hodgson was also quick to add that team spirit within the England squad dressing room is good . The England boss (centre) added that he has never had an issue during his two years in charge to date . 'I've been very lucky in the two years or so that I've had the privilege of leading the team. I must say I've haven't noticed any problems like that,' he said. 'I'm not particularly patting myself on the back or anyone on the back because dressing rooms can be very difficult places.' He added: 'We haven't had that problem, we work very hard not to have that problem and we are working very hard at the moment to make sure that we are all singing off the same hymn sheet, that we are taking ownership of what we're trying to do. Hodgson also revealed his delight at the form of Danny Welbeck leading up to England's two European Championship qualifiers. The form of Danny Welbeck since his £16million move to Arsenal has also pleased Hodgson . The 23-year-old scored his first professional hat-trick for Arsenal against Galatasaray earlier in the month and Hodgson is happy to see him hitting form with Daniel Sturridge absent due to injury. 'There have been periods and moments when for him it has not always been easy because he hasn't got an enormous amount of game time and he's had to spend a lot of time waiting for his chance,' he said. 'It's great now that he's made his move and he's one of the first names on the team sheet and I'm pleased for him. 'But he's taken that chance by playing well in the games he's done so far.' The 23-year-old (centre) is expected to partner Rooney in attack for England vs San Marino and Estonia . Rooney was also quick to praise his former Manchester United team-mate, hailing the Gunners' striker qualities. 'Daniel is a fantastic footballer and sometimes he doesn't get the credit he deserves,' Rooney said. 'As a footballer he is very intelligent and obviously he's very quick and athletic.

"Neil Warnock believes that Jose Mourinho is the nearest manager he has come across to Brian Clough. Warnock's Crystal Palace side host Mourinho's high-flying Chelsea on Saturday, up against who he considers to be the best boss currently in the game. Like Clough, one of the greatest English managers, Mourinho is not shy to share his opinion but has won the silverware to back it up. Neil Warnock, then Sheffield United manager, is pictured alongside Jose Mourinho at Bramall Lane in 2006 . Mourinho applauds the Chelsea travelling faithful after the Champions League clash against Sporting Club . Warnock said: 'I think he's the nearest thing to Cloughie. He's that type. He's a player's manager but he doesn't keep the players in his pocket. 'He says it how it is. He always wants his teams to play well. Tactically, in difficult games, he's always spot on.' Chelsea have already opened up a five-point gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League and are unbeaten this season with eight wins and two draws in their 10 games. Last season, in Mourinho's first campaign of his second spell at the club, he pushed them to within four points of champions Manchester City. Last year Mourinho was without a free-scoring striker and moved swiftly to rectify that by signing Diego Costa in the summer, who has taken the Premier League by storm with nine goals already. Warnock's second spell as Crystal Palace manager has started in positive vein . Mourinho learnt his trade from one of the very best in the shape of the late Sir Bobby Robson at Porto . Warnock remembers fondly when Mourinho first joined the Premier League 10 years ago. 'When he came on the scene I was at Sheffield and he was such a good-looking so and so,' Warnock added. 'That started it off without even being a good manager. 'He has signed well. It is alright having money but he knew he didn't have a striker last year. 'In the January window if he had signed a striker he would probably have won the title last year. This year they have signed at least two quality players and are a little notch above everyone else. 'I think he is the best there is – I always have done.' Warnock has rubbished speculation he is being lined up for a move upstairs in the boardroom at Palace . Elsewhere, Warnock has rubbished speculation that he is being lined up for a move to the Selhurst Park boardroom. The 65-year-old replaced Tony Pulis in the managerial hotseat at Palace in August, penning a two-year deal in the process. And Warnock insists there is plenty of life left in him yet. He added: 'I'm not ready [to move upstairs]. I will take the story with the pinch of salt. 'I know nothing about it. I'm afraid I'm not into that at the minute, I'm just concentrating on managing. 'You are going to get rumours like that. I have come to help Palace out and I'm really enjoying it.'","Neil Warnock regards Jose Mourinho as the best manager in the game .

"Paris Saint-Germain were made to pay the price for a raft of missed chances by Edinson Cavani when Monaco scored an equaliser deep into stoppage time. Lucas Moura looked to have saved the blushes of his misfiring team-mate when he sent PSG ahead. But substitute Anthony Martial took advantage of some shocking defending by David Luiz and Co. in PSG's defence to level the score. VIDEO Scroll down for the top five goals in Ligue 1 from September . Monaco substitute Anthony Martial scored in the closing stages of the match to hand his side a point . Martial was congratulated by his team-mates after scoring late on against Paris Saint-Germain . Super sub Martial was mobbed by his Monaco colleagues after scoring in the dying stages of his side's match . PSG's Lucas Moura was congratulated by Javier Pastore after opening the scoring at Parc des Princes . Moura wheeled away in celebration after scoring past Monaco shot stopper Danijel Subasic . Paris Saint-Germain: Sirigu, Van der Wiel, Camara, David Luiz, Maxwell, Moura, Motta, Verratti (Bahebeck 47), Matuidi, Pastore (Cabaye 77), Cavani. Subs not used: Douchez, Aurier, Chantome, Digne, Augustin. Goal: Lucas Moura 71. Monaco: Subasic, Fabinho, Kurzawa, Carvalho, Raggi, Dirar (Silva 66), Moutinho, Bakayoko (Germain 86), Ferrerira, Kondogbia, Ocampos (Martial 76). Subs not used: Stekelenburg, Santos, Elderson, Thiam. Goal: Martial 90. On this display it was hard to see why Manchester City have bid for Cavani in recent years and why Arsenal and Chelsea have both shown interest in him. The Uruguayan striker has been criticised in France for failing to live up to his £55million price tag when he moved from Napoli last year. In the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, out with a heel injury, the 27-year-old has been handed the chance to drive the team forward. But on a night when virtually everything he tried went wrong, PSG had to rely on the sprightly Moura to finally find the net. It began going wrong in the first half. On 38 minutes, he rose highest at the near post in an attempt to reach Maxwell's cross from the left only to flick the ball, taking it off the head of Blaise Matuidi who would surely have opened the scoring. Instead it was the away side who had came closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening 45 minutes. The home side were left frustrated as they struggled to find a way past Ligue 1 rivals Monaco . PSG trio Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti and  Blaise Matuidi react after missing an opportunity . Monaco's chance came a minute before the break, Joao Moutinho passing into Layvin Kurzawa who sent a first-time shot crashing off the crossbar. And Cavani's night got no easier early in the second half. He did well on 57 minutes to turn one way and the next before laying the ball off to substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck, who forced Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic into a smart save at his near post. But two minutes later he swung wildly at the ball on the edge of the box, completely mistiming his shot, and the ball bobbled before being cleared high into the air. As Cavani looked up, it was hard to tell if he was following the flight of the ball or pleading to the football gods for mercy. If it was the latter, they failed to listen as a minute later he was played in by Thiago Motta, burst through on goal then fell over. PSG were fortunate the score remained goalless just after the hour when the ball dropped to Kurzawa and he had just defender Gregory van der Wiel to beat but struck a weak shot so that the PSG man could fling a leg at the ball to divert it wide. Finally, the home side found a player who could stick the ball in the net, when the whippet-like Moura stole in a the back post to put PSG ahead in the 71st minute. That seemed like it would be enough for all three points, until PSG failed to clear in second-half stoppage time and Martial took a touch before finishing with a low strike. Laurent Blanc thought his side were feeling the effects of their impressive 3-2 win against Barcelona on Tuesday. 'They were very tired after the Barcelona game. We have done a marathon, this was our seventh game in 23 days. It’s not illogical that the lads were at the end of the road. 'I am not worried. Marseille are top and deserve it. But they don’t play in Europe, don’t forget.' Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim, on the other hand, thought his side were unlucky not to grab all three points.

"Stuart Nelson was in the dugout recalling his heroics from that evening when, through a gap in the stands, he saw a coach drive off in the corner of his eye. The 33-year-old was recounting, excitedly, the best night of his career; his 100th appearance for Gillingham, a first game back from injury in two months, how he had thrown his hat in the ring for a penalty, saved two, then struck the decisive one as they knocked Colchester out of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. Halfway through speaking to the local press and club media after the game at Weston Homes Community Stadium on Tuesday night, he was sure it could not possibly be his team coach departing for the 70-mile journey back. Gillingham goalkeeper Stuart Nelson had to hitch a lift home after missing the team coach . Nelson scored the winning penalty for his side, but was left behind by the team bus after the game . 'I could see through the corner of the stand a coach in the distance leaving,' Nelson recalls. 'It was dark, but I could just make it out. I was still talking and in the back of my mind I thought, “Nah it can't be ours.”' Afterwards, Nelson headed back to the changing room to find everyone and rejoin their celebrations which would continue on the coach back. But only those sorting out kit and equipment who travel in a separate transit van remained. He asked the club's sports scientist James Russell where everyone was. 'His face dropped,' Nelson says, laughing. 'He knew it had gone. He said he would call them back, if I wasn't sorted they would've come back, but I told him it's fine I'll get a lift. 'You couldn't knock me that night, if I had to walk back I would have done. I would've floated. 'I was on cloud nine. I was buzzing, it's one of those night's in football you never forget. 'It was a dream comeback for me. As a 'keeper you don't get many times where you score the winner. 'You're there to save and you can only save what's in front of you. For it to all work out that way was special.' Nelson jumped into the back of a Volkswagen with the club's media officer Phill Catterick, club photographer Barry Goodwin and Kent Messenger reporter Luke Cawdell. Most of the team were part of a group message on WhatsApp Messenger – they had all bought EuroMillions tickets for that night and used it to see if anyone had won – and Nelson text them saying he could not believe he had been left behind.

'I got a lot of abuse from the boys,' Nelson explains. 'Everyone on there was laughing. I think some of the players stitched up our assistant manager Andy Hessenthaler, it's his job to count everyone on the bus. 'I sit right at the back and maybe some of them told him I was already on there.' With all the jokes aside, Gillingham still had an internal investigation as to what went wrong, to make sure it does not happen again. The punishment, however, was not as serious. 'The way we deal with things is we put the man on the centre spot at the training ground and balls are put all the way around the centre circle,' Nelson reveals. 'Then all the players pelt them at him. 'Hessey took a few off the lads. Some of the culprits that stitched him up must've got to do it! It was a bit of fun. It's all done and dusted.' Although this is the first time Nelson has been left behind by the team bus, it was not the first time he scored the winner in a penalty shoot-out. In a League Cup match for Brentford, away to Swindon in 2006, he saved one, saw another fly over the bar and stepped up, again, to bag the winner. 'I'm always up for taking penalties,' he explains. 'I strike the ball well. But they don't come around much for a 'keeper, it depends who wants to take one.' That night, he managed to make it on the bus home. Missing one will surely not happen again at Gillingham on Hessenthaler's watch. 'He'll make sure he walks up to the back of the coach next time and not trust the boys,' Nelson jokes.","Stuart Nelson scored the winning penalty on his 100th appearance for Gillingham .

"Ricardo Carvalho has warned Premier League defenders that Monaco team-mate Radamel Falcao is on the verge of realising his frightening goalscoring potential on loan at Manchester United. The striker, who completed a £6million season-long loan move in the summer ahead of a £43.5m permanent deal, is yet to find the net in his first three United games. But with Wayne Rooney banned for three matches, there is increased pressure on the Colombian to open his account for the club. Radamel Falcao is yet to score in three Premier League appearances so far for Manchester United . The Colombian forward vying for the ball with West Ham's Aaron Cresswell during their 2-1 win last Saturday . Monaco defender Ricardo Carvalho (bottom) tacking Zenit's Hulk during their 0-0 Champions League draw . Falcao arrived in England with a fearsome goal-scoring reputation, but has so far drawn a blank. But Monaco defender Carvalho warned: 'He doesn't need too much time. He's a striker that smells the goal and is dangerous in the box. Always when he gets the opportunity to score, he will score. 'The Premier League is a tough league to play in, but I think he'll do well and score there. 'He has that thing with him when he gets a half chance he will score. He's a great striker and a great professional.' According to Carvalho, Falcao was intent on leaving Monaco when he started to hear of interest from Real Madrid and Manchester United in the summer. Falcao knows the Spanish La Liga well due to his his two years at Atletico Madrid, so began asking Carvalho about the Premier League. Carvalho spent six years playing in the top flight at Chelsea – where he won three titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups – and is well-versed in what it takes to succeed in England. Falcao is set for a more prominent role in United's attack following the suspension of Wayne Rooney . The 28-year-old has been in training ahead of United's game against Everton on Sunday . Being a centre-back, he is also aware of what forwards require to cope with and flourish in a league known for its brutal and unforgiving nature. 'For him it would've been easier to go back to Spain,' Carvalho added. 'But he wants to try the Premier League. It is physical and strong and there is more pace. 'When he heard Manchester United were interested he wanted to try it. He was speaking with us about the Premier League. He knows the Spanish league also, but he was asking about the Premier League. 'For me the Premier League is the best. Real Madrid is a big club and Barcelona too, but I enjoy the games more in England than when I was in Spain. Also the way Falcao plays, I said that for me it's the best for him.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Chesterfield FC defender Georg Margreitter's unusual surname has earned him free pizza for the rest of the season courtesy of Domino's. The Wolves loanee had already been nicknamed 'Pizza' by fans and teammates alike, despite the differences in spelling between his name and the tomato, mozzarella and basil classic. Chesterfield defender Georg Margreitter has been given free pizza for the rest of the season by Domino's . The 25-year-old Austrian says it's the first time his 'Pizza' nickname has ever paid off . The Chesterfield branch of Domino's invited the defender down for a pizza making session . His local branch of Domino's even invited the Austrian to try his hand at making a few slices ahead of his team's League One derby clash with Sheffield United on Saturday. The 25-year-old said: 'The pizza nickname has always come with the territory, but this is the first time it’s paid off! 'With such a high intensity training programme it’s great to be able to treat myself and get the energy levels back up'. Margreitter is currently on loan from Wolves after spending last season with FC Copenhagen . Margreitter arrived at Chesterfield from Wolves where he fell out of favour with manager Kenny Jackett and spent most of last season at FC Copenhagen. At the time, Chesterfield manager Paul Cook told the club’s website: ‘Georg’s career in English football has never really got going, for one reason or another. 'But he had successful spells in Austria and Denmark and we believe he’ll be a useful addition to the squad.’","Chesterfield defender Georg Margreitter gets free pizza for rest of season .

"Rio Ferdinand has hit back at Lord Ouseley after he accused the QPR defender of using Kick It Out as a ‘punchbag’ and selling a ‘book of trivia.’ Ferdinand believes that the anti-racism campaigners should have used the John Terry court case as an opportunity to support his family. Rio Ferdinand (left) has hit back at Kick It Out chief Lord Ouseley (right) John Terry was found guilty by the FA of aiming racist abuse towards then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand . But the former England and Manchester United centre-back feels that they shied away at a crucial time. Speaking at the launch of his #2sides book, Ferdinand said: ‘This was a huge world wide issue, all the cameras in the world were on it. ‘Over my career I’ve always been asked to wear a T-shirt and I’ve always done that to give the organisation that exposure it needs to keep spreading the word. ‘This opportunity comes and my question to them is you wear a T-shirt in the way to that court room. You let people know what this is about and that you’re here. Anton's older brother Rio Ferdinand partnered John Terry at the heart of England's defence for several years . ‘Not just for my brother but you’re here for two brothers in a racism case. And you’re part of it, you’re the organisation there standing shoulder to shoulder with these guys. They didn’t. ‘If you went out and spoke to Joe Bloggs in the street and said, “What was the guy like? What was his name? Was there a guy from Kick It Out there?” ‘They wouldn’t be able to give you the slightest answer. Exposure, tell people you’re involved. Why’re you scared? They’ve been waiting for this type of case to give them exposure. This is the time. Why turn away from it?’ Ferdinand insisted he did not have a problem with Lord Ouseley and that he did not want argue with the Kick It Out chairman. Anton refused to shake the hand of  Terry during a match between QPR and Chelsea in September 2012 . But he hopes that if a similar situation arises again they will make the most of it in future. ‘I haven’t got a feud with Lord Ouseley,’ he added. ‘He can say what he wants I’m not really bothered. ‘The time came for them to stand up, be there and be seen and they weren’t. ‘I hope when my kids get older and something like this happens that we all have learned from it and it’ll be dealt with a bit different.’ Rio (left) refused to wear a Kick It Out T-shirt before Manchester United's game against Stoke in 2012 .

"England travel to Estonia on Sunday having won their opening two European Championship qualifying matches. Roy Hodgson's men followed up September's 2-0 victory in Switzerland with a 5-0 win against San Marino at Wembley on Thursday night. Here, Sportsmail looks at the three men who will be looking to ruin England's perfect start. Lithuania's Saulius Mikoliunas (second from right) scores to secure a 1-0 win against Estonia in qualifying . Estonia's Karol Mets (right) battles for the ball with Lithuania's Mindaugas Kalonas (left) in Vilnius on Thursday . Waddle’s midfield partner . Magnus Pehrsson . Position: Manager . Age: 38 . Previous clubs: Djurgardens, Aalborg, GAIS, IK Sirius, Atvidabergs FF . Only hardcore Bradford City fans will remember Pehrsson’s one-month loan spell in England. With Chris Kamara in charge of the side in 1996, Pehrsson played just once, alongside Chris Waddle in central midfield. Estonia manager Magnus Pehrsson will be hoping to ruin England's perfect start to qualification . Pehrsson played alongside Chris Waddle (pictured) for Bradford during a loan spell back in 1996 . Manchester City may also remember Pehrsson. He was manager of Danish side Aalborg, who almost knocked them out of the UEFA Cup in 2009. City were cruising 2-0 ahead from the first leg and there were five minutes to play in the second with the score goalless when Aalborg netted twice, including a stoppage-time penalty. Shay Given was the eventual hero as City edged through 4-3 on penalties. Pehrsson has also worked alongside England manager Roy Hodgson on a number of occasions as a pundit for Swedish television. Blackpool bargain . Sergei Zenjov . Position: Forward . Age: 25 . Previous clubs: Karpaty Lviv, TVMK Tallin, Parnu Vaprus . Estonian forward Zenjov was Blackpool manager Jose Riga’s first signing in his so far short but torrid time at the club. Estonia forward Sergei Zenjov, pictured against Shrewsbury, joined Blackpool on a one-year deal in July . He was the first of 14 free or dirt-cheap players as Riga had to sign virtually an entire new first team with barely any money. Zenjov moved from Ukrainian side Karpaty Lvov, where he had spent six years, for free on a one-year deal. He is yet to score for Blackpool in 10 games and they are second-from-bottom in the Championship. But England would be wise not to underestimate him. Zenjov surprised the Italians by scoring against them in a Euro 2012 qualifier. Zenjov looks to keep the pace with Lithuania's Arvydas Novikovas during Estonia's Group E defeat . The Chemist . Rimo Hunt . Position: Striker . Age: 28 . Previous clubs: Levadia, Tallinna Kalev, MC Tallin, Kaitseliit Kalev, Haapsalu . Hunt has been nicknamed ‘The Chemist’ back in Estonia due to having completed a degree in chemistry. It is also, apparently, due to his chemistry in the box, according to Estonian media, yet that does not extend to the international scene. Hunt has scored just one goal in five appearances for their national side, and that was in a friendly against Gibraltar, who are not even recognised by FIFA as an official team. He is, however, taking to the Kazakh Premier League well. That is where Hunt now plies his trade, at Kaisar, and he is one of the league’s leading scorers with eight this season, two off the top. Previous to that move, Hunt spent his entire career playing for Estonian club sides.","England face Estonia in next European Championship qualifying match on Sunday evening .

"Roy Hodgson has hit back at Brendan Rodgers' claims that he ignored advice from Liverpool over Daniel Sturridge's recovery time. Rodgers was furious when Sturridge injured his thigh during the last England get together and he hasn't played since the 1-0 victory over Norway early last month. The Liverpool manager insisted that Sturridge needs 48 hours to recover after a match, but Hodgson ignored the advice and forced the striker to train. Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England in September resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland and a number of Liverpool matches . Hodgson said: 'We have only a shortage of time. We have two games and two training sessions, we wanted to play him and Rooney together against Switzerland. 'The injury was unfortunate but if I am going to be under pressure to give players two days off every time they play then we won't train. They can't have two days off. 'He has not played for Liverpool since picking up the injury. If he was to get fitter during the international week then he will still have a lot of work to do to bring him up to speed for Liverpool anyway. There was no question of him being selected. Hodgson denied that there is any problem between him and Brendan Rodgers after the Liverpool manager warned him not to play Daniel Sturridge. The England boss has not selected the striker for his squad to face San Marino and Estonia in their Euro 2016 qualifiers. Rodgers said that he had told Hodgson that Sturridge was not available for the national team, even though he could play some part of Liverpool's match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday before the England squad meet up. Talking at Melwood, the Liverpool boss said: 'I've not spoken to Daniel (about the situation). My focus is on Liverpool, it is not on England. 'I spoke to him about being available for Liverpool but I can't think about England when he is not ready to play for Liverpool. England boss Roy Hodgson has insisted players can not have two days off due to the proximity of matches . 'He's had a grade one injury for four weeks, which is a long time, and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool. 'I've had good communication with Roy. It was amicable. There is no issue. 'We spoke at length yesterday on the situation and I said to him 'Every individual player is different'. 'I respect he had work to do internationally but my thoughts are with Liverpool players and what their needs are. 'We agreed it was probably too soon for Daniel to meet up with England, irrespective of whether he was involved this weekend or not. He hasn't trained with the team at all since the injury with them and it was probably not the right time to go with them.' While there is no issue between himself and Hodgson, Rodgers wouldn't dismiss questions surrounding the two pairs of medical staff being at loggerheads. 'It is not something to be discussed now,' he said. 'I don't think the same thing will happen again. From the conversations with Roy they will obviously look at that. 'I understand his position where he has only a few days to work with the players and he will probably take away that intensity on that second day but you can still work players, we work players here on the second day, but it needs to be tapered to the individual player.' Liverpool striker Sturridge has only managed to appear in half of his side's Premier League matches . Brendan Rodgers told Hodgson that Sturridge would not be available for England but could play some part in Liverpool's match against West Brom before the national team meet up . Hodgson added: 'The last thing you want is injuries in training. You feel a responsibility to the clubs when you have their players and I can only think of three injuries with the national team in two and a half years I have been in charge. 'I haven't been told he can't play for us. We have a right to pick players and we have a right to check on their fitness and assess them ourselves. It's never happened in my two-and-a-half years and hope it never will. The way forward is to have dialogue with managers and players. 'If he took some part at the weekend it'll be very much at the beginning of his recovery. Us going forward in December and March, a fully fit Sturridge is what I need. 'I don't seek ways in which I can assert my authority. I'm happy with the way I use my authority.'","Roy Hodgson has hit back at Brendan Rodgers' claims over Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge .

"Nathaniel Clyne and Jonjo Shelvey are the surprise call-ups by Hodgson for his England squad. The Southampton right-back has not won a cap for England, but his strong displays this season have earned him a place. On his inclusion, Hodgson said: 'He's impressed us for a while. Even before the World Cup he was a name we were constantly considering, but there were others in front of him then. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson discusses Daniel Sturridge club v country row . Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne has been named in Roy Hodgson's England squad . Jonjo Shelvey, who won his first England cap in 2012, has also been called up to Roy Hodgson's squad . 'Now we've lost Glen Johnson and Kyle Walker. John Stones played there but we're looking for someone else who would be an interesting candidate for the right-back post. He was considered even before the last two matches, this time he's asked to come.' Hodgson revealed that Swansea midfielder Shelvey was in a similar position. 'He's another player like Clyne who's constantly in our thoughts and discussions. 'The way we're looking to play could suit him. He's had an excellent start to the season and he's there on merit because of his form and qualities he possesses.' Shelvey revealed the call-up is a proud moment and that his family are delighted by the news. England manager Hodgson claimed Clyne and Shelvey have constantly been in his thoughts . 'It’s fantastic to be called up by England at any level, but to be called up to the senior side is a very proud moment for me, said the midfielder. 'I’ve just spoken to my family and they’re all over the moon. 'It’s nice to be recognised for my performances in recent weeks. Hopefully I can show everyone what I can do in the upcoming international matches. My main focus is on the game against Newcastle this Saturday, but I am looking forward to training with England on Monday. 'It’s a big thing for me and my family. There will be a lot of my relatives in the crowd supporting me. A lot of it is down to Garry Monk and the coaching staff here with the way they have got us playing. We have earned a lot of praise for that. During the last international break there was only about eight of us here training, so it’s a credit to everyone at Swansea for earning international recognition.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher tweeted after the squad was announced: 'Delighted for Shelvey call up to the England squad didn't quite happen at Lfc but shows how regular football can help players development.' The former Liverpool defender later added: 'Thought there may have been an outside chance for Downing as he's doing well in a diamond system at West Ham, which England will use.'

They followed up victories against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup and Birmingham at the weekend with this resounding result. According to club sources only one of the panel, Fulham fan and Nike director David Daly, was at Craven Cottage for the match. ‘That performance certainly won’t do me any harm,’ Symons said afterwards, when asked about his chances. ‘The two things I set out to do when I came in were galvanise the club and start winning games. On both counts it’s going well.’ Symons revealed he has changed a lot around the club and their Motspur Park training ground since former manager Felix Magath was sacked in mid-September. He added: ‘I sent an email out to our scouts because the information they’ve given us about opponents that we’ve passed on to the team is spot on. It gives the players belief.’ In the ninth minute they opened the scoring when centre-back Matt Mills slipped and the mistake allowed Hugo Rodallega to take a touch before burying the ball under goalkeeper Andy Lonergan. They made it two in first-half stoppage time when Bryan Ruiz sent in a free kick and Fernando Amorebieta rose to head home.

"Ryan Bertrand has hit out at the way he has been treated at Chelsea, which could pave the way to making his loan move to Southampton permanent. The left back, who scored his first goal since moving to the south coast club in the summer for the season, has been on loan for nine different spells at seven clubs. Now 25, Bertrand is still not deemed good enough to warrant a place in Chelsea’s squad and he claims that they have been dishonest with him. Ryan Bertrand (second right) is enjoying his time at Southampton after being loaned out to his seventh club . The Southampton defender was mobbed by his team-mates after scoring against Queens Park Rangers . Previous loan spells: . 1. Bournemouth - November 2006 - December 2006 . 2. Bournemouth - January 2007 - February 2007 . 3. Oldham - August 2007 - January 2008 . 4. Norwich - January 2008 - May 2008 . 5. Norwich - July 2008 - May 2009 . 6. Reading - July 2009 - June 2010 . 7. Nottingham Forest - August 2010 - January 2011 . 8. Aston Villa - January 2014 - May 2014 . 9. Southampton - July 2014 - present . ‘The situation became clear to me before I went on loan to Aston Villa [in January],’ he said. ‘Right from when I was 17, I was getting those 15, 20, 25, 30-plus games a season until I hit a stumbling block. ‘That’s when the alarm bells rang. Before that, I had a chance to move from the club – because I just want to keep my career moving – but I was advised I didn’t need to do that. ‘It all unravelled in front of my eyes, and certain things didn’t make sense in terms of what certain people had said to me, all I ask for is honesty, and I didn’t get that. ‘Since I left to go on loan to Villa, it’s been about me again. I’d never rule anything out, but it’s just been about getting out there and playing consistently without the thought process of what Chelsea think or whether I’m going back there.’ Bertrand has taken no time in replacing teenage sensation Luke Shaw, who left in a £31million transfer to Manchester United.

While Shaw has struggled with injury and fitness at his new club, Bertrand has been in scintillating form. He hopes that his new lease of life at Southampton can help him break into the England team . ‘I love playing for my country – I’ve done it twice at senior level and throughout the youth set up,’ former Champions League winner Bertrand added. ‘To get that taste of playing for my country was great. There’s nothing better than playing in front of a full house at Wembley. It’s what every boy dreams of. ‘That’s definitely one ambition. The first was to get into the team here and to play regularly, so if my performances are of a high enough level then I don’t see why not.’","The defender is upset at the way he's been treated by parent side Chelsea .

"No sooner had Wayne Rooney led by example scoring a sumptuous early nerve-settler against West Ham than he was being branded a pariah for needlessly kicking out at Stewart Downing and getting sent off. Yet that was already his third goal alongside two assists in the opening six games of this campaign and put him ahead of Thierry Henry – and behind Andy Cole and Alan Shearer – as the third all-time Premier League top-scorer on 176 goals. United now desperately need Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao to pick up some of the considerable slack that will be left behind in Rooney's absence. Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie are set to become Man United's first-choice strike partnership with Wayne Rooney suspended for the next three matches following his red card against West Ham on Saturday . Van Persie (centre) is congratulated by Falcao after the Colombian set up his goal at Leicester . Falcao has not yet found the net for United but it certainly isn't for the want of trying . Robin van Persie scores to put United two goals to the good against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday . Wayne Rooney will be suspended for three matches after his straight red card against West Ham . The United captain kicked out at Stewart Downing as the West Ham winger raced clear . (4-3-1-2): De Gea; Rafael, McNair, Rojo, Shaw; Ander Herrera, Blind, di Maria; Mata; Falcao, van Persie . Especially as they face tricky matches hosting Everton and Chelsea at Old Trafford and travelling away to West Bromwich Albion without their talisman. Falcao is yet to score in a United shirt since his £6million loan move from Monaco and Louis Van Gaal needs him to start hitting the back of the net. There is a reason the 28-year-old's total transfer fees is already £90.2m, which will go well over the £100m mark when United make the move permanent for £45m next summer – in league matches alone he has netted 138 times in 207 starts. That is a stunning rate of a goal every one-and-a-half starts. Van Persie is beginning to shake off his early-season fatigue from competing in the World Cup with Holland, scoring twice in the past two games. Rooney had earlier showed his deadly instinct to give United the lead . Falcao came with great expectations and now United really need him to start performing . Van Persie celebrates with Falcao after doubling United's lead against West Ham on Saturday . October 5 - Everton (H) October 20 - West Bromwich (A) October 26 - Chelsea (H) His first game back will likely be the Manchester derby at the Etihad on November 2. But his scoring rate for this campaign is still just one goal every 203 minutes, something he needs to vastly improve on without Rooney around. Rooney's ban also provides the chance for Juan Mata to get a foot-hold in the team, as the natural replacement in behind the two strikers. The Spaniard is becoming the perennially pushed aside – sidelined by Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and now, seemingly, Van Gaal at United – but will surely have his chance to make his mark. With former club Valencia reportedly waiting in the wings to make a bid in the January transfer window, this could be his last real opportunity to impress. There are goals and assists in United's wealth of midfield and attacking options; Van Persie, Falcao, Mata, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Adnan Januzaj. But where will the fierce bite come from which is at the heart of Rooney's game? Source: Opta . Juan Mata (bottom left) is likely to be the one to benefit most from Rooney's suspension . United have already lacked backbone this season, crumbling at Leicester, being brushed aside by League One MK Dons and held at newly-promoted Burnley. There is no obvious replacement for the screaming, furious passion which resonates from the England forward to the rest of the team. His international team-mate Steven Gerrard, who he replaced as captain of the national side, described Rooney as a 'natural leader.' He revealed of their time with England: 'Before a game, he is one of the most vocal players in the dressing room. He wouldn’t be afraid of speaking up and talking to someone one-to-one, telling them what is expected.' VIDEO We fought to the end - Van Gaal . Rooney's absence presents a dilemma for Louis van Gaal and his assistant Ryan Giggs . Rooney's passion was very much in evidence during United's 5-3 defeat to Leicester . United are seventh in the Premier League table, eight points behind the leaders Chelsea . Where will that be found in a new team built from £150m spending this summer with a few teenagers being brought into the first-team fold? Who will call out those not working hard enough in the dressing room at half-time if they're struggling in the next few weeks? Rooney has apologised for his red card, but it is United who could be sorry to see him on the sidelines instead of at the centre of their team in the next month. They are already eight points off Chelsea at the top of the table – that gap could be far greater by the time he is back.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino went to stadium:mk to watch Alli play in MK Dons' shock 4-0 Capital One Cup win against Manchester United. And the 18-year-old midfielder did not disappoint as he shone in the centre of the park among United's multi-million pound stars. Tottenham have joined Liverpool in the race to sign MK Dons star Dele Alli, who featured in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup third round tie with Bradford City . Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino went to scout Alli in MK Dons' League Cup win over Manchester United . Alli, an England Under 19 star, is on fire this season with six goals in 11 games including a hat-trick last weekend against Crewe.

Alli signed a new three-year contract at MK Dons last week, but the club will struggle to keep hold of him when the transfer window opens.

"Mauricio Pochettino has ordered his Tottenham players to be more aggressive after they slumped to a dismal defeat at home to West Brom at the weekend. Spurs face Nottingham Forest on Wednesday night in the Capital One Cup, with Pochettino expecting his players to show more energy and fight than they did in the league. It has been a disappointing start to his reign at the club, after replacing Tim Sherwood in the summer, and he is demanding that his players do something about it. Mauricio Pochettino has ordered his Tottenham players to be more aggressive after they slumped to a defeat . West Brom beat Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend and Mauricio Pochettino wants an immediate reaction . Mauricio Pochettino has demanded his Tottenham players show more aggression in the Premier League . Pochettino said: 'We need to move the ball quicker, faster. West Brom played a long ball and to try to win the second ball. Maybe we have problem because the second ball we arrive late always, we arrive a lot of time to late in the box of the opposition. We need to be more aggressive in the last third of the pitch. 'We had the possession more than 60 per cent, after we need all we create from the back and build, we need to be more aggressive. We are in the moment we need to set our style and philosophy. This is a normal process, it is maybe up and down in the beginning, but we need to be strong and to carry on and to work hard and believe in our way. 'We are ready to compete and to fight against Forest because we expect a tough game.' Mauricio Pochettino wants to see a change: 'We need to be more aggressive in the last third of the pitch' Spurs won their opening four games of the season under the Argentine, but have now drawn two and lost two of their last four. But Pochettino insisted that the job is not bigger than he anticipated when he arrived in the summer. He added: 'No not really. When we arrive here we know the situation. We know that maybe happen up and down in different period. Always different when you arrive at a new club with different players you need time to get to know each other. 'I'm not worrying about the situation. I believe at the moment to we need to have more points to reflect the table, it's the beginning of the season, it's not how we start it's how we finish.

"It is a statistic that haunts Everton fans – the last time their club beat Liverpool at Anfield was 1999. A lot has changed since that fiery Monday night fifteen years ago when Everton escaped from their rival's home with a 1-0 win and only 19 players finished the match. Everton's Francis Jeffers and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld were sent off for fighting in the second half. Kevin Campbell scored the winning goal last time Everton beat Liverpoool at Anfield back in September 1999 . Goalkeeper Sander Westerweld and Everton striker Francis Jeffers were sent off after coming to blows . A 19-year-old Steven Gerrard then came from the bench to be shown a red card in stoppage time for a waist-high challenge on goalscorer Kevin Campbell, who netted what turned out to be the winner in only the fourth minute. Michael Owen, also 19, was lucky not to be dismissed for a similarly ugly challenge in a ferocious Merseyside derby. But what became of the players who featured that night?

"Arsene Wenger has hit back at the critics of Mesut Ozil, after he failed to impress yet again during Arsenal's defeat 2-0 at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Non-existent throughout, the Gunners' record signing was hauled off after just 62 minutes, and much of the criticism of the midfielder's recent displays has been nothing short of scathing. But Wenger insisted that the Germany World Cup winner will soon be back to his best and that his heat maps are proof that he is still having a key influence on games - despite the fact Ozil is yet to register a goal or assist this season,. Mesut Ozil looks dejected during Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at the hands of Borussia Dortmund . The German had an ineffective night in Germany and was hauled off after just 62 minutes . Ozil looks frustrated alongside team-mate Jack Wilshere after the Gunners concede the opener . Arsene Wenger speaking at a press conference ahead of Saturday's game against Aston Villa . Wenger looks frustrated on the touchline as Arsenal go down 2-0 at Borussia Dortmund in midweek . 'Why should he be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1,' said Wenger. 'Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what? 'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.' It has been suggested that the formation Arsenal are currently playing, with Ozil often playing out on the right, does not suit the German's talents. But Wenger believes that is merely a side issue. 'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch.' Here then, are Ozil's heat maps from his last four Arsenal games: . Ozil's heat map during Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League defeat away at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday . Ozil's heat map during Arsenal's 2-2 draw at home to Manchester City in the Premier League on September 13 . Ozil's heat map during Arsenal's 1-1 draw at at Leicester City on August 31, in which he covered more ground . Ozil's heat map during Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Everton on August 23, where he played more on the left . For all the heat maps and other statistics from all Premier League and Champions League matches click here . They show that Ozil's involvement was minimal in the defeat in Dortmund and he was stuck out on the left against Everton. However, Wenger was half right as Ozil popped up more in the centre against Manchester City and particularly at Leicester. On the Dortmund debacle, Wenger added: 'It’s a bit unfair because I believe that our offensive talents on Tuesday night [against Borussia Dortmund] were not in their best condition, and they couldn’t express that talent. 'On the other hand it’s post-World Cup. He came back on August 11. You know it takes a few months for them to get back to their best, that can happen. 'They should not be concerned and just support him. I understand that you want your best players always to make the difference in every single game and we all go through period where we are a bit less good. You help. 'A club is a union between players, supporters and directors. You have to be united and sometimes go through periods together where it goes a bit less well.' Wenger revealed that Mathieu Debuchy will undergo an exploratory operation on his ankle injury this evening which will determine how long he is out for. If he does not need further surgery, it will be six weeks before his return, but if he needs to go under the knife it will rule him out for at least three months. 'We’ll know tonight [Friday]. He has an exploration of his ankle tonight and they go in and look how the ligament is damaged, and after that we know if he does need surgery. Mathieu Debuchy could be out for up to three months after getting injured against Manchester City . Calum Chambers (right) is set to fill in at right-back after missing out in midweek through illness . 'If he doesn’t, it’ll be six weeks, if he does need surgery it’ll be three months. At the moment we don’t know.' Calum Chambers, who missed the Dortmund game through illness, is set to return this weekend, and the 19-year-old looks set slot in at right back in the absence of Debuchy. 'I like his attitude, I like his intelligence and I like the fact that he came into the team with a good resistance to the pressure and just played his game,' said Wenger of Chambers. 'I am very impressed by him.'","Wenger hits back at critics of Ozil after a string of poor displays .

"Ikechi Anya's face lit up and his mouth pulled into a wide small as he fell to his knees after placing a shot past Manuel Neuer. The Watford winger looked like a child who had just woken up on Christmas day, understandable considering his 30-yard run in behind Germany's defence to slot the equaliser for Scotland beyond Neuer had just rocked the World Cup winners. But who is the plucky player and where has he come from? Sportsmail explains all... VIDEO Scroll down for Ikechi Anya dazzles with keepy-up tricks on Scottish training pitch . Magic moment: The Watford midfielder slots past the world's greatest goalkeeper to equalise for Scotland . Disbelief: A clearly emotional Anya celebarates his goal in Dortmund which put Scotland level . Is he the latest young hotshot to burst on to the scene? No, actually. Anya is 26 and has had a diverse career already. He played for Wycombe's youth team before Tony Adams made him their youngest ever player, aged 16, in 2004. But Paul Lambert took over and released him so he moved into non-League for two years – at Oxford City and Halesowen Town – before joining the Glenn Hoddle Academy and eventually earning a contract at League One Northampton. Defensive ability: Gianfranco Zola taught Anya to play as a wing-back as well as an out-and-out winger . He then spent three years in Spain for Sevilla's reserves, Celta Vigo and Granada before a one-year loan deal at Watford in 2012 turned into a permanent move, signing a three-year contract for Gianfranco Zola. Ikechi Anya doesn't sound like your typical Scottish name? His background is as diverse as his football career. Anya's father is a Nigerian scientist and his mother a Romanian accountant. He was born in a council estate in Glasgow's Castlemilk. He was bullied at primary school aged seven and shortly afterwards the family moved to London. Anya's father, Chinasa, wanted his son to follow his academic path, but Anya was always set on football. Pride: Anya could have played for England, Nigeria or Romania but grew up supporting Scotland . His older brother became a doctor, who raps in his spare time. You'd expect nothing less in the Anya household. He could've played for England, Nigeria or Romania, but always supported Scotland as a child so it was a no-brainer when he received a call-up in 2013. It sounds as if he bucks the trend then? He certainly does. Anya is a deeply religious Christian and believes that marks him out from many other professional footballers. 'I’m religious and believe if you work hard you’ll get your just rewards,' he said in an interview last year. 'That keeps me humble. I don’t get ahead of myself. On the move: Anya joined Watford in 2012 after spells in non-league and abroad in Spain . 'I accept everything that happens to me in life and that helps to keep me stable. 'I’m a bit different from most players. If you talk to my team-mates they’ll all say that. It’s a good different though. It’s good to have variety with a different outlook on life compared to the cliched footballer.' What's he like as a player? Pace: Anya is quick, as he showed in his well-taken goal against Germany, but also has technical ability . Anya is a rapid flank man – aptly demonstrated by his burst of pace from the left flank to take him through on goal against Neuer on Sunday night. At Watford he was taught to play as a wing-back in a 3-5-2 formation by Zola, as opposed to an out-and-out winger where he featured for Scotland. He is good on the ball and a quick-thinker. Anything else we should know about him? Music, football and family are the three key things in his life. He takes music very seriously and likes to read-up on lyrics of songs he enjoys to understand them better. While at Watford he has also acts as a translator for some of the Spanish-speaking players.","Anya broke through at Wycombe and joined Watford after a spell in Spain .

"Brazil are in action for the first time since their humiliating 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat and subsequent 3-0 thrashing by Holland in the third-place playoff. Their friendly against Colombia in Miami is the first match since those results exposed the reality of their poor team and dealt crushing blows to the World Cup hosts which knocked the national team to the ground. New manager Dunga, who replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari, has been tasked with hauling them back to their feet and turning them into the heavyweight world champions they once were. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at what changes he has made and what to expect... VIDEO Scroll down for Neymar shows off some unbelievable skill in Brazil training . Ouch: Brazil return to the pitch for the first time since their humiliating World Cup efforts on home soil . Crestfallen: Marcelo lies on the pitch after Brazil's 7-1 loss in the World Cup semi-final by Germany . Return: Their friendly against Colombia in Miami is the first match since those results exposed the  poor team . THE CULLED . Dunga took a hatchet to Brazil's World Cup squad and only 10 of the 23-man group made the cut – less than half. The biggest casualties were Barcelona right-back Dani Alves and Real Madrid full-back Marcelo. Both are known for their marauding style on the flanks which has been horribly exposed in the past, something Dunga is no longer prepared to stand for. Tottenham's Paulinho and former first-choice goalkeeper Julio Cesar are also two major names to have been left out. Lifted: Dunga (right) lifts the 1994 World Cup trophy aloft after captaining Brazil to glory 10 years ago . In charge: Dunga took a hatchet to Brazil's World Cup squad and only 10 of the 23-man group made the cut . The chop: The biggest casualties were Barcelona right-back Dani Alves and Real Madrid full-back Marcelo . THE NEW CROP . Three players will have the chance to prove themselves on their international debuts; Cruzeiro's attacking midfielders Everton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart and Corinthians centre-back Gil. Of the three, Goulart is the most exciting addition. He is currently joint-top scorer in the Brazilian top-flight with nine goals, playing in the No 10 role for Cruzeiro. In July he scored a wonder goal from his own half in a friendly against Chivas. He is relishing his call-up, saying this week: 'Forget the World Cup. Now we are a different group and have a new coach.' Another to be handed a chance many felt he was unfairly denied by Scolari is Philippe Coutinho. The Liverpool forward was frozen out by Scolari, but has finally got a real opportunity to prove his place in the national side. Happy about that, Philippe? Coutinho can prove his worth for Brazil against Colombia after being called up . RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE POSTER BOY . Neymar made a return to action at the weekend after a fractured back ended his World Cup dreams, coming off the bench in Barcelona's win against Villarreal. The poster boy of the Brazil World Cup has been handed the captaincy, and if his performances in that tournament, when he dragged an average side through to the semi-final before his injury, is anything to go by he will lead by example. It is likely that this friendly will pit him against defender Juan Camilo Zuniga, who was responsible for the flailing knee which struck Neymar's back and put him out of the tournament. Dunga, himself a World Cup-winning Brazil captain, is confident he has made the right decision. 'Neymar has responded very well to it,' he said. 'He is a player who likes challenges and like to win. We talked to him when we first broached the subject and we told him what we wanted. He's a player with a lot of quality, despite his age is experienced. The captain has to set the standard for the others.' Guess who's back: Neymar returned to action at the weekend after a fractured back ended his World Cup . Recovered: Neymar came off the bench in Barcelona's win against Villarreal as the poster boy returns . LUIZ THE LIABILITY . Another player who survived Dunga's savage cuts is David Luiz – and the world's most expensive defender will also be expected to shoulder more responsibility. A friendly against Colombia is no better way to test the often inconsistent centre-back. Trying to deal with Manchester United's new striker Radamel Falcao and Real Madrid's £71million signing James Rodriguez could turn brutal. Falcao is back from the knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup. The last time he faced Luiz he tore him to shreds, scoring a hat-trick in Atletico Madrid's 4-1 Super Cup win back in 2012. Rodriguez is also no longer 'El Nuevo Pibe' – The New Kid – the nickname he was initially given by Colombia fans in tribute to legend Valderrama who was called 'El Pibe.' The pair are a frightening prospect. Brazil scraped through against Colombia when they met in the quarter-finals during the summer, but this could be very different. Pressure: Another player who survived Dunga's savage cuts is David Luiz, who must shoulder responsibility . A big challenge: A friendly against Colombia is no better way to test the often inconsistent centre-back . VIDEO Dunga discusses his Brazil squad . NO ROOM FOR SENTIMENT . Despite wholesale changes there are still no recalls for Ronaldinho or Kaka, and Robinho was also omitted from the squad until Hulk got injured and he was brought in as a replacement. They were the big names who Scolari largely ignored and it appears that Dunga has no interest in changing that decision. The attitude of Ronaldinho, now 34, was questioned by the last regime while Kaka's career has been on a downward spiral since the 32-year-old left Milan in 2009. But Robinho, another with so much promise so young, now 30, has a glimmer of hope. No comeback: Ronaldinho, now 34 years old, has not been recalled to the Brazil squad for the friendly .

"Chelsea continued their 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League as Jeremie Boga's first-half double eased them to victory over Maribor. Boga struck after 13 minutes and again on the stroke of half-time as Adi Viveash's team moved to the brink of qualification for the knockout round. They had earlier beaten Schalke 4-1 and Sporting Lisbon 5-0 to take command of Group G and Tuesday's win over the Slovenians further strengthened that position. Chelsea's Jeremie Boga celebrates the first of his goals against Maribor in the UEFA Youth League . Boga high-fives Ruben Loftus-Cheek after doubling Chelsea's advantage at their Cobham training ground . Chelsea: Thompson, Sammutt (Wakefield 19), Christensen, Clarke-Salter, Aina, Loftus-Cheek, Colkett, Kiwomya, Musonda (Palmer 60), Boga, Brown (c) (Ugbo 79) Substitutes not used: Baxter (GK), Christie-Davies, Scott, Mukhtar . Scorer: Boga 13, 45 . Maribor: Prineg, Straus, Sostaric, Uskokovic, Marjanovic, Rober, Lorbek (c), Grmek (Mulalic 90), Volmajer (Bjedov Kobe 76), Hajric (Polanc 81), Kramaric . Substitutes not used: Moravac (GK), Flis, Karic, Babsek . Booked: Rober, Hajric . Referee: Bryn Markham-Jones (Wales) Chelsea dominated from the off at their Cobham training ground and took the lead when Boga exchanged passes with captain Isaiah Brown before firing home with aplomb. Charlie Colkett then had a chance to double the lead on Chelsea's next attack but scuffed his shot wide from six yards out. Charlie Wakefield, who had replaced the injured Ruben Sammut early on, then forced Maribor goalkeeper Damjan Prineg into a save with Brown unable to get to the rebound. A free-kick from Colkett and an effort from Charly Musonda forced Prineg into evasive action as Chelsea pressed hard for a second goal. It duly arrived on the cusp of half-time and in stylish fashion. Brown back-heeled to Boga, who took a touch to set himself and then powered the ball home from outside the box. Boga could have claimed a hat-trick in the second-half but fired over on his left foot and then saw a venomous strike rattle the crossbar. If Chelsea claim three points in the return in Maribor in a fortnight's time they will assure themselves of a place in the last 16.

"Three weeks ago, Jose Mourinho discussed Chelsea’s fixture against Arsenal and happened to mention, rather provocatively, that the midfielder the two sides had in common was now in love with the Blues. On Saturday, it became increasingly evident that Chelsea’s fans are returning the affection. Barely four months have passed since it was confirmed Cesc Fabregas would leave Barcelona for Stamford Bridge. In that short time the midfielder, almost as much as Diego Costa, has lifted this side from contenders to significant title favourites. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho pleased with evolution of team . Cesc Fabregas has proved an instant hit at Chelsea since joining the club this summer from Barcelona . Fabregas appears to have quickly won over the Chelsea fans despite having played for rivals Arsenal before . Fabregas (left) and Diego Costa have been two factors in Chelsea's outstanding early season form . In two statistics, a partial measure of his impact can be taken: no Premier League player has completed more passes (671) or created more chances (25) than the Spaniard this season. Costa draws the bulk of the credit. Goals are the most valued commodity and nine in seven games mean he is, rightly, seen as the key cog in Mourinho’s machine. The absence of such an effective frontman last season makes his impact all the more obvious and profound. His absence in the coming fixtures with a hamstring complaint might highlight his importance further still. But what of Fabregas? Chelsea’s squad was not crying out so loudly for a player in his mould during the summer. Yet if they win the title – granted, a strange suggestion considering it is October – it would be impossible, at this stage, to imagine the 27-year-old and his unique qualities not being at the heart of the success. Against Crystal Palace on Saturday, he scored his first Premier League goal of the season. The magnificence of the goal came from its speed and the speed came from Fabregas’ vision. He takes possession 35 yards from goal and rolls the ball into the feet of Eden Hazard. From there it’s a one-touch blitz as Hazard returns the pass and Fabregas feeds Oscar, who puts the midfielder through on goal. The finish is delightful and the goal rivals Jack Wilshere’s for Arsenal against Norwich last season. The Spain international (right) was mesmeric in Chelsea's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Saturday . Fabregas (centre) scored the decisive goal of the game following a beautiful move in the second half . Fabregas (left) celebrates his strike with Oscar - after being assisted by the Brazil international . Significantly, Fabregas never once looks down and was part of the move’s origin, back in his own half. Surges from deep are what he does. It was telling that in the match, he ran 7.4 miles – 0.4miles further than the next most energetic player. Wenger, on the same day that Mourinho spoke of Fabregas’s love for all things blue, told journalists his former charge was not a defensive player. That he was still, at heart, an offensive creator whose home these days was foraging runs from deep, like Aaron Ramsey does at Arsenal. It is in that position, in front of the back four but not defending, where Chelsea needed improving, albeit not as much as up front. Last season, it was largely down to Nemanja Matic to be the deep-lying presence. In big games, the excellent Serb had David Luiz next to him. It is easy to see, therefore, why a tactical layer of Matic and Fabregas is so much better. Fabregas' midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic (left) has provided a better balance to the Chelsea side . It is the platform from which Fabregas can have the most impact. On Saturday, he played 123 passes – more than anyone else. In context, Mile Jedinak hit the most for Palace with 50. All Chelsea moves seem to move through Fabregas, who in turn has become the side’s pacemaker of sorts, deciding when is the right time for urgency and when is the right time to wait. At Barcelona - a spell that Wenger feels did not go as well as Fabregas would have hoped - he played in the middle of a midfield three and as a forward and sometimes on the side. When he arrived at Chelsea, it wasn’t obvious where he would play. But by fielding him next to Matic, Mourinho has made the most of his energy, intelligence and ability to match clever runs with clever passes. He has seven assists for the season and Costa has often been handed the acclaim for finishing the moves. John Terry indicated after the Palace win that surviving a Costa injury was the big question hanging over Chelsea’s credentials. That sounds about right. But one imagines Mourinho, and the club’s fans, are equally keen to keep Fabregas healthy. Fabregas (left) made more passes than anyone else at Selhurst Park on Saturday with 123 .

"John Terry will captain Chelsea for the 500th time against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday. The 33-year-old, who has been labelled 'captain, leader, legend' by the Stamford Bridge faithful for his terrific service to the west London outfit, has been praised by former Blues stars Marcel Desailly and Ron 'Chopper' Harris. Both Desailly and Harris, who were speaking in an exclusive interview with Bleacher Report, highlighted the importance of Terry's role at the club. Chelsea captain John Terry is in line to wear the Blues armband for the 500th time on Saturday . Club captain Terry, pictured in 2012 (left) and 2001 (right), has been a terrific servant to Chelsea . Captain, leader, legend! The Stamford Bridge faithful adore Chelsea centre back Terry . Three Premier League titles . One Champions League medal . One Europa League medal . Five FA Cup winner's medals . Two League Cups . Two Community Shields . Terry established his place at the heart of Chelsea's defence during the 2000-01 season when he formed a partnership with fellow club legend Desailly. The Chelsea man, who made his senior debut in October 1998, replaced Desailly as club captain at the start of the 2004-05 season after the Frenchman decided to seal a move to Qatar. 'I had the privilege of seeing him arriving on the scene as a very young player,' said Desailly. 'He was very motivated and was already ready to become an elite player. 'Every day he was first at training. He would talk to the older players. He was young, but he was a leader. He was already a captain.' Former club captain Marcel Desailly, pictured in February 2002, played alongside a young Terry . Terry could be groomed into a future manager of the west London outfit after he hangs up his boots . The 33-year-old has won a host of honours including the Europa League in May 2013 . Former Blues defender Ron 'Chopper' Harris played for Chelsea between 1961 and 1980 . John Terry is set to captain Chelsea for the 500th time on Saturday. The only current Premier League captain who comes close is Steven Gerrard, who has led Liverpool in 443 games. But in terms of trophies, Terry leads the way compared to some of English football’s greatest leaders. He was won 13 trophies as Chelsea captain, a number only Tony Adams can match. John Terry Chelsea 2001-present  13 . Tony Adams Arsenal 1988-2002  13 . Bryan Robson Man Utd 1982-94  11 . Steven Gerrard Liverpool 2003-present  3 . Terry first led Chelsea as a 21-year-old back in 2001 and is way out in front in Chelsea’s list of top captains. John Terry 499 . Ron Harris 324 . Dennis Wise 298 . Harris, who is Chelsea's record appearance holder having represented the club 795 times, has praised Terry for the way he has dealt with issues away from football during his 16-year professional career. 'The saying has always been that when the going gets tough, the tough get tougher,' added Harris. 'John’s always been in the thick of things, putting himself about and leading from the front. What more can you say about the fella? 'I can’t speak highly enough of John and everything he has done for Chelsea Football Club. 'It’s a proud moment for me to see him making his 500th appearance as captain. 'Like me, he has come through the ranks and gone on to captain the club to win major honours.' Terry returns to Selhurst Park for the first time since he netted an own goal past Chelsea team-mate Petr Cech to hand Crystal Palace all three points at the end of March. The Blues skipper will be hoping he is able to leave south London with a smile on his face this time around. Terry scored an own goal past Chelsea team-mate Petr Cech at the back end of last season .

"Ronald Koeman has been rewarded for Southampton's excellent start to the season with the September manager of the month award. The Dutchman, who took over in the summer, guided the Saints to victories over Newcastle United (4-0), Swansea City (1-0) and Queens Park Rangers (2-1), leaving them third in the Barclays Premier League table. And to mark Koeman winning the accolade, we take a look at his life and times as a player and coach. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has scooped the September Manager of the Month award . 1. Koeman the player is probably best remembered for that moment at Wembley in 1992 when his drilled free-kick through the Sampdoria wall ended Barcelona's long wait for the European Cup. With Barca wearing an all-orange strip, it was fitting that a Dutchman should step up to settle a goalless contest that was drifting towards penalties. Koeman's strike earned him a special place in Barcelona's history as they won a European Cup final at the third time of asking and a footnote in history as the last goalscorer in the competition before it became the Champions League. Koeman celebrates after scoring his winner for Barcelona in the 1992 European Cup final against Sampdoria . The defender drilled home a free-kick to settle the close-run contest in extra time at Wembley . 2. This was the most significant of his 88 goals for Barcelona, an incredible scoring record for a defender. His ability to hit powerful right-footed free-kicks proved a real weapon and many will remember the one in a 5-0 thrashing of Real Madrid at the Nou Camp in 1994. Signed from PSV Eindhoven in 1988, he joined compatriot Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team', playing alongside superstars like Romario, Hristo Stoichkov, Pep Guardiola and Michael Laudrup. Aside from the European Cup, Barca won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991-1994 and the Copa del Rey in 1990. Koeman was also a fearless penalty taker and holds the La Liga record for his 25 consecutive successful penalty conversions. Romario in action for Barcelona against Manchester United in the 1994-1995 Champions League . Coach Johan Cryuff (back row centre) with members of his 'dream team' at a testimonial match in 1999 . 3. Loved by the Barcelona fans, he was given the nicknames 'Tintin', because of his resemblance to Herge's fictional character, and dressed up as the adventurer (complete with dog 'Snowy') for a photoshoot during his time at the club. His pale complexion also led to Koeman being called Floquet de Neu after the albino gorilla in Barcelona Zoo that lived from 1964 to 2003. Koeman earned the nickname Tintin because of his likeness to the popular cartoon character . 4. Koeman started out at Dutch club Groningen as a teenager and quickly established that reputation of a goalscoring centre half. In his first season there, he found the net on 15 occasions in the league and it wasn't long before Ajax signed him. Koeman was a fan of the Amsterdam club but it took some time to settle there. Ajax boss Aad de Mos had reservations about his ability and the constant scrutiny almost prompted him to quit the game altogether. His mum used to write angry letters to popular magazine Voetbal International every time a negative piece about him was published. Eventually, Koeman asserted himself and scored 30 goals in all for Ajax. He spent just three seasons in Amsterdam before joining PSV Eindhoven. Led by Guus Hiddink, who encouraged Koeman's attacking gifts, they won three Dutch titles in a row between 1987 and 1989 and the European Cup in 1988. That season proved a real highlight for Koeman, who scored a remarkable 26 goals. 5. English fans will also remember Koeman for a certain incident in a USA 94 World Cup qualifier. In the 57th minute of a make-or-break qualifier between Holland and England in Rotterdam, David Platt was dragged down by Koeman on the edge of the area. Koeman probably should have gone but German referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher issued only a free-kick and a yellow card. The defender compounded the sense of injustice four minutes later, chipping in a free-kick to send England spiralling out. The Channel 4 documentary crew filming Do I Not Like That recorded Graham Taylor's reaction as he told the linesman: 'The referee's got me the sack, thank him ever so much for that won't you.' Koeman later admitted: 'I expected the red card. I turned around and was surprised to see the referee had not sent me off. I was lucky.' Koeman chips the ball over the England wall to set Holland on their way to victory in 1993 . Graham Taylor resigned as England manager shortly after the 2-0 defeat in Holland . 6. In all, Koeman won 78 caps for his country, scoring 14 goals. His crowning glory came in Holland's 1988 European Championship win and he scored a crucial penalty in their semi-final win over hosts West Germany and was named in the team of the tournament. The Holland-Germany rivalry is well documented and Koeman allegedly used Olaf Thon's shirt as toilet paper after the match in Hamburg. 7. Koeman comes from a footballing family. His father, Martin, was also a defender, spending a decade at Groningen between 1963 and 1973 and winning one cap for Holland - against Austria in April 1964. Ronald's brother Erwin, who is now assistant manager at Southampton, also enjoyed a successful career with PSV, Groningen and Belgian side Mechelen. He played a part in PSV's league triumphs in 1991 and 1992, and also won the Belgian league in 1989 and the European Cup-Winners' Cup in 1988 with Mechelen. Erwin played alongside his brother for the Dutch team and the midfielder was part of the victorious 1988 squad. Erwin Koeman (right), pictured in action against Louis van Gaal . 8. Ronald moved into coaching following his last playing stint at Feyenoord in 1997 and worked initially as assistant to Hiddink for Holland and then Louis van Gaal at Barcelona. Van Gaal came in as technical director when Koeman was coach at Ajax in 2004 but their relationship became fractious. Van Gaal dismissed Koeman as 'that boy' in his autobiography and suggested he was not first choice to succeed him at AZ Alkmaar in 2009. Koeman later said of their disagreements: 'We had some problems in the relation between his job and my job. First he left Ajax and, after three-and-a-half years, I left too. It was difficult because it was a problem in the relation in football. Sometimes a little bit fighting between each other.' Koeman celebrates with his Ajax players after leading them to the Eredivisie title in 2002 . 9. After Barcelona, Koeman coached at Vitesse Arnhem, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ and Feyenoord before joining Southampton in the summer. There have been plenty of ups and down in this time. At Ajax, he managed to lead them to the Eredivisie title and bring through the likes of Rafael van der Vaart and Wesley Sneijder but they ultimately slipped behind in the championship and couldn't regain the ground. Since then, he has been pretty nomadic, not staying in a job for longer that a couple of years. He finished just third in the Portuguese league with Benfica but won the Eredivisie with PSV by a one-goal margin from Ajax. He struggled at Valencia and AZ, before failing to win anything at Feyenoord. Koeman, manager of Ajax, greets compatriot Frank Rijkaard prior to a 2004 friendly match . Koeman is unveiled as the new coach of Benfica in June 2005 . 10. Koeman has been linked with the Dutch manager's job this week after a poor start to Hiddink's spell in charge. Former player Ronald de Boer was one of those who called for Koeman to take over but the manager insisted he is committed to the Saints: 'I am the manager of Southampton, I am not the national manager and I will not be the next national manager.'","Former defender is best remembered for free-kick winner in 1992 European Cup final as Barcelona beat Sampdoria at Wembley .

"Brendan Rodgers was brutally honest in his assessment, summing up the feelings of most Liverpool fans. 'We were nowhere near our capacity and it has been like that for much of the season,' he said after Sunday's match against Queens Park Rangers. It was easy to forget they'd actually won the match. Skipper Steven Gerrard was even more to the point in his analysis. 'Everything needs improving,' he thundered. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Real ready for tough week - Ancelotti . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was scathing in his assessment of their performance at QPR . Simon Mignolet and Joe Allen desperately try to keep out an Eduardo Vargas header to make it 2-2 . Dejan Lovren is beaten in the air by Steven Caulker as Liverpool struggled to impose themselves at Loftus Road . Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren mull things over during the 3-2 win at Queens Park Rangers . That improvement needs to come about pretty damn quickly. On Wednesday night, the champions of Europe Real Madrid come calling. It is a wonderful, glamorous tie - the raison d'etre for a competition like the Champions League. The whole world will be watching Anfield, fascinated. But on current form, things could get pretty messy for Liverpool. Their defence has looked vulnerable all season - managing to keep just one clean sheet so far - and now Dejan Lovren, Martin Skrtel and co come up against the most feared forward line in world football. Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and their team-mates have already racked up 40 goals in 13 matches this season and have won their last two matches 5-0. Martin Skrtel hacks the ball away as Liverpool struggle to clear their lines during the QPR match . Real Madrid's fearsome attack, including Javier Hernandez (left), Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) and James Rodriguez are next up for Liverpool in the Champions League . Cristiano Ronaldo already has 15 goals in seven La Liga matches this season . Liverpool will be relieved that Gareth Bale will likely be sidelined for the match at Anfield . VIDEO Real ready for tough week - Ancelotti . It will come as some relief to Liverpool that Bale is sidelined with a gluteal muscle injury, but Karim Benzema, Javier Hernandez, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric are just some of the other attacking options at Real's disposal. The goals could come from anywhere. Liverpool's central defensive partnership of Skrtel and Lovren has looked vulnerable all season and showed their weakness again when Eduardo Vargas shook them off to bring QPR level at 2-2 in the 92nd minute on Sunday. Lovren, who cost Liverpool £20m in the summer, lacked any kind of command at Loftus Road, with far too many clearances landing at the feet of opposition players. He was bullied by Bobby Zamora. Skrtel, too, struggled to contain the QPR captain and was also at fault for Basle's winner in Liverpool's last Champions League outing. With all due respect, if they can't cope with QPR's attackers, what hope is there against Real? QPR striker Bobby Zamora gives Martin Skrtel the run around during Sunday's match . Dejan Lovren also struggled to contain Zamora in the match at Loftus Road on Sunday . Rodgers played Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique out wide, with Javi Manquillo left on the bench and Alberto Moreno not in the squad. Whoever occupies those positions on Wednesday will have to be on top form. Liverpool are likely to be pinned inside their own half for long spells, even though they are at home, and their fragility is alarming at times. Simon Mignolet, the goalkeeper, remains vulnerable with crosses and his inconsistent performances were heavily criticised by Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville after the 1-1 derby draw with Everton. Real are in ominous form. Ronaldo has 15 goals in seven league matches after his double in Saturday's five-goal thrashing of Levante and will score over 70 this season if keep up this rate. The team as a whole may well end up close to 150 across all competitions - they put eight past Deportivo La Coruna and have smashed five against each of Basle, Elche, Athletic Bilbao and Levante. They are gradually beginning to play like they did at the end of last season, when they won the Copa del Rey and their historic 10th European Cup. Simon Mignolet clatters in to Martin Skrtel as he tries to collect the ball . James Rodriguez celebrates after scoring in Real's 5-0 rout of Levante on Saturday . Manchester United loanee Javier Hernandez has also been given a new lease of life at the Bernabeu . Toni Kroos has also impressed since his summer move from Bayern Munich . One man who will particularly relish the Anfield visit is striker Javier Hernandez, on loan from Manchester United. Chicharito scored on Saturday, taking his tally to three, and the Mexican has been given a fresh lease of life by the temporary move away from Old Trafford. Kroos, who joined from Bayern Munich in the summer, had a near-100 per cent passing record against Levante, while James Rodriguez looks every inch a Madrid player and gave a fine performance with licence to attack at the weekend. Karim Benzema should recover from the fever that kept him out of the last match to offer Carlo Ancelotti yet another dangerous option. Five years ago, Liverpool thrashed Real 4-0 on a glorious night at Anfield. Current form suggests that scoreline might be the other way round on Wednesday night.","Liverpool host in-form Real Madrid in Champions League on Wednesday .

"England were denied a rare win on German soil  by a saved penalty and the upright as the Under-19s were held to 1-1 draw against their bitter rivals. Not since the senior side beat Germany 2-1 in a 2008 friendly, with John Terry's late header, have England or any of the sides at youth level won here, but the Under 19s came within a whisker. Goals from England striker Bradley Fewster and Germany's Timo Werner either side of half time eventually decided this tie at the Stadion Niederrhein in Oberhausen. Jumping for joy: Bradley Fewster celebrates scoring the opener for England but it wasn't enough . Not so high: Fewster can't quite believe it after missing a penalty while one of the Germans celebrates . Germany Under-19s: Funk, Baumgartl, Fohrenbach, Kijewski, Klostermannm Christiansen, Dahoud, Ristl, Sane, Cueto, Werner. England Under-19s: Gunn, Smith Brown, Chilwell, Morris, Gomez, Galloway, Kiwomya, Alli, Fewster, Colkett, Roberts. The game was tight and anxious until Middlesbrough's Fewster broke the deadlock with a well-taken goal on 37 minutes. Dele Alli was busy and bustling in the middle of the park and his pressure paid off when he pinched the ball from Mahmoud Dahoud and passed to Fewster on the edge of the box. The teenager took a touch around centre-back Niko Kijewski and sent a low shot under Marius Funk from eight yards. But Germany struck back in the 59th minute with a well-worked goal. Patrick Pflucke found Boubacar Barry on the right in, from England's point of view, too much space and he sent in a low cross which Werner slid in. From there, the match completely opened up. Manchester City left-back Ashley Smith Brown struck the right post on 64 minutes after twisting and turning two defenders inside out before curling an effort across goal. When the ball came back off the upright, Alli followed up with a low shot but it was saved by Germany goalkeeper Marius Funk. England won a penalty two minutes later when goal-scorer Fewster was clattered in the box by Steffen Nkansah, but he stepped up to take it and his effort was saved by Funk, diving low to his left. Combative: Germany's Leroy Sane tries to break away from England's Ben Chilwell to launch an attack . Rough and tumble: Chilwell and Brendan Galloway get the better of Sane on this occasion . Straight up the other end, Germany broke and Leroy Sane struck a powerful drive which England goalkeeper Angus Gunn, son of Scotland and Norwich stopper Bryan, could only beat out. But England were dangerous on the break, too. In the 79th minute Joshua Aina passed from his own half to Demarai Gray on the right then charged forward. Gray played him in with the return pass and Aina's low shot across goal flew agonisingly wide. Then, on 86 minutes, centre-half Brendan Galloway, who moved from MK Dons to Everton in the summer, tore forward from the back. He ran on to Brandon Barker's high ball, in behind the defence, and went for a flick over the on-rushing goalkeeper but the move required the subtler finish of a forward and the ball dropped over the bar. Line-up: England's young lions pose for a photo before their 1-1 draw with Germany in Oberhausen . Liverpool target Alli, 18, was immense in the centre of the park. Scouts from top-flight clubs have followed him closely at MK Dons over the past 18 months and manager Karl Robinson suggested recently he is one of the most talented teenagers England have ever produced. Fulham winger Patrick Roberts ghosted past the German players for fun and had the opposition constantly on the back foot running scared. Roberts, 17, has tried to style his game on Lionel Messi – there's no harm in aiming at the top – and his low centre of gravity enables him to shimmy and shift the ball around and through players as if they weren't there. In the first half the 5ft 5ins player was a much-used outlet on the left-hand side to build England's attacks. It was just a shame that one of those did not turn in to a second goal. John Peacock, in charge of the side before handing over to new manager Sean O'Driscoll, said: 'There are bits we can work on without a doubt but I'm very pleased with them. They're a great group, they listen intently, they work hard, they put a shift in. 'The result didn't quite come off, but the performance was key and we said that from the very beginning. Produce a performance and you'll be fine. 'The message we give to the players now: Go back to your clubs, get back into your club environment, keep working hard and doing the things which got you here in the first place.'

"Switzerland finally claimed their first points of Euro 2016 qualifying in a 4-0 rout of San Marino on Tuesday night, but the country's press were far from enthused. After defeats against England and Slovenia in Group E, a double from Haris Seferovic and further goals from Blerim Dzemaili and Xherdan Shaqiri ensured Swiss victory in Serravalle. Newspaper Blick moaned about the team scoring just four goals against the 'Dwarves' of San Marino, with only Seferovic getting a good rating. Switzerland raced to a 4-0 victory over San Marino to claim their first Euro 2016 qualifying points but their performance in Serravalle failed to enthuse the Swiss press . Haris Seferovic, seen here scoring the first goal, was the only player to receive a good rating in Blick . The two-goal striker received a score of 5 from the paper, which equates to 'good' in their rating system. All the others received either a 3 for 'weak' or 4 for 'good enough'. Shaqiri was singled out for particular criticism, with Blick saying he did not perform well enough despite a goal and an assist. They add that Josip Drmic didn't have his shooting boots on, with all his efforts badly missing the target.

The paper 20 Minuten was also underwhelmed, with its front page headline saying that Switzerland did their duty but didn't shine in the match. They added that Switzerland barely showed up during the second half. Tages-Anzeiger noted the lack of emotion when the players lined up to salute their travelling supporters at the final whistle. Newspaper 20 Minuten said Switzerland had done their duty without causing any excitement . Le Matin said Switzerland were far from convincing in their performance despite scoring four times . NZZ said the Swiss had done their duty but that the match was played out in a 'surreal ambience' comparable to the early rounds of the Swiss Cup. Die Zeitung mentioned the highest-ever victory over San Marino, the 13-0 scoreline recorded by Germany in 2006, and said the Swiss might have come close to that had they not 'surrendered to the obvious lack of enthusiasm.'

"Diego Costa was left with a face as red as his shirt after offering up a contender for miss of the season in Spain's Euro 2016 qualifier with Luxembourg. The striker inexplicably fired wide when played through one-on-one with goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert after 32 minutes of the match at the Josy Barthel Stadium. It looked easier for the Chelsea man to find the net from such point-blank range but his attempted dink was scuffed and went past the far post.

But the striker turns away in horror as the ball drops wide of the far post . The Luxembourg goalkeeper and defenders can't believe their good fortune as Costa's shot drops wide . The striker lifts his shirt over his head in embarrassment but his blushes were spared by an offside flag . Costa has been in outstanding form since joining Chelsea, scoring nine goals in nine matches . As Costa lifted his shirt over his head in embarrassment, he would have been relieved to learn that he'd been flagged offside though he had no idea initially. Costa is in sensational form for his club, with nine goals in nine matches since his £32m move from Atletico Madrid in the summer, but has struggled to find the net for his country. He squandered a succession of chances during the first half, as goals by David Silva and his strike partner Paco Alcacer gave Spain a commanding lead over the Group C minnows. But he did eventually score his first goal for his country, firing home in the second half to make it 3-0 from close range. The relief on his face was apparent for all to see. Juan Bernat scored a late fourth goal to round off the comprehensive victory. Costa (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after breaking his duck with a second-half goal . Vicente del Bosque's team desperately needed a morale-boosting win after a shock defeat to Slovakia on Thursday. Speaking about his goal afterwards, Costa said: 'The truth is it was annoying me quite a lot. I could not score. I did not score, and the team lost the games I played. I did not know how I was going to score. 'But thanks to God the ball dropped for me, and I just had to put it in. I must thank the boss, every game was another chance for me to show what I can do. I hope from now things will go well for me.' And coach Del Bosque added: 'We’re all happy he has scored. He worked hard, lacked luck in front of goal. He will be a useful player for us. When a player puts in so much effort, wants it so much, in the end it will go for him.'","Diego Costa missed an easy one-on-one chance in Spain's Euro 2016 qualifier with Luxembourg .

"Sheyi Ojo sparkled as Liverpool continued their unbeaten start to the Barclays Under 21 Premier League season with a comprehensive win over West Ham at Upton Park. The 17-year-old winger showed precisely why he is so highly rated by both Liverpool and England with an eye-catching performance capped by a couple of excellent goals. With Liverpool leading 1-0 approaching the half-hour, Ojo curled a beautiful shot from outside the box into the top right-hand corner to double the lead, leaving Hammers goalkeeper Raphael Spiegel rooted to the turf. Sheyi Ojo celebrates his first goal of the night against West Ham . Liverpool players celebrate Ojo's opener against West Ham at Upton Park . Samed Yesil also scored to secure a convincing win for Liverpool U21s . It was the highlight of an evening in which West Ham simply couldn’t handle the England Under 18 international, who signed professional terms at Anfield over the summer. If his long-range goal drew gasps from the crowd, his assist for Liverpool’s opening goal was equally as memorable. Turning on a sixpence, Ojo left two defenders for dead and, with a burst of acceleration, advanced to the edge of the box. After feigning to shoot, he instead tucked a through ball to Ryan Kent to slot home from six yards. And when forward Samed Yesil added a third for the visitors shortly before half-time, the contest was all over. Yasil was set up by an unfortunate deflection off a West Ham defender, allowing him to beat the offside flag. It was a fitting assist as this was an evening in which fortune did not smile on the Hammers as they wasted a string of excellent openings. Ryan Kent of Liverpool (centre) scored the first of the Red's goals on Friday night . Liverpool players celebrate during a dominating win over West Ham . West Ham could not find a way back into the game, and eventually fell to a 0-4 loss .

Bookings: . Goals: Kent (14), Ojo (28, 90+2), Yesil (38) Man of the Match: Sheyi Ojo . Referee: Ryan Atkin . Elliot Lee was the most culpable. Inside two minutes, he was presented with a gilt-edged chance when Sebastian Lletget’s shot cannoned back off the crossbar to him unmarked in front of goal. Lee somehow failed to get the ball out of his feet and goalkeeper Lawrence Vigouroux, whose initial mis-kick had allowed West Ham in, redeemed himself with an unlikely save. And at three goals down, Lee had the chance to improve West Ham’s outlook just before the break. Played clear by Kieran Sadlier, he drew Vigouroux out but rolled his shot wide of the far post. Lletget also failed to turn the ball home from all of three yards when Sam Westley crossed low from the right. His scuffed effort hit the base of the post, allowing Vigouroux, who was obviously wearing his lucky gloves, to claim. So while West Ham were guilty of wasting their chances, and consequently are still seeking their first win of the campaign, Liverpool were lethal. Ojo was the performer to catch the eye. There was a buzz around him when Liverpool paid £2m to take him from MK Dons as a 14-year-old, fending off competition from other leading clubs, and he has matured well under their auspices. Liverpool's 0-4 win means they continue their unbeaten start to the U21 Premier League season . Sheyi Ojo is highly rated by both Liverpool and England, and the youngster showed why . He possesses raw pace and packs a fearsome and accurate shot, as West Ham found out to their cost when they stupidly backed off for the goal. Kent, also 17, impressed too with his direct running and ability to find space in the box. He gave West Ham a warning in the third minute when his curled effort had to be blocked by Spiegel, but they didn’t heed it and were soon punished by the fleet-footed winger. With the game pretty much decided, the second period failed to replicate the pace and flow of the first. Lee did his best to reduce the deficit but his looping header was tipped over the crossbar by Vigouroux. And in the dying moments, he worked half-a-yard to force another smart save from the Chilean keeper. Liverpool were sauntering away with the points and there was to be a final flourish when Ojo rolled home his second in stoppage time.

"Jose Angel Pozo scored twice as Manchester City maintained their 100 per cent record in the UEFA Youth League with a 2-0 victory over CSKA Moscow in Russia. The highly-rated young Spaniard struck either side of half-time to give City their third successive victory in freezing temperatures at the Oktyabr Stadium. After their 4-1 win in Germany against Bayern Munich and a 2-1 home success over Roma, Patrick Vieira's Under 19 team are already on the brink of qualification for the knockout stage.

Referee: Lasha Silagava (Georgia) CSKA had caused problems for the City youngsters when the two sides had met at this exact stage last season, holding them 1-1 in Russia and then winning the return at Hyde. But this time they struggled, failing to record a single shot on target as City dominated proceedings from start to finish. Vieira selected the same starting line-up as came from behind to beat Roma on matchday two, courtesy of goals from Olivier Ntcham and Thierry Ambrose, and City started brightly. They gained the advantage on 21 minutes when Pozo shot from just outside the penalty box. CSKA goalkeeper Ilya Pomazun thought the ball was going wide of the target and was left red-faced when Pozo's effort crept into the far corner. The visitors wasted a good opportunity to double the lead a minute later when Ntcham couldn't sort his feet out in time to convert Ambrose's cross, allowing Pomazun to smother. CSKA gradually grew into the game and a free-kick from Aleksandr Golovin smacked the crossbar just before half-time in what would prove to be their best chance. Shortly after the restart, Ambrose was denied by the goalkeeper after the Frenchman had driven purposefully into the penalty area. Patrick Vieira's team can secure qualification to the knockout stages if they win the return with CSKA . But City eventually claimed their reward with 20 minutes remaining when Brandon Barker slipped in Pozo with a through ball. The Spaniard had his back to goal and plenty still to do, but he swivelled andhis shot found the net with the aid of a slight deflection. City play CSKA again on November 5 at Ewen Fields and could wrap up their qualification.","Jose Angel Pozo scored in each half as Manchester City beat CSKA 2-0 .

"He stepped off the plane in Tallinn very much the Plan B and, despite Adam Lallana's best efforts, he will fly home as the Plan B as well. It's not that Lallana did a great deal wrong in England's underwhelming 1-0 win over Estonia, but when Roy Hodgson resorts to bringing on a player who before the match declared himself fatigued to provide the spark it doesn't bode too well. The 'tired one' was Lallana's Liverpool accomplice Raheem Sterling and with an uninspiring England trying to break down 10-men Estonia after the hour mark, he was summoned from the bench to offer a much-needed injection of pace. Lallana carries the ball forward on one of his trademark driving runs as England search for the breakthrough . Lallana carries England's attack during the second half as they seek to take advantage of having a man more . Lallana's heat map from the match showed how he covered a great swath of the midfield . Raheem Sterling was introduced to good effect as England chased a goal in the second half . Lallana is not without speed but he simply can't muster the raw acceleration that Sterling can when needs must. He had impressed for much of the first-half but faded a little after the break and fresh legs were definitely required to lift England to the victory that maintained their perfect start to Euro 2016 qualification. Tiredness eventually catches up with even 19-year-olds and Sterling, who has been carrying a heavy burden of expectation for both club and country this season, felt it necessary to tell Hodgson on the eve of the match that he was suffering the effects. Sterling, who was taken off at half-time in Thursday's rout of San Marino with the more demanding trip to the Baltics in mind, had very much been Hodgson's Plan A and the England system had been tweaked accordingly. But instead of him, it was Lallana who took position at the top of a midfield diamond behind frontmen Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck. Lallana is muscled off the ball by Estonia's Joel Lindpere during the Euro 2016 qualifier . Lallana gets the better of Estonia's Martin Vunk to win the ball during the first half . Passes: 48 . Passing accuracy: 87.5% . Duels won: 9 . Duels lost: 6 . Recovered possession: 10 . Tackles: 4 . Fouls won: 1 . Shots on target: 1 . Blocked shots: 3 . Chances created: 0 . The early signs were encouraging, with Lallana, bold and direct, at the centre of every England attack. He hustled and harried, forcing Artur Pikk into a mistake before rampaging across the box and firing off a shot that was blocked. The link-up play with Rooney was intuitive and the captain automatically tried to locate Lallana's intelligent runs during the opening stages. On the quarter-hour, Lallana, having dropped deep again to retrieve possession, found space with a smart flick over his own head before attemptin to find Fabian Delph. Lallana, who had been one of England's few bright sparks at the World Cup in Brazil, featuring in all three matches, looked perfectly at home in the advanced role. He was close to turning in a deflected Welbeck cross and then forced a save from goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko at his near post. He recovered the ball on 10 occasions and recorded a passing accuracy of 87.5 per cent, which certainly isn't to be sniffed at. Tellingly, though, he directly didn't create a chance all night. The longer England hammered away at the densely-packed Estonia defence without reward, the more his influence waned. Lallana and Wayne Rooney have a chat during the early stages of the match. They linked well throughout . The win kept England top of Group E with maximum points from their three matches so far . England had dominated proceedings, enjoying as much as 75 per cent of the ball, and the balance shifted further in their favour when Estonia captain Ragnar Klavan was sent off for brutally stopping Delph's storming run just two minutes into the second-half. With more space to exploit and Estonian legs tiring, England were screaming out for extra pace to take advantage. Lallana, unfortunately, wasn't the man to provide it and Hodgson wisely moved to bring on first Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and then Sterling. There were a few eyebrows raised by the fact Sterling had felt unable to start the match but was now required to rescue it. But whatever his condition, the introduction of the two speedsters gave England the impetus they needed. Rooney curled home the decisive free-kick and England take another step closer to France the year after next. Lallana does provide an exciting option for England. It's just that Sterling at the moment offers a little bit more.","Adam Lallana played at the head of England's midfield after Liverpool colleague Raheem Sterling was benched with fatigue .

"The instinctive reading of the ball as it came back across the penalty area would be the envy of many a top striker . As would the presence of mind to get in front of the covering defender. So too the smart outside-of-the-boot finish into the one area the goalkeeper couldn't stop it.

Yet it was John O'Shea out there grounding out a draw for Ireland in their quest to reach Euro 2016. That's John O'Shea. The defender. For so long unsung and under-appreciated, it's time, on the occasion of O'Shea's 100th international cap, to raise our glasses to a man who throughout his career has been a byword for presence and professionalism. O'Shea is not, nor has ever been, a glamorous player. There have been good times and there have been bad times. But his contribution, whether for Manchester United, Sunderland or Ireland, has been marvellous. It's quite easy to forget that O'Shea made 393 appearances for United over the course of his 12 years in the Old Trafford first-team squad. And it may surprise the uninitiated that he has five Premier Leagues, an FA Cup, three League Cups and the Champions League in his trophy cabinet. Add to that the 121 games he has played for Sunderland, many as captain, and that century of caps for his country. Thomas Muller is given a warning by John O'Shea whose impressive career started at Manchester United . Nobody clocks up that amount of games by fluke. That's why it was so wonderful, on his big history-making night, to see O'Shea there, in the 94th minute when all hope seemed lost, rescuing a precious point and avoiding an accident on the long road to France. His beaming smile radiated out from many back pages on Wednesday morning, his Irish eyes also smiling as they gazed up at the delirious travelling support high in one corner of the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen. This was John Francis O'Shea from Waterford, sticking it to the world champions. One of United's own, a product of that prestigious academy, O'Shea slowly but assuredly worked his way up into the first team. Admired by Sir Alex Ferguson for his versatility, O'Shea made his breakthrough as a 21-year-old because he could play at left-back, right-back, centre-back or in central midfield. O'Shea scores Manchester United's fourth goal in a 4-2 win over Arsenal in February 2005 with a clever chip . Roy Keane jumps on O'Shea to congratulate him on his goal against Arsenal but would criticise his team-mate during their time together at Old Trafford . It didn't matter where he was asked to play, you could depend on O'Shea to produce a performance of efficiency and character. He'll always be remembered at Old Trafford for that outrageous lob over Manuel Almunia from outside the box in United's 4-2 win at Arsenal in the 2004-2005 campaign. And equally he'll be remembered as one of those criticised by Roy Keane's acerbic tongue the following season. Unlike many of those blasted in that never-aired MUTV interview, O'Shea survived - and prospered, winning trophies at home and abroad. O'Shea celebrates with Rio Ferdinand after scoring a crucial goal at Liverpool which would help Manchester United go on and claim the 2006-07 Premier League title . He scored a critical last-minute winner at Anfield as United won the title in 2006-2007 and was used as an emergency striker at times the following campaign, which he ended as a European champion. O'Shea scored against Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final, first leg in 2009, setting United on course for a 4-1 aggregate win and Ferguson put him in the team for the final with Barcelona as a reward. You see, critical goals in critical games are not a recent phenomenon for this man. Perhaps the highlight was still to come - O'Shea was handed the captain's armband for the Champions League semi-final with Schalke in 2011. It proved a fitting farewell. John O'Shea is the current captain of Sunderland and led Manchester United out as skipper in a Champions League semi-final against Schalke in 2011 . Many believe there isn't life after United but O'Shea has proved an exception, a little like Phil Neville at Everton. Joining Sunderland has meant flirtations with relegation and a few thrashings, but allowed him to develop his leadership skills. He has always been a positive presence both on the field and behind-the-scenes at the Stadium of Light, a future manager-in-the-making you would imagine. O'Shea is 33 now and will eventually decide to call it a day. He'll bring the same level of dedication to whatever he chooses to do next. He'll never be the most celebrated of players but that just makes those headline-grabbing moments like the one in Germany all the more magical.","John O'Shea scored last-gasp equaliser for Republic of Ireland in Germany .

"Edinson Cavani is certainly known as a sharp shooter but the Paris Saint-Germain striker's rifle celebration has come under fire since his sending off at Lens last Friday. The Uruguay star, who scored PSG's winner in the Champions League at Apoel Nicosia on Tuesday and again pretended to shoot, is in fact an avid hunter. Hence, when Cavani fires in one of his many goals he performs a gun-toting gesture, similar to that of a huntsman. Edinson Cavani  was eventually sent off after celebrating his goal at Lens on Friday with a gun-toting gesture . Cavani (right) repeated the celebration, which he has used for years, on Tuesday in the Champions League . The 27-year-old celebrated his goal with his customary 'rifle' celebration that hit the headlines last week . Remarkably, he was booked at Lens last Friday after converting a penalty and carrying out his celebration, which he has used for years. He was then, however, sent off after becoming embroiled in a heated argument with referee Nicolas Rainville. His father Luis revealed before the World Cup that Cavani, on a 48-hour break from the Uruguayan training camp, returned to his home town of Salto for a nocturnal hunting session, during which he managed to haul two boars and six hares. 'It's always been football first, then hunting for Edi. He loves it and he's a good shot at both!' Luis told the Telegraph. Cavani and his father hunt near a picturesque farm the PSG star bought for Luis last year. PSG players argue with referee Nicolas Rainville as Cavani is given his marching orders at Lens last Friday . 'We always did it when he was a kid and we still do. He came here from the camp in Montevideo and everything he hadn't done in a whole year while he's been in Paris, he has to cram in over two days,' added Luis before the World Cup. 'So we spent them fishing and hunting, getting only three hours sleep both nights. It was crazy but he did it. 'Edi's not going to stop doing it! As for fishing, he always says it calms him. This has always been a way of life for us.' Paris Saint Germain forward Edinson Cavani cannot believe his red card during the clash with Lens . So, Cavani's hunting roots explain the background of his rifle celebration and the striker defended his actions having repeated the gesture after scoring the winner in Cyprus on Tuesday. 'The most important thing for a striker is to score. The most important thing for the team was to make a step further in the Champions League. 'That was my decision to do that, this time it will not be misinterpreted. My expulsion against Lens? We all have the right to make mistakes. We are all human beings, television pictures seem obviously in my favour. It was not bad, it just was misinterpreted. I work hard to perform well for my team to score goals.' Cavani, seen scoring for Uruguay in the World Cup this summer, went home to hunt on a break from training . PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has strongly criticised the referee's decision to send off Cavai at Lens, insisting punishments given for such celebrations are negative for French football. 'It is the media's job to speak about the referee,' he told Canal+. 'Cavani does not deserve that red card. And why has he got a yellow before? He always does the same celebration. 'This is not normal and it is not good for French football if we want to develop. It is a bad situation for everyone.'","Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani was sent off on Friday following a gun-toting celebration and argument with the referee .

"Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Raheem Sterling after the Liverpool youngster only started on the bench for England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia - by revealing Sir Alex Ferguson used to give Cristiano Ronaldo time off during mid-season to rest. Sterling complained of feeling tired ahead of the clash and did not complete training on Saturday before asking manager Roy Hodgson to be rested. But former Three Lions defender Ferdinand has backed the 19-year-old's decision on Twitter, claiming English players are often 'too proud' to take time out to rest and believes it could benefit the youngster in the long run. And he also revealed Ferguson used to give Ronaldo 'a few weeks off' during mid-season to recuperate. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Raheem  came to me complaining of tiredness .

Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . In a series of tweets, Ferdinand said of the 19-year-old: 'Sterling - tired, fair play to him. English players are normally too proud to do that unlike our foreign friends. #FreshWhenItMattersMost. 'For instance, (Carlos) Tevez would come in some days (at Manchester United) and sit on the massage bed while the team trained... ""I'm tired... match day - firing & energised. 'Either some real dumb heads on here or they just missed the point totally. Doing what's better for the team & yourself long term... 'With more rest at the right times throughout seasons (Wayne) Rooney would have gone into tournaments for England fresher 100%... Too proud again. 'Same could be said of (Steven) Gerrard, (Frank) Lampard, JT (John Terry), A. (Ashley) Cole, myself, etc. - all too proud to set out of training or a match with the bigger picture in mind.' Also, in reply to a tweet which read 'didn't fergie used to give Ronaldo a few weeks off mid season early in his career', Ferdinand replied: 'yes... defo helped him develop'. Sterling only played 45 minutes in Thursday’s 5-0 win over San Marino and was replaced by Adam Lallana at half-time but he came on for Jordan Henderson after 64 minutes in Tallinn on Sunday. talkSPORT presenter and former England striker Stan Collymore tweets about Sterling feeling tired . Ex-England striker Gary Lineker gives his view on Sterling feeling tired and believes he should be cut slack . Adam Lallana replaced Sterling against San Marino on Thursday and starts in his place in Estonia . Lallana started in place of Sterling in Tallinn but, after coming, on the livewire forward won the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney scored. 'Yesterday we trained  but Raheem was complaining a little about being tired and was not at his best. So we won't risk him and Lallana is in fine form,' Hodgson told ITV before the game. 'We can use him as a sub. Adam was very good against San Marino and interpreted the role behind the two attackers very well. 'They are different types of players and both feature strongly.' Given Hodgson’s comments on Thursday, it was perhaps no surprise that Lallana started. He said: ‘Lallana, when he came on for Raheem, was every bit as dangerous and inventive and creative as Raheem could be. That's nice to know.’ Sterling trained with the England substitutes before the game and took part in a game of keep ball. He then took part in shooting practice - blasting his first effort well wide, and his second over the bar. He was more effective when he came on, however. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will hope Sterling will be fit during a busy spell of upcoming fixtures, with their next three games played within six days: Oct 19 – QPR (a), Oct 22 – Real Madrid (h), Oct 25 – Hull (h).","Rio Ferdinand backs Raheem Sterling's decision not to start in Estonia .

"European rugby’s elite competition returns this weekend under an unfamiliar guise with a new name, a new format and a new trophy. And former Wales international Ieuan Evans says he is ‘salivating’ at the prospect of watching the continent’s best in action in a revitalised tournament. It has taken more than two years for the European leagues to resolve the issue of how to re-format the Heineken Cup in order to ensure the Premiership and Top 14 are kept happy – as well as to maximise the potential riches on offer to each club – but now they seem to have settled on a competition which has intrigue in almost every single match-up. Representatives of the England clubs competing for the new European Rugby Champions Cup, which starts on Friday - (from left) Chris Bell (Wasps), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Ed Slater (Leicester), Alistair Hargreaves (Saracens), Stuart Hooper (Bath), George North (Northampton) and Dan Braid (Sale) Sky Sports pundit Ieuan Evans is 'salivating' at the thought of the European Champions Cup . The inaugural European Rugby Champions Cup, which begins on Friday when Harlequins host French side Castres at The Stoop, will see five pools of four – as opposed to the six groups of four in the Heineken Cup – battle it out to qualify for the last eight. Pool winners are guaranteed qualification, while the three best runners-up will also progress, meaning competition will be more fierce than ever and even one home loss could mean the difference between potentially winning the competition and going home early. And Sky Sports rugby pundit Evans, who scored 33 tries in 72 internationals for Wales and one in seven Test appearances for the British and Irish Lions, told Sportsmail: ‘You look at the quality this year of the teams and the groups and how close they’re likely to be you salivate the prospect because there’s no breathing space. There will be pressure, intensity, challenges. That’s what you get with the elite comp. ‘Three second-placed teams means sides are going to scrap for every single bonus point. Because of the quality of the pools as well there are going to be some top-end teams who aren’t even going to make it through to the knockout stages. ‘Quality is always quality no matter if the competition and format has changed. I suppose what does change is that now there’s five pools instead of four it means it’s a far harder task to rest players and to rotate players because there’s no respite.’ The 50-year-old, who was dubbed ‘Merlin’ during his playing days by legendary commentator Bill McLaren for his exceptional poise when running with the rugby ball, is amazed by the strength and competition in every single group. (Left to right) Matt Corker of London Welsh, Matt Mullan of Wasps, Alistair Hargreaves of Saracens, George North of Northampton Saints, Stuart Hooper of Bath Rugby, Ed Slater of Leicester Tigers, Joe Marler of Harlequins, Dan Braid of Sale Sharks and George Skivington of London Irish pose with the the two trophies during the 2014/15 European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup Tournament Launch . Harlequins Director of Rugby Conor O'Shea during the European Rugby Launch at Twickenham Stoop . ‘If you look at Pool One – Munster, Sarries (Saracens), Clermont – all these sides would expect to get into the last four and beyond,’ the former winger continued. ‘You have three potential winners and three semi-finalists from last season in one group. Where’s the easy game? ‘(Northampton) Saints have got Racing Metro and Ospreys – Ospreys are top of the Guinness Pro 12 at the moment. There’s very little respite there and we can have some surprises but a team will rise to the top in this competition – it always does.’ Evans won the now defunct Heineken Cup with Bath in 1998 and he has been impressed with the dynamism on offer in the West Country side’s backline this season. And the (now unlikely) prospect of the European Player of the Year Steffon Armitage returning to England to play at The Rec in order to force his way into Stuart Lancaster’s England World Cup squad is one which Evans would welcome. ‘Armitage really adds to the storyline going into this weekend’s games – will he play for Toulon, will he not play for Toulon? He would be a huge coup for whoever could snap him up. ‘The talk all week has been about who is coming back from France. Will Steffon Armitage come back? Will Jamie Roberts and Lydiate come back to the Welsh regions? ‘If Armitage was to go to Bath he would be a huge signing. Not that they need strengthening in that area – we don’t know where Sam Burgess is going to play – but they also have Francois Louw to come back. To have Louw and Armitage – well that would be an interesting one for them! ‘You are not going to sniff at an opportunity to have Steffon Armitage though because he has been sensational for Toulon. Top 14 Player of the Year is not an award that French teams hand out lightly. ‘I’d be surprised if Toulon let him go but you never know with (owner) Mourad Boudjellal – they could be chasing Richie McCaw!’ Toulon forward Steffon Armitage will not be returning to the Premiership with Bath . England legend Jonny Wilkinson became the last man to lift the Heineken Cup for Toulon in May . The ex-Scarlets flyer, who captained Wales to the 1994 Five Nations title, expects the usual suspects to compete for the first European Rugby Champions Cup title – with Leicester having too many injuries to really challenge and former side Bath being too early in their development to contend with the continent’s elite – but he believes one Scottish side could be a dark horse this year. Evans explained: ‘The four favourites in most bookies’ minds are probably double-champions Toulon, Clermont, plus Saints and Sarries. ‘I’m interested to see if Glasgow can start to find their European performances step-up a notch. We’ve seen their domestic performances really improve but are they capable of stepping-up in Europe? That’s an interesting one for me. ‘Toulon, having so much depth, you have still got to fancy them though.’ In that sense, the more that things change, the more they stay the same… . Sky Sports’ biggest ever season of rugby includes more than 360 matches from competitions including The European Rugby Champions Cup, Top 14, PRO12 and Autumn Internationals.","European rugby's elite competition returns this weekend under new guise .

"Roberto Mancini believes Manchester City's status as Premier Champions and one of the growing forces in European football was set in motion during his reign at the Etihad Stadium. The Italian was in charge at the Sky Blues between 2009 and 2013 - and led City to their first Premier League title in 44 years during the 2011-12 season. City also won the FA Cup in 2011 under Mancini's tutelage before Manuel Pellegrini led the club to a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season.

Chilean boss Pellegrini (centre) led City to the Premier League and League Cup double last season . And the former Inter Milan, Lazio and Fiorentina boss is adamant the foundations for City's continued success were set in place during his four years at the Etihad. The 49-year-old, quoted in FourFourTwo, said: 'I think that we started to build this team five years ago. In two years we won the Premier League, the FA Cup, we won everything in England. 'And this current team are playing nine of my players all of the time. I am very happy with that because I know these players. But Mancini is adamant that the foundations were laid in place during his four-year tenure at the Etihad . 'I think it's not easy to build a strong team with only four or five years. 'They are a team like Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona - big teams that have been like that for 50 years. You need the time to improve. But we have a big chance also to be one of the best teams in Europe.' Mancini, who has been out of work since leaving Galatasaray in June, has also revealed he would be interested in managing a Bundesliga side but worries the language barrier could prove to be a stumbling block.

"England Under 19s hammered hosts Luxembourg 8-0 on Sunday to all but ensure their progression from the first qualifying round for the 2015 European Championship. Braces from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Patrick Roberts and Brandon Barker, as well as goals from Charlie Colkett and Bradley Fewster, saw England followed up their opening win over Belarus with another victory. Sean O'Driscoll's side have now scored 11 goals in two games without reply and face Belgium on Wednesday in their final Group 1 game, knowing they have almost ensured progression to the tournament in Greece next year. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, pictured playing against Ukraine in May, scored twice in England Under 19s' 8-0 win .

Chelsea's Loftus-Cheek exchanged some neat passes with Fulham's Roberts before smashing home. And just six minutes later England were two up. Manchester City winger Barker put in an exquisite cross for Chelsea's Colkett who prodded home. It was then Barker's turn to provide for himself as he converted an unstoppable penalty after being tripped in the box after 21 minutes. A second penalty soon arrived too as Roberts was felled and, after being forced to re-take the spot kick, he coolly slotted the ball the opposite way to the goalkeeper. Barker then ensured it was 5-0 at half-time when he curled a magnificent free-kick from the edge of the area into the top corner. The second half did not get much better for the hosts either, as Loftus-Cheek broke clear five minutes after the restart to slot in England's sixth. But then Luxembourg did enjoy their best chance of the game - after 66 minutes Cedric Sacras shot and the ball took a wicked deflection off Colkett and on to the crossbar. England added two further goals in the final moments through Middlesbrough forward Fewster and Roberts to put some added gloss on the scoreline in what was an emphatic victory.","England Under 19s make it two wins out of two to top Group 1 .

International goals: 40 . Brazil forward Neymar produced the performance of the international week, scoring all four of his nation's goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in the 4-0 demolition of Japan in Singapore. At just 22 years of age, Neymar has already netted a remarkable 40 goals in just 58 internationals since his debut four years ago and he sits an incredible fifth on the all-time Brazil scoring list, above the likes of Bebeto, Rivaldo and Jairzinho. Messi, meanwhile, came off the bench during Argentina's 7-0 victory over Hong Kong and bagged a brace.

"Host commentator . Thanks for tuning into our coverage today! West Ham United have the win they wanted. It wasn't pretty but Sakho really saw them through and they have another three points. QPR meanwhile remain rooted to the bottom of the table and were totally outplayed. Karl Herny sees yellow for pulling back Cresswell. Kevin Nolan normally buries them but he hits it straight at Rob Green. Downing gets past Onuoha and he pulls it back for Nolan on the penalty spot who side-foots it straight at the keeper. Taarabt puts the ball past Cresswell and the defender decides to trip him up. Clever at this stage of the game. Jordan Mutch is capable of scoring the spectacular and he smashes one from 25 yards out which dips just before Adrian. The goalkeeper is able to collect it though. Taarabt is frustrating but he can do brilliant things from time to time. The midfielder skips between the West Ham midfield and runs at the defence before unleashing a shot which swerves wide of the right-hand post. Tomkins, who has possibly been West Ham's best player today, rises highest from a corner to nod the ball straight into Green's hands. The only side who look like scoring here are West Ham... The midfielder curls the ball around the wall but Adrian is equal to it and palms it away. QPR need a goal - and soon! West Ham are in total cruise control and the spark that was in QPR at the start of the second half is completely gone. Tomkins has been comfortable at the back for West Ham and both Zamora and Austin need to challenge him more. Valencia has it in the net but the referee disallows it. Rob Green had put the ball down to take a free-kick and he passed it straight to Valencia but the striker was not 10 yards away. Bizarre incident. Sakho now have five goals in just five starts for West Ham and that is a real blow to QPR. Tomkins tries to shoot from a tight angle and ends up looping the ball over the defence and to the back post where Sakho just nods it home from a yard. Huge goal for West Ham. Leroy Fer decides he is going to have a go from distance and he tries to launch one from the middle of pitch. Unfortunately his volley is blocked only yards in front of him and QPR still do not have the breakthrough. Zamora has given QPR a lot more shape. They are getting into the game now and Kranjcar is becoming more and more involved. West Ham on the other hand cannot get their foot on the ball for long at the moment. Again Zamora causes problems and he is breaking past Tomkins so the West Ham man brings him down and is booked. That is far better from QPR. Straight away the substitute Zamora gets involved and breaks down the left. He centres the ball for Austin who gets a foot on the ball but it goes past the post. Much, much better. It certainly hasn't been a classic, but West Ham look extremely comfortable. Since taking the lead after five minutes they haven't really felt the need to put their foot on the has. QPR simply haven't put their foot on anything yet. They have been very poor and you would expect changes soon. Austin is running his hart out up top but there is simply no support. Sandro has been tidy in midfield but isn't exactly setting the world alight and Kranjcar is being prevented from influencing the match. Alex Song controlling things. Valencia is down with a slight knee injury. They really have not got going at all here QPR and they keep just lumping it forward. Apart from Austin's chance, their only real positive is that they have only conceded the one... Hoilett has been completely anonynmous. Valencia makes a wonderful run in behind the QPR defence and he wants the ball played to him from Zarate. The ball is delayed slightly though and the Ecuadorian is caught offside. Warning signs for QPR though. QPR really are struggling. They just keep shooting themselves in the foot. Valencia makes himself a nuisance and he makes sure to get his body between the ball and Sandro, who alongside Caulker takes three attempts to get rid of what should have been a fairly routine defensive clearance. Everything that West Ham have done well has come through Stewart Downing. He is enjoying his role behind the front players and is spreading the play beautifully with some long-range passes. Sakho's headed flies just wide meanwhile when he should score. Charlie Austin does brilliantly to slot the ball through Tomkin's legs and he finds himself through on goal to the left-hand side. Instead of squaring to Kranjcar, he takes the shot on himself but can only lash it straight at Adrian. Zarate seems to be carrying a knock now for West Ham. Bobby Zamora, who scored the goal to get West Ham promoted, is applauded as he comes on to warm up for QPR. I'm afraid apart from West Ham kicking the ball out for a goal kick when they had a good attacking opportunity, that's about all there is to report... QPR are getting frustrated in attack because there simply isn't enough cohesion and communication between the attacking players. There is a huge gap and Austin is so isolated. Sakho is breaking into space because QPR are stretched so Sandro takes one for the team and takes him out. Card comes out. First of all Leroy Fer finds himself offside for QPR then Downing for West Ham. A lot of sloppy play from both sides, but particularly the visitors. Downing is being positive with everything he does. He sends Sakho down the left whose cross deflects behind Valencia and he smashes it just wide. QPR had a good three minutes and have been awful since... Harry Redknapp needs to find something from his players. West Ham look dangerous every time they go forward, however, particularly through Downing. Rob Green is adamant there is a hand ball here but West Ham are ahead. Downing whips in the corner and QPR simply do not defend it. Sakho just sticks out a leg and it may even have been an Onuoha own goal. Queens Park Rangers have the first meaningful attack and Charlie Austin is fouled in the centre of the park. We're almost ready for the fourth Premier League game of the day. Five minutes until kick-off after the delay at Stamford Bridge. QPR haven't won at Upton Park for 21 years! The breezed past the hosts 4-0 that day with two goals from Les Ferdinand sandwiched by Gavin Peacock and Gary Penrice strikes. Out they come, led by Stewart Downing.

Being named Arsenal captain in 2007 ahead of Gilberto Silva after one season. BAD GALLAS . After controversially signing for Arsenal, Chelsea claimed Gallas threatened to deliberately score own goals if he was not allowed to leave Stamford Bridge. Gallas, Arsenal's captain at the time, held a sit-down protest after drawing 2-2 against Birmingham put a dent in their title hopes. Being stripped of his captaincy in 2008 after publicly criticising Arsenal players and saying the younger members should show courage. Gallas, who started his professional career at Caen in 1995, won 84 caps for France and scored five goals, including the controversial strike in their 2-1 play-off win against Ireland that earned the side a 2010 World Cup berth. Gallas poked the home from close range after being set up by Thierry Henry, who had clearly handled the ball to prevent it from going out of play. He also played the 2006 World Cup final which France lost on penalties to Italy. After playing for Marseille from 1997-2001, Gallas left for England, joining Chelsea, where he won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 and popped up with some important goals. He moved to Arsenal in 2006 as part of the deal which took Ashley Cole to Stamford Bridge. Possibly his most famous moment in a red shirt came at Birmingham in 2008 when he had a tantrum and held a solitary sit-down protest in the centre circle after the Gunners conceded a late goal to draw a match they should have won. It ultimately derailed their title bid. Never one for the quiet life, he joined Tottenham  in 2010.

"Who needs maternity clothes when your baby bump looks this good? The works of art have been painted on expectant mother's stomachs by Carrie Preston, 27, from Cornwall. The artist has painted more than 130 baby bumps to provide women with a unique memento of their pregnancy. Her intricate designs include birds, animals and film scenes. Carrie said she tries to make her pictures personal to the mother-to-be, whether it be related to their favourite book, flower or colour. Picture perfect: Carrie Preston has painted more than 130 baby bumps including this 'Little Apple' painting, left, and an intricate jigsaw of the globe . Personal choice: The pregnant women might choose to have their favourite bird or animal, like this woman who chose a peacock . Out of this world: Film scenes are popular requests like this one from E.T. She said: 'Sometimes mums know exactly what they want from the beginning. The . cow bump lived on a farm and their whole family history related to . working with their jersey cows. There are often stories behind each of . the bumps.' The craze for painting baby bumps started in the U.S. a few years ago and has started to take off in the UK. Carrie, who has a degree in Early Childhood studies, said she chose the creative career path two years ago after becoming a mother herself to Maisy, eight, and Oliver, five. Artistic: Animals are popular requests like, from left, this kangaroo, pig, and turtle swimming under the sea . Wrapped up: Carrie has been belly painting for two years as she believes pregnancy should be celebrated . Wanting to spend more time with her children, she decided to pursue her passion was for art. She taught herself how to paint and set up her website, My Little Sweet Pea, to display her artistic talent and services. She explains: 'My original plan had been to become a primary school teacher. But I soon realised that being a mum and staying true to my dreams meant that I wanted to pursue my art. My . business started with murals, creating spaces for children to play in . and it progressed to face painting, gifts, watercolours and then bumps.' On how she came across the idea to paint on pregnant women she said: 'I was trawling through the internet for inspiration and I came across this new craze in America called belly painting. My friend who happened to be pregnant at the time became my muse, and that is where it all started.' Moo-mento: Carrie said this mother wanted a cow on her baby bump because she had lived on a farm and her family cared for jersey cows . Bear cub: This pregnant woman wanted a picture of her favourite Winnie The Pooh story . Making waves: This painted belly pays homage to Katsushika Hokusai's famous work . Since then, as well as making a living as an artist, Carrie has raised more than . £8,000 for charities including Comic Relief and her local neonatal . unit through 'bumpathons' where expectant mothers sponsor her to paint . their bellies. Carrie said the bigger the bump the better the canvas so she usually paints on women when they are 32-36 weeks pregnant. She only uses safe face paint designed for the skin and says the two-hour painting sessions can be a pampering experience for the mothers-to-be. She said: 'The two hours . are very relaxing, the brush strokes and sponges sooth the bump. A lot . of mums say that they have nearly fallen asleep. Babies also kick lots during the session which is obviously a comfort for the mum.' Carrie thinks belly painting is a wonderful way to show off the special time. She said: 'I really believe the pregnancy should be celebrated as much as possible. Even lucky ladies are only pregnant two or three times in their whole life, so I think we should make the most of every moment.'","Carrie Preston, 27, from Cornwall, paints the detailed images on baby bumps .

"Scientists have found out how to turn pure light into matter for the very first time – after 80 years of trying. The idea was first dreamt up in 1934 by two physicists, but they never expected anybody to be able to physically demonstrate their prediction. But researchers at Imperial College London say they have found a way to convert light into matter by using new equipment in the form of an extremely powerful high-intensity laser, capable of speeding up electrons to just below the speed of light. Researchers say they have found a way to convert light into matter by using new equipment in the form of an extremely powerful laser capable of speeding up electrons to just below the speed of light . The 80-year-old theory involved smashing together two particles of light, or photons, to create an electron and a positron - subatomic particles found in all materials. Although scientists at the university believe they can create matter, at this stage the end result would not be visible to the naked eye. Professor Steve Rose, from imperial College, said: 'What was so surprising to us was the discovery of how we can create matter directly from light using the technology that we have today in the UK. ‘As we are theorists we are now talking to others who can use our ideas to undertake this landmark experiment.' The experiment would involve blasting electrons, sped up by lasers to just below the speed of light, into a slab of gold to create a beam of photons a billion times more energetic than visible light. The next stage would need a tiny gold can called a hohlraum, German for 'empty room'. Scientists would fire a high-energy laser at the inner surface of this to create a thermal radiation field, generating light similar to that emitted by stars. Although scientists at Imperial College London, pictured, believe they can create matter, it would only be in the form of tiny subatomic particles, not visible to the naked eye . They would then direct the photon beam from the first stage of the experiment through the centre of the can, causing the photons from the two sources to collide and form electrons and positrons. It would then be possible to detect the formation of the electrons and positrons when they exited the can – in their microscopic state. Oliver Pike, who is currently completing his PhD in plasma physics at Imperial College London, said: 'Although the theory is conceptually simple, it has been very difficult to verify experimentally. The experimental design we propose can be carried out with relative ease and with existing technology. 'Within a few hours of looking for applications of hohlraums outside their traditional role in fusion energy research, we were astonished to find they provided the perfect conditions for creating a photon collider. 'The race to carry out and complete the experiment is on.' The research published in Nature Photonics shows how the original theory, put forward by US physicists, Gregory Breit and John Wheeler in the 1930s, could be proven in practice. This 'photon-photon collider', which would convert light directly into matter using technology that is already available, would be a new type of high-energy physics experiment. The experiment would recreate a process that was important in the first 100 seconds of the universe and that is also seen in gamma ray bursts, which are the biggest explosions in the universe and one of physics' greatest unsolved mysteries.","Theory of turning light into matter first thought of in 1934 by two physicist .

"One of the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines was forced into a 2,000-mile detour when it was mysteriously refused entry into the United Arab Emirates. HMS Tireless spent a week in international waters while it sought permission to dock before deciding to divert to Goa in India. Ministry of Defence officials have not revealed the reason for the snub but insist there was never any safety issue. The submarine HMS Tireless is seen in the Artic in Ministry of Defence March 21, 2007 . The diversion meant heartbreak for a handful of families who had travelled to the Arabian Gulf hoping to see crew members for the first time in months. A planned change of crew also had to be postponed as the Trafalgar-class sub made its way to India.Some families are understood to be seeking compensation for the cost of flights and a week of accommodation while in the UAE. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We do not discuss submarine movements for reasons of security. 'However, I can confirm that HMS Tireless's visit programme in the Gulf of Oman was delayed. 'We do not routinely comment on submarine operations so we are unable to discuss the detail, although we can confirm it was not a safety issue. British sailors stand on the HMS Tireless submarine as it pulls out of . Gibraltar in 2001 . 'A small number of families did travel to the region at their own expense in anticipation of the visit.'They were kept informed of the situation by local Royal Navy personnel ashore.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office denied there were any diplomatic issues between the UK and the UAE. A spokesman said: 'The UK has a long history of co-operation and friendship with the UAE. 'We maintain regular contact at the most senior levels and work together on shared interests and security challenges across the region.' HMS Tireless was due to be decommissioned last year but it was reportedly spotted surfacing off the coast of Gibraltar last August amid tensions between Spain and Britain over fishing rights. The 30-year-old vessel also suffered a leak in its reactor in February of last year and had to return to its Devonport, Plymouth, HQ for repairs. MoD officials say the sub remains on active service but is due to be replaced by a new Astute class submarine. The hunter-killer craft has a crew of 130 plus 18 officers and a top speed is 32 knots or 36.8 mph.","HMS Tireless spent a week in international waters while it sought permission to dock .

"A Canadian nun was abducted by a gang of armed kidnappers in the early hours of Saturday while working as a missionary in Cameroon. Fears are growing for Sister Gilberte Bissiere, as it was revealed that the gunman targeted the 80-year-old and two Italian priests, but left African religious workers behind. The group had been part of a Catholic mission to help improve water supplies and provide medical help to those with HIV and Aids. Kidnapped: Sister Gilberte Bissiere, from Canada, was abducted along with two priests in Cameroon . Armed forces in Cameroon are said to be trying to find the kidnappers, but officials have not said who was behind the abduction of Sister Gilberte and priests, Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegri. 'Doors were broken towards midnight by unknown people and the religious were taken away. We do not know where they are,' Bishop Philippe Stevens said. 'The act is not yet claimed but we imagine who is behind this kidnapping,' the Bishop, who is based in Maroua where the kidnapping took place, added. An unidentified priest from Vicenza told Vatican Radio the kidnappers seized Sister Gilberte, but left nuns from Cameroon. Vatican Radio said officials had not ruled out involvement by Islamic fundamentalist group Boko Harem. The terror group has warned Cameroon to stay out of its fight with the Nigerian . military, threatening to carry its war for an Islamic state . into the neighboring country. Pope Francis is said to be aware of the kidnapping and released a statement saying he 'hopes for a rapid and positive solution to the affair'. Abducted: Gianantonio Allegri, left, and Giampaolo Marta, right, are among the kidnap victims .

Italy has cautioned against travel to the area, which is 20 miles from the border with Nigeria because of the risk of 'kidnappings due to presence of jihadist elements coming from Nigeria'. The priests were assigned from the Vicenza diocese in northern Italy. No one has claimed responsibility, diocese officials said. Father Gianantonio had written to his home diocese last month saying local authorities had advised him to travel with a police escort, the Catholic News Agency reported. 'Even if on the surface you do not notice anything in particular that is alarming, it is palpable in our feelings and our conversations,' he wrote in the letter dated March 12.","Canadian Sister Gilberte Bissiere was taken along with two Italian priests .

"Sinitta quits at eleventh hour . After decades of fame and fortune, they are used to the finer things in life. But that hasn't deterred a crop of older contestants from deciding to rough it in the jungle in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! The line-up for the new series is dominated by ageing stars, with four of the ten contestants in their 60s. Well dressed for the jungle: Lorraine Chase arrives in Brisbane this week ahead of her appearance on I'm A Celebrity.. Get Me Out Of Here! Hart to Hart actress Stefanie Powers, . 69, comedian Freddie Starr, 68, Emmerdale star Lorraine Chase, 60, and . former jockey Willie Carson, 68, are swapping creature comforts for the . challenges and creepy-crawlies of the Australian bush. Also on the series, which begins on Sunday, are Benidorm actress Crissy Rock, 53, and pop singer Sinitta, 43. Here I go! Comedian Freddie Starr, 69, looked excited as he jetted out of Heathrow . With the average age of this year's . contestants at 47, show insiders admitted that executives had realised . viewers like older celebrities because they bring more 'charisma, jokes . and life experience'. But they insisted that this year's . show was cast purely on 'character' and filling it with older . celebrities had not been a deliberate tactic. It comes after BBC's . Strictly Come Dancing attracted attention for the number of older women . on the current series, including Edwina Currie, 64, Anita Dobson, 62, . Lulu, 62, and Nancy Dell'Olio, 50. She certainly would have been an entertaining addition to this year's batch of celebrities facing the jungle. But it has emerged that Sinitta quit I'm A Celebrity... at the last minute. The singer, 43, was due to fly to Australia this week but pulled out at the eleventh hour. Sinitta attended a party at Garrard . jewellery house in London Monday night when she was supposed to be . preparing for her flight to Brisbane. As recently as Monday Simon Cowell's . ex was insisting to ITV bosses that she would go through with show . despite her phobia of creepie-crawlies, The Daily Star alleges. But despite attempting to 'train herself' to handle snakes and insects, her morbid fear became too much. Sinitta's spokesperson told the paper: 'She would have been hilarious but her phobias cause panic attacks.' Get me out of here! Sinitta was due to fly to Australia this week but has pulled out over her phobia of creepie-crawlies causing panic attacks . And in the past, older contestants on . I'm A Celebrity have grabbed the most headlines, with Kim Woodburn, . Gillian McKeith, Jan Leeming and Tony Blackburn among the more memorable . stars. A source on the ITV programme said: . 'We don't cast on age, we choose people based on character and . personality regardless of how old they are. 'But often people that have lived a . bit bring a bit more in charisma, jokes and life experience. We are . happy with the mix of people we have got.' Eye candy: Jessica Jane Clement arrives at Brisbane Airport for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Many of the contestants, including Carson, Starr and Miss Chase, have already landed in Australia to prepare for filming. Miss Chase said: 'I had a 60th . birthday in July and ever since then I've been trying to find a . challenge. I'm A Celebrity is that challenge.' 'I tried to look up various bootcamps . to tackle this year, but life always gets in the way. At one point, I . even thought about learning to ride a motorbike, so I researched . motorbike courses in Wales – but it was getting towards the end of the . year and I hadn't signed up for anything yet when I heard from the . producers.' Looking forward to it? The Only Way Is Essex star Mark Wright and actress Stefanie Powers are also on board . Carson said: 'I'm really looking . forward to experiencing Australia. However, I'm not prepared for . roughing it in the jungle. I'm not prepared for the camping aspect of . it. And I'm really going to miss my bed.' Starr had a heart attack and underwent . bypass surgery in April last year. He said: 'I'm so out of shape it's . unbelievable, but I'll try to lift trees and things like that while I'm . in the jungle.' The older contestants will be joined . by younger faces including Coronation Street actor Antony Cotton, 36, . The Only Way Is Essex star Mark Wright, 24, Real Hustle presenter . Jessica-Jane Clement, 26, and McFly bassist Dougie Poynter, 23. Will he cope? Former jockey Willie Carson, 68, is expected to appear on the show . Get ready for a rollercoaster: Fatima Whitbread and Crissy Rock are starring on the show . Last year's show was dominated by the antics of Miss McKeith after she collapsed during one of the trials. She won little sympathy from her fellow contestants and the audience. The former accused her of faking her . collapse and the latter ignored her professed  phobia of . creepie-crawlies by repeatedly voting for her to take part in the Bush . Tucker challenges.

"A Down's Syndrome man who suffocated to death . while being arrested by police for refusing to leave a movie theater idolized law enforcement, it was revealed today. Robert Ethan Saylor, 26, was an avid follower of TV show NCIS and was so interested in the police that he would regularly call 911 so they would come to the house so he could to talk to them. But on January 12, he died following a confrontation with the very people he idolized, after he asphyxiated as three police officers tried to restrain him at a theater in Frederick, Maryland. Loss: Robert Ethan Saylor, who died in police custody, was said to be obsessed with law enforcement . Saylor had been watching Zero Dark Thirty at the cinema with a health aide and when it finished, he wanted to watch it again and refused to leave. A cinema employee called three off-duty sheriff's deputies - Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy 1st Class James Harris - who were working a security job at a nearby shopping center. When the officers, who were not wearing police uniforms, approached Saylor and tried to arrest him, he began lashing out. They handcuffed him and allegedly his face was put to the ground as he was being apprehended, ABC News reported. The officers then realised he was suffering a 'medical emergency'. Music-lover: Robert Saylor pictured with a relative was a big music fan and a member of his church choir . On leave: Lt. Scott Jewell, left, and Sgt. Rich Rochford, right, were two of the officers at the scene . The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died. 'Ethan . was developmentally disabled, not a criminal,' Joseph Espo, a lawyer . representing Saylor's parents, Patti and Ron Saylor, told the Washington . Post. 'He was . entranced by police and police departments and liked communicating with . them to the extent that, if there was ever a complaint, it was that he'd . call so they could come to the house so he could talk to them.' Saylor's . mother took cookies to the sheriff’s office last year to thank the . deputies for all the trips they made to the house, Espo told the Post. The . three deputies have all been placed on administrative leave and have . exercised their right as law enforcement officers not to give statements . to investigators. Scene: The deputies, who were not in uniform, went to Westview Cinema when he did not leave . Tragic: Saylor was taken to Frederick Memorial . Hospital by officers and later died from his injuries . Saylor's mother, Patti Saylor, told the ABC her son should never have been arrested. 'He has never had anyone put their hands on him in their life,' says Patti Saylor. 'He would not have been doing anything threatening to anybody.' Authorities say they are investigating the incident. Saylor, often known by his middle name Ethan, was said to be a 'cherished member of Damascus Road Community Church' where he was a popular member of the men's choir.","Robert Saylor, 26, died while being arrested for refusing to leave Westview Cinemas, Frederick, Maryland, on January 12 ."
"West Ham have been given a boost with news that Andy Carroll has returned to first-team training following injury. The 25-year-old hasn't kicked a ball all campaign after picking up an ankle problem in the Hammers' pre-season tour of New Zealand, but his arrival on Thursday was confirmed via the club's official Twitter account. Carroll is pictured grinning from ear-to-ear as he is put through his paces along with the rest of the West Ham squad. VIDEO Scroll down to see Andy Carroll return to West Ham first-team training . Andy Carroll returned to first-team training with West Ham on Thursday after an ankle injury . The England international won't feature in the club's home clash against Manchester City on Saturday with his comeback likely to be in November. Carroll's eventual return will come as a welcome addition to boss Sam Allardyce despite the club's impressive early-season form. The Upton Park outfit sit fourth in the Premier League having collected 13 points from eight games to date. Summer signings Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia have adapted to life in England brilliantly so far with the pair having scored seven goals between them in England's top flight. Injury-plagued Carroll will find it hard to displace the duo upfront on current form, but the £15million striker's return will give Allardyce a welcome selection dilemma when fully-fit.

"An unstoppable last-gasp, long-range shot from Yordan Minev gave Ludogorets a 1-0 victory over 10-man Basel in their Champions League Group B match. It was an historic moment in Sofia for Ludogorets, who became the first Bulgarian team to win points in the Champions League's group stage.

The Bulgarians, who impressed against Liverpool and Madrid in their previous matches, signalled their intent with a brilliant header from Marcelinho that forced Basle keeper Tomas Vaclik to save on the stretch after 17 minutes. Ivory Coast midfielder Geoffroy Serey Die was then shown a straight red card for a bad foul on Ludogorets's Cosmin Moti, but the visitors still almost took the lead with keeper Vladislav Stoyanov making a brilliant one-handed save to deny Derlis Gonzalez.

"Newcastle's top goalscorer Papiss Cisse is a doubt for Sunday's trip to Tottenham – but Ryan Taylor is back in the squad after two years out injured. Senegal forward Cisse has not trained since last weekend's 1-0 victory over Leicester because of a knee problem. He has scored four times in as many games since returning from a broken kneecap and his goals have helped ease the pressure on manager Alan Pardew. Papiss Cisse scores past goalkeeper Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel last Sunday . But the Newcastle boss, who is also sweating on the fitness of calf victim Cheick Tiote, said: 'We have not got a crisis, but we have one or two we are kind of waiting for. Papiss, Cheick - I'm not really going to be clear on any of that until Friday. But we have got players in the group to cope if they don't make it.' Without Cisse, Pardew could be forced to hand Spanish rookie Ayoze Perez his first Premier League start. Meanwhile, Taylor is included in the Newcastle squad for the first time since August 2012. Ryan Taylor has overcome two horrific years of injury problems to make his return to the Newcastle squad . Spanish rookie Ayoze Perez (right) may get his first Premier League start on Saturday . The 30-year-old midfielder has suffered successive cruciate knee ligament injuries in that time, and Pardew said: 'Ryan should return this week and I think that's an inspirational story to everybody here and everybody in football, because this is a guy who has had terrible, terrible bad luck with cruciate injuries and he has come back again. 'It was so pleasing to put his name on the team-sheet this week to travel. That's good news for us, because he is a very, very liked guy here. 'He's just a good person to have at the training ground. There's been a lot of talk this week about professionalism at training grounds and what people bring.

"One serene image has been viewed by over one billion eyes, has been seen in videos of the White House and even the Russian government--the default Windows XP computer background. Even though Microsoft killed off support for Windows XP this week after 13 years, they decided to pay homage to the nostalgic scene. With many wondering where the image of green grass and blue skies named 'Bliss' really came from, the tech company Microsoft released a video in which they interview the photographer Charles O'Rear. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This photo called 'Bliss' was taken by former National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear on 1996 and was made famous by being Microsoft XP's default desktop photo . This is the same scene where O'Rear took his famed desktop background photo in 1996 . O'Rear drove from Napa Valley to Sacramento on an extremely busy and dangerous road . O'Rear, a former National Geographic photographer said he was driving through the Napa Valley on his way to visit his girlfriend in San Francisco when he came across a beautiful landscape with perfect grass and an almost clear sky. In a video about the photo, O'Rear says that even though the photo appears to be taken in a calm environment, the road there is one of the most dangerous and busy roads he's driven on. Despite the dangerous road, the image couldn't be more placid. He took his old film camera and snapped the famous photo in 1996. O'Rear says by the time he took the picture there were a few clouds in the sky but when he first saw the photo worthy setting the sky was completely clear. Several years later, Microsoft commissioned the photo for Windows XP, reports Time. They flew O'Rear out to their offices to personally deliver the photo. 'I had no idea where it was going to go,' ‘O’Rear said in the video. 'Anybody now from age 15 to the rest of their life will remember this photograph.' he said. 'I’m thrilled to know that people have had pleasure from looking at that, from looking that a photograph that I made.' O'Rear stopped to snap the photo as he was driving along this busy road from Napa Valley to Sacramento .

"Diego Simeone has long been lauded for his motivational skills in charge of Atletico Madrid - and whatever he said to his charges at half time against Malmo certainly did the trick as they ran out 5-0 winners with five second-half goals. Atletico were sluggish in the first half at the Calderon but eventually ran out big winners to put them in a great position to qualify from Group A at the half-way stage. Koke, Mario Mandzukic, Antoine Griezmann, Diego Godin and Alessio Cerci all scored after the break to give them six points from their first two games. Diego Godin leaps into the air at the Calderon to celebrate his goal - a fourth of five second half strikes for Atletico Madrid .

Atletico Madrid: Moya; Godin, Siqueira, Juanfran, Miranda; Suarez, Koke, Niguez; Griezmann (Rodriguez 72), Mandzukic (Cerci 77), Turan (Garcia 68). Unused subs: Gamez, Gimenez, Jimenez, Oblak.

Booked: Johansson, Rosenberg. But the first half was a different story, with dead ball opportunities uncharacteristically wasted and Griezmann hitting the bar when clean through. Simeone looking frustrated on the touchline. The second period was a different story though, and Koke unlocked the Swedish side's defence to break the deadlock within three minutes of the restart after latching onto Arda Turan's cross. Summer signings Mandzukic and Griezmann scored a quick-fire double after the hour mark. First Mandzukic turned in a cross with a poacher's finish, then Griezmann was perhaps a little lucky to see his shot take a touch off the keeper before dropping just under the crossbar and into the back of the net . And captain Godin added the fourth when he headed home a corner with three minutes left. Cerci made it five in injury time, knocking home his own rebound from a curling effort to add even more gloss to the result. That result leaves Atletico on six points in the group, although they sit behind Olympiakos on their head-to-head record despite a five-goal superior goal difference, with the Greeks still to travel to Madrid. Juventus and Malmo sit three points behind that pair in what is one of the tightest groups in the Champions League at the half-way stage. Atletico face Getafe in La Liga on Sunday - a game that should pose a good opportunity to gain ground on their main title rivals with Real Madrid and Barcelona meeting in El Classico. Mario Mandzukic celebrates his goal as Atletico put themselves in a strong position to qualify from a tough Group A .

"A man whose nose was removed during a battle with cancer has had a completely new one reconstructed with bones from his ribs. Alan Dagless, 56, underwent two years of reconstructive surgery after he lost his nose to a rare form of skin cancer. Specialists at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle used bones and skin grafts from his legs to build a new nose, which Mr Dagless says has now restored his confidence. Alan Dagless, who had his nose removed during a battle with cancer, has had his face transformed after a new one was built with bones from his ribs . Mr Dagless pictured in 2008 with , before his cancer was discovered. Mr Dagless, 56, of Whitley Bay, endured two years of reconstructive surgery following an operation to remove a rare form of skin cancer from his nose . The former joiner said: 'When the bandages were taken off once all the reconstruction was completed, I was amazed. I had been under bandages for so long that I didn't exactly know what to expect. 'I was so happy to have my nose back. I feel like myself again.' Mr Dagless, of Whitley Bay, was diagnosed with squamous cellular carcinoma in December 2008 after more than a year of experiencing alarming nosebleeds. Mr Dagless's fiance and partner of 20 years Kim Williams, 54, said: 'We were worried. We thought it couldn't be normal for Alan to be experiencing as many nosebleeds as he was. He had up to 20 a day. Mr Dagless during his reconstructive surgery. Doctors removed his nose after they were concerned the cancer would spread to his lymph nodes . 'He wasn't experiencing any pain but there was lots of blood. He would be going about his normal business and then suddenly the bleeding would start. 'Our bedsheets were often ruined because of how much blood there was.' But she said it wasn't until August 2008 when Miss Williams returned from holiday to find her fiance in a state of distress that the couple took action. She said: 'He looked like Elephant Man - his nose was red and three times the size and his eyes were puffed up.' Doctors examined Mr Dagless and discovered cancer in his nose. They were also concerned about the cancer spreading to his lymph nodes. They recommended the complete removal of Mr Dagless's nose. Miss Williams said she and Mr Dagless's sons Malcolm and Michael, and Miss Williams's son Scott, were shocked. Mr Dagless said: 'It was difficult to be told that having the nose removed was my only option, but I coped as best I could.' In January 2009, after 12 hours on the operating table, Mr Dagless emerged from surgery with a bandage covering the deep hole where his nose had once been. Despite assurances that the procedure had almost certainly removed all traces of cancer from his body, Mr Dagless faced a traumatic recovery period. He said: 'I was a typical man - I kept quiet but I got very down about it. It was tough to cope with such a big change.' Miss Williams said: 'He kept his feelings to himself. It was only natural that he felt a bit depressed. I had to be strong for him.' Mr Dagless's face as it appears today. He was diagnosed with squamous cellular carcinoma in December 2008 after more than a year of experiencing alarming nosebleeds . Now, after two years, his transformation is complete and his nose has been completely reconstructed . After a year, Mr Omar Ahmed, a consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, spoke to the couple about options to restore Mr Dagless's face. Mr Dagless said: 'Mr Ahmed said I could either wear a plastic nose or have it rebuilt using tissue from my body. I chose to have it rebuilt, because it was thought it would be better in the long run.' Mr Dagless's face remained bandaged for the majority of the next two years as he underwent a series of plastic surgery procedures. Finally, in December 2012, consultants were ready to remove the dressings permanently. Miss Williams said: 'It was the first time we'd had a chance to take a really close look. It was marvellous. Mr Ahmed did some really good work.' The couple now hope to marry once they can afford a honeymoon. Mr Dagless said: 'My life has improved enormously.

"Cesc Fabregas was pleased to be back in London following this week's Euro 2016 qualifying matches. The midfielder played in Spain's shock 2-1 defeat to Slovakia on Thursday but was an unused substitute as Vicente Del Bosque's men made amends with a 4-0 victory in Luxembourg. Smiling for the camera with his partner Daniella Semaan, seemingly outside the couple's London home, 27-year-old Fabregas posted the snap to Instagram and accompanied the picture with the message: 'Home sweet home!!' Cesc Fabregas posted a snap with his partner Daniella Seeman after returning home from international duty . Chelsea fans will be pleased to see the Spaniard return from international duty unscathed with the Blues leading with the way in the Premier League having won six of their opening seven fixtures. Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, has no regrets about allowing the opportunity to bring  Fabregas back to Arsenal pass him by last summer. The Gunners had first option on signing the 27-year-old midfielder after they inserted a clause in the deal which took him to Barcelona in 2011. But Arsenal boss Wenger decided against making a move the Spaniard during the last transfer window and he subsequently joined Chelsea for £30million.

Fabregas has been in sensational form since his move to Stamford Bridge, laying on seven assists for his team-mates in seven Premier League appearances. But despite Fabregas' dazzling performances in blue, Wenger insists he is content with his decision not to offer him a return to the Emirates. Speaking to BeIN sports, he said: 'I don't regret not taking Cesc because we already had a lot of creative players in our midfield.' Fabregas, pictured in action against Arsenal, has seven assists to his name in seven Premier League games . Arsenal lost 2-0 to league leaders Chelsea in their last fixture before the international break, a result which left them nine points behind Jose Mourinho's side. But even with a hefty gap already between the two sides, the Frenchman is confident his side will catch their London rivals as the season goes on. He added: 'Chelsea will also have a difficult period [in the season]. Our schedule was extremely difficult and I have the belief that we can close the gap to them.'

"Click here for all the stats and heat maps from the game at the Veltins-Arena . John O’Shea now has one hundred caps and three goals for the Republic of Ireland. As Martin O’Neill and his team edge forwards towards an unlikely shot at qualification for the European Championship finals, that second statistic is currently somewhat more important than the first. Only seconds remained in added time in Gelsenkirchen on Tuesday night as Ireland seemed to be heading to a rather expected and routine defeat against a German team unimpressive but still markedly superior.

Toni Kroos had scored his team’s goal with 20 minutes to go and, for Ireland, there seemed to be no coming back. O’Shea, however, had been a Trojan at centre-half all night and, when it mattered, he appeared just an inch or two ahead of Germany’s Mats Hummels to prod an unlikely equaliser past Manuel Neuer after a deep cross from substitute Wes Hoolahan had been hooked back across goal deep in the 94th minute. It really was a most incredible finish. O’Shea’s last goal for his country had come against Kazakhstan. Suffice to say, this one may transpire to be much more important. Having not lost back-to-back competitive games since the European Championship finals hosted by Holland and Belgium 14 years ago, Germany were clearly intent making amends for their setback across the Polish border at the weekend. For much of the first half, their football was purposeful and aggressive. For long periods, though, there was not much to show for it once play reached the environs of the Irish penalty area. Indeed, Irish goalkeeper Forde was worked only twice in an opening 45 minutes that saw O’Neill’s team hold the Germans at bay with relative comfort. Certainly Ireland were organised and not lacking in energy themselves. O’Shea and Marc Wilson were particularly impressive immediately in front of Forde even if the Irish largely failed to hold on to the ball whenever they did manage to venture in to the German half. A team unrecognisable in part to the one that lifted the World Cup in Rio back in early July, Germany nevertheless bristled with attacking menace at the outset. Indeed, only five minutes had elapsed when left-back Erik Durm advanced to smack a superb right foot volley in to the top of the crossbar from 25 yards. For a while this effort seemed to set the tone as the German midfield eased the Irish defence so far towards their own goal that, at times, as many as six green shirts retreated to form some kind of shield in front of Forde. Thousands of Irish fans travelled to watch their team pick up their seventh point in three games in Group D qualifying . Irish fans were in raptures after O'Shea's equaliser, with one German (centre) looking particularly out of place among green shirts .

One rare Ireland attack ended with Bayern keeper Neuer grabbing the ball low just ahead of  Robbie Keane . There were other early chances, too, as full-back Antonio Rudiger headed a good chance wide after a training ground set piece between Kroos and Thomas Muller provided him with an opportunity. Then Julian Draxler made an intelligent run inside David Meyler to receive possession and pull the ball back to Kroos. The shot, though, was dragged wide. Irish forays in to German territory were rare but, as time passed, so were genuine threats on their goal. Mistakes from Wilson and then Forde gave Germany an apparent route to goal but O’Shea cleared with a huge swing of the right boot that said everything about the urgency of the situation. Before the interval there was still time for Ginter to head a corner over while Kroos also whistled another long range effort over the frame of the goal. Germany, though, reached half-time with much to think about and made a change for the second period as Arsenal’s Lukas Podolski replaced Ginter for the second period.

Before long, however, Germany were back on top and Forde was at his best to touch over a long-range shot from Kroos before Hummels almost turned in the resulting corner from close range. Just before the hour, meanwhile, came a moment of apparent controversy as Podolski appeared to be fouled in the penalty area by Wilson after Muller had superbly cushioned a header in to the substitute’s path. However, replays showed that the referee was correct to wave away penalty appeals as there had been no contact and Podolski had in fact fallen over rather easily. By now, with less than half an hour left, Ireland were beginning to look rather ragged. They just couldn’t keep the ball and, as such, were beginning to look increasingly vulnerable. Germany, though, were still looking less than convincing. Joachim Low (left) gives instructions to his Germany side, who struggled to get going, while Martin O'Neill ponders on the touchline .

Walters attempts to put Schalke star Draxler off as he drives forward with the ball at his home ground in Gelsenkirchen . Having had a more realistic penalty appeal rejected when O’Shea seemed to grapple Gotze to the ground, Germany finally broke through in the 70th minute. Kroos had already had a few sighters when he lined up another from 25 yards and this time his low right foot shot fizzed past Forde and found the corner via the foot of the goalkeeper’s right-hand post. Right at the death, Ireland almost scored when McClean crossed low from the left for Hoolahan, only for Durm somehow to throw himself in the way of the ball and block the threat. Then up stepped O’Shea to write his own story. ‘I remember all my international goals because there aren’t many,’ said the former Manchester United player. ‘This one overtakes the other two. I’m not one for hanging shirts up but this one may be heading for the mantelpiece in my mum and dad’s house.’ The result leaves Ireland with seven points from three games in Group D, with the hardest away trip out of the way for O'Neill and assistant Roy Keane.

A Met Office spokesman said the snow was falling much earlier than last year, when snowflakes were not reported until December. Charlie Powell, a spokesman for the Met Office said: 'Some parts of the country are as cold as Moscow today. Those in Northumberland are experiencing temperatures between 3 and 4C. 'Overnight temperatures could drop to as low as -2 with a frosty start to the day tomorrow for many.

Tony Conlan, a forecaster with MeteoGroup UK, the weather division of the Press Association, said some areas of lower ground in Scotland saw their first meaningful snow, and a 'wintry mix' of rain, sleet, hail and some snow will continue until late on Saturday. 'It will be colder today than it has been, with temperatures typically ranging from 2C (36F) in parts of the Scottish highlands to 10 or 11C (50-52F) in the far west of England' he said.

As strengthening winds and cold air spread across Britain from Scotland, a group of body-boarders make the most of the big waves in the North Bay, Scarborough . Thousands of migrating birds have been dying before reaching England this week because of an appalling combination of fog and winds around the coast. Fishermen have discovered many exhausted and disorientated 'garden' birds plunging into the sea around their vessels, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). England's east coast, from Northumberland to Kent, has seen the arrival of many birds, including redwings, fieldfares, bramblings and blackbirds, perhaps numbering in their millions. The charity said these were the lucky survivors which had managed to cross the North Sea, but many others might have perished before making landfall. The skipper of a boat said: 'While fishing about 10 miles south of Portsmouth, we witnessed thousands of garden birds disorientated, land on the sea and most drowning. 'Species included goldcrests, robins, thrushes and blackbirds. The sky was thick with garden birds. I estimate I saw 500 birds die and that was just in our 300-yard sphere.' Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said: 'The scale of these reports is truly shocking, and it has the potential to adversely affect the status of species which may be declining for other reasons.'","Temperatures as cold as Moscow today as chill of winter hits the north-east .

"Ten people working for one of Europe's largest telecom firms in France have committed suicide in the past three months for reasons ‘explicitly related’ to their jobs, it emerged today. Orange France, a company also present in the UK, is notorious for its tough approach to customer services as well as their employees. Staff working in call centres have previously complained about a 'bullying culture' and the firm, including having to ask permission to go to the bathroom. Ten people at telecoms firm Orange France have committed suicide in the past three months, and a report says all of the deaths were 'explicitly related to work' The ten suicides so far in 2014 are almost as many as in the whole of last year  – prompting a ‘serious alert’, according to the monitoring group, the Observatory for Stress and Forced Mobility. A report says all of the deaths were ‘explicitly related to work’ at Orange, which is the new name for what used to be called France Telecom. The worst suicide spell to date was between 2008 and 2009 when 35 employees took their lives. This prompted the resignation of the company boss, Didier Lombard, and had much to do with France Telecom trying to re-brand itself. It was privatised in 2004, leading to huge job losses and an increased work load on those who remained. Bad boss: Staff working in Orange France's call centres have previously complained about a 'bullying culture', and the firm saw 35 people commit suicide in 2009 (stock image) Now the company, which became Orange in 2013 and employs around 100,000 people, is due to meet employee representatives to discuss the issue on Friday. A spokesman confirmed to French news agency AFP that there had been ‘several suicides’ this year, and that ‘these situations remind us to be vigilant’. Orange call-centre staff have, in the past, complained of having to ask permission to go to the toilet or file a written explanation for going one-minute over a lunch break. Senior staff say they have been bullied, with many having turned to antidepressants or taken extended sick-leave.

"Louis van Gaal has confirmed Manchester United youngsters Paddy McNair and Tom Thorpe will be in the squad for Saturday's match against West Ham at Old Trafford. The two Under 21 defenders have been drafted in to deal with a lengthy injury list which includes centre backs Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. Tyler Blackett, who has been deputising in that position, is suspended after being sent off against Leicester last week. 'They [McNair and Thorpe] are in the squad,' Van Gaal told MUTV on Friday. 'That is why we have a youth education. It was also our policy [to use the youth teams] and always the policy of the club too.'

With United's three first-choice centre backs out, the Dutchman is expected to drop Argentina international Marcos Rojo into the centre, with either Thorpe, the club's reserve team captain, or 19-year-old McNair, partnering him in the heart of United's backline. When asked if Daley Blind and Rojo were an option as a centre-back pairing, he said: 'No, I don't like having too many left-sided defenders or left-footed players in defence. 'I think always of balance so [instead] I have to pick up a right-sided central defender from the youth education. Normally, I am always doing things like that. I have already said that we have a lot of vacancies when you buy only six players and let 14 players go.'

Jones had one injury in the national team, which was unfortunate. 'I am a coach with a lot of experience and I believe I have never been in this situation. It is surprising me and I am evaluating myself and my staff and also the players to see what is wrong but I cannot imagine what we are doing at another level than in my former clubs.' Van Gaal said Saturday's game against West Ham could also see a league debut for Luke Shaw, who joined the club from Southampton in the summer but has been kept out by injury. 'Maybe last week he could have played but it is better to give an injured player more time to recover and that's why he didn't play last week. He is now ready to play and I am anxious to see him.' Luke Shaw, pictured in training with Radamel Falcao on Friday, could make his league debut for the Red Devils after recovering from injury . United vice-captain Darren Fletcher jogs ahead of Thorpe, who looked to be enjoying himself after being promoted from the reserves to Van Gaal's senior squad . When asked if the 5-3 defeat to Leicester was a one-off, Van Gaal said: 'Yes, of course. I've spoken with the media and they are thinking it is a record occurrence. It is an incident. 'For a player I hope it is a once in a lifetime incident. Me, as a coach, I have experienced such a result in Barcelona. We have to learn from it and improve.' The Dutchman said he has been impressed by Angel Di Maria's versatility since his summer move from Spanish giants Real Madrid. 'In both positions he is playing fantastic,' said Van Gaal. 'He is creating a lot, he is scoring goals and he gives assists. So, as a coach, you cannot want more. But we have also the main moment in football when we lose the ball and then he can improve.' On Falcao's fitness as he recovers from a serious knee injury, he said: 'We are building up Falcao in the same way we are building up the other players. You will notice I left Van Persie to train for the first three weeks before he came in for 60 minutes. I did the same with Falcao. He has impressed me and played very well. I hope he can continue.'

'I was very impressed [with their win over Liverpool]. They play the same system we do. It is more or less one system against the same system. They play like a team.

She made the revelation during a television interview in Germany yesterday - her 25th birthday - ahead of the release of the film 3,096 Days. The film is based on her memoir, which takes its name from the number of days spent in captivity. Miss Kampusch has previously refused to comment on the sexual side of the complex relationship she developed with Priklopil. Scroll down for video . Natascha Kampusch was interviewed last night by Günter Jauch . Miss Kampusch said she had been raped by her kidnapper Wolfgang Priklopil - the first time she has discussed such details . The upcoming film is based on Miss Kampusch's memoir of her ordeal . The film, starring Northern Irish actor Antonia Campbell-Hughes as Miss Kampusch, will be released across Europe this month and shows Priklopil taking his young captor out of the cellar he constructed beneath his house near Vienna and raping her. Speaking to talk show host Günter Jauch, Miss Kampusch said police evidence had reached 'the public domain'. She said this made her agree to changes in the film's script which showed the assaults. Jauch asked her: 'So you are saying now to the public: this is what happened, now please leave me in peace?' She replied; 'Yes'. Priklopil was an Austrian communications . technician who kidnapped . Kampusch on the morning of March 2 1998 on her way to . school. He kept her in a custom built basement under his house in Strasshof near . Gänserndorf, in Lower Austria. Miss Kampusch escaped on August 23 2006 while Priklopil took a phone call. He killed himself by lying down in front of a train shortly after her escape. Miss Kampusch, who has made an estimated five million pounds in TV and magazine interviews and book sales, still has mixed feelings about the man she calls 'the criminal'. She reportedly carries a photo of him around with her at all times, lives in his house, maintains his car and travels under a false name to foreign countries because of the attention she gets. Miss Kampusch said last night that she wished Priklopil had lived to tell his side of the story. She said the cellar in his house, which she now owns, has been filled in. She said: 'That feels good.' Speaking about life after her escape, she said: 'I'm trying to commit to each day positively, to process what is happening to me. 'That I was a child when it happened really helped me. As a child you are still naive and believe in justice.' She says she was the intellectual superior of Priklopil, who had never had a girlfriend and whose plan was to groom Natascha until she fell in love with him. 'The more information I learned about him, the more I could see through his intentions,' she said. 'I can never do the carefree youth thing. What helps me is talking with other other people who share their experiences of youth with me.' Wolfgang Priklopi killed himself after Natascha Kampusch escaped from his home, eight years after her kidnap . Miss Kampusch gave her first television interview shortly after her escape, but has refused to speak about sexual assaults during captivity until now . Miss Kampusch has frequently been accused of not taking opportunities to escape from Priklopil. The bungled police investigation to find her after her disappearance is still being probed by German and Austrian investigators. Miss Kampusch said that although she went shopping with Priklopil, and once on a ski holiday, there was no opportunity for escape. She said: 'There were years of pressure on me. It was like an internal prison which made it impossible to flee. That was pure fear. 'He said he would stab anyone who tried to help me.' John Egan, a child kidnap victim, and a German journalist who was tortured in Iran joined the discussion after 45 minutes. All three concurred that it was important to maintain contact with their tormentor and to remain, after freedom, in the role of the victim. But she said that her 'martyrdom' is often challenged in Austria because people don't believe her side of the story. Some politicians and lawmen believe Priklopil had an accomplice and that Miss Kampusch has not told the whole truth about what went on during the years she spent with him. 'For me, this is very hard to bear, because I am almost pushed to the point of living abroad - or to kill myself,' she said.","Gave German television interview yesterday on her 25th birthday .

He's made on average 8.4 changes for each European tie; last season they made 6.4. Harry Kane marked his return to the Spurs side with a hat-trick at White Hart Lane . The Argentine boss has made 42 changes in their five European games so far this term, but he hasn't necessarily picked weaker teams.

Well, Mauricio, points make prizes, and Spurs haven't had this bad a start since Juande Ramos was sacked in 2008. Mauricio Pochettino insists he's not concerned by Tottenham's poor start to the season . Bizarrely, Asteras had seven Argentinians in Thursday night's squad, all in that perfect age of 24 to 29.

"Women, highly educated, divorced and rich people are more likely to die from assisted suicide, new research has revealed. Researchers in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is legal, found that of people helped by right-to-die organisations such as Dignitas, around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause. They say this indicates that an increasing number of people may simply becoming 'weary of life'. Of people helped by right-to-die organisations in Switzerland, such as Dignitas (pictured), around 16 per cent of death certificates did not register an underlying cause. - suggesting they were 'weary of life' The research, published online in the International Journal of Epidemiology – . that shows assisted suicide is more common in women, the divorced, those . living alone, the more educated, those with no religious affiliation, . and those from wealthier areas. A . previous study of suicides by two right-to-die organizations showed that . 25 per cent of those assisted had no fatal illness, instead citing 'weariness . of life' as a factor. In this study, researchers from the University of Bern looked at anonymous data on 1,301 cases . of assisted suicide between 2003 and 2008, provided by three . right-to-die organisations. In 84 per cent of cases, the death . certificates listed at least one underlying cause of death. In the age . group, 25-64 years the majority had cancer (57 per cent), followed by diseases . of the nervous system (21 per cent). Eleven people had a mood disorder . listed as the first underlying cause, and three had another mental or . behavioural disorder. Religious affiliation appeared to influence whether a person opted for assisted suicide. Religion was another key factor. People of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than Roman Catholics. (Pope Francis is pictured) For all causes, except Parkinson's disease, the . percentage of assisted suicides was higher in women than men. In the . 65-94 years age group, cancer was again the most common underlying cause . (41 per cent), followed by circulatory (15 per cent) and diseases of the nervous system . (11 per cent). Thirty people had a mood disorder, and six had another mental or . behavioural disorder. The rate was also higher in urban . compared to rural areas, in wealthier neighbourhoods, and in the French . rather than German or Italian speaking areas of the country. Younger people who had children were less likely to opt for assisted suicide in younger . people, but not older people. Religion was another key factor.  People of no faith were six times more likely to choose assisted suicide than Roman Catholics, The Times reported. Divorcees and people who live alone are also 50 per cent more likely to choose assisted suicide, researchers found . Those living alone or divorced were 50 per cent more likely to choose it. Lead researcher Professor Matthias Egger said: 'The higher rates among the better educated and those living in . neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic standing does not support the . 'slippery slope' argument but might reflect inequities in access to . assisted suicide. On the other hand, we found a higher rate among people . living alone and the divorced. Social isolation and loneliness are well . known risk factors for non-assisted suicides and our results suggest . that they may also play a role in assisted suicide. 'Also, the . observation that women die more frequently by assisted suicide than men . is potentially of concern. Interestingly, though, studies from the . Netherlands and Oregon in the USA reported more men than women among . assisted deaths.' Last year, the European Court of Human Rights asked . Switzerland to clarify whether and under what conditions individuals not . suffering from terminal illnesses should have access to help in ending . their lives, suggesting that Switzerland should more precisely regulate . assisted dying. While euthanasia is prohibited in Switzerland, the penal code states . that assisted suicide is legal if no selfish interests are involved. Assisted . suicides in Switzerland involve volunteers working for 'right-to-die' associations. The role of physicians is restricted to assessing the . decisional capacity of the person requesting assistance and to . prescribing the lethal drug. Notably, the person requesting assistance . does not need to have a terminal illness. Dr Egger added that future deaths in right-to-die clinics must be registered so that suicide trends must be monitored.","Of people helped by right-to-die .

"The cost of renovating the Olympic Stadium ahead of West Ham’s 2016 move will rise by £35.9million but the extra funding will not be paid for by either the Hammers or the taxpayer. The iconic venue in Stratford is due to host five matches at next year’s Rugby World Cup before becoming West Ham’s permanent home for the 2016/17 season. The original stadium cost £429m to build and a fixed conversion fee of a further £154m was agreed with constructor Balfour Beatty. Unforeseen circumstances have seen costs of renovating the Olympic Stadium rise by £35.9million . But West Ham, the stadium's future tenants, will not have to contribute towards the increased cost . The problem involves extending and strengthening the roof of the stadium used for the 2012 Olympics . That figure, however, has now risen by £35.9m to £189.9m due to the complexity of extending and strengthening the roof, but neither West Ham nor the taxpayer will be covering the added cost. 'Providing adequate support for the new roof has required significantly more strengthening work to the main roof truss, which was originally designed to be taken down after the Games,' a statement on queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk read. 'We have therefore today agreed to increase the value of the Balfour Beatty contract by £35.9m to £189.9m. 'We will meet these costs from the project contingencies and additional income we will generate from our other developments. 'There will therefore be no additional call on the taxpayer and no impact on our current programme.' The taxpayer will not be forced to shell out for the additional cost, it comes from project contingencies . 'Additional income from other developments' will also help to fund the increased costs of the build . Measuring approximately 45,000 square metres and 84m at its deepest point, the new roof will be the longest cantilevered roof in the world, with construction experts consulting similar technology to that used on North Sea oil rigs. Despite the total bill for the stadium now amounting to £618.9m, West Ham will contribute only £15m for a 99-year lease together with annual rent and a share of income as was agreed last year with the London Legacy Development Corporation, chaired by London mayor Boris Johnson. The renovated venue will have 50,000 seats and will also serve as the national competition stadium for athletics in the UK, hosting regional and international events. West Ham will leave their Upton Park home to move across East London into the new 50,000-seater venue .","Stratford's Olympic Stadium will cost more to renovate than first thought .

A Dubai court was told that the threat was made by the 40-year-old, named only as A M, amid several outbursts of verbal abuse directed at cabin staff and unseemly behaviour that included throwing food at other passengers . B S also alleges that A M pulled on her shirt so hard that she felt pain, then told her that she was a 'sex slave'. The court then heard that he threatened to slap her, kill her and chop her up. Another attendant E M, 26, from Egypt, told the trial: 'I was ordered to attend to the problem and, when I did, I saw him jumping on his seat and pulling B S from her shirt, then insulting her with very bad words.' A M allegedly then set the plane's fire alarms off by smoking a cigarette in the toilet, which caused considerable worry among passengers. When he was told that he would be met by police once the plane had landed he responded with verbal aggression then fell asleep, the trial heard.

"More people than ever are having to work on Christmas Day, according to a new study. Gone are the days when every shop was shut and the parish church was jammed with worshippers, as more staff are asked to forego their festive break. The Trade Union Congress revealed almost 172,000 workers were on duty on December 25 in 2010, a figure that has risen 78 per cent in the last eight years. Serving holiday cheer: A majority of people working on Christmas day are in service orientated industries, such as hospitality . The numbers of those working over Christmas in 2004 was 96,000 and in 1998 was 72,000. The most recent figures show equal numbers of men and women going to work on Christmas Day. Those in the NHS and social care made up the biggest group, 74,500, of those working in 2010, while 14,000 hospitality and catering staff and 13,800 retail, wholesale and motoring workers gave up their break. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber called for employers to make sure their staff are properly recompensed for sacrificing Christmas. He said: ‘There has been a significant increase in the number of people working on Christmas Day in recent years, reflecting the changing nature of the way we live our lives. Not alone: Santa and Rudolph are not the only ones to work on Christmas Day . ‘Unions have worked hard to make sure that the UK’s Christmas Day employees get premium rates, earning double or even triple their normal pay. ‘We should all spare a thought for the people next Tuesday who will be hard at work while we’re opening our presents, messing about with our new gadgets, tucking into our turkey dinners, sipping a glass of sherry and relaxing with our families. ‘But whether it be the emergency services, those in the health service, call centre workers, people working in petrol stations or in hotels and restaurants, let’s remember all those whose work helps keep the country ticking over while the rest of us are enjoying ourselves.’","A majority of Christmas workers are in service orientated industries such as hospitality .

"Sergeant Blackman is said to have been devastated by the death of his wheelchair-bound father shortly before the tour of Afghanistan that was to end in shame. Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease and died in January 2011. A friend said it had a huge impact on his son, who tragically had been caught in traffic and unable make it to his father’s bedside to be with him as he died. It was against this emotional backdrop of regret and grief that the commando deployed to Afghanistan. Those close to him believe this played a part in the ‘moment of madness’ that ended in the execution of a Taliban fighter – and murder conviction more than two years later. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Alexander Blackman with his wheelchair-bound father Brian who died shortly before his tour of duty . Footage: The incident in which Blackman killed a Taliban militant was caught on camera by another Marine . Ironically, Blackman was a model soldier, a war hero with an exceptional record who had served in a number of conflicts. He proved his courage on six gruelling tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. And in 2001 he was part of the hunt for Bin Laden. He was among Marines flown in to help Special Forces as they fought Al Qaeda gunmen in Bora Bora. Blackman’s closest brush with death came on his tour to Iraq, when he miraculously survived being hit by a grenade during the assault on Basra. Identified: Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been revealed as the Royal Marine who was last month convicted a murdering an Afghan insurgent . Fighting had been intense, with an . officer describing the area as a scene from Dante’s Inferno. While . leading the assault on Basra, Iraq’s second city in a military vehicle, . his rucksack containing ammunition, water and rations was hit by the . warhead of a rocket propelled grenade in an ambush on his vehicle. Marines dived for cover as bullets and RPGs raining down on them, and one rocket smashed into his kit bag diverting it just past his head while bullets burst around them. After the attack, his fellow commandos could not believe that Blackman had not been killed. Despite the difficult campaign – which saw Marines locked in some of the fiercest fighting experienced by British forces – his combat report is said to have been ‘exemplary’ and he was recommended for promotion. His family in Brighton – his father, a former porter and lorry driver, his mother Frances, 74, a former hairdresser, brother and two sisters knew his love of the Marines and the lifestyle they offered. Blackman, a keen cyclist, runner and golfer, excelled while studying sports and physical education at Lewes Tertiary College in East Sussex. He had ambitions of representing Great Britain at canoeing until, aged 17, he was knocked down by a car while cycling. Desperate to challenge himself, he enlisted in the Royal Marines in 1998, passing the arduous tests with flying colours. Tours of Northern Ireland were followed by training in the US and Oman, and in November 2007 he deployed to southern Afghanistan. After returning from that tour he married Claire Warner, 38, an assistant director of operations with the National Trust in Somerset and Gloucestershire, and they settled in Taunton. Incident: The footage filmed by Marine B's helmet camera formed part of the court martial hearing . Revealed: Footage of the incident with Blackman's face uncensored has just been released for the first time . Highly regarded by senior officers, . Blackman had joined 42 Commando and J [Juliet] Company, known for its . discipline, fortitude and bravery – and members were tested to the full . during their six-month spring tour in spring 2011. He had previously seen some action in Afghanistan during the quieter winter months. But this deployment – later named the ‘Tour from hell’ by his colleagues – them attacked almost daily. Despite this hostility, the imposing 6ft 3in Blackman was credited with fostering ‘hearts and minds’ of the local population and helping oversee projects such as the building of a school. But the gruelling impact of losing friends and colleagues was to take its toll. During the proceedings leading up to his conviction for murder, Blackman said around 20 of his friends had been killed or maimed during the tour, including a popular young officer and a marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. Film: The Marine could be heard quoting Shakespeare as he shot the Taliban prisoner . Trauma: Friends of Blackman have blamed the incident on the horrors he experienced while on duty . He said other comrades had suffered ‘life-changing’ injuries and described the effect the deaths had on commandos after the body parts of friends were hung in trees by insurgents. ‘It’s not a nice thing for the lads,’ he said. ‘Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ The Marines returned home as heroes, with Blackman earmarked for promotion to Colour Sergeant. It would have remained that way had a commando not been arrested by civilian police more than a year later and chilling head camera footage of the Helmand execution discovered on his laptop.","Brian Blackman, 73, was suffering from Parkinson’s disease .

"Sam Allardyce insists he is not bothered that he is yet to be offered a new contract by West Ham, despite his current deal running out at the end of the season. West Ham have had their best start to the Barclays Premier League since Allardyce brought them back up two years ago and are fourth in the table.

Despite all he has suffered, Leon still has a . positive outlook on life. His state of mind is remarkable considering . how much his life has changed.’ Mr Adams was attacked on his way home from the pub where he worked in Cardiff city centre.

"Murderer: Marc Dutroux, seen being escorted by police officers at Brussels' Palace of Justice, is seeking early release from prison (pictured in court on February 4) Serial paedophile child killer Marc Dutroux has been denied early release from prison amid fears he will re-offend. A Belgian court today turned down a request by the 56-year-old to serve out the rest of his life sentence at home under electronic surveillance. It came after Dutroux's mother warned that her son will kill again if a court grants his appeal for early release from prison. The court then said there were 'no grounds' for an early release, citing the 'absence of any prospect that Dutroux' could be reintegrated into society. Jeannine Dutroux, 78, described her son as a 'repeat offender in his soul' and begged judges to keep him behind bars. The 56-year-old psychopath was arrested in 1996 and jailed for life in June 2004 for the kidnap, rape and torture of six young girls in the mid-1990s, four of whom died. But he has now applied for early . release under Belgian laws which state prisoners can be freed after . serving 15 years of a life sentence if they are no longer a risk. But . his mother Jeannine has told Belgium's Le Soir newspaper: 'I am certain . he will start again. Marc isn't ready to be released because he still . wants to attribute to others the responsibility for what he did. 'This is a repeat offender in his soul, as he has already proved throughout his life.' Dutroux . insists he is no longer a danger to the public and it is his 'human . right' to live at home wearing an electronic bracelet. Judges . will consider his application in private at Belgium's sentencing court . in the capital Brussels at 2pm today - two months before he becomes . eligible for release in April. The . demand comes after Dutroux's hated ex-wife Michelle Martin was freed . from prison earlier this year to spend the next ten years 'at prayer' in . a convent. Martin, 52, had . served 16 years of 30-year jail term for complicty in the imprisonment . and murder of her husband's young victims.

Jailed and freed: Dutroux was jailed for life in 2004, left, for the kidnap, rape and torture of six young girls in the mid-1990s, four of whom died. His ex-wife Michelle Martin, right, was freed . from prison earlier this year after serving 16 years of a 30-year term for complicity in his crimes . Dutroux's bid for freedom is opposed . by Belgian prosecutors, the victims' families and the governor of the . high security Nivelles prison, where the killer is currently held in . solitary confinement. Belgium's . Sudpresse newspaper said: 'According to the law, the sentencing court . must take into account the views of the prosecutors, the prison and the . victims' families. 'But it is not bound to follow their pleas to keep him locked up and can free him if it deems fit. Abducted: Laetitia Delhez, left, was was found alive two days after going missing in 1996, aged 14, along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, then 12, right, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle . 'In that case, he would be freed to be electronically tagged and live at home under house arrest.' The Dutroux affair erupted in August 1996, when police arrested the unemployed electrician following the abduction of 14-year-old girl Laetitia Delhez. She was found alive two days later along with severely emaciated Sabine Dardenne, 12, in the basement of his house the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle. In August, 1998, the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo were found buried in the garden of Dutroux's other home in the southern town of Sars La Buissiere. Murdered: In August, 1998, the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune, left, and Melissa Russo, right, were found buried in the garden of Dutroux's second home in the southern Belgian town of Sars La Buissiere . A month later, the bodies of Ann Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks were found in another property owned by Dutroux. Public anger increased when came to light that police had missed a string of clues that could have led to Dutroux being apprehended earlier. It also emerged that he had been released from jail in 1992 after serving just three years of a 13-year sentence for the abduction and rape of five girls. Chilling: A policeman walks down some steps in the house where Dutroux held some of his victims captive in an underground 'cell', right . Terror: Dutroux tied his young victims to a bed on the underground dungeon in which he held them beneath his home in the Charleroi suburb of Marcinelle . Nationwide fury boiled over and more than 300,000 people took to the streets of Brussels in October 1996 in a series of marches to protest at judicial incompetence. Jean-Denis Lejeune, the father of victim Julie Lejeune, spoke of his 'outrage' at the release of Michelle Martin this year. But he has now said on his Facebook page that he 'will not react' to the possible release of Dutroux. He wrote: 'I have definitively turned the page on the whole Dutroux affair and I will not be reacting any further on this subject. 'I want instead to convert this energy into a positive force to use for the good of others, for political projects in Belgium and humanitarian work abroad.'","Marc Dutroux jailed for life in 2004 for kidnap, rape, torture of six girls .

"He's a father-of-four with plenty of experience as well as a friend of Prince William's, and now David Beckham stepped in with some advice for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they await the birth of their second child. But far from top tips on how to juggle changing two sets of nappies, Beckham's advice was simple ant to the point - get more sleep before the baby arrives. 'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step,' said Beckham during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine, who then confessed that going from two to three was an even bigger leap. Scroll down for video . Daddy cool: Beckham, who is a father of four, offered the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge some advice . Friends: Beckham has known Prince William for several years and is in the running to be godfather . The Duchess, who is currently suffering from acute morning sickness, is thought to want three children by the age of 35. Beckham's words of support came as Kensington Palace announced that the Duchess will not be attending tonight's Invictus Games opening ceremony and that her trip to Malta next week is 'under review'. Kate, who suffered from the same extreme morning sickness during her last pregnancy, is expected to give birth in the Spring. Beckham, who has known the Duke of Cambridge for a number of years and was a guest at the Royal Wedding in 2011, is also in the running to be a godparent for the couple's second child. According to bookmakers William Hill, Beckham boasts odds of 16 to one to become a godparent - as does his wife Victoria. Other favourites include Prince Harry, Pippa Middleton, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall. Long shots include David Cameron and Boris Johnson at 66/1. 'It . surely has to be a case of second time lucky for Harry and Pippa,' commented spokesman Joe Crilly, 'but . William has a real bromance with Becks who could well be asked to . undertake god-parenting duties this time around.' Godfather or not, Beckham also revealed that he was left delighted by the royal baby news and said that the couple are 'great parents'. 'I’m so happy for them both because they’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible,' he said. 'I’m just happy that they’re going to have another little one running around the house.' Second child: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that a second baby was on the way on Monday . Missing out: The Duchess will miss the Invictus Games, a passion project of brother-in-law Prince Harry . Thanks to her pregnancy, the Duchess will also miss a Drumhead service at Lee Valley Athletics Centre with the Duke and Prince Harry tomorrow, to remember all those who have died or been injured in conflict. Currently being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace, she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies, causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is thought her illness began sometime last week and when William visited Oxford University on Monday without his wife to open the institution’s new China Centre, he said the Duchess had experienced a 'tricky few days'. The condition has also thrown her first solo overseas tour into doubt, with the Duchess due to be in Malta on the 20th and 21st September to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence.

"A puppy so small it has be fed with a pipette is believed to Britain's tiniest pooch. Tyson the chihuahua-cross was rejected by his siblings at birth after being too small to suckle on its mother. After being thrown out of the litter-of-five, the animal was examined by vets who believe he could be the nation's smallest dog. Scroll down for video . Tyson the puppy weighs just 11 ounces and is only 4in tall. The dog is thought to be the smallest in Britain . The chihuahua cross was rejected from his litter-of-five at birth because he was too small to suckle . His owner, Rosemarie McLinden from Keal Cotes, Lincolnshire, carries Tyson around in a hamster cage. The 46-year-old has had to make special arrangements to make sure the tiny animal isn't lost in the mix of her other pets. 'He was tiny when he was born and he was eventually pushed out by his brothers and sisters because he was so tiny.' 'He just hasn't really grown since. 'I had to start feeding him myself as he couldn't latch on to his mother. He was so small he just could not breastfeed due to the tiny size of his mouth. 'I bought a little dropper and had to feed him day and night every two hours until he was a little bigger. 'We had to take him away from the rest of the litter because he is so small they think of him as a squeaky toy. 'I’ve been doing a lot of research and I can’t see a smaller dog anywhere in the entire country.' Mrs McLinden has built a special crate for the dog to sleep in, but cannot find a collar small enough for his little neck. Speaking of the other dogs in his litter of Chihuahua Lhasa Apso crosses, the mother-of-four said: 'They are all so boisterous, but he is just too small to be boisterous, he’s just an energetic loving pup.

'He has one ball that he likes to chase, we found a practice golf ball that he can use, but even that is bigger than his head. 'We’ve just started trying to wean him onto dog food, and we have to rub around his little gums to help him eat. 'He seems do be doing well though and we hope he stays fit and healthy.' Tyson joins a menagerie of animals at the family home which already has two kittens, a bearded dragon, sheep, horses, chickens and a hedgehog. Vet Sharon Crocket, of Pilgrim Veterinary Surgery, in Boston, Lincolnshire, where Tyson has been treated, said: 'He could possibly be the smallest dog in the UK.

An ambulance transporting Ebola virus-infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol leaves Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia with a police escort on Tuesday afternoon . Dr Brantly was pictured on Saturday being helped out of a special ambulance in a hazmat suit and walking into the hospital. Mrs Writebol was strapped into the stretcher today and covered from head-to-toe as she was wheeled to the hospital entrance. Both medics who wheeled Mrs Writebol's stretcher into the hospital were wearing protective suits along with the ambulance driver. American medical teams were taking no chances with the disease which has no known cure and is fatal in 90 per cent of patients. The ambulance traveled from Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta in a convoy with four police SUVs, according to AJC.com. Emory University Hospital said in a statement today that it will not hold a press conference and instead focus on Mrs Writebol's care. Mrs Writebol's plane made a brief stop at Bangor International Airport in Maine at 8am on Tuesday for refueling.

She is only the second-ever known patient with Ebola on American soil . A Grady Hospital medical vehicle follows behind an ambulance transporting Ebola virus-infected American aid worker Nancy Writebol leaves Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia . The two Americans infected with Ebola are receiving an experimental drug so novel that it has never been tested for safety in humans. The experimental treatment is made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical of San Diego, with funding from the government. The treatment is aimed at boosting the immune system’s efforts to fight off the virus. It is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the Ebola virus. It’s unclear whether the experimental treatment played in recent improvement in the aid workers’ medical conditions. Mrs Writebol is reportedly in a stable condition after receiving a second dose of the drug. Ebola has killed at least 887 people in four West African countries in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Mrs Writebol showed some improvement over the weekend. She can walk with assistance and asked for Liberian potato soup - her favorite meal, family and friends said. A private plane arrives at Dobbins Air Reserve Base on Tuesday transporting a second American missionary, Nancy Writebol, who was stricken with Ebola while working in Liberia . Second U.S. Ebola victim Nancy Writebol's chartered plane touches down in Atlanta, Georgia shortly before midday on Tuesday . However, her case remains grave. She is in serious condition with a disease that has no known cure and proves fatal for up to 90 per cent of patients. Jeremy Writebol believes his mother can yield a greater good from her impending return to the United States amid West Africa's worst-ever outbreak of the virus. The attention focused on her case 'might help develop a cure and resources to help those who are suffering,' Mr Writebol said. 'I am sure hopeful for that.' Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol contracted Ebola after working on the same medical mission team treating victims of the virus around Monrovia, Liberia. More than 1,300 people have been stricken, killing at least 729 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Dr Brantly, seen here with his wife Amber, is improving at Emory University Hospital after receiving a dose of an experimental serum . Nancy Writebol and her husband David were being sponsored to work in Africa by their church in Charlotte, North Carolina when she contracted the deadly virus . Ebola has no vaccine or antidote. Both Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were given an experimental treatment last week, according to international relief group Samaritan's Purse. The group originally said that only Mrs Writebol had received the treatment. However Dr Brantly also received a unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who had been under his care, according to the organization. Emory, where Brantly already is quarantined, boasts one of the nation's most sophisticated infectious disease units. Patients are sealed off from anyone not in protective gear. Lab tests are conducted inside the unit, ensuring that viruses don't leave the quarantined area. Family members see and communicate with patients through barriers. Mrs Writebol and her husband, David, had been in Liberia since August 2013, sent there by the Christian organization SIM USA and sponsored by their home congregation at Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the hospital where Dr Brantly treated patients, Nancy Writebol worked as a hygienist whose role included decontaminating those entering or leaving the Ebola treatment area. Their pastor, the Reverend John Munro, said David Writebol fulfilled administrative and technical duties. A few weeks before she was diagnosed, Jeremy Writebol said, a doctor visited the Monrovia hospital where she worked and praised the decontamination procedures as the best he'd seen. Jeremy Writebol said she was 'really pleased by knowing that' and never thought she would be infected, despite her proximity to the virus. David and Nancy Writebol have engaged in foreign missions for 15 years, spending five years in Ecuador and nine years in Zambia, where Munro said they worked in a home for widows and orphans. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention, also in Atlanta, say they've been criticized for bringing Ebola cases to an American hospital. But Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director, emphasized again on Sunday that there is no threat to the public in the United States. Some airlines that serve those nations have suspended flights, while international groups, including the Peace Corps, have evacuated some or all representatives in the region. But the Writebols, their pastor predicted, won't be away from the stricken land for any longer than they have to be. 'They knew that Liberia was a tough assignment,' he said, comparing their vocation to the Bible's stories of leper colonies. 'Followers of Christ went into those colonies, knowing they would die,' Munro said. 'I certainly wouldn't judge them if they didn't go back, but I don't think this will deter them.","American Ebola patient Nancy Writebol, 59, was wheeled into Emory University Hospital at 1pm on Tuesday by medics wearing hazmat suits .

"The newly-married Duchess opted to wear eye-catching £1,900 18ct gold drop earrings . While the Duchess of Cambridge's regal plum outfit bagged all the headlines in today's papers, it was a more understated element of her gorgeous outfit that has added extra sparkle. For Kate was wearing a stunning pair of diamond and citrine earrings as she attended church at Sandringham for the first time yesterday. Along with her made-to-measure Jane Corbett hat, the newlywed also wore an eye-catching pair of 18ct gold drop earrings. Made by Chelsea-based Kiki McDonough, famed for her use of vibrant semi-precious stones in daring colour combinations, the 18ct gold drop earrings are worth a cool £1,900. And the favourite theory among royal watchers and gossips is that they were a Christmas present from her husband, Prince William. Kate is a fan of the brand and has been spotted at various royal outings wearing the bold designs. Pieces worn this year include a small silver, diamond-studded cross on a chain with matching diamond earrings and a pair of 18 carat gold Citrine Drop earrings valued at £495 to the Epsom Derby. Intriguingly, Kiki's designs were once worn by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as the likes of actresses Rosamond Pike and Emilia Fox. Kiki who's been designing pieces of jewellry for around for 25 years, told Vogue: 'It is wonderful to see such a stylish young person wearing my designs. 'As a 'modern Royal', Catherine is as chic when dressed down as she is at formal engagements - my jewellery is designed to be worn every day, and Catherine does this beautifully.' She added: 'I once counted  Princess Diana as one of my most loyal customers and we always had such fun choosing designs for her to wear - she took great pleasure in wearing my jewellery. 'It is a very special added extra that Catherine now enjoys wearing my designs too.' All eyes were on the Duchess, who will turn 30 in January, as she attended a community service with her husband, Prince William on Christmas morning. She teamed a simple knee-length frock coat with black platforms which The Mail learnt were specially commissioned for the occasion. The vertiginous £169 black suede heels were by Spanish designer Mascaro, which also produces the Pretty Ballerina range of pumps favoured by the Duchess.. A spokesperson for family run firm, founded in Menorca, said: ‘They were a special request from her office. I think either the Duchess or somebody she knows previously had this style and they wanted a repeat of it in her size. 'They cost £169 and she paid full price as we have been informed that she cannot accept gifts.’ The shoes had been from a previous season but now the company will reproduce the design now they have received the royal seal of approval – showing once again the Duchess’s newfound fashion power. .But the real head turner was a hat by milliner Jane Corbett, who regularly creates pieces for the Middleton family. The pair of diamond drop earrings were on display as she wore her hair in a half up, half down creation. Other members of the royal family who . attended the private service included the Queen, the Countess of Wessex, . Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and the Duke of . Cambridge. Kate has also been spotted wearing a small silver, diamond-studded cross on a chain with matching diamond earrings by Chelsea-based designer Kiki McDonough . Kate's presence helped attract a record 3,000 well-wishers to St Mary Magdalene church on the Norfolk estate and police were on hand to manage crowds. The Queen opted for a lavender wool boucle coat by her dressmaker Karl Ludwig, upon which she had pinned a diamond shell brooch with a pearl at the centre, with a matching white and ivory hat by Angela Kelly. She accepted dozens of bouquets helped by three of her grandchildren, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and the Wessexes’ daughter Lady Louise Windsor.

Sisters Beatrice and Eugenie, who accompanied their father Prince Andrew, both selected smart double breasted pea coats in shades of black and grey accessorised with matching berets. Many were eager to hear about Prince Philip's health after the 90-year-old was admitted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge last Friday after suffering chest pains.

"When it was revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had asked for not one but two kitchens to be installed at their Kensington Palace apartment, questions were asked about why the couple needed so much extra space.

The new royal baby will take its place in the royal nursery alongside Prince George and will have two to choose from: At Kensington Palace and at the couple's country retreat, Anmer Hall in Norfolk. Currently decorated with characters from the Beatrix Potter books, the Duchess of Cambridge chose fittings from luxury children's furniture emporium, Dragons of Knightsbridge, where moses baskets start at £75. Overseeing the nursery and both of its royal occupants will be Norland-trained nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, who accompanied the one-year-old prince on his first royal tour to New Zealand and Australia. New home: Along with Prince George and his or her parents, the baby will live at Anmer Hall in Norfolk . In charge: Norland-trained nanny Maria Theresa Turrion Borallo will also be in charge of the new royal arrival . THE RELATIVES . As with Prince George, the Middletons are likely to play a big part in the new arrival's life with Carole and Pippa expected to take a particularly active role. Indeed, so close is the Duchess of Cambridge to her mother, she and baby George decamped to their Bucklebury home within a day of his birth. Since then, Carole in particular has been a constant presence in his life, even helping to plan his Peter Rabbit themed first birthday party. But the new baby's other set of grandparents will also have a prominent role, with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall known to dote on their grandson. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will also spend plenty of time with the new arrival as, of course, will Prince Harry and the baby's Middleton aunt and uncle, Pippa and James. Grandparents: The Middletons are close to Prince George and will spend plenty of time with the new baby . Royal relations: Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are said to dote on their grandson, Prince George . THE WARDROBE . Although just a year old, Prince George has long made headlines for his wardrobe - and his ability to sell out everything that he wears. The new royal arrival will be no exception and like his or her big brother, will boast a wardrobe packed with gorgeous designer buys as well as one or two thrifty purchases. When Prince George made his first appearance outside the Lindo Wing, it was in a white receiving blanket, which will almost certainly be reused for the new arrival. Costing £44.95 and made by Aden + Anais, a US label run by an Australian, more than 7000 Jungle Jam swaddling wraps were sold in the first nine days of George's life, while traffic to the brand's website shot up by 1,960 per cent. Other brands to benefit from the George effect - and are likely to do the same courtesy of the new royal baby - include Petit Bateau, Rachel Riley and Les Petit Abeilles. Second outing: The baby is likely to make its debut in a receiving blanket like George's Aden + Anais number . Stylish: Prince George spends much of his time in outfits by Petit Bateau, Rachel Riley and Les Petites Abeilles . THE GODPARENTS . Close family friends dominated when it came to choosing the seven godparents for Prince George, although William and Harry's favourite cousin Zara Phillips also made the cut. The Cambridge's second child is likely to have a similar set of godparents with friends such as Hugh van Cutsem likely to make the cut second time around. Hugh's wife Rose is also a potential godparent, as are Prince Harry and Mike Tindall, whose company both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoy. Other possible godparents include Olivia Bleasdale, Prince William's flatmate at St Andrew's University, and David Jardine-Paterson, the banking heir married to Kate's best friend Emilia D'Erlanger. Also in the running are members of Europe's royal dynasties, among them Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark who is a distant relative of the Duke of Edinburgh, and Spain's new queen, Letizia. Future godparents? The couple are close to Hugh and Rose van Cutsem whose daughter was their bridesmaid . Royal godparent: Distant relation Crown Prince Frederik and glamorous Queen Letizia are possibilities . It's the question that will keep us on the edge of our seats until March: what will the Duke of Cambridge's second child look like? According to software programmer Charanjeet Kondal, the new arrival will have wispy blonde hair, deep brown eyes and a small nose. The software expert, who repeated the trick two years ago when the imminent arrival of Prince George was announced, has so far proved a dab hand at predicting the looks of royal offspring. His Morph Thing application merges photos of the parents and produces an image of what the new child will look like between the ages of two and four. The face of a future prince or princess?

"Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his poor form, according to club legend Ian Rush. The Italian forward has scored just one goal since his £16million summer move from AC Milan, and some supporters have begun to question his worth to the side. But Liverpool's record scorer insisted the 24-year-old has a role to play at the club. Mario Balotelli still has a future at Liverpool despite his slow start at the club, according to legend Ian Rush . 'He still has a future at Liverpool,' Rush told talkSPORT. 'The fans are some of the most patient, but he has to realise he's playing at Liverpool Football Club, not just any other club. 'He's got to show his commitment to the club by proving it on the pitch. 'He's only 24 and he's got to learn he's at ,for me, the best club in the world.

The former Manchester City forward was off the pace against Real Madrid and was substituted at half-time . 'We're most probably quite predictable in the way we play.' The former Manchester City man was also criticised for swapping shirts with Pepe at half time, an action Rush did not condone. He said: 'The Liverpool fans are very knowledgeable, and you just don't do that (swap shirts at half time). 'I'm sure Brendan Rodgers will have a word with him behind closed doors.' Balotelli was also criticised for swapping shirts with Real Madrid's Portuguese defender Pepe at half time . Michael Owen, meanwhile, felt Balotelli's performance against Madrid highlighted just how much the club missed the injured Daniel Sturridge. He tweeted: 'Just highlights how unbelievably good Suarez was and how much Daniel Sturridge is missed. 'I thought Brendan Rodgers spoke well in his post match interview. Doesn't seem happy with Balotelli. Signing him was always a risk.

"Vladimir Putin yesterday mocked the West's sanctions against Russia - as eastern Europe began boosting its defences amid fears of further Kremlin land grabs. Putin dismissively brushed aside concerns raised by Washington, Brussels and London and inked Crimea's switch to rule by Moscow in defiance of international objections. He also laughed off punishments imposed by the U.S. and EU on his closest friends and their banks. Putin opened an account in blacklisted St Petersburg-based Rossiya Bank, which was singled out for sanctions by America, and ordered that his monthly £4,500 salary be paid into the bank. 'I have ordered the administrative department to transfer my salary there,' he said. Scroll down for video . Vladamir Putin today said he would be transferring his salary to Russian Bank Rossiya Bank - despite the fact that the U.S. has said that it plans to sanction the organisation . The leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined him. 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it,' he said. And Putin joked in abusive slang that a gaggle of oligarchs including Yuriy Kovalchuk and Gennadiy Timchenko - seen by the U.S. as his 'cronies' and subjected to sanctions in support of Kiev - are 'typical moskali', bearing Ukrainian names. But the Ukrainian premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday said he was signing an EU association deal - the first step to membership - to protect his country from 'armed gangster' Putin. He insisted 'Russia has undermined the global security system. 'Russia has started to behave like an armed gangster in Europe, therefore we should find an adequate answer to stop an international crime because this is an international crime.' In slashing a gas subsidy to Ukraine, he was using 'energy as a new nuclear weapon,' he said. Poland responded by announcing that it will speed up the £3 billion purchase of a missile defence system, with Interior Minister Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz calling the turmoil in neighbouring Ukraine the 'biggest crisis' since escaping the Soviet noose 25 years ago. President of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov (right) also transferred his money to the sactioned bank. He said: 'The decision to introduce sanctions against the bank indicates that it is reliable, since the U.S. does not like it' France yesterday offered to send four fighter jets to the Baltic states and to ensure twice weekly AWACS patrols.

"The International Olympic Committee is to seek an explanation from Russian member Shamil Tarpischev for his derogatory comments about Serena and Venus Williams. Tarpischev, who is president of the Russian Tennis Federation and captain of their Davis and Fed Cup teams, has been widely condemned for calling Serena and Venus 'the Williams brothers' on a Russian TV chat show, with Serena describing his comments as 'sexist, racist and bullying' on Sunday. The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) reacted swiftly, fining Tarpischev the maximum of 25,000 US dollars and banning him from any involvement with the WTA for a year.

Tarpischev, 66, has been a member of the IOC since 1994. Speaking at a press conference ahead of the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore, world number one Williams said: 'I thought (the comments) were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time. I thought they were in a way bullying. 'The WTA and the USTA (United States Tennis Association) did a wonderful job of making sure that - in this day and age, 2014 - for someone with his power, it's really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks.' Tarpischev was also criticised by Russia's highest-profile player, Maria Sharapova. The French Open champion said: 'I think (the comments) were very disrespectful and uncalled for, and I'm glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA.

"Danny Cipriani's omission from Stuart Lancaster’s England squad was criticised by the man who brought the fly-half out of the wilderness. Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond, who signed Cipriani from Melbourne Rebels almost three years ago, described the selection of Northampton’s Stephen Myler as third-choice No 10 behind Owen Farrell and George Ford as ‘conservative’ and claimed the 26-year-old is judged by different standards to other players. ‘It does seem that he’s always got to go the extra mile,’ said Diamond. ‘Danny seems to have to prove himself far and above the other players. He’s done his rehabilitation, if that’s what you want to call it, and he’s outstanding week in week out for us. I think the England coaches have been a little bit conservative.’ Danny Cipriani has been left out of Stuart Lancaster's England squad for the autumn internationals . Sale coach Steve Diamond believes it is unfair that Cipriani has not been selected for England . Cipriani has been one of England's leading No 10s this season but has been overlooked by Lancaster . Asked if he thought Cipriani would have been picked if he played for Northampton, Diamond simply replied ‘Yes’. Saracens wing Chris Ashton and Leicester fly-half Freddie Burns were the other key absentees from Lancaster’s 33-man party for the QBE Series. But Lancaster said of his choice: ‘We have criteria for every position. We measure and mark every player. It doesn’t matter if you’re with a team that’s first or eighth in the table. ‘What Steve (Myler) has shown is a very good consistent level of application, irrespective of whether he is on the front or back foot. The message Danny and Freddie have both received is that everything is important.’ Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), D Wilson (Bath), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), D Attwood (Bath), G Kruis (Saracens), J Launchbury (Wasps), C Lawes (Northampton), C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), B Morgan (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola (Saracens), T Wood (Northampton).

"Nico Hulkenberg has been retained by Force India for the 2015 Formula One season. Hailed as a 'true racer' and a motivator by team principal Vijay Mallya, Hulkenberg has enjoyed his strongest season to date this campaign since returning to the Silverstone-based marque. The 27-year-old German said: 'It's good to confirm my plans for next season. This is a team I know extremely well and we've enjoyed a great year together with some special results.' 'True racer' Nico Hulkenberg has been retained by Force India for the 2015 Formula One season . Hulkenberg has finished in the points in 13 of the 16 grands prix to date, with four fifth-place finishes to his credit, comfortably outscoring team-mate Sergio Perez. For now there is no word on whether the team will also retain Perez, even though the Mexican has consistently stated in numerous weeks his desire to remain. For Hulkenberg, next term will be his fifth competitive campaign in F1 since making his debut with Williams in 2010. After being dropped by the Grove-based team, Hulkenberg was signed by Force India as test driver for 2011 prior to being promoted to a race seat for 2012. Surprisingly, Hulkenberg then switched to Sauber for 2013, only to return to Force India for the current season. Believing the future is bright with Force India, Hulkenberg added: 'The team has big ambitions and I believe we can have a competitive package again next year. Hulkenberg has enjoyed his strongest season to date since returning to the Silverstone-based marque . 'We have a strong partner in Mercedes and everyone in the team is motivated and hungry for more success. 'I have a good feeling for 2015, and there is a lot to be excited about as we try to build on the results we have achieved this year.' Mallya has confirmed holding on to Hulkenberg on this occasion was an easy decision as he said: 'Everybody in the team is delighted to see Nico remain a Force India driver for next season. 'We rate him very highly and he has done a tremendous job this year by consistently picking up crucial championship points. 'We know him extremely well - he's a true racer and he knows how to motivate the team.

"Graeme McDowell has emerged from the Ryder Cup with renewed self-belief and a resolve to re-dedicate himself to the sport after a lost period when he freely admits he was a sports psychologist’s worst nightmare. It has long been a mystery why someone so good under pressure and on and around the greens should frequently talk himself down. McDowell was at it again at Gleneagles. When asked about the possibility of partnering Rory McIlroy, he told an amusing but bewildering story about how he would watch his fellow Northern Irishman drive the ball 350 yards at Medinah in 2012 and ask himself: is it worth me bothering to tee it up? Graeme McDowell punches the air as he beats Alexander Levy at the World Match Play Championship . McDowell says he's emerged from a period in which he was a sports psychologist’s worst nightmare . Well, maybe not if there was nothing else to the game. But thankfully, some good people around him, including caddy Ken Comboy and coach Pete Cowen, have finally got through regarding the qualities McDowell does have rather than those he does not. ‘I have definitely been getting sucked in playing with these big hitters and beating myself up about it,’ revealed G-Mac. ‘Playing with Rory, Stenson, Dustin (Johnson), I’ve been thinking: “Wow, I can’t compete.” 'Now I am refocusing on what I do have, because I do have the tools to compete. I need to be more like Jim Furyk and stop being obsessed by negatives. My team around me have given me a good dose of reality in telling me how good a player I am.’ Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley did a good job, too, when he gave McDowell the honour of leading the team out in the singles. It’s a symptom of how negative McDowell had become that his first thought was to ask himself whether he was up to the task. ‘It did take me aback at first when he asked me,’ admitted the 35 year old. ‘He said I want you to lead us because you’re a battler and a fighter and I thought: ""Oh yeah, I’m a battler and a fighter.” 'I’ d forgotten that about myself. 'I thought I was just a guy who hit it 275 yards from the tee and could only compete on short courses. I’d forgotten I had a lot of other qualities that made me the player I was. I guess that’s why we pay these fortunes to sports psychologists to get these thoughts out of our heads. G-Mac's caddy Ken Comboy (right) was among those who have helped him appreciate his talents again . McDowell putts on first green on Wednesday at the London Golf Club in Kent . McDowell now knows that while he doesn't have the heavy machinery at the disposal of Rory McIlroy or Dustin Johnson that made him wonder whether he could compete or not, his other virtues make him a threat on tour . McDowell finishes off the 16th hole at the World Matchplay Championships in Kent . ‘So I’m using this end of season run to refocus for next year and really commit myself to the game again. I lost focus for the last year for all the right reasons, with getting married and having our first child. They are special times in the life of anyone. 'But now that’s all stabilised, and I realise how lucky I am to be playing out here. I’m in the prime of my career and I want to give the next five to eight years absolutely everything I have.’ Given his prowess at the format, where better to start than at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the London Club on Wednesday? There were shades of Gleneagles with him out first and up against one of the game’s gifted young talents but, like Jordan Spieth on that earlier occasion Frenchman Alexander Levy was despatched, by a three and two scoreline. Elsewhere, much of the attention centred around American Patrick Reed, who discovered that not only are the Europeans a tough nut to crack at the Ryder Cup but there’s plenty more who are tough cookies as well. Reed was up against Swede Jonas Blixt, who did what no European was able to do at Gleneagles, as he defeated the brash Texan two and one. Just like the Ryder Cup (above), McDowell was first up in Kent on Wednesday and beat Levy 3&2 .

Reed will now have to win his next two matches against Paul Casey on Thursday and Jamie Donaldson on Friday if his first visit to the London area is not to end with him spending the weekend as just another American tourist. As for the man who won the winning point at the Ryder Cup, Donaldson was rather brought down to earth by the only Englishman in the field, as Casey won two and one. There were also wins for Victor Dubuisson against Pablo Larrazabal, and Shane Lowry over Scot Stephen Gallacher.","Graeme McDowell beat Alexander Levy in World Match Play Championship .

"Atlanta Falcons defensive end Osi Umenyiora describes returning to his city of birth for the latest International Series contest at Wembley as a 'dream come true'. Umenyiora, who was born in London, will line up for the Falcons against the Detroit Lions on Sunday in front of over 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. The 32-year-old spent his early years in England before his parents moved to Nigeria and then to Alabama in the United States. Osi Umenyiora will return to England this week when the Atlanta Falcons take on the Detroit Lions . Now in his 12th season in the NFL, Umenyiora has won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants and appeared in two Pro Bowls. The defensive end moved to the Falcons in 2013 having spent a decade with the Giants and he appeared in the first International Series contest at Wembley against the Miami Dolphins in 2007 - which New York won 13-10. He said: 'It's my second time coming back to England and it is a dream come true for me. I hadn't been back to London at all when I left and it had been over 20 years. Coming back in 2007 was a great experience for me. 'All I can remember about England was the weather and the rain because I was seven when I left.' Umenyiora, pictured in action against Seattle last season, was born in England and moved away aged seven . Umenyiora at Wembley Stadium this summer during an NFL International Series media day . Umenyiora winning the Super Bowl with the New York Giants in Glendale, Arizona in February 2008 . The Falcons will be making their first trip to England for an International Series contest as they take on the Lions in the first ever lunchtime kick-off at Wembley. Having been part of the first game at Wembley seven years ago, Umenyiora has witnessed the growth of NFL in England since the International Series began and thinks the league are well on their way to giving London a team of their own. 'There are six teams coming over this year,' he said. 'Next year there might be eight teams and the year after that 12 and then maybe they will think about a team here full time. 'They're doing the right thing. It's a business and they have to expand and there's no better place to do it than here where there is a fan base.' But Umenyiora thinks the NFL will have to find a solution to the logistical difficulties that moving a team to London would create. He said: 'Logistics here would be the hardest thing because, as far as having a fan base goes, they'll have that here. 'Canada is right next to the United States and they have an NBA basketball team in Toronto. The Buffalo Bills sometimes play there as well so it is easier travel wise. 'The players will adjust to it. If I was getting paid, there's not much I wouldn't do. They have a fan base here to support a team and the players who come here will get on with it. 'What the NFL will have to do is have players that are from the UK. The people from America that live here would support the game first, but as soon as the people from England understand the game I think they will have a true feeling for it.' The Atlanta Falcons travel to England on the back of a fourth straight defeat having lost 29-7 in Baltimore . The Falcons landed at Gatwick Airport on Monday morning and will practice at Arsenal's Colney base this week ahead of their game against the Lions on Sunday. With the game kicking off at 1.30pm UK time, fans back in Atlanta will be watching the game at breakfast time. But Umenyiora is confident the early start will not be an issue either for the players or followers back home. 'They love football over there and they'll wake up at 4am to watch football if they have to so I don't think it will be a factor,' he said. 'I don't know how it's going to play out but we're going to be here for a whole week before the game so we will have a chance to adjust and maybe practice early in the morning or do something that will acclimate us.'","Osi Umenyiora will return to England this week when Atlanta face Detroit .

"Hull pair Nikica Jelavic and Michael Dawson are set to miss up to six weeks with injuries sustained at the weekend. Jelavic, the Tigers' four-goal joint top-scorer, injured his knee during the warm-up of Saturday's 2-2 draw against Arsenal, while Dawson was forced off late on with an ankle injury.

"Newcastle's Premier League clash with Leicester was delayed by an hour because of a safety issue with the new giant screen at St James' Park. The Magpies only installed the monitor above the Leazes End this week and it was making its debut against the Foxes. But dressing panels surrounding the screen came loose amid high winds on Tyneside and referee Martin Atkinson advised that fans were not allowed into the ground. The new scoreboard at St James' Park, hanging above a section of the stand,reportedly came loose, causing concerns regarding safety . As the wind picked up around the ground, staff were forced to investigate whether the screen was safe . Leicester's Kevin Phillips and Newcastle manager Alan Pardew look up at the faulty scoreboard while they wait for further news . An initial club statement read: ‘Newcastle United can confirm that there is currently a short delay in opening the turnstiles for today's game whilst an issue with the new screen is being addressed.’ This was followed by second statement, which read: 'An engineer is on site and will make a full appraisal at approximately 3pm. 'Further information will be available as soon as possible. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. The fears  led to the game being delayed by an hour and no fans of either team were let into the stadium until after three o'clock . Engineers investigate the screen at the Leazes End of the stadium, the new scoreboard was only installed earlier this week . Crowds of Newcastle fans build up outside the stadium while the turnstiles remained closed . 'We will bring you updates including any information on turnstiles and a revised kick-off time as soon as we can. Thank you for your patience.' The club eventually announced that the game would kick-off at four o'clock. The club then apologised for the inconvenience caused to supporters, saying: 'We wish to apologise once again to everyone who suffered inconvenience as a result of this issue today and wish to place on record our particular thanks to all supporters at St James’ Park for their patience.' It has been quite a week for Atkinson, who abandoned the European Championships qualifier between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade after a drone carrying an Albanian flag – including the disputed region of Kosovo – landed in the stadium, triggering fighting between players and fans.

Newcastle United Football Club would like to offer sincere apologies to everyone affected by the delay to kick-off of today’s Barclays Premier League fixture with Leicester City at St. James’ Park. Turnstiles were closed until 3:15pm whilst loose dressing panels surrounding the newly-installed LED screen in the Leazes Stand were assessed and made secure by engineers. Kick-off was subsequently rescheduled to 4:00pm. Before turnstiles were opened, an issue was identified with the dressing panels and in order to give the Club the opportunity to rectify the situation, the decision was taken to keep the turnstiles closed. Supporter safety was of paramount importance and the Club felt that this action was necessary as a precaution. The Club wishes to make very clear that the issues we experienced were not to do with the screen itself. Although the screen carries the ‘adi.tv’ branding the dressing panels were not installed by ADI nor a company sub-contracted by ADI. We wish to apologise once again to everyone who suffered inconvenience as a result of this issue today and wish to place on record our particular thanks to all supporters at St James’ Park for their patience.","Leicester faced Newcastle in their Premier League clash .

"As if Marouane Fellaini scoring was not enough, West Brom have been made to further regret their half-time tweet during Monday's 2-2 draw with Manchester United - by German giants Bayern Munich.

"A disabled man who is in a vegetative state must be kept alive for as long as possible so he can have a 'good' Muslim death, his wife has pleaded. She told the High Court her 55-year-old husband responds to family visiting the hospital in Greater Manchester and enjoyed smelling some perfume 'brought from Mecca' despite his severe brain damage. The man, who can only be referred to as L, had a heart attack last month and the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has applied for an order allowing it not to resuscitate if his condition deteriorates further. 'Responsive': The condition 55-year-old man who was in a 'vegetative state' has improved dramatically overnight, it was claimed today . His wife, however, told a judge that her husband had 'sniffed' the perfume and reacts to touch. The family . argue that it would be contrary to the religious beliefs of L, who . suffered a cardiac arrest in mid-July, not to do all that could be done to keep him living for as long . as possible. Pleading for doctors to continue doing all they can to save him, his wife of 40 years told the court today he has shown active signs of life. Speaking through an interpreter, the mother-of-eight criticised the quality of care her husband has received from hospital staff. Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which is based in Oldham, is seeking a court declaration that it would not be in his best interests to offer him ventilation or resuscitation if there was 'a life-threatening event'. Religious beliefs: The man's wife said he was able to 'sniff' perfume brought back from Mecca, pictured . Claire Watson, appearing for the Trust, said it was the unanimous view of clinicians treating L, as well as independent experts, that he was in a persistent vegetative state 'with minimal prospects of improving any neurological function and no meaningful prospect of further recovery'. Ms Watson told Mr Justice Moylan, sitting in the Court of Protection in London, that treatment would lead to 'the prolongation of death and lack of dignity'. But Mrs L said her husband was 'a very good Muslim' and had said he wanted 'a good death in line with his faith' - and that involved prolonging life 'for as long as you can'. Jenni Richards QC, appearing for Mrs L, asked her why she disagreed with the doctors' diagnosis that he was in a vegetative state and incapable of any meaningful response to anyone or his environment. Mrs L said that on occasions when the family visits him, her husband 'takes a deep breath and is aware that someone is there'. Mrs L described how she had visited her husband on the day of Eid, following the conclusion of Ramadan at the weekend. She said through the interpreter: 'I took a scarf and there was perfume he (Mr L) himself had brought from Mecca, so I put it on that scarf. 'Then we put the scarf in his hands and we felt like somebody is having a sniff, and he took a sniff of it. 'It is true sometimes he does not realise what is happening, but sometimes he does.'","She said he reacted to the presence of family and had 'sniffed' perfume brought back from Mecca .

"Joe Schmidt has angrily denied influencing provincial selection, rubbishing suggestions he has 'blocked' Darren Cave's path back to the Ireland squad. Head coach Schmidt has confirmed Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne will fight it out for Ireland's no 13 shirt in the upcoming Guinness Test series. Henshaw and Payne face a shoot-out to replace the retired Brian O'Driscoll, with Ulster centre Cave overlooked for Ireland's autumn ranks. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has angrily denied influencing provincial selection . Cave last year claimed his 'face doesn't fit' with the Ireland set-up, while Eoin Griffin left Connacht for London Irish in the summer, frustrated by his lack of national chances. Schmidt insisted he is monitoring the progress of both centres, but blasted the 'massive misnomer' that he orders provincial coaches to select players in positions of his choosing. 'We've probably gone with Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne: they are the two guys who are playing 13,' said Schmidt, speaking at the launch of a new Guinness advertising campaign in Dublin. Ulster's New Zealand-born centre Jared Payne is now eligible to represent Ireland under the residency rule . 'I think there has been a massive misnomer that I influence provincial selection. 'That is absolutely untrue: the guys that are selected in the centre, or to carry water, are nothing to do with my selections. 'They are the provincial coaches, they are looking to do their best for the province and that's the way it should be. 'For someone to imply that Darren Cave has been blocked is wrong: he's very much on our radar. 'Darren Cave had a shoulder operation; he's come back from injury, then had a rib injury. 'But he's still a guy that's still in our thinking for 13. Racing Metro's Johnny Sexton remains Ireland's first-choice fly-half for November . 'To say that Eoin Griffin may have left because he saw the writing on the wall is massively disappointing: he is still on our radar, we keep an eye on what's happening at London Irish. 'It's frustrating, because selection is a tough enough job without the impression we're influencing things. 'We have a very hands-off approach: we try not to interfere. 'We have a lot of faith in what they are delivering, and we benefit from the product of their efforts.' Kiwi boss Schmidt defended his decision to omit Paddy Jackson from Ireland's autumn squad, claiming the Ulster fly-half needs regular club rugby after injuries. Racing Metro's Johnny Sexton remains Ireland's premier outside-half, with Leinster's Ian Madigan also making the squad for November's three-Test challenge against South Africa, Georgia and Australia. 'Paddy's only played one full game this season,' said Schmidt, who opted for Munster's Ian Keatley ahead of Jackson. 'He needs to be playing at the moment - he doesn't need to be training with us. 'He's obviously disappointed, but he's a tough young man, we've got a lot of respect for Paddy. 'Ian Keatley did very, very well on the summer's Emerging Ireland tour, the feedback was that he led by example, both on and off the field. 'This camp gives us a little bit of an opportunity to work with him and help him to develop him as a player.' New Zealand Under-21 cap Payne steps up to Ireland's senior squad for the first time after completing his three-year residency requirements at UIster. The 29-year-old will face stiff competition from Connacht's 21-year-old powerhouse Henshaw, who remains favourite to start alongside Gordon D'Arcy this autumn. 'Jared has good variety in his kicking game, and his ability to read defensively at tackle time is good,' said former Leinster coach Schmidt. 'He can carry and slip tackles, or at least win the gain-line, and I think you could just about say ditto for Robbie. 'He's also got a very good kicking game. 'His passing game I think is a super aspect to his game, Robbie, he's got a very good width and a really flat, wide pass - and the ability to make the subtle passes as well.'","Head coach Schmidt confirms Robbie Henshaw and Jared Payne will fight it out for Ireland's no 13 shirt in the upcoming Guinness Test series .

It was not intended as a slur.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction form Louis van Gaal and Alan Irvine . After the match West Brom's Twitter account tweeted this response to criticism surrounding their Fellaini joke . The midfielder, celebrating his fine strike, scored his first ever goal for Manchester United in the second-half . United keeper Anders Lindegaard was one to criticise the WBA Twitter account for the half-time tweet . The club later insisted that the intention was to make a Carry On-style gag about Fellaini 'stripping off' but instead of being naked under his tracksuit top, he had a United shirt on. Albion say it was not meant to be a put-down. That joke was probably not worth the effort, in hindsight. United substitute keeper Anders Lindegaard was one of those to criticise the Baggies Twitter account after the match, saying: ‘Complete lack of knowledge, class and respect on Twitter from @WBAFCofficial on Fellaini!! #united #karma #keepbelieving.’ This tweet from the WBA official Twitter account at half-time appeared to mock United player Fellaini . Having entered play at half-time, it only took Fellaini three minutes to fire in this fierce strike to equalise . The much maligned £27.5million man scored after 48 minutes, which was his first goal for United since signing last September during David Moyes’ tenure. After the match Fellaini added: ‘It was a great feeling. I've waited a long time for this moment,’ he said after the match. However despite Fellaini’s efforts, England U21 forward Saido Berahino slotted West Brom back in front and Manchester United were only rescued late on thanks to a low drive from Daley Blind to save van Gaal’s blushes.

"Rangers striker Nicky Clark insists he will react in the right way after losing his place to Kenny Miller. Despite being the Ibrox side's most consistent performer over the last two months, the former Queen of the South hitman was dropped for Saturday's 6-1 win over Raith Rovers. He was back in Ally McCoist's line-up for the straightforward 2-0 win over East Fife at New Bay View in Tuesday night's Petrofac Training Cup quarter-final. Nicky Clark (centre) has started the season well but did not start in Rangers' win on Saturday against Raith . The striker (centre) returned for Tuesday's Petrofac Training Cup 2-0 quarter-final  win against East Fife . But he can expect to find himself back on the bench for next Saturday's Scottish Championship clash at Dumbarton, with Miller now fully recovered from the calf tear which kept him out of action for six weeks. However, Clark insists he is not the type to go in a huff. He said: 'I'm up for the challenge. You need to be if you are playing for a club like Rangers. 'All the boys are doing well and scoring goals, so I just need to keep my head down, keep working hard and when my chance comes, make sure I take it. Kenny Miller replaced Clark against Raith and scored in the comprehensive 6-1 win . 'I was a wee bit disappointed not to start at the weekend but any player will feel the same when you are doing well. 'Kenny and Kris Boyd are experienced players and the manager knows what he's getting from them. 'I've been happy with the way I have been playing and the team was doing well during that period, picking up some good results. Clark hopes he can persuade Rangers manager Ally McCoist to give him more game time in the coming months . 'So yeah I was disappointed not to play against Raith but we have got loads of really good players at this club with a lot of international caps. You have got to expect that they will come in ahead of you at times and play. 'What's important is how you react to being left out.'

"The scenes which surrounded Serbia's abandoned Euro 2016 qualifier with Albania caused much shock and amazement to all those watching. But it is by no means the first international encounter to be taken over by external elements, as Sportsmail looks back at 10 previous matches which turned into total chaos. Serbia and Albania players brawl leading to the abandonment of their Euro 2016 qualifier in Belgrade . Senegal vs Ivory Coast (October 2012) Didier Drogba has scored a few crucial goals in his time, but none have sparked off carnage inside a ground more than his penalty for Ivory Cost at Senegal in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure is escorted by police off the field in Dakar during his country's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Senegal. The match was abandoned after home fans went on a violent rampage . The Chelsea striker's spot-kick to put his side 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play led to home fans starting a riot, throwing everything they could on to the pitch as well as burning rubbish. As Ivory Coast took to the pitch seeking some relative safety, the players were rushed off it by police escorts. The aftermath saw Senegal banned from the following year's competition. Italy vs Serbia (October 2010) It's amazing this Euro 2012 qualifier in Genoa even kicked off, let alone last seven minutes before being abandoned after Serbia fans threw flares on to the pitch and into the home crowd. Serbian fans (left) throw fireworks on the field before their team's Euro 2012 qualifying match against Italy . Italy's Gianluca Zambrotta escapes a flare thrown by fans as the game was abandoned after seven minutes . The game was already delayed by 40 minutes after the visiting supporters tried to break down barriers between them and the pitch leading to Serbia players having to try to calm their own fans, without much success. The then-Italy boss Cesare Prandell claimed he 'had never seen anything like it.' The Italians were later awarded a 3-0 by UEFA. Denmark vs Sweden (June 2007) This heated Euro 2008 qualifier in Copenhagen came to a dramatic end in the 89th minute after referee Herbert Fandel abandoned the game following an attack by a Danish fan. With Denmark coming back from 3-0 down to level 3-3, Christian Poulsen sparked off wild scenes after he was sent off for punching Markus Rosenberg, resulting in a penalty to Sweden. Denmark's Michael Gravgaard (centre) tries to intervene as a Danish fan attacks referee Herbert Fandel (left) Stewards were nowhere to be seen as the fan ran on to the pitch to attack the referee. But despite the intruder being pulled away quickly by Denmark players, Fandel stopped the game with Sweden later given a 3-0 win by UEFA. France vs Algeria (October 2001) This was the first time the two countries had met since the north Africans had gained independence from their European hosts in 1962 - and it being 'only a friendly' wasn't going to lower the tension. Algerian fans hinted at things to come after they heavily booed ‘La Marseillaise’ before kick-off. For a while though, the game appeared to be meandering to a calm ending. Policemen drag away a spectator after dozens of Algerian supporters invaded the field  during the France Algeria match at the Stade de France in Paris.  France were leading 4-1 when the match was abandoned . However with France 4-1 up in the 77th minute, ever-increasing numbers of Algerian fans took to the field with stewards powerless to restore order. After the players went off for their own safety,  it took the intervention from riot police to regain control. Zimbabwe vs South Africa (July 2000) A 2002 World Cup qualifier in Harare was bought to a fatal end as a result of stampeding from the home crowd late in the second half. A South African football team member (front) and  fans react to tear gas fired by Zimbabwe police during the second half of the match at the National Stadium in Harare . After the visitors had gone 2-0 up, Delron Buckley’s celebrations provoked a reaction among the home fans, with players quickly forced off as the atmosphere grew in hostility. This led to police firing tear gas in to the crowd that caused the situation to worsen, resulting in the stampedes which crushed 13 people to death. Republic of Ireland vs England (February 1995) Given the history between the countries, this was never expected to be the friendliest of friendlies but nobody expected the chaos that erupted midway through the first half at Lansdowne Road. The warm-up fixture for Euro 96 was hostile from the off with both fans heavily booing each other’s national anthem before the game. Republic of Ireland's clash with England was abandoned after 27 minutes due to crowd trouble . Shortly after David Kelly put Ireland 1-0 up, England fans began ripping up seats and throwing missiles. Referee Dick Jol abandoned the game before riot police intervened. Fifty people were injured on the night. Egypt vs Algeria (November 1989) Unlike many of the matches in this list, this game was actually completed as Egypt defeated Algeria 1-0 to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. But there was post-match chaos from the Algeria contingent. The players and staff were unhappy at the referee - who took eight minutes to leave the field. Algeria fans turned their anger on to the VIP area while their player Lakhdar Belloumi bottled the Egypt team doctor - leaving him blind in one eye. Brazil vs Chile (September 1989) Chile had to win this 1990 World Cup qualifier to retain any hope of making it to Italy the following summer. Not long into the second half they looked doomed after going 1-0 down in Rio. Then in an extraordinary incident, a flare thrown on the field caused Chile goalkeeper Roberto Rojas to go down with his head bloodied. This forced Chilean players to walk off and not return for fears of their safety. It later emerged that the flare had not hit Rojas and he had caused his own injury with a razor blade in his glove. As a result Chile were banned by FIFA from the 1990 and 1994 World Cups. England vs Scotland (June 1977) Goals from Gordon McQueen and Kenny Dalglish sealed a famous 2-1 Home Nations tournament win for Scotland at Wembley, but it's the aftermath which lingers in the memory. A goal post was smashed and torn down as a policeman tried to calm some of the thousands of Scottish fans running wild on the pitch at Wembley Stadium after Scotland's 2-1 defeat of England . Scotland fans invaded the pitch in huge numbers after the final whistle, ripping up the Wembley turf as well as famously breaking the crossbar. To this day there are still many Scottish homes that will boast of having a small patch of turf from the famous win. Peru vs Argentina (May 1964) A horrific disaster which is one of the worst ever seen at a football match. Peru were in contention to qualify for the Olympics, but late on in this Lima clash the hosts saw an equaliser disallowed. Two spectators from an unhappy home crowd invaded the pitch in protest, but after one was brutally beaten by police, fans retaliated by pelting them with missiles. Police responded by letting off tear gas, but as fans raced for the locked exits an eventual crush led to the deaths of 328 of the 53,000 in attendance at the Estadio Nacional.","Serbia and Albania's Euro 2016 qualifier abandoned after pitch disruption .

"Tony Fernandes faces legal action by the current 'owners' of Caterham as the Formula One team stand on the brink of going out of business. Caterham were bought from Malaysian entrepreneur Fernandes at the end of June by a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern businessmen, since when the organisation has been forced to deal with numerous difficulties. Already facing an unlawful dismissal suit by a group of more than 30 staff axed over the summer, on Monday a supply company to the team - Caterham Sports Ltd - was placed in administration. Tony Fernandes, pictured with England manager Roy Hodgson, is facing legal action by Caterham . Crucially, however, the consortium claims AirAsia and QPR owner Fernandes, along with two other former owners of the F1 team, failed to act in good faith with regard to the transfer of shares of ownership. In essence, the consortium has been running Caterham over the course of the last few months without being the legal owners. Given the countless issues, they have now decided to withdraw all management from the team and effectively told Fernandes he is again in charge. Up until Wednesday, Caterham had been preparing as normal for the final three grands prix of the season in the United States, Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But without management, and with Fernandes unlikely to step back in at such short notice, the team face the prospect of their campaign being brought to a premature end, and worse, folding altogether. Caterham are in danger of going out of business after a four-year stay on the Formula One grid . Via a strongly worded statement, the consortium said it is to take all legal recourse against Fernandes and other parties. The statement read: 'On 29 June 2014, Caterham Enterprises Ltd, Caterham (UK) Ltd and Sheikh Mohamed Nasarudin (Seller) and their shareholders Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Bin Meranun entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Engavest SA (Buyer) with regards to 1Malaysia Racing Team Sdn Bhd/Caterham F1 Team. 'Since the date of the agreement, the seller has refused to comply with its legal obligations to transfer their shares to the buyer. 'The buyer has been left in the invidious position of funding the team without having legal title to the team it had bought. 'This is in total contradiction to the seller's press release of 3 October 2014 which stated that Mr Fernandes and his Caterham Group had no longer any connection with the Caterham F1 team. 'The administrators of Caterham Sports Limited have been appointed on behalf of Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (Exim), a creditor of Mr Fernandes and the Caterham Group. The buyer has no connection with Exim. 'Caterham Sports Ltd was a supplier company to the Caterham F1 team. Very regrettably, the administrators' appointment has had devastating effects on the F1 team's activities. 'Since their appointment, the administrators have released various press statements which have been severely detrimental to the management of the Caterham F1 team. 'After three months of operating the Caterham F1 Team in good faith, the buyer is now forced to explore all its options including the withdrawal of its management team. 'Lawyers have been instructed by the buyer to bring all necessary claims against all parties, including Mr Fernandes who, as an owner, will run the F1 operation.' Team principal Manfredi Ravetto has confirmed he has been forced to step back from managing the team, as well as insisting Fernandes remains the owner. Fernandes later hinted he had yet to be paid for Caterham by the consortium. After retweeting a question from a follower - 'I wonder what @tonyfernandes has to say.... Could it be he hasn't received payment from the Swiss/Middle Eastern investors? £F1' - he then posted: 'If you buy something you should pay for it. Quite simple.'","Troubled Formula One team stand on the brink of going out of business .

"Daniel Ricciardo feels Sebastian Vettel's desire for a new challenge was the driving force behind his decision to quit Red Bull. The Austrian team confirmed at the start of the month the man they helped win four consecutive Formula One titles would be departing at the end of the year, with Daniil Kvyat promoted to his race seat from Toro Rosso. Although the Milton Keynes-based marque did not mention where Vettel was heading, team principal Christian Horner later let the cat out of the bag by revealing Ferrari had poached the 26-year-old German. Sebastian Vettel is set to leave Red Bull at the end of the season and could join Kimi Raikkonen (left) at Ferrari . Daniel Ricciardo, who has outshone team-mate Vettel this season, has so far won three races this year . When Ricciardo first heard the news he concedes he was far from surprised, saying: 'I was pretty open to anything. 'I expected him to leave, so I wasn't shocked when he announced he was leaving. 'The way I see it, he has won four titles with Red Bull and obviously he has an opportunity elsewhere. Vettel won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and established himself as the best in the world . Sebastian Vettel is pictured in the Red Bull garage during practice for the Japanese Grand Prix . 'Before he sees himself getting a bit too old for the sport, he probably wants another challenge.' The suspicion is Ricciardo has also put Vettel's nose out of joint as the latter was understandably the dominant force in his previous relationship with former team-mate Mark Webber. But in a car not to his liking following the changes brought about by the introduction this year of the 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units, Vettel has been outperformed by Ricciardo. Ricciardo, on the podium having won the Belgium Grand Prix, is not surprised that Vettel is leaving Red Bull . Members of the Mercedes team celebrate winning the constructors' championship at the Russian Grand Prix . Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg were first and second in Sochi to wrap up Mercedes' constructors' title . Other than Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, Ricciardo is the only other driver to win a race this season, taking the chequered flag on three occasions. Ricciardo insists, however, in public Vettel has accepted his fate with good grace. 'He has been fair with me from day one, and after the third win was still very fair and very respectful with me,' added Ricciardo. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso (right) says it is 'unlikely' that he will be driving for Mercedes next season . 'As the season goes on he would love a win, so maybe inside there is a bit more frustration. I am sure deep down he wants to get a win this year. 'When you see a team-mate win races and you're not, naturally you are frustrated, but I wouldn't say that has been displayed in meetings or anything I have seen. 'To his credit he hasn't taken anything out on me, or in front of the team. 'Maybe behind closed doors, but not visible to any of us, so I think he has controlled it well.'","Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel is set to leave for Ferrari .

"Brazil players are being told not to wear hats, earrings or flip-flops while on international duty under the command of coach Dunga. They are also advised not to use mobile phones and tablets at certain times, and are discouraged from engaging in religious or political discussions. The internal code of conduct was published on Thursday by the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, Brazil's largest daily. The Brazilian Football Confederation confirmed its existence during a news conference in which Dunga announced the squad for friendlies against Turkey and Austria next month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dunga: There is no room for individuals in my Brazil team . Brazil captain Neymar, pictured wearing earrings and a cap, will have to follow Dunga's strict rules . The talismanic Neymar sported a personalised cap during a 2014 World Cup press conference . The confederation's guide for good behavior already existed but was revised after Dunga took over following Brazil's disappointing performance at their home World Cup this year. 'There are rules in any company, and even in our family there are conducts that are needed to maintain good harmony,' Dunga said. 'We are not prohibiting anything, there were rules already, we are suggesting some things we thought were important. The players are responsible for their own acts and depending on what happens we will decide how we respond.' The 16-topic guide published by Folha said players may be punished if they don't follow the rules. They could receive a warning, a fine or be released from the squad, according to the daily. Dunga, who replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari after the World Cup, is putting his own mark on the Brazil squad . A former defensive midfielder in his second stint in charge of the national team, Dunga was known for his toughness as a player and continued to cultivate the image of a disciplinarian after becoming a coach following the 2006 World Cup. Last month, veteran right back Maicon was dropped from friendlies in the United States for failing to report to the team's hotel by the time established by coach Dunga and the Brazilian Football Confederation. 'I think fans demanded more organisation in the national team,' he said. 'From what we've seen so far, the players liked what was presented to them. Now they know what the limits are.' There were no formal restrictions under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari at the World Cup, when the hosts were eliminated with a 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals. Players were regularly seen wearing hats and flip-flops and using mobile phones at the team's training camp. Maicon was dropped from Dunga's squad at the beginning of September due to his poor time management . The new guide says players should not use or wear the listed items during gatherings such as lunch and dinner, or in changing rooms and team meetings. They are being told to wear socks and tennis shoes. It also states nobody should leave the table before everyone is finished during meals, and that the captain should be the first one to leave. It notes that players should always report to the national team wearing social attire. They are advised not to express their political or religious opinions while with the national team, and should always sing the national anthem before matches. According to Folha, the guide also says the players are responsible for paying  extra costs during trips, including charges for phone calls and excess baggage. Brazil has won all four matches since Dunga's return, beating Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Japan.","Neymar and Co. have been told to follow Dunga's new instructions .

"A visible indication of the eagerness with which Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers approached this match could be seen in his face when he welcomed Carlo Ancelotti to the stadium. Eyes bulging, head back, hand outstretched — it was an unfortunate look caught by the Sky Sports cameras. Meanwhile Rodgers also welcomed back Joe Allen for his first start since he injured his knee playing for Wales on Andorra’s artificial pitch.

Liverpool’s kids did the business over Real Madrid on Wednesday afternoon, claiming a thrilling 3-2 victory over the Spaniards in the UEFA Youth League at Langtree Park, St Helens. Harry Wilson, 17, struck the winner with two minutes remaining. The victory means Liverpool top Group B at the midway point, joining Basle and Real on six points from their opening three matches.

"Liverpool fans will have the perfect opportunity on Thursday night to see if World Cup teenager Divock Origi really is the answer to all their problems at Anfield. With Luis Suarez gone, Daniel Sturridge injured and Mario Balotelli struggling badly, it is ironic that their £10million striker Origi will be in action against Everton in the Europa League for his loan club Lille. A goal or two will undoubtedly lead to calls from the Kop that he is brought back from France straight away to ease the Reds out of a mini-crisis following an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat against Real Madrid. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Liverpool loan star Divock Origi firing the goals in for Lille . Belgium international Divock Origi signed for Brendan Rodgers' men in June after an impressive World Cup . Origi celebrates scoring Lille's opening goal against Wolfsburg in his side's Champions League clash . Origi (left) in action for Belgium against Bosnia's Senad Lulic during the 1-1 draw between the sides in October . Brendan Rodgers swooped for the 19-year-old after he starred for Belgium last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to Lille on a season-long loan to aid his development. Officially, that is still written in stone though when a club as powerful as Liverpool are paying out millions of pounds, they usually find a way if they wanted Origi back earlier, possibly in January. Former Anfield striker Michael Owen thinks they should but Everton manager Roberto Martinez, whose side have the task of stopping Origi tonight, advises caution about rushing the 19-year-old into the Premier League. Origi celebrates with Chelsea star Eden Hazard after he opened the scoring against Russia at the World Cup . Roberto Martinez's Everton will look to limit Origi's influence for Lille in their Europa League meeting . 'You need to think about what the best step is to get a player ready for the Premier League. Sometimes as a young player you need to play games and you need to play minutes,' said the Everton boss. 'Remember that Origi didn't have many starts last season. He was more coming on as substitute, and slowly in the second half of the season he had a bigger role. So maybe he needed more starts before coming over. That is a strategy that has been put in place. 'I don't know the details surrounding the loan, but for me it's not strange.' Origi (left) shields the ball from Mile Jedinak during Belgium's friendly against Australia in September . Origi will come up against Tim Howard for the first time since the keeper's heroics against Belgium in Brazil . You can see Martinez's point of view. Liverpool's current predicament is borne out a perfect storm of losing Sturridge for two months with thigh and calf injures and the disastrous form of Balotelli and another summer signing Rickie Lambert. That doesn't mean Origi is the answer either at this moment. He had an explosive World Cup where his pace and movement shocked defenders. But towards the end of the tournament he was less effective, and has spoken himself of missing seven or eight chances against Tim Howard when Belgium played USA. Howard of course will be in Everton's goal against him tonight. This season, Origi has scored five goals to underline his potential, four for Lille and once for his country. And yet his overall form has blown hot and cold. He is inconsistent – something Liverpool don't need. Having said all that, if Origi does well against Everton, it may look odd to keep him in France while his parent club are struggling in front of goal. Martinez, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of world football and was in Brazil as a television summariser last summer, knows Origi's qualities. 'The World Cup showed he is intelligent and has a real strong personality. He has got real pace and power, a striker that can play really well in wide areas and a real threat on the counter attack. 'When he faces space he can be really dangerous. Origi can finish with both feet but is probably more right footed. I think he is someone that needs to be facing the space to be at his very best.' Liverpool fans don't have to take Martinez's words for it. They will be able to see Origi with their own eyes against their Merseyside rivals and whatever happens it's unlikely he'll be swapping shirts with an Everton player at half-time.","Liverpool loanee Divock Origi will feature for Lille against Roberto Martinez's Everton in the Europa League on Thursday night .

Such is the youngster's talent and will to succeed for his club, there's little doubt Barkley will be a key figure if Everton are going to lift the Europa League trophy in Warsaw next year - and what better way to start than by helping his side to take complete control of their group with three points at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Everton's stuttering start to the Premier League campaign was handed a timely boost as Barkley returned last weekend and although his absence wasn't the sole reason for the Toffees' tough time, his 66 minutes against Villa showed exactly what Martinez had been missing and it's no coincidence that Barkley played a part in arguably his side's most impressive win of the season. Barkley plays with a maturity beyond his years, but that doesn't detract from his almost schoolboy desire to attack and run directly at defenders with a confidence and directness that lifts the Everton faithful from their seats. Last season, Barkley completed 80 take-ons, the fourth highest in the Premier League, and although he attempted just one on Saturday, his close control and threat on the ball meant the youngster was occupying two or three Villa players at once, which created pockets of space for his team-mates.

Roberto Martinez, pictured during his pre-match press conference. believes Barkley was born to play football . Kick-off: Thursday, October 23, 6pm . TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm . Romelu Lukaku will be the biggest beneficiary from Barkley's return and the £28million Belgian looked a much better player with the England international tucked into the No 10 role in support. For all his self-confidence and obvious potential, Lukaku has been a source of frustration for Toffees fans so far this season, often looking leggy and showing a poor first touch around the opposition's box. But with Barkley playing behind him, Lukaku actually looks worthy of his hefty price tag and will be grateful to his team-mate for the pass which led to the Belgian's third Premier League goal of the season. And with 13 of his 16 goals last season coming while Barkley was on the pitch, it's no wonder Lukaku is so happy that his 'friend and brother' is back in a blue shirt. England midfielder Barkley plays a lofted pass against Paul Lambert's side as Lukaku looks on . Lukaku, who has described Barkley as a 'friend and brother', thinks the midfielder is the best player at Everton . The former Chelsea striker told Everton's official website: 'He is like a friend and brother to me off the pitch. 'I am very happy that he is back on it because he brings something that the whole team needs.' In France on Thursday, Barkley looks set to make his European debut and with the Europa League being the gateway to the Champions League for the first time, he could soon find himself playing on Europe's elite stage should Martinez's side go all the way on their Road to Warsaw. Barkley helps to knit Martinez's free-flowing football together, making space for Lukaku while bringing in Everton's marauding full backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, which will be key to Everton's game plan on Thursday night as they look to exploit a Lille side that have won just two of their last eight games in all competitions.

Toffees duo Samuel Eto'o (second from right) and Leighton Baines (right) get put through their paces . Lille may not have had the brightest start to their domestic campaign - 15 points from 10 matches - but they have more than enough to test Martinez's side. Liverpool loanee Divock Origi will be looking to endear himself to Reds fans as the Belgian striker aims to add to his tally of five goals in all competitions for the French club against his Merseyside rivals to be. Origi, who agreed a £10milllion move to Liverpool last summer on the back of an impressive World Cup, has been hailed as a 'monster' by compatriot and Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and will provide a stern test for Everton's backline, whether he plays from the left or the centre of Lille's front three. Divock Origi, pictured celebrating against Wolfsburg, is on loan at Lille from Everton's rivals Liverpool . Lille's players train at their home stadium as they prepare to welcome their English opponents to France . Without Barkley, the Toffees have recorded two impressive results in Europe so far, a resounding 4-1 win against Wolfsburg and a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Krasnodar in Russia, while Lille remain unbeaten but are yet to collect a win after two draws from their opening two games. Everton fans tuning into ITV4 from 5.30pm on Thursday night will hope another fearless Barkley performance will inspire them to three points, while showing the rest of Europe why he was born to play football.","Everton take on Lille in Group H of the Europa League on Thursday .

"Arsenal's new Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina has been ruled out for three months, with an injury he picked up while playing for former club Nice. Arsene Wenger confirmed the keeper's injury at his press conference before Arsenal take on Anderlecht in Belgium on Wednesday night. Emiliano Martinez is set to make his Champions League debut, and the 22-year-old Argentine is now the only senior cover for the suspended Wojciech Szczesny. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal not reach potential - Wenger . David Ospina has been ruled out for three months after aggravating an old injury in his last outing for Arsenal .

Mesut Ozil, Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy,  Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and Laurent Koscielny, while Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry and Jack Wilshere are all still struggling for fitness. Wenger claims the injury is the result of being rushed back from a different problem while in France. ‘He had his first injury in Nice,' claimed the Arsenal boss. 'It was a knee problem and I think he was a bit rushed back. 'He didn't use his legs so his muscle became weaker, then he got injured during the World Cup. And after that he came to us injured, from the World Cup. 'It took him two months to play a game.

"Harry Wilson struck the winner with just two minutes remaining as Liverpool beat Real Madrid in a UEFA Youth League thriller on Wednesday afternoon. The Reds had surrendered a two-goal advantage at Langtree Park but weren't deterred and snatched victory when Jordan Rossiter teed up Wilson for a cool side-footed finish.

Referee: Neil Doyle (Ireland) Liverpool started the contest brightly and signalled their intent by creating a couple of early chances. Ryan Kent delivered a free-kick from wide on the left that just evaded the far post and Wilson's swerving strike had a similar fate. But they didn't have to wait much longer for the breakthrough, which arrived on the quarter-hour. In an almighty goalmouth scramble, Wilson struck the post and Jerome Sinclair fought to keep the move alive before Cameron Brannagan rattled the ball home. The lead was extended five minutes later - when Wilson curled his free-kick onto the post it bounced out fortuitously for Tom Brewitt to slam home from close range. Liverpool continued to press and Wilson could easily have made it three when he seized on a loose pass inside his own half and scorched forward. Goalkeeper David Oliveros saved his effort and Sinclair's follow-up was blocked on the line. Real gradually grew into the contest and won a penalty when Adam Phillips was penalised for a high challenge on Cristian Cedres. But Liverpool got away with it, Borja Mayoral slicing the spot-kick high over the crossbar. Philipp Lienhart celebrates scoring Real Madrid's first goal, halving the deficit after 53 minutes . Shortly before half-time, Real fired another warning shot when Aleix Febas rattled the frame of the goal. The Spanish side emerged from the break refreshed and halved the deficit just eight minutes in. Alvaro Tejero attacked down the right and his accurate cross was nodded in off the crossbar by Philipp Lienhart. They were level on 67 minutes when substitute Borja Sanchez drove forward, played a one-two with Scot Jack Harper, and fired the ball in off the post. But they couldn't use their momentum to go on and win the contest. Instead it was Liverpool who claimed a dramatic late win when Wilson struck with just seconds to spare.","Liverpool beat Real Madrid 3-2 in dramatic UEFA Youth League clash .

"If you’ve ever wanted to name part of Mars after yourself, now is your chance. A Colorado-based company is giving anyone the ability to give their moniker to one of the red planet’s 500,000 unnamed craters. And, as long as you have a few pounds change in your pocket, you don’t need to be a scientist or astronaut to take part in the project. The world's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of Mars' craters, saying the red planet is not up for sale . The opportunity has been provided as part of a mapping project run by the space-funding company, Uwingu. The smallest craters, given on a first-come-first-served basis, will set you back around $5 (£3) with prices increasing based on the size of the crater. If all the craters on Mars are named, Uwingu will raise $10 million (£6 million), which it plans to use to fund grants in space exploration, research and education. ‘This is the first people's map of Mars, where anybody can play,’ Uwingu chief executive Alan Stern, told Space.com. ‘It's a very social thing’ The smallest craters, given on a first-come-first-served basis, will set you back around £3 ($5) with prices increasing based on the size of the crater . ‘We're developing this grant fund — the Uwingu fund — for people who've been hit by sequestration. ‘There's nothing like it right now. They have no place to go; it's either Nasa, NSF [the National Science Foundation] or you're out of luck.’ The company hopes to gain names for other features on Mars if it hits its target of naming all the craters by the end of 2014. ‘Only imagination limits your naming choices,’ the company writes on their website. The IAU said the public can get involved in naming of craters when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas. Craters less than 62 miles (100km) in diameter are named after towns on Earth with fewer than 100,000 people. Craters wider than this are named after late planetary scientists. Using that scheme, a large crater might someday be named after Carl Sagan or Eugene Shoemaker. One, for instance, has been named after Hal Masursky, a geologist who spent his career at Nasa studying lunar and planetary surfaces and the best places for landing. ‘Names of Martian craters in this new Mars map can honour individuals, living or deceased, pets, places on Earth or in space, sports teams, musical groups, countries, fictional characters - its up to you.’ Mr Stern said the project could provide some interesting insights into what people are thinking about and what’s important to them. Duplicate names are allowed in different districts and provinces on Mars just as street names in different cities on Earth can be the same. For each crater you named, an electronic certificate is issued with the name, date and details of the crater. The 15,000 red planet features whose names have been approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) will be added into Uwingu's base map. However, Uwingu will not get approval from the IAU, who is the body that approves the names of space bodies and their features. Uwingu's founders said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days .","Uwingu said project could provide insights into what people find important .

"Before every UEFA match there is a meeting of 'emergency personnel' who run through what to do in the event of any major incident before or during the match. This wouldn't be expected to cover a drone flying over the stadium with a politically-incendiary flag, however. While the referee does not attend this meeting, he is aware of potential issues, as England's Martin Atkinson would have been ahead of taking charge of Serbia against Albania in Belgrade. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the shocking scenes as Serbia vs Albania was abandoned . Serbia's game against Albania was abandoned after a drone flying over the stadium sparked chaotic scenes . Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down a flag carried by a drone - the Euro 2016 tie was later abandoned . Albania players flee the pitch and head to the relative safety of their dressing room following the chaos . The decision to take the players off the field may have been Atkinson's or he could have been advised to do so by UEFA's veteran delegate Harry Been, who is likely to have been sent there with any potential issues in mind. Once safely back in the referee's dressing room as the trouble unfolded on the pitch and in the stands, there will have been regular updates for Atkinson and his team of English officials as to how things were progressing. Out of courtesy, he will have been ‘consulted’ regarding the eventual abandonment - but the decision will have ultimately been made by Been. These incidents are rare but when they do happen it is always nice for the referee to have a senior delegate to take control or responsibility.

"An entertainment industry big wig with a gold-plated resume has reportedly resigned in the wake of pornographic photos of him emerging online and a work-related sexual harassment suit despite a sex-addicition rehab stint ten years prior. Richard Nanula holds a Harvard MBA. He held top titles at Disney and biotech juggernaut Amgen. Currently, he sits as chairman of the board of Miramax. And though the suave wheeler-dealer has made millions for his companies, his reportedly unseemly predilections may prove his undoing. Maxed out: Miramax chairman Richard Nanula has taken a leave of absence after a sexual harassment charge and after photos of him in a compromising position with a porn star allegedly hit the internet . Variety reported June 26 that website TheDirty.com had published photos it claimed showed Nanula engaged in sex acts with a porn star. The photos have since been taken down, but remained viewable at a site called PornNewsToday.com. Sources for Variety said the photos were the reason for the leave of absence Nanula recently took from Miramax and Colony Capital, which owns a large stake in the entertainment group. One of Colony Capital’s largest investors, it should be noted, is Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of the deeply conservative Muslim country. ‘Richard Nanula has taken a leave of absence from Colony and Miramax for personal reasons,’ Lisa Baker, a publicist with Owen Blicksilver PR, which reps Colony, told Variety. Now, the New York Post is reporting that a sexual harassment suit may be an additional reason for Nanula’s leave of absence. Additionally, says the Post, that leave of absence is actually a permanent vacation. However, Colony Capital failed to substantiate the Post’s tip that Nanula has resigned. Cured? Nanula, 2nd from right in 1997, reportedly entered a 6-day sex addiction rehab ten years ago that, he claimed in his divorce, had cured him . ‘Based on our investigation,’ a Colony rep told Page Six, ‘these matters are personal to Mr. Nanula, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.’ The harassment suit centers on a paralegal at Colony named Stephanie Shaw, who claims Nanula groped her buttocks in an ‘unwelcome, extreme, and offensive’ way back in early 2012 and filed suit in a Los Angeles court. Shaw, who was fired after less than a year with the company, is also alleging wrongful termination, among other wrongdoings. The court documents can be read in their entirety, here. Accused: A paralegal at Colony Capital, which has a major stake in Miramax, has filed a sexual harassment suit against Nanula claiming he groped her buttocks and that she was subsequently fired . Meanwhile, this isn’t the first bit of funny business the executive has been accused of. Back in 2005, Nanula’s then wife Tracey filed for divorce. According to court papers, Tracey claimed that she had found that Nanula had spent as much as $10,000 on prostitutes and traced his infidelities back to 2001. Tracey also indicated in her filing that Nanula had, at one time, completed a 6-day rehab stint for sex addiction that he subsequently claimed had cured him. Tracey Nanula would not comment on the case. The sexual harassment issue is now in binding arbitration, in which Shaw is seeking unspecified damages. MailOnline reached out to both Miramax and Colony Capital, though neither had responded as of Sunday afternoon. Stepped down?

"Spain defender Juanfran has called for patience as former Atletico Madrid team-mate Diego Costa fired another blank in the shock 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying defeat to Slovakia. Costa has made an electric start to his Chelsea career with nine goals in seven games this season since signing for Jose Mourinho's side in the summer. However the Brazil-born striker has now failed to score for Spain in six matches but Juanfran insists the under-fire forward will soon be scoring for the national side.

Chelsea star Costa had a frustrating evening in Slovakia, finishing a sixth game for Spain without scoring . Costa squares up to Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel during the loss as the referee steps in to intervene . 'He's not getting the scoring chances he's getting with his club team,' Juanfran told AS. 'He's committed and sooner or later he will start scoring goals. We need to be patient with him. On Sunday [against Luxembourg], everything will be fine.' Juanfran stated he though the result, a first qualifying defeat for Spain since 2006, was harsh on Vicente Del Bosque's side. Juanfran, whipping in a cross in Slovakia, has leapt to Costa's defence insisting he will fire in the goals soon . 'Their goalkeeper had the game of his life. I truly don't believe we deserve to leave this stadium defeated,' he said. 'Sunday is a must-win game now. We are disappointed and we'll go over it again and again tonight (Thursday). 'But by the morning we'll find the way to take the positives out of our display and we'll look to take three points on Sunday. I don't think we'll treat this like it is the end of the world.'

"A leading doctor has reassured Real Madrid fans that Cristiano Ronaldo's patella tendon is unlikely to cause him problems in the long-term. Dr Pedro Luis Ripoll, of the FIFA-accredited Ripoll Y De Prado sports clinic, told Marca that there is only a 10 per cent likelihood Ronaldo will require surgery on his troublesome knee. The Portugal star has been plagued by continuous niggles in his knee since last season, contributing to a below-average showing at the World Cup, but Dr Ripoll suggested Ronaldo has very little to worry about. Cristiano Ronaldo, seen here celebrating his last-minute winner for Portugal in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Denmark on Tuesday, will suffer no long-term problems with his troublesome knee . Ronaldo caused concern when he strapped an ice bag to his knee after coming off in Portugal's 1-0 friendly defeat to France in Paris on Saturday night - it was later revealed to be a mere precaution . Ronaldo has struggled with knee problems all year and it contributed to a sub-par showing at the World Cup . 'There's no reason for concern. Only 10 per cent of these injuries require surgery,' he said. Real fans are worried their talisman, who has scored 18 goals in 12 appearances for club and country so far this season, will be sidelined by tendinitis at some point, affecting their chances of winning La Liga and retaining the Champions League. They suffered a further scare at the weekend when Ronaldo strapped an ice pack to his left knee on the bench after being substituted in Portugal's 1-0 friendly defeat to France in Paris. Ronaldo has been in sensational form for club and country this season, scoring 18 goals in 12 matches . Ronaldo scores one of his three goals in Real's rout of Athletic Bilbao prior to the international break . But this was later revealed to be just a precaution, part of a treatment plan Ronaldo and medical staff have devised to keep him fit and firing. Ripoll's comments suggest the 29-year-old will be playing at the highest level for many years to come. Ronaldo is already Portugal's record goalscorer and he extended his total to 51 on Tuesday night with a towering, last-minute header to defeat Denmark in a Euro 2016 qualifier.

"For all the best from our brilliant Match Zone, click here. For Scotland, it was desperate, frantic backs-to-the-wall stuff by time up. Gordon Strachan spoke afterwards of feeling drained by a night of heroic graft and he wasn’t alone. This is the kind of night likely to prove the difference between qualification and a perennial hard-luck tale. They clung on in the end. An engrossing, pulsating Euro 2016 qualifier ended in an excellent, valuable point. Yet with 15 minutes to play the Scots promised so much more. Recovering from a wretched start and the loss of an early goal, they somehow eked out the lead via strikes from Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith. The brilliance of Arkadiusz Milik dragged Poland back into it and, but for the width of a goalpost in the dying minutes, this might have been a desperate tale of woe for Strachan’s team. They rode their luck in the final stages. No question. Yet a home win over Georgia and a return of four points from a possible six was tarnished only by a late Irish equaliser against Germany. Strachan calls Group D the group of death, but in this developing team life and energy abounds.

Goal: Maloney 18, Naismith 57 . Booked: Greer . Manager: Gordon Strachan . Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain) There were fine performances all over here. Ikechi Anya – again – Russell Martin, James Morrison, and the unheralded Gordon Greer - a late stand-in for Grant Hanley no less - were simply superb. ‘Gordon Greer was fantastic,’ said the Scotland manager. ‘He looks nothing like a football player - he looks like a rock star who’s turned up at a testimonial game. But he is absolutely fantastic. I thought his partner also did well.’ Steven Whittaker was an unexpected replacement for Andrew Robertson at left back and also earned the praise of his manager. ‘Steven Whittaker? You put him on there and you know what you are going to get,’ said Strachan. ‘If you had 10 Steven Whittakers you would sleep a lot easier the night before the game, trust me. He can’t play in goals, that’s why I only said 10.’ Yet the night got off to a deeply inauspicious start. Backed by a partisan and raucous home support, Poland took the lead in 11 minutes with a goal which was cheap and avoidable. It was also a personal disaster for Alan Hutton. The Aston Villa right-back earned plaudits for his performance in the weekend win over Georgia, a result which invigorated a campaign that began with defeat in Germany. Seeking to cut out a speculative, chipped through ball outside his own area, he took a poor touch with the outside of his heel directing the ball straight into the path of Krzysztof Maczynski in a shooting position. The midfielder’s calm, controlled low sidefooted shot rebounded off the inside of the post and into the net. Hutton sank to his backside on the turf as team-mates looked accusingly in his direction. In the space-age, cavernous environs of Warsaw’s National Stadium it was an ominous development. A repeat of the friendly victory here in March already looked improbable. But the Scots showed depth and reserves of strength. Under Strachan they know how to work their way back into a game. And it took them just six minutes to do it. A fine goal it was, too, the pre-match recovery of Ikechi Anya from an injury scare proving an act of mercy from the footballing gods. The Watford man conjured a superb first touch from Steven Fletcher’s spearing, diagonal long ball, plucking it out of the air on the left of the area and playing a pinpoint cut back to Maloney 10 yards from goal. The former Celtic player had scored just twice in 34 international appearances, but showed great poise to steer a low, placed shot into the net. With 17 minutes played, this lively football match stood at 1-1. Naismith (left) attempts to challenge Poland's Kamil Grosicki in the air during the Euro 2016 Group D qualifier .

Scotland goalkeeper David Marshall punches the ball under pressure from Poland's Kamil Gilk as Lewandowski also jumps in the air . The equaliser had a calming effect on Scotland. It settled them. Frankly, they looked the more dangerous team. In 38 minutes Whittaker more than justified the decision to pick him at Robertson’s expense when he denied the Poles a certain second goal. Robert Lewandowski, the shining star of this Polish team, looked odds on to convert after Waldemar Sobota ghosted in behind the Scots rearguard and guided Artur Jedrzejczyk’s through ball towards goal. Whittaker hacked it to safety. Scotland breathed again and made it to half-time intact. Within 12 minutes of the restart they went a stage further, silencing the 55,197 crowd with a stunning second goal. Scotland’s set-pieces had been poor of late, so when Maloney was fouled 30 yards from goal the fans were hardly holding their breath in anticipation. But this time James Morrison’s free kick found its way through a static Polish defence, Naismith reacting to prod the ball low into the corner of the net from 10 yards out. The regret for Scotland was that half an hour of the match still remained. Inevitably they began to fall deep. Too deep at times. Tiredness played its part, of course. Steven Naismith (right) gets the slightest of touches on the ball and puts it in the back of the net to move Scotland 2-1 ahead .

Poland's Grzegorz Krychowiak (left) jumps in for the challenge on Scotland's James Morrison by the sideline . Milik, the Polish No7, posed the greatest threat of damage. He headed a more than decent opening onto the roof of the net from close range. With 20 minutes to play his low, driven cross then ran menacingly across the face of Scotland’s goal, requiring the merest of touches to draw the Poles level. The minutes, by now, were ticking past excruciatingly slowly. Strachan opted for fresh legs. Darren Fletcher replaced the goalscorer Naismith while Derby’s Chris Martin took Steven Fletcher’s place up front. And within seconds the Scots came so close to going 3-1 ahead. Anya’s run to the left touchline ended in a piercing deep cross to the back post area where Maloney controlled and lashed a right foot shot towards the top of the net. Wojciech Szczesny – outstanding against Germany – pushed the ball over the bar at the last second. Had it gone in it was game over. Scotland would have taken all three points.

What came next was brutal both in its significance and its creativity. With 14 minutes to play, Jedrzejczyk played a neat reverse pass in behind the hapless Hutton, Milik thrashing an outstanding left foot shot which fizzed past Marshall’s outstretched hands to scenes of enormous joy and no little Polish relief. The home nation were working up a head of steam. An impassioned support bayed for the winning goal, demanded it, indeed. Within minutes they almost had it. Lewandowski worked an opening to thrash a rasping right foot shot towards goal, David Marshall saving brilliantly. Then came a quite incredible let-off for the visitors six minutes from time. Milik, a repeated thorn in Scotland’s side, lashed an angled shot against the outside of the post after some delightful lead-up play. The ball fell invitingly to Kamil Grosicki who seemed certain to thrash it into the net before the ball skidded wide. Polish heads were in hands. They knew, as we all did, that their final chance had come and gone.","Poland took the lead in the 11th minute as Krzysztof Maczynski took advantage of an Alan Hutton mistake .

"Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has warned the Premier League to watch its back because the Bundesliga is about to overtake it. The Bundesliga is currently third in UEFA's five-year rankings, but closing in on the Premier League all the time. And Rummenigge has called on all German sides participating in Europe next week to pull out all the stops to ensure England's top division drops a position at the end of the current season, which is feasible. Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge believes the Bundesliga will overtake the Premier League . 'I think that the English are looking over to us with rather a bit of envy,' he told Sport1 television. 'They may have high income, but on a sporting level, they are losing a bit of attractiveness compared to the Bundesliga. 'Not long ago, we were fourth in the UEFA rankings and now we are third. 'We've caught up a lot on the Premier League in recent years and I'd like to call on all Bundesliga clubs involved in the Champions League and the Europa League in the coming week to get as many points as possible.

Bayern Munich (right) and Borussia Dortmund (left) contested an all-German Champions League final in 2013 . Chelsea were England's best representatives in the Champions League last season, losing in the semi-finals . While setting his sights on overtaking England, Rummenigge should perhaps also be wary of what is going on behind Germany. Italy, which dropped to fourth in the rankings in 2012, when Germany secured a fourth starting berth in the Champions League at the expense of Serie A, have accumulated more points than any other nation so far this season. Although they are not likely to have any chance of regaining third place for a few years at least, the fact Italian clubs have started to take the Europa League seriously with only one team - Torino - dropping any points on the first two European matchdays shows they are keen to close a gap which currently stands at over 11,000 points. The Bundesliga is just over 3,000 points behind the Premier League with Spain's Primera Division still over 14,000 points clear at the top. At the end of the current campaign, England will lose the 18,357 points it gained in 2010/11, while the Bundesliga loses just 15,666 points.

On Tuesday, Gutierrez revealed that a collision with Arsenal's Bacary Sagna on the final day of the 2012-13 Barclays Premier League season led to the scan which detected his testicular cancer. 31, has now spoken about his treatment for the first time, and says the tumour might not have been detected so soon had it not been for that accidental clash with Sagna on the final day of the 2012-13 season. Speaking about his treatment in an interview with TYC Sports the 31-year-old said: 'I had a very hard collision with Sagna in the area of the pubic bone and the genitals. Jonas Gutierrez revealed on Tuesday that he has been diagnosed with cancer . The Newcastle winger (centre) said doctors uncovered a tumour after a tackle by Bacary Sagna (right) The collision between Sagna and Gutierrez (centre) came when Newcastle hosted Arsenal in May 2013 . 'From then I had a lot of pain that wouldn't go away. I spoke with the doctor straight after and he said: ""If it doesn't hurt then don't worry"". 'Then it was holiday time and I felt the pain more in the testicle. The season started and in September and October I noticed that the testicle started to become inflamed. I felt a pain when I put my underpants on, it was uncomfortable. 'I went back to the doctor and they told me to have an ultrasound scan and they detected a tumour and told me I needed an operation. I left the clinic crying and went home and told my dad who was there. 'I spoke to the club and said because of the delicate nature of the problem and because in Argentina I was going to understand everything being told to me better, I wanted to be treated there.' Gutierrez was left writhing around on the floor in agony after the challenge by the full-back .","Papiss Cisse scored both goals in Newcastle's 2-2 draw against Hull .

"On and off the pitch there is perhaps one word which best describes Jonas Gutierrez – genuine. Shortly before meeting him for the first time, I was warned – albeit with a smile – that I would hear him before I saw him. It was true. That was in July, 2008 and he had just signed for Newcastle from Real Mallorca. I interviewed him at the club’s training ground and there was no need for an interpreter, Jonas insisting from the off that he used English. Newcastle's Jonas Gutierrez has been battling testicular cancer and the chemotherapy has caused hair loss . The first thing that strikes you is his gregarious nature, he’s larger than life but endearing and infectious with it. It was, then, a shock to learn of his battle with testicular cancer and to see the TV interview in which Jonas – wearing a baseball cap having lost his hair following chemotherapy – revealed his illness. For while we all know that cancer does not discriminate, here was a supreme athlete once nicknamed El Galgo – The Greyhound – for his indefatigable efforts on the field. But when he arrived at Newcastle it was the moniker ‘Spiderman’ we were all talking about. During his time at Mallorca, Jonas, after a visit to the cinema to see Spiderman, had promised a boy he would don the superhero’s mask the next time he scored a goal. And so he duly did, producing the disguise from his shorts following a solo strike against Osasuna. The Argentine midfielder is known for his gregarious, larger-than-life personality that is hard to dislike . Type ‘Spidey Jonas’ into YouTube and enjoy it for yourselves, you’ll see what I mean about his fun-loving nature from the celebration as he mimics spinning a web. One person who certainly thought Jonas was a superhero was my own mam. Following a pre-season friendly against PSV in the summer he signed, I interviewed Jonas pitchside. Kevin Keegan was manager and he’d invited my family – waiting for me in the stands – down to the dugout area to watch me perform. After the interview I introduced Jonas to my parents, shaking my dad warmly by the hand and giving my mam a kiss on either cheek. It was then that we realised her shoe was caught in the drain on the fringe of the pitch. Without further notice Jonas was down on all fours manoeuvring the shoe back and forth in a bid to free it. Thirty seconds and two more kisses later we were all on our way. He’d even signed the matchday programmes of which he was the cover star. In fact, I have never seen Jonas refuse an autograph or an interview. His willingness to engage with team-mates, press and supporters made him instantly popular on Tyneside. Gutierrez was loaned out to Norwich last season but they were relegated from the Premier League . He backed it up on a Saturday afternoon as well. He was so impressive on his debut at Manchester United – a 1-1 draw – that Alan Hansen said on Match of the Day that he could be the signing of the season. Sadly, with Keegan gone before the month was out, Newcastle were ultimately relegated. Gutierrez, though, stayed and played a key role in the club regaining their top-flight status – there was also the long-awaited appearance of the Spiderman mask at St James’ Park following a fine goal against Peterborough. It had been in his shorts for over a year! It was during the Championship season that his best friend and Argentinian compatriot, Fabricio Coloccini, scored one of his first goals for the club at Watford. In 2008, Alan Hansen said on Match of the Day that Gutierrez could be the signing of the season . As we waited to speak to the scorer – who still hadn’t emerged from the dressing-room – we noticed the team bus starting its engine. Taking matters into our own hands, we entered the crumbling changing quarters of Vicarage Road to be met by the sight of Jonas and Coloccini - still wrapped in their towels and the last two present – enjoying the beats of their infamous (the other players occasionally took the mickey) Latin sounds. Rather than chase us, Jonas offered to play the role of interpreter and so Coloccini gave his first interview to the press as a Newcastle player. When Jonas revealed his cancer treatment he, of course, spoke fondly of Coloccini, thanking him for his support. And in the hours since, thousands of fans, team-mates and sportsmen from around the world have come out and offered their thoughts and support to Jonas and his family. That is the reason for a few of the above personal recollections, hopefully illustrating in a small way what a genuine guy he really is. Get well soon, Jonas.","Jonas Gutierrez battling testicular cancer .

"Roy Hodgson took the decision to start Raheem Sterling on the bench in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia after he complained he was tired the day before the game. The Liverpool forward has been heavily criticised for his stance since, but was he entitled to say he was suffering from weary legs?

"For all the best from our brilliant Match Zone, click here . There are times when watching England can sap your energy. That much is true, never more so than during the World Cup. And this mundane Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has the makings of a lethargy-inducing trudge. So thank goodness for Wayne Rooney and his curling free-kick. Eyes were glazing over in Tallinn after 73 minutes of frustration against an Estonia team with 10 men and little ambition. Raheem Sterling was not the only one feeling weary. Up popped Rooney with an effort which squirted from the grasp of goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko and spilled into the net to win the game and inch the captain a little closer to the England goal record.

Referee: Marijo Strahonja (Croatia) 6.5 . Ratings by JOE BERNSTEIN . His pursuit of Sir Bobby Charlton has taken on a life of its own, since there is not a lot else to excite on the road to France. He now has 43 goals from his 99 appearances, six short of Sir Bobby and five behind Gary Lineker, who was teased by his son on Twitter with 'Rooney's gonna get ya old man'. Roy Hodgson had been preparing to take Rooney off and replace him with Rickie Lambert when the goal went in. The forms had been filled in and handed to the fourth official, according to ITV, who were pitch-side. Hodgson later denied this, which was odd, and talked his way into a muddle, as he is prone to do, claiming his backroom staff might have been doing that, but he wanted to keep his captain on. How strange. Anyhow, when Lambert eventually entered the fray, it was in place of Danny Welbeck, who 'rolled an ankle' according to the manager. It is not thought to be serious but Arsene Wenger, with injuries piling up at Arsenal, will be anxious to check. Rooney had misfired against San Marino on Thursday – squandering a hatful of chances and scoring from a penalty - and was the chief culprit as more chances came and went in Tallinn. It seemed set to be a tale of dreadful finishing by the Gulf of Finland, despite playing against 10 men for nearly half the game. Estonia lost their captain Ragnar Klavan - also winning his 99th cap - sent off for a second yellow card when he body-checked Fabian Delph, early in the second half. Rooney, however, refused to be deterred. He has now scored 11 in 26 games since Hodgson took over from Fabio Capello and this one gave England maximum points from three games in Group E. They are on the way to the manager's artificial target to win all 10 qualifiers and were able to celebrate another clean sheet. Luis Suarez was the last player to score against them. England will have seen out his ban without conceding a goal, although they were almost caught out in the opening seconds with a shot by Blackpool's Sergei Zenjov, which clipped Gary Cahill on the heels and fizzed narrowly wide. The move started with a clear foul on Fabian Delph in midfield missed by the Croatian referee Marijo Strahonja, who was very lenient with some feisty tackling by the home team, early on.

Cahill clattered through Zenjov after winning the ball, as if to warn the Estonians they could have that sort of game if that's what they wanted. When the yellow card finally came out it was to book Klavan for holding back Welbeck and it proved costly when he was dismissed three minutes after the interval. England's best effort in the first-half came from Rooney, who made an angled run, was found by Wilshere and took on the volley, dropping over his right shoulder. It was difficult but Rooney caught it sweetly, possibly too sweetly, and it flashed over. On other occasions, he appeared less confident and uncertain in front of goal, making the runs and getting the chances but failing to test the goalkeeper.

He darted clear again before the break, but was unable to fashion an effort on goal as the blue shirts recovered to crowd him out. It was beginning to feel like an extension of his frustrating night against San Marino, when he had many chances but scored only once, from the penalty spot. Wilshere, excellent in the holding role without having to do much holding against a team who rarely had the ball, smashed one into the side-netting and Henderson forced the first save of the game from Pareiko with a dipping shot from 30 yards, just before half-time. Hodgson deserves a little credit for taking the necessary risk to clinch the win, sending on Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to inject pace and impetus. Sterling had not started having complained of being tired on the eve of the game. Adam Lallana was selected instead and was bright and busy early on, but his clubmate came on won the free-kick on the edge of the penalty box which Rooney finally converted. At last there was reward for a game England dominated almost as completely as the one against San Marino. Rooney ought to have made it two. He was clean through again before the end but could not beat Pareiko. He is going after the record in ones. But last night one was enough to wake England up.

"England laboured to a scrappy 1-0 win against Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday evening, Wayne Rooney's free-kick finally breaking the deadlock against the 10-man hosts. Roy Hodgson's men enjoyed plenty of possession, but struggled to open up a dogged Estonia outfit. Here's how Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rated England's performances. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere talk about his deeper role for England . Wayne Rooney curls a free kick over the wall and into the corner to finally give England the lead . Joe Hart 6 – Didn't have to be at his shot-stopping best. His presence adds security in tricky away games but distribution let him down on occasions. Geed up the team in the tunnel before kick-off and got the clean sheet. Calum Chambers 5.5 – Steady in defence but England could have done with a more an attacking outlet at right back given their superiority. This will be an interesting position for Hodgson moving forward, Glen Johnson is better at getting forward but Chambers is younger and steadier. Calum Chambers was again selected by Roy Hodgson to start at right back for England, but offered little . Gary Cahill 6.5 – Didn't put a foot wrong either defensively or starting up attacks. Left his calling card on Sergei Zenjov with a strong tackle. He looks set to be the core of England's defence for many years to come. Phil Jagielka 5.5 – Often had time on the ball without making the most of it. Solid whenever a high ball was hoisted into the England box. Now in his thirties, it is hard to see him improving and Phil Jones will replace him when fit. Leighton Baines 6 –Still making the runs of old but lacks the dynamism of a couple of years ago. Set up one good chance for Rooney but missed a good free-kick opportunity. Always offered himself as an attacking outlet but against better opposition you fear for him. Booked. Jack Wilshere 7 – Lacks mobility as a holding midfielder when out of possession, but last night he was able to get forward and set up Rooney's near-miss volley with the pass of the game. Always on the lookout for the ball, won his fair share of free-kicks too. Man of the match. England's players leave the field at half time after failing to score against a side ranked 63 places below them . Jack Wilshere was England's best player on the night, and one pass for Rooney in particular was spectacular . The Arsenal midfielder lacks some of the necessary mobility to thrive in a defensive role, but was impressive . Jordan Henderson 6.5 – Caught early by the gloriously-named Martin Vunk, showed energy thereafter without the cutting edge.  Covers so much ground for England, hard to imagine the team without him. Booked and substituted. Fabian Delph 6 - Lax pass nearly cost England early on but won the foul that got Estonia skipper Ragnar Klavan sent off. Shows great energy and mobility, perfect for the way Hodgson wants to set up, but not creative enough. Substituted. Adam Lallana 6 – Found pockets of space between the Estonian lines, making him a more natural No 10 than Sterling. But couldn't pull off that one pass to make the difference. That playmaker's job in the England team is up for grabs. Fabian Delph offered industry rather than creativity in the middle of the park before he was replaced . Adam Lallana carries the ball forward but England lacked a creative spark in the centre of midfield . Danny Welbeck 5.5 – Not his day. The Estonians were strong enough to counter his physical attributes and he didn't take up enough 'fox in the box' positions. Possibly his biggest contribution was getting shoved by Klavan for the first of his two yellow cards. Substituted. Wayne Rooney 6.5 – His effort and teamwork were exemplary, and he eventually compensated for two bad misses by scoring his 43rd England goal with a free-kick - before he could be taken off. Should have added a second goal in injury-time but was foiled by the goalkeeper one-on-one. England captain Wayne Rooney had his side's two best chances in the first half, but couldn't hit the target . Rooney blazes over when well placed as England struggled against their unfancied hosts in Tallinn . Danny Welbeck stretches for the ball but it was a match where England's spearhead was not at his sharpest . Substitutes: . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (for Delph 61) 5.5 – Didn't have a big impact after becoming Roy Hodgson's first change . Raheem Sterling (for Henderson 64) 6.5 – Hodgson's decision to hold him back worked with the winger winning the free-kick on the edge of the box for Rooney to score . Rickie Lambert (for Welbeck 80) Manager: Roy Hodgson 6.5 – Can be justified in leaving Raheem Sterling on the bench. The Liverpool winger may not have been happy but Hodgson gave him 26 minutes to make a difference, which he did. Referee: Marijo Strahonja (Croatia) 6.5 – Got his biggest decision right, sending off Estonia captain Ragnar Klavan for two clear yellow card offences on Welbeck and Delph.

"It will go down as one of the quieter games of Joe Hart's international career but that didn't stop him being voted man of the match for England's 1-0 win against Estonia on Sunday evening. The Manchester City keeper earned his second consecutive award following Thursday's comfortable 5-0 victory over minnows San Marino, another game where he was rarely tested. But, perhaps poking fun at his lack of action for a second time in four days, Three Lions fans opted to pick Hart as Vauxhall's best player in an online vote for the Euro 2016 qualifier. Joe Hart was voted as England's man of the match against Estonia by fans despite having another quiet night . Hart won his second Vauxhall man of the match award with a massive 83 per cent of the online vote . The Manchester City keeper was also picked by fans for his performance against minnows San Marino . The 27-year-old received a massive 83 per cent of the vote, leaving him well ahead of second-placed Jack Wilshere (six per cent) and goalscorer Wayne Rooney (three per cent). Hart made just one save and one catch in Tallinn, following on from the one save he made at Wembley on Thursday evening. England's clean sheet means they have now kept five in a row for the first time since 2006 and are yet to concede a goal since Luis Suarez's late winner for Uruguay during the group stage of the World Cup. As well as San Marino and Estonia, Roy Hodgson's side have since managed to keep out Costa Rica, Norway and Switzerland on their way to four wins from five games. Hart beat Wayne Rooney to Vauxhall's man of the match vote despite the striker's match-winning free-kick . Luis Suarez's late goal against England at the World Cup was the last the Three Lions conceded .","England beat Estonia 1-0 in their Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn .

"Former Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard has been voted Player of the Month for September by Manchester City fans after an impressive start to his loan spell at the club. The 36-year-old edged out England midfielder James Milner and Spain's David Silva for the honour, the club confirmed today. Lampard's impact has vindicated the surprise move by City manager Manuel Pellegrini to offer him a six-month loan deal after he left Chelsea following 13 trophy-laden years to join New York City FC. Lampard endeared himself to City fans when he scored a dramatic late equaliser in the Premier League clash against his old club in September. Frank Lampard has impressed for Manchester City since he joined the club on loan from New York City FC . Lampard has continued his goalscoring exploits for City (left) after netting many times in the blue of Chelsea . Lampard netted against Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup and showed his eye for goal again in City's 4-2 win at Hull City. He is due to join City's affiliate club New York in January but there is already speculation that his stay in north-west England could be extended by a month. 'There has been a lot said about when the season starts, but the only thing that can decide my future is how well I am playing. They will be kicking me out in January if I don't play very well,' Lampard stated. 'I am just looking game to game and trying to play as well as I can.'

"Click here to see our brilliant Match Zone including a pitch map of Diego Tardelli's match-winning performance . It wasn't Lionel Messi, Neymar or even Kaka that stole the show in Beijing's first Superclasico de las Americas but Atletico Mineiro's Diego Tardelli. Goals either side of half-time from the 29-year-old, who was fairly absent for much of the game, made it three wins from three for Brazil without conceding. Much of the match build-up was centred on Beijing's pollution but thanks to a breezy Saturday afternoon it had all but cleared up in time for kick-off with levels dropping from 'Hazardous' to 'Moderate'.

Since 1914 there have been 95 meetings between the two nations with results almost even, Argentina on 36 victories, Brazil with 35 and 24 matches finishing in a draw. Argentina had won all but one game in the last 10 - that being their World Cup final loss to Germany - while Brazil's poor campaign saw them come under intense scrutiny following a 7-1 loss to the Germans. The tables had turned somewhat for Brazil with back-to-back 1-0 wins over Colombia and Ecuador but the jury was still out. Argentinian fans had plenty to be happy about in the opening 10 minutes with Manchester City man Sergio Agüero getting in on goal after just 15 seconds and Messi introducing himself with a couple of darting runs much to the delight of the Chinese fans. Argentina continued to knock on the door with Di Maria and Agüero again creating but their finishing let them down. Totally against the run of play though, Mineiro forward Diego Tardelli capitalised on some bad defending from Demichelis and Zabaleta to smash a volley home across Romero and give Brazil the lead on 28 minutes. Tardelli had been a doubt before the game with an eye injury but his finish opened his international account in style. Diego Tardelli was a peripheral figure for much of the game but popped up with both goals. See his pitch map in our brilliant Match Zone . Tardelli didn't see much of the ball but when he did he made it count and grabbed two goals from inside the area .

Neymar followed up by destroying the Argentina defence, the Barcelona star getting past Mascherano and leaving him in his wake before easing past Demichelis but he couldn't finish the chance. With Argentina suddenly on the back foot, Danilo was outpaced by Manchester United's Di Maria who was brought down in the box just five minutes before the break. The stage was set for Messi but the talismanic playmaker missed the opportunity to level matters as he hit a poor penalty which Jefferson palmed away.

Chelsea full-back Filipe Luis hit a great chance over the bar before Neymar caused problems for Argentina. Oscar also went close before Diego Tardelli got in on the act again with his second on 64 minutes - the corner came in and from the flick-on Tardelli nodded the ball home to double Brazil's advantage. Argentina continued to try and find a way back into the game but Brazil looked as if they might have scored more. Kaka was introduced in the latter stages to a massive reaction from the Chinese fans, with one getting so excited he followed his hero onto the pitch only to be swiftly removed.","Dunga's Brazil beat South American rivals Argentina 2-0 in Saturday's friendly match in Beijing .

"Cristiano Ronaldo claims he put his career on the line by playing in last season’s Champions League final. The Real Madrid star played almost 60 games for club and country last season and admits he needed a rest towards the end.

"England swept lowly San Marino aside - CLICK HERE for our amazing match zone. Here was an ominous warning for the provincial cities. This is precisely the kind of low-grade international football heading your way if England steps aside to make way for more American Football at Wembley Stadium. The Cowboys, the Jaguars, the Falcons and the Lions are on the way later this year. It makes you wonder if Thursday's crowd was swelled by dyslexic gridiron fans hoping to catch a glimpse of legendary quarterback Dan Marino. It was one of those largely pointless one-sided exercises served up in every qualifying campaign, where Roy Hodgson only has to make sure his team turn up on the right day to secure the points. VIDEO Scroll down to watch pictorial highlights of England's comfortable Euro 2016 qualifier win over San Marino . Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring the second goal on an extremely comfortable night for England against San Marino . England: Hart 6, Chambers 6, Cahill 6, Jagielka 7, Gibbs 6, Henderson 6 (Oxlade-Chamberlain 46 - 7), Wilshere 5.5, Milner 5, Sterling 7 (Lallana 46 - 6.5), Welbeck 7 (Townsend 66), Rooney 7 .

Referee: Marcin Borski (Poland) *Ratings by SAM CUNNINGHAM at Wembley . He did and they did and, as Switzerland lost in Slovenia, England may at this rate qualify for Euro 2016 with years to spare. What will that do to the crowds at Wembley? No wonder the idea is back on the agenda to move some of these less-appealing games to cities where international football is more of a novelty and smaller stadiums, which fill up more easily. Since Wembley is not likely to surrender its A-list fixtures. These will be the ones earmarked for the travelling circus. It was a terrific effort by nearly 56,000 who came along and by England who coped well with the no-win task at hand. Hodgson's team did their best to entertain, sustained a healthy tempo, and never attempted to coast or simplify their football. Five goals did not reflect their utter domination and plenty of chances were missed, many by Wayne Rooney, who might have scored half a dozen but inched within seven of Sir Bobby Charlton's 49-goal record - six if he can claim the fifth which swerved in off defender Alessandro Della Velle. Hodgson wanted to give it him. 'Rooney all day,' he beamed. The opener came from the unexpected source of Phil Jagilka, Danny Welbeck continued his fine goal run and Andros Townsend came off the bench to score his first international goal for a year. San Marino boss Pierangleo Manzaroli was happy with five. Adam Lallana, marked out for praise by Hodgson, had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside, there were some remarkable saves from computer science student Aldo Simoncini and Townsend was denied by a late goal-line clearance. It may have been a glorified training session but it was a spree to lift spirits ahead of Sunday's qualifier in Estonia, which promises to be a little trickier, and Hodgson was able to report there were no injuries of note, another key element of the night. With his international players falling lame at a rate of one a day, Arsene Wenger must have been among those who looked away. Five Arsenal players started the second-half, including Calum Chambers and Kieran Gibbs in their first competitive England game. Well, competitive in the sense that there were points at stake. This particular competition was to see who could puncture the double layer of dark blue insulation on the edge of the Sammarinese penalty area and beat Simoncini. Phil Jagielka (centre) plants a  header home after 24 minutes to set England on their way - the Everton defender's first competitive international goal . Jagielka is all smiles when being congratulated by Gary Cahill with goalkeeper Aldo Simoncini lying on the floor after tripping over .

Townsend is congratulated by Rooney after scoring just minutes after coming on at Wembley in front of a swathe of empty seats . Danny Welbeck put a shift in up front for England against San Marino - CLICK HERE for our brilliant match zone . Two years ago, Simoncini protected his goal for more than half an hour. Here, he was beaten after 24 minutes when he came hurtling from his goal-line in pursuit of James Milner's corner and tripped over his team-mate Luca Tosi. As the goalkeeper crashed to the ground, Jagielka leapt to nod the ball into an unguarded net. It was the 172nd goal conceded by Simoncini in 40 games. It would be 176 by the end of the night. If he were bothered by the avalanche of numbers, he would have packed in long ago, as would San Marino for that matter. For them, they have a right to compete on the international stage as the world' s oldest republic but it is debatable. Simoncini was soon launching himself Superman-style towards Gary Cahill's head underlining the danger of UEFA's comedy mismatches: a student high on adrenalin propels himself like a human missile at the head of a player currently negotiating a £120,000-a-week contract at Chelsea. In truth, England could have few complaints about the way San Marino played. There were some clumsy challenges, but Milner was the first to be booked, raising the question of a how an England player manages to ease to the brink of suspension in a game like this. The night's second yellow card went to San Marino's veteran striker Andy Selva, who was back in his own penalty area, attempting to clear the ball when he kicked Rooney in the face. Rooney's spot-kick would have beaten even a professional goalkeeper. Welbeck (left) saw an early left-footed effort deflected just wide as the hosts tried to turn the heat up on the lowly visitors .

Kieran Gibbs (marshaled by Chiaruzzi and Hursch) spent the majority of the game deep in San Marino territory down the left-hand side . Winger Raheem Sterling - who was brought off at half-time - uses his low sense of gravity to get away from Matteo Vitaioli (left) It was another crash back to earth for Simoncini who had just produced a splendid reflex save to turn a shot over from Welbeck and the cue for Hodgson to start making changes with the trip to Tallinn in mind. The limbs of Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson were to be preserved, a sign of how important the Liverpool pair have become to their country. And, with San Marino beaten, the fluent movement of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and vision of Lallana helped England ease clear. Oxlade-Chamberlain set up the second for Welbeck at the near post, within four minutes of the restart. Lallana had his first England goal wrongly disallowed for offside before Townsend cut inside from the right to score and Rooney, having fluffed one elaborate attempted chip, scored with another, helped by the deflection.
