"Toyota today said it is recalling 1.75 million vehicles globally over brake problems and other glitches that posed a fire risk. The Japanese manufacturer cited three problems in several models including its luxury Lexus brand and Crown Majesta. One issue was an improperly shaped part in the braking system that could lead to a change in the 'feel' of the brake pedal over time . Toyota has recalled 1.75 million cars globally, including luxury Lexus models and the Crown Majesta . A total of 9,637 Lexus IS, GS and LS models, manufactured between January 2005 and September 2010, are being recalled in the UK due to the fuel issue . That defect affected 802,000 vehicles, mostly in Japan and China, produced between June 2007 and June 2012. Toyota said the issue, wouldn't render the brake ineffective, but performance could begin to 'gradually degrade'. Fuel delivery was an issue affecting 759,000 vehicles, including Lexus models and Crown Majesta made between January 2005 and September 2010, which could increase the risk of a fire 'in the presence of an ignition source'. More than half of the affected cars were sold in the U.S. A total of 9,637 Lexus IS, GS and LS models, manufactured between January 2005 and September 2010, are being recalled in the UK due to the fuel issue. A problem with 109,000 cars in Japan linked to the fuel-suction plate also posed a fire risk, the firm said. The affected cars were made between October 2006 and October 2014. The announcement comes about four months after Toyota recalled 2.27 million vehicles over a airbag defect . Toyota said it was 'not aware of any fires, crashes, injuries, or fatalities' linked to the problems. The announcement comes about four months after Toyota recalled 2.27 million vehicles over a airbag defect. Toyota has recalled almost 11 million vehicles since the start of the year. In February the manufacturer recalled 1.9 million of their hybrid Prius model. Despite logging record sales and bumper profits, Toyota has been fighting to protect its reputation as rival General Motors scrambles to contain a deadly ignition-linked scandal. In March, Toyota agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle U.S. criminal charges that it lied to regulators and the public as it tried to cover up deadly accelerator defects, which caused vehicles to speed out of control and fail to respond to the brake. Toyota recalled 12 million vehicles worldwide in 2009 and 2010. This week, GM raised its ignition-switch death toll. As of October 10, the number of people killed in crashes because of the defective ignition switches was 27. The company waited nearly 11 years before beginning to recall 2.6 million cars, in February, after hundreds of possible accidents and deaths were reported. By late August GM had acknowledged 13 deaths from crashes related to the problem, in which the faulty ignition could turn off power to a car's power steering and safety airbags while it was in motion.","Brake and fuel delivery issues lead to the recall of 1.75 million vehicles .

"Members of the controversial Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church are planning a protest at tragic actor Robin Williams' funeral over his portrayal of a gay man in the movie The Birdcage. The Good Will Hunting star passed away on Monday and while details of his funeral have not been made public, members of the church have already announced plans to picket the memorial. A message posted on the group's official Twitter.com page reads: 'Westboro Baptist Church Hopes To Preach In Lawful Proximity To Robin Williams' Funeral - To Warn The Living: Repent Or Likewise Perish.' Robin Williams (left) starred with Nathan Lane in The Birdcage . The controversial church has already spoken out about Williams' role in the film, in which he played a gay man . Tough time for the family: Robin Williams' wife, Susan Schneider (left), announced his death earlier this week while his daughter Zelada (right) was callously trolled on Twitter . However, organisers at the global non-profit organisation Planting Peace have launched a fundraiser to counter the church's plans. A message from co-founder Aaron Jackson reads: ""Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list. ""His appeal crossed generational boundaries. I was personally impacted when I heard of his passing. This is a small gesture to honour his legacy and the difference he made to so many,"" he said. Jackson said that when the WBC announced they were protesting the star's funeral, ""we felt like launching a fundraiser for a charity Robin loved would be the perfect way to honour him and counteract the message of hate and intolerance that the WBC continues to convey"". The proceeds from the fundraiser will benefit St Jude Children's Hospital, which Williams supported during his life.","Controversial church infamous for its anti-gay agenda .

"Two brothers have been charged with felony assault after a bathroom brawl at the new Levi's Stadium during Sunday's San Francisco 49ers game. Santa Clara County prosecutors say 27-year-old Amador Rebollero - who also goes by the name Jose Ramos -  and 34-year-old Dario Rebollero appeared in court Wednesday, but they didn't enter pleas. Prosecutors say one of the two victims, who are cousins, remains in critical condition and may be partially paralyzed. Their names haven't been released. Amador Rebollero could get 11 years in prison if convicted; his brother, 8 years. Santa Clara County prosecutors said in a release that 'The motive of the attack appears to be that the now possibly-paralyzed victim was in line at the men’s room behind Ramos and ""nudged"" him on the shoulder to point out an available urinal.' Scroll down for video . Charged: Amador Rebellero, left, and Dario Rebellero, right, have been charged with felony assault after a bathroom brawl during Sunday's San Francisco 49ers game . Police said Monday they were reviewing video of a fight in a restroom at Levi's Stadium that left one man in serious condition . 'These victims were beaten like animals,' Deputy District Attorney Deborah Hernandez said, according to CBS San Francisco. 'One of the victims has suffered severe injuries. He has some bleeding to the brain. He has had to have partial skull removal to relieve some of that pressure. He is currently suffering some paralysis.' Police said Monday they were reviewing the video of the fight inside the restroom at Levi's Stadium. In the video, which has been widely distributed on the Internet, the two assailants and two victims appear to be wearing 49ers gear. The footage shows the assailants raining punches down on two fellow fans, leaving one unconscious and the other lying on the floor desperately protecting his head. As punches are thrown other fans in the restroom can be heard urging those involved to calm down. The person filming the footage turns the lens towards himself and says 'Wow' just before the clip ends. Alex Cartagena, who posted the video online after his brother-in-law Justin Sweeney recorded it, said the situation in the men's restroom was intense. Brutal: The bearded man on the left with blue jeans and white sneakers was hit so hard in the face that he was left unconscious (right) Accused: Dario Rebollero, left, and Amador Rebollero, right, are seen after their arrest on charges of felony assault . 'One guy was impatient about another guy not taking the stall quickly enough,' he said. 'It happened really quickly. Next thing you know, the guy's lying on the floor.' The suspects, Dario and Amador Rebollero, fled from the bathroom but were soon caught inside the stadium, said Santa Clara police spokesman Lt. Kurt Clarke. One victim was treated and released and the other was in serious condition. Spokesman Bob Lange said the team is deeply concerned about the victims. 'We were appalled to see the video of the attack on the victims,' he said, expressing gratitude to the police. 'Maintaining the safety of all stadium guests is our highest priority.'","Two brothers have been charged with felony assault after a bathroom brawl at the new Levi's Stadium during Sunday's San Francisco 49ers game .

"An easyJet plane sparked panic on the ground after it was  spotted circling in the sky above Liverpool airport for two hours with an RAF jet in tow on Tuesday. The budget airline's Airbus A-319 was seen by observers who took to Twitter to highlight its unusual flight pattern - and fears were raised when a Hawk was seen flying a similar route. However, a spokesman for John Lennon Airport confirmed the two aircraft were both taking part in training exercises on the same day. An easyJet plane was on a 'training course' when it was spotted circling for some two hours (file photo) Members of the public began to worry when an RAF Hawk jet was also spotted circling the airspace . 'We had a crew training flights that departed from John Lennon Airport, which will have gone up, come down, gone up and come down again,' the spokesman told Mail Online. 'It's not unusual and we have these very often in fact there was one that has been out today (Tuesday). 'Because of the wind direction, the flights went out on a slightly different path, which was more over south Liverpool, and this meant that more people noticed it. 'And then purely by coincidence, an RAF Hawk was out on a training exercise and was in the same area. People were putting two and two together and getting five.' A member of public, Karl Voice, also contacted the Wirral Globe after he saw the easyJet plane performing 'evasive manoeuvres' with its landing gear down over New Ferry from about 11.30am.' Locals took to Twitter after seeing both planes in the sky for up to two hours. The map shows the number of times the easyJet plane circled over John Lennon Airport . The circling of the easyJet plane began to stir up questioning on Twitter . While Ciara wrote: 'There's been an easyJet plane and a RAF fighter circling Liverpool all day and it kept flying right over our school like so low it was crazy.' Eileen posted: 'That easyJet plane is still flying round and round in circles! That's one long training course they're on! #Liverpool.' A spokesman for easyJet said: 'easyJet has been conducting routine crew training flights in the North West which are set to continue for the rest of the week. Officials at John Lennon Airport have said that the plane will be 'in training' for a few days . 'Our pilots are always fully aware of other aircraft operating safely in the vicinity. At no point was there any risk whatsoever to either aircraft. 'The airline has a comprehensive training programme for its pilots and as part of this conducts numerous flights of this kind every year.' However, members of the public seemed to believe this was far less 'normal' than suggested. Writing on Twitter Peter Handley said: 'Anyone know why the plane is circling? Counted at least 15 times in the past 2 hours. And Kieran Hughes was similarly confused, writing: 'Sat for about 4 hours watching an easyjet plane circle Liverpool airport!' Keith Stafford added: 'The plane circling Airport is crew training. Seems too unusual still.'","Worried locals take to Twitter after spotting both planes circling in the air .

"'Politics of envy': Ed Miliband has pledged to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million . Families who have saved hard to own their own home would be punished under Labour’s ‘mansion tax’ plans, a major insurer has warned. Chief executive of Legal and General, Nigel Wilson, said the party was ‘pandering to the politics of envy’. He fears that Ed Miliband's pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2 million would exacerbate the housing shortage and make it hard for first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder. Mr Wilson said: ‘People who choose to prioritise buying a home have typically made sacrifices to do so: fewer foreign holidays, meals out or other luxuries. ‘Through no fault of their own, their prudence would be punished by a Mansion Tax.’ The threat of a levy had already slowed the top end of the property market and the drop in sales could reduce the amount of houses being built, he added. Mr Wilson also said the levy was unlikely to raise even a tenth of the £1.2 billion that the shadow chancellor Ed Balls said it will raise as homeowners are likely to try and find legitimate ways to avoid paying the tax. Under Labour’s plans, owners of homes worth more than £2million to £3million will pay £3,000 per year. Owners of homes worth more than £3 million could pay as much as £30,000 per year. Around 90 per cent of affected homes are in the capital and Mr Wilson says the tax would be ‘anti-London’. He said: ‘The political attractions of a Mansion Tax on houses worth over £2 million are obvious. It’s anti ""Fat Cat"", it’s anti-London; and sends a message to those who can’t afford housing: “we’re on your side”.’ Mr Wilson also branded Labour’s plans as ‘a form of double taxation’. He said: ‘Since the long-forgotten abolition of MIRAS, mortgages are paid out of income that has already been taxed. The Liberal Democrats are putting forward similar proposals. Priorities: Mr Wilson said that people who want to buy a home typically forgo other luxuries. (File image)","Labour pledges to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million .

"It looks just like that speeder chase on the Forest Moon of Endor... if you squint really, really hard. In fact it's a stunt by hardcore drone-owners, who have emulated their favourite Star Wars scene by racing £150 quadcopters through the woods. The group of men - and they do seem to be mostly men - wear goggle-mounted monitors as they race radio-controlled machines at up to 70mph near their homes in the French Alps. Scroll down for video . On your marks: Drone enthusiasts have emulated Star Wars by racing £150 quadcopters through the woods . Assault course: Unlike the Forest Moon of Endor, hairpin bends are clearly marked with red tape and arrows . Spot the difference: The real scene in Return of the Jedi was a bit more high-octane - with more (primitive) CGI . They claim the exhilarating sport is Formula 1 for the 21st Century, allowing them to blur the effect of a video game and a real life race. It is carefully modelled on one of the climactic scenes in the 1983 hit Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, when Luke Skywalker whizzes through the woods in a bid to stop stormtroopers from sounding the alarm. There are a few crucial differences. The course is marked out with red-and-white tape and plastic tree-mounted arrows, so the fiery crashes are less likely. And instead of using the force, the enthusiasts see through a front-mounted camera while another films the experience for a highlights clip. But the members of AIRgonay, a group of 60 radio-controlled flying machine hobbyists who live in Argonay, southern France, insist theirs is still an adrenaline-junkie's sport. Event: The drone enthusiasts in the French Alps meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz through the woods . Hobbyists: One of the 60 members of the AIRgonay group with his £150 radio-controlled machine in the forest . They meet every lunchtime for a quick whizz around the woodland, and insist their high-speed drones rarely break down despite the pressure they're placed under. Group founder Herve Pellarin, 44, said: 'When we first started there were a lot of broken drones. 'It takes some practice to fly them - even now there are a few crashes whenever several drones round a tight corner. But the drones are very light so they don't break easily and can take a fall quite well.' The smartphone app designer added: 'When me and my friends first started chasing each others' drones around I thought to myself ""wow, this is just like Star Wars"" - especially when we're in the woods. 'I used to be a champion skateboarder, but an injury meant I had to stop. 'I'm addicted to adrenaline, and drone racing gives me a chance to get some excitement. Flying through the woods at super speed is pretty thrilling. Quadcopter: The contraptions, with front-mounted cameras, are capable of reaching top speeds of 70mph . Woodland: The men insist there are fewer fiery high-speed crashes into trees than in the 1983 blockbuster . Delicate: The quadcopter racers admit that 'when we first started there were a lot of broken drones' Cheap: Despite their advanced technology, the racers insist their £150 contraptions are very affordable . 'I found a piece of forest and I negotiated with the council to let us fly there on weekday lunchtimes. All of us leave work and meet up for a race over lunch.' Each quadcopter has two cameras mounted on the front - one to relay the video to a pair of goggles which acts as monitor, and another to record the flight. Mr Pellarin said he hopes the sport will become popular all over the world. 'Drone racing is a new motorsport for the 21st century,' he said. 'We would like people to set up their own quadcopter clubs and events. I would love it if there was a league. 'The sport is so representative of the time we live in. It uses state-of-the-art technology.' Adrenaline junkies: The members of the group.

"A beautifully-groomed classic Sydney apartment has been placed on the market, in its pristine original condition, for the first time in 45 years. The owners Rod and Thelma Thompson, who had been dating for 12 years, decided they'd tie knot in 1968 just so they could receive a war service home loan and buy the property off the plan in 1969 for $16,000. The couple have lived in the 92 square metre property up until this year. Now the Randwick apartment, south-eastern Sydney, is set to hit the market next week with a price guide of $650,000 plus. Selling agent Kiki Bermudez, of Mint 360 Property, says the two-bedroom unit is 'a rare find'. Scroll down for video . A beautifully-groomed classic Sydney apartment, in its pristine original condition, has been placed on the market for the first time in 45 years . The owners Rod and Thelma Thompson bought the Randwick apartment, in south-eastern Sydney, off the plan in 1969 for $16,000. It is now on the market for more than $650,000 . Selling agent Kiki Bermudez, of Mint 360 Property, says the two-bedroom unit is 'a rare find' and will hit the market early next week . Ms Bermudez is impressed by the 'retro' kitchen and eat-in kitchen of the property which was built in the 1960s . 'A lot of people are describing it as retro, late 60s chic, but I really think it's an original gem,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was amazed by it when I first walked it. It's as if you step back in time when you see the interior of the property.' Features include crystal chandeliers throughout the home, wallpaper with velvet texture, an original stove top and a large eat-in kitchen. The unit - one of 12 in the building - is facing north, close to Randwick Racecourse, an external private laundry and a lock-up garage. Mr Thompson, 92, reluctantly decided to put his home up for sale after his 97-year-old wife died in May. Daughter-in-law Cherie Fyson says if it wasn't for the property, the pair wouldn't have married. 'After they met at a dance in 1952 they lived together for 12 years,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then they wanted to buy this property and needed the loan. If it wasn't for that, they still wouldn't be married to this day.' Mrs Fyson attributes the property's well-maintained condition to Mr Thompson - who used to calculate mileage on government cars as his day job. 'Thelma used to call Rod her ""toy boy"" - he did all the washing, cleaning, cooking and even rubbed cream in her legs for her,' she said. 'But ever since she died, Rod has been sitting in the home very lonely and by himself so he decided to finally sell it.' The couple never had children together but Mrs Thompson - who was a seamstress - had two from a previous marriage. The first inspection will be held on Saturday and real estate agent Ms Bermudez says she plans on dressing up in 1960s attire. She says it is most likely this is the only unit in the block that's been kept the way it was bought 45 years ago. If not sold prior, the apartment will go under the hammer on November 22. Rod and Thelma Thompson dated for 12 years before they decided to tie the knot in 1968 so they could receive a war service home loan .","Owners Rod and Thelma Thompson bought the Randwick apartment, south-eastern Sydney, off the plan in 1969 for $16,000 .

"A nursing assistant who strangled and buried eight of her newborn babies  will be tried in France four years after she admitted the country's worst ever infanticide case. Dominique Cottrez, 50, is said to have killed the children and hid their bodies in bin liners between 1989 and 2000 because she did not want to use contraception. After her confession in 2010, she tried to escape the charges by claiming the crimes all took place more than ten years earlier - which under French law means a prosecution cannot be brought. Standing trial: Dominique Cottrez (pictured) killed eight of her newborn babies between 1989 and 2000 . Macabre: An excavator combed the garden of Cottrez' house, where two babies' remains were found in 2010 . But today a court ruled she must stand trial, because hiding the bodies meant it was impossible to know a crime had been committed within the time limit. The first macabre discoveries were made four years ago when the new owners of a house in the village of Villiers-sur-Tertre, northern France, found human bones in their garden while digging a pond. They alerted police, who found the remains of two children which had been there since the Cottrez family moved out in 1991. After tracking Dominique and husband Pierre-Marie Cottrez to another house just half a mile away, they found the bodies of six more children buried in the garden in black bin liners. Doting: One of the surviving children of Cottrez (pictured) defended her after her 2010 arrest . Defence lawyer Marie-Helene Carlier told a court this week: 'My client readily admits the horror of what she has done but believes that legally the time for punishment has passed.' But France's Court of Cassation rejected the claim, and ruled that Cottrez must stand trial next year for the wilful killing of eight minors under 15 between 1987 and 2000. Public prosecutor Eric Vaillant told an initial court hearing in 2010 how Cottrez, who was obese, had managed to hide her pregnancies within her 20-stone frame. 'She managed to hide the fact she was pregnant because she was very overweight,' he said. 'She told investigators that when she became aware she was pregnant she decided she did not want any more children but also did not want to see a doctor for contraception. 'She has admitted giving birth in secret and then suffocating the babies and disposing of the bodies.' Husband Pierre-Marie Cottrez, 48, has denied knowing about the babies being born or killed. The couple have two surviving daughters, Virginie, 22, and Emeline, 23 - who have one son each. Emeline described her mother as a 'doting granny' to her child. She said after the crimes were discovered: 'It's incomprehensible that our mother could have done this. 'She was a good, loving grandmother, and we were happy to leave our children with her.' Grim: The second house where six more corpses were discovered. The case is thought to be France's worst . Tributes: Candles were laid in front of the house where the newborns' remains were found in northern France . The tragedy is not the first such case in France. In March 2010 French mother Celine Lesage, 38, was jailed for 15 years after admitting to killing six of her new-born babies and hiding the bodies in her cellar. In 2009, Veronique Courjault was sentenced to eight years in jail after admitting to killing three of her own babies, burning one corpse and hiding the others in the family freezer.","Dominique Cottrez admitted France's worst ever infanticide case in 2010 .

He added: ""The ship's company has been outstanding and I am pleased that so many of their families are here today to welcome them back to the home of the submarine service."" The Duchess of Cornwall, known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, will later be given a tour of the submarine and attend a reception at the base. During her eight months at sea, HMS Astute travelled more than 27,000 miles and took part in counter-smuggling operations and an international exercise. Submariner Steven Panniers is greeted by his daughter Amelia after disembarking HMS Astute at HM Naval Base Clyde, Scotland, following the submarine's maiden deployment in February . The deployment saw seven men qualify as submariners, including 19-year-old Connor Campbell from Dunfermline in Fife, who was met at Faslane by his proud parents, sister and girlfriend. He said: ""It was quite exciting getting off the boat and seeing everyone. It's been hard work but it's definitely been worth it. ""You get used to the conditions after a while. Now I'm just looking forward to getting home and relaxing."" Submariner Rory McEwan from Gloucestershire is greeted by his children and wife Rossanne at Faslane .

Thomas Bett, 26, from Anstruther in Fife, said what he missed most while at sea was his own bed. He said: ""It's not that bad – you have a Mess you can sit in and the food's ok. The main thing I miss is my double bed - it's more comfortable."" Submariner Tony Simpson from Helensburgh hugs children Iyla, seven (left) and Rheana, four . Mr Bett was welcomed home by sister Nicola, 37, and her husband, with whom he lives. She said: ""It's fabulous to be here and see him come off the boat. It's been hard and we've missed him, but I've not missed the washing."" Astute was launched in June 2007 at BAE Systems in Barrow-in-Furness and was commissioned during a ceremony at Faslane attended by the duchess, the boat's sponsor, in August 2010. The Duchess of Cornwall, known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, is greeted by Gareth Jenkins Commanding Officer of HMS Astute as she joins senior naval officers at HM Naval Base Clyde . Faslane is the home of the UK submarine service and all seven of the Class vessels – Astute, Ambush, Artful, Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and Ajax – will be ported there. Commodore Michael Walliker, Commander of the Faslane Flotilla, said: ""I am delighted to welcome HMS Astute back to her base port at Clyde. ""Her return is the culmination of four years' dedication and commitment by a great many people, both in uniform and in industry to deliver this submarine to the front line."" The 97-metre long Astute is able to circumnavigate the world without surfacing. Its nuclear technology means it will never require refuelling and the submarine can manufacture its own oxygen from sea water. Lieutenant Commander Rob Tantam, 36, said the returning home was made even better by the exceptionally sunny weather. The Plymouth-based officer was met by his wife Kate and his sons Thomas, three, and James, five. He said: ""It's been quite a long time away and so it's great to come back and see the families on the jetty, which is not something you're used to on a submarine. ""It's been a great day, especially with the nice weather which is not usual for Faslane."" The duchess, wearing a raspberry-coloured coat with a Rothesay tartan collar, boarded HMS Astute briefly before meeting submariners and their families at a reception where she presented awards to the newly-qualified submariners. She told the 300 guests: ""I'm pleased to see everyone back in one piece. I imagine there's lots of making up to do with wives, sons, brothers and family members. ""I'm proud to be sponsor of HMS Astute and pleased to see everyone home."" Commander Jenkins said: ""It was a tremendous honour for my ship's company to be welcomed home by Her Royal Highness and made what was already an auspicious occasion even more special."" The 97-metre long Astute is able to circumnavigate the world without surfacing. Its nuclear technology means it will never require refuelling and the submarine can manufacture its own oxygen from sea water . Meanwhile, Europe's largest military exercise has begun off the coast of Scotland with involvement from 22 ships and submarines. Exercise Joint Warrior happens twice a year and is hosted in the UK. The three Armed Forces and a number of other nations are involved in the exercise to help hone how they all work together. In addition to the large number of warships, more than 50 aircraft and almost 3,500 people are taking part. Military chiefs said the exercise allows UK, Nato and allied units to train together in tactics and skills for use in a ""combined joint task force"". The exercise runs through a range of scenarios, including crisis and conflict situations that could be realistically encountered in operations, such as disputed territory, terrorist activity and piracy. Countries taking part are the UK, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Germany, Lithuania, Belgium, Poland, Estonia and Latvia.","More than 100 submariners  welcomed back to HM Naval Base Clyde at Faslane .

"The son of a First World War soldier has sold his home so he can publish his late father's harrowing memoirs that have recently been unearthed. John Burder has turned the hundreds of pages of text written by Captain Claud Burder into a book after finding a large number of documents hidden in a dusty trunk in the attic. The 72-year-old managed to run off a limited edition of 500 hardback copies of his father's horrifying account of life in the trenches, called 'Hell on Earth', which were mostly given to friends and family. John Burder (pictured) has turned the hundreds of pages of text written by Captain Claud Burder into a book after finding a large number of documents hidden in a dusty trunk in the attic . He sold his home (pictured) in Bournemouth, Dorset so he can publish his late father's harrowing memoirs that have recently been unearthed . But he believes the memoirs ought to be read by a wider audience and after he started getting requests from more people, he approached several publishing companies with no success. Now Mr Burder has sold his detached home in Bournemouth, Dorset, and moved into a bungalow to raise £25,000 to fund the publishing project - including having the book professionally designed. Using the self-publishing house New Generation, he will be printing on demand but is hoping to produce 10,000 copies and wants to supply as many as possible to schools and colleges. 'Hell on Earth' details the grim and bloody experiences Capt Burder endured in the trenches, including seeing a comrade 'blown to pieces' while stood next to him and diving for cover from a shell only to land on the dead body of a comrade. On another occasion he placed himself between two 'sleeping' soldiers in a darkened shelter under bombardment. It was only when dawn broke he realised they had both been killed. It also records the moment his life was saved by his fountain pen which deflected a piece of shrapnel aimed for his heart. Despite completing hundreds of pages, Capt Burder locked the manuscript in a chest and never spoke about the war before his death in 1968 aged 87. His son inherited his family's belongings but didn't get round to opening the trunk until 2009. Captain Claud Burder is pictured with his wife Gabrielle on their wedding day after the war in 1921 . Capt Burder locked the manuscript (pictured) in a chest and never spoke about the war before his death in 1968 aged 87 . He was stunned when he learned of what his father had gone through at the notorious battlegrounds of Ypres and the Somme. Mr Burder, a retired TV producer, said: 'It is the most amazing and horrific account of what the war was like. My father described everything like it was yesterday. 'The book is not the work of a journalist or a historian or a general getting reports from people at the front. It is a verbatim, contemporary account written by a man who was there throughout the entire war. A man who suffered with his men and went through it all and somehow survived it. 'It should be read by any young person who has even the slightest interest in the war because it does show how stupid and futile it was. 'I thought it my duty to try and get my father's story in front of as many people as possible. 'The first run of 500 hardbacks cost me £3,000. I sold them for £16 each and I had a job to break even. 'I decided to sell my home and move to a bungalow so I could afford to print more copies. 'I have spent about £25,000 on the project so far but the object isn't to make money, just to get dad's word out to people who want to listen. 'I am just doing what he can't do himself, it would be totally wrong of me if I didn't.' Capt Burder, an English graduate from Cambridge University, was a vicar before the war broke out in 1914. He tried to join the army as a reverend but, at 32, was told he was too old so enlisted with the Middlesex Regiment as a private. Now Mr Burder has sold his detached home in Bournemouth, Dorset, and moved into a bungalow (pictured) to raise £25,000 to fund the publishing project . In the following four years he rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the Military Medal for leading his men with great gallantry and courage. His war ended in 1918 when he was struck in the head by a piece of shell. A young officer who had been standing next to him was 'blown to pieces' in the explosion. He wrote: 'Nothing whatsoever was left of him, not a single button.' An account of his at the Somme two years earlier reads: 'We passed many dead men, one of whom I remember because he was kneeling on one knee with his rifle still in his two hands as if he had been killed in the act of advancing.' He described Ypres as 'this devastated hell' and of when the Germans shelled their shelter in the trenches. He wrote: 'It was so dark that it was impossible even to see who was next to me but I could feel there was someone on my left, I thought he was asleep. 'As the darkness dwindled...I could see now my campanian and understand his silence. His head had been blown off without otherwise disturbing his position. Using the self-publishing house New Generation, Mr Burder will be printing his book (pictured with the manuscript) on demand but is hoping to produce 10,000 copies and wants to supply as many as possible to schools and colleges . 'On my right a man who was sitting in the same position as my silent companion on the left had his head removed in exactly the same way.' There were one or two light-hearted moments during the conflict. An impromptu game of cricket with a stick and a tennis ball resulted in him smashing the ball through the window of his commanding officer's lodging, prompting him to jump up in panic. And when his company entered the village of Vimy in April 1917 following a ferocious battle a comrade was astonished to hear one of the German prisoners calling out his name. It transpired that before the war the PoW had been a baker in Twickenham. After the war Capt Burder returned to the church and became rector of St Mary's Church in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, and then chaplain at nearby RAF Wyton. He married wife Gabrielle in 1921 and they had three children; George, Mary and John. Tragically, Mary died aged six from whooping cough and George, a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade, was killed crossing the Rhine towards the end of World War Two. He was posthumously awarded the Military Cross, which his father received from King George VI.","John Burder, 72, sold his home in Bournemouth, Dorset to raise £25,000 .

"Philosopher Neil Van Leeuwen states there are two 'beliefs’ - religious and factual - that co-exist because we can form 'secondary cognitive attitudes' Proponents of science and devout disciples of religions around the world regularly clash about their views. But Georgia-based philosopher Neil Van Leeuwen believes it may be possible for seemingly conflicting views to overlap, and for people to believe in aspects of both - so long as we reassess what we mean by the term ‘belief.’ In his latest paper he writes that there are two interpretations of the word 'belief' - one religious and another factual. Professor Van Leeuwan compares the belief in religion with the way our brains handle imaginative play. In his essay ‘Religious credence is not factual belief’, he uses an example describing a situation where a child is playing with a Playdoh cookie. The child knows it is made of Playdoh because it is 'tangible and evident' - they have a factual belief in what it physically is. However, the child can suspend a certain amount of reality to imagine the cookie is real for the purposes and context of the game. Another, more complex example quoted in the paper, is to imagine a statue falling from a boat into the ocean. Professor Van Leeuwen writes that people typically imagine the statue sinking. They do this because factual beliefs form the basis, and supplies missing information, for any outcomes while imagining the scenario. But people asked to imagine the scene don’t factually believe a statue is currently sinking into the sea because if they did, they would alert the authorities and take action to stop it from doing so – even though the scenario is hypothetical. Professor Van Leeuwen describes a situation where a child is playing with Playdough cookies. The child knows it is made of Playdough because it is tangible; they have a factual belief in it. However, they suspend a reality to imagine the cookie is real, for the purposes of the game. This can be applied to relgiion and science . This belief system is reliant on human capacity to generate 'secondary cognitive attitudes', explained the philosopher. Professor Van Leeuwen said imaginative representations, such as religious views, co-exist with a factual belief, such as those held by scientists, or 'thoughts about reality', without being confused with it . Professor Van Leeuwen said this suggests the distinction between the beliefs only works one way – and that there is ‘is an anti-symmetric relation’ between factual belief and imagining, which the philosopher calls cognitive governance. Professor Van Leeuwen believes this is a significant distinction, and it can be applied to religion versus science. With this theory it is possible for the human brain to imagine and hypothesise about religious teachings, while also believing in evolution when looking at evidence to suggest as much.

However, the child can suspend a certain amount of reality to imagine the cookie is real for the purposes and context of the game. Professor Van Leeuwen believes there is a distinction, and it can be similarly applied, in principle, to religion versus science. He states it is possible for the human brain to imagine and hypothesise about religious teachings, while also believing evolution happened when looking at evidence to suggest as much. This is reliant on human capacity to generate ‘secondary cognitive attitudes’ and that imaginative representations co-exist with a layer of factual belief - also known as thoughts about reality - without being confused with it. This, he says, relies on the human ability to generate ‘secondary cognitive attitudes’ and that imaginative representations co-exist with a layer of factual belief without being confused by either. Professor Van Leeuwen, using the example of children again, said that during any pretend play a child has two 'maps' - one representing what he or she takes to be reality and another representing the contents of a fantasy world. ‘She uses the two maps in conjunction, since she must pretend in the physical space of the real world,' continued Professor Van Leeuwen. 'But she does not confuse them, contrary to popular myth. ‘We see a similar structure - two maps - in the relation between religious representations and factual beliefs. ‘There is a corresponding myth to be debunked: quite simply, the myth that the two maps are run together - that there is only one kind of “belief.”’ Addressing concerns that, by looking at belief in this way, causes religion to be linked with fiction, Professor Van Leeuwen wrote: ‘This conclusion is startling, causing us to ask: how can something so serious as religion be rooted in the same capacity that yields something as frivolous as fiction? ‘But the question contains a misguided assumption. 'Humans, in fact, take many fictions incredibly seriously.’","The claims are presented by Georgia-based philosopher Neil Van Leeuwen .

"Robin Williams checked into rehab at an addiction treatment center in Minnesota in the weeks before his apparent suicide. At the time, his representative said, 'After working . back-to-back projects, Robin is simply taking the opportunity to . fine-tune and focus on his continued commitment, of which he remains . extremely proud.' While he was at Hazeldon Addiction Treatment Center, the actor and comedian paid a visit to a Dairy Queen in Linstrom nearby on June 29. Scroll down for video . Maintaining his sobriety: On June 29 Robin Williams was spotted at a Dairy Queen in Minnesota, not far from Hazelden, where he was receiving treatment . Looking very slim, Williams posed for a photograph with server Abby Albers in one of the last pictures of his life. Albers grabbed the opportunity to have her photo taken with Williams, who she said was 'the ONLY famous person' to have ever entered the store. On Facebook where she posted the picture, she described him as 'friendly,' and said he bought a small vanilla cone but refused to speculate among her friends about the reason for his visit. In response to someone's suggestion that Williams was attending rehab at Hazeldon, she said '...if he is it's none of our business.' Williams had often spoken about his problems with drugs and alcohol, and in recent years he admitted he was again struggling. On a recent tour, he even joked about it. 'I went to rehab in wine country,' he said, 'to keep my options open.' Williams told Parade magazine in 2013 that he had relapsed in 2003 after 20 years of sobriety while filming The Big White. 'One day I walked into a store and saw a little bottle of . Jack Daniel’s. And then that voice — I call it the ""lower power' — goes, ""Hey. Just . a taste. Just one."" I drank it, and there was that brief moment of ""Oh, I’m . okay!"" But it escalated so quickly. Within a week I was buying so many bottles . I sounded like a wind chime walking down the street. I knew it was really bad . one Thanksgiving when I was so drunk they had to take me upstairs.' The center: Hazelden is located in Minnesota and their Lodge department specializes in helping patients achieve long-term sobriety . Demanding schedule: Williams, pictured in 2013, had been working nonstop and needed some time for himself, his rep said in June . He described feelings of loneliness and fear that pushed him back towards alcohol at that time. 'I was in a small town where it's not the edge of the . world, but you can see it from there, and then I thought: drinking. I just . thought, hey, maybe drinking will help. Because I felt alone and afraid. It was . that thing of working so much, and going f***, maybe that will help. And it was . the worst thing in the world.' In 2006, his family held an intervention to force him to get help for his addictions. He checked into a Hazeldon center in Oregon and admitted he was an alcoholic. His . rep said at the time, 'After 20 years of sobriety, Robin Williams found . himself drinking again and has decided to take proactive measures to . deal with this for his own well-being and the well-being of his family.' Robin . has admitted to problems with cocaine in the late 1970s and early '80s. The death of his friend, comic John Belushi, is what made him . want to give up drugs. 'Was it a wake-up call?' he said years later. 'Oh . yeah, on a huge level.' Most recently, Williams was reportedly staying at Hazelden's The Lodge, which is known for helping patients maintain long-term sobriety. In 2010, Williams told The Guardian that he was still attending AA meetings weekly. 'Have to,' he said. 'It's good to go. Prolific tweeter: The Oscar-winner shared many thoughts and images on social media, but had remained silent during August. His last tweet was dedicated to his daughter, Zelda, linking to an Instagram picture of her  when she was a baby . A very big career: In May his film The Angriest Man In Brooklyn with Mila Kunis was released . The Chicago native had a manic shooting schedule this year and had been making movies back-to-back before his death. This year alone he appeared in the films Boulevard with Kathy Baker and The Angriest Man In Brooklyn with Mila Kunis. In December he will appear in Merry Friggin' Christmas, about a father who drives all night to collect his son's presents. He also filmed Night At The Museum's Secrets Of The Tomb with Ben Stiller and Rebel Wilson. Williams plays Teddy Roosevelt. The legendary performer had also completed a TV series The Crazy Ones with Sarah Michelle Gellar. Legendary: The comedic genius with Pam Dawber in Mork & Mindy, which aired on TV from 1978 and 1982 . Happier times: This 2009 file photo shows actor Robin Williams and his wife Susan Schneider at the premiere of Old Dogs in Los Angeles . Williams' wife Susan Schneider confirmed the tragic news of his death today and spoke of her ‘profound grief’. 'This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken. 'As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.'

"A Florida animal services director was fired last week after twenty pets were euthanized under her watch in a single day. The local sheriff's office sent Jacqueline Johnston packing October tenth after barely more than a week on the job. When Johnston was hired, she claimed her stance was to resort to euthanasia only in extreme situations, according to WFTV. Shocking: The Lake County, Florida sheriff's office sent Jacqueline Johnston packing October tenth after barely more than a week on the job. In one of her nine days as director of the county's animal services department, twenty pets were euthanized . 'To be fair some were indeed sick or injured but certainly not all,' Sergeant James Vachon of the Lake County Sheriff's Office told the Orlando Sentinel. Vachon said a volunteer blew the whistle on Johnston after 18 or 20 animals were put down in one of Johnston's first nine days on the job. 'Law enforcement, especially, has a healthy respect for animals and what they can contribute, so it's a tough thing to hear,' Vachon said. The county sheriff himself released a statement after Johnston's firing in which he shouldered blame for the startling mishap. 'This decision was made on our watch and we have taken swift action to ensure it does not happen again.' Johnston's brief reign, some say, was a return to maligned former habits of the agency. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the shelter euthanized 710 dogs and 2,896 cats in 2013 after cutting way back from a shocking 2,037 dogs and 4,404 cats they put down in 2009.

"The European Commission has revealed that Ireland could be granting Apple illegal rebates worth billions of dollars which may have to be repaid. If the EU's initial findings are confirmed over the coming months, Apple could face a massive repayment bill because it funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in Ireland, where it benefits from low, negotiated tax deals. In a letter to the Irish government published on Tuesday, the European Commission, which is carrying out an investigation into Apple's overseas tax practices, said the treatment granted to Apple 'constitutes state aid' and therefore raises 'doubts about the compatibility' with EU law. Scroll down for video . Merrion Street: The European Commission has written a letter to the Irish government stating that tax arrangements between the Republic and Apple may not be compatible with EU law . EU rules forbid governments from helping companies to avoid undermining free market competition. The EU first announced the probe in June, also targeting coffee store chain Starbucks and others as part of a crackdown on multinationals exploiting tax loopholes. The EU Commission is now requesting further documents from Ireland before making a legally binding decision on whether the rebate granted to Apple is illegal and must be recouped, wholly or partially. The EU probe focuses on exaggerated transfer pricing, where one part of a company charges another part an inflated price for goods or services to shift profits to low-tax locations. If Apple had to repay some taxes, the money would come as a windfall to Irish state coffers. However, fearful of losing its reputation as a business-friendly country with low corporate taxes, the Irish government is adamant that no EU rules have been breached. The Commission, however, said in the letter that the tax deals struck with Apple in 1991 and in 2007 show 'several inconsistencies' and may not comply with international taxation standards. The Brussels-based executive body also was critical of the fact that Apple's applicable tax rate appears to have been the result of 'a negotiation rather than a pricing methodology' which a 'prudent, independent' tax authority should not have accepted. Irish presence: Apple has a large distribution centre on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Cork . Apple's tax practices have also attracted scrutiny in the United States, where a Senate Committee last year published a scathing report on the Cupertino-based firm's tax schemes. The report held up Apple as an example of legal tax avoidance made possible by the complicated U.S. tax code, estimating the firm avoided at least $3.5 billion (£2.1 million) in U.S. federal taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using its tax strategy. Apple - one the world's most valuable and profitable firms - sat on some $164 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $138 billion stashed away in foreign subsidiaries, according to its latest quarterly report in June. The company estimated its effective U.S. tax rate is 26.1 percent, as opposed to the statutory U.S. rate of 35 percent, primarily because of undistributed foreign earnings. A 'substantial portion' of those foreign earnings was generated by subsidiaries organised in Ireland, Apple said in the regulatory filing, adding that 'such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S'.","European Commission probe criticises Ireland over tax deals with Apple .

"About a dozen protesters were jailed after being arrested during Thursday's protests in Ferguson, and it has some local officials and rights groups questioning if police overreached. A small number of people gathered outside Ferguson police headquarters, the latest of several protests since the Aug. 9 shooting death of Michael Brown by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Protesters want Wilson, who is white, to be charged in the killing of Brown, 18, who was black and unarmed. A grand jury investigation is expected to last into November. Just before midnight, officers began moving toward the protesters, who were chanting, used plastic restraints on their wrists and put them in a van, according to Gabrielle Hanson, who was at the scene while her mother, freelance videographer Mary Moore, shot video. Moore was among those arrested, Hanson was not. Scroll down for video . Protests have been commonplace in Ferguson, Missouri, after the Aug. 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18, by a white cop, Darren Wilson . Demonstrators protest in Ferguson on Aug. 12 in the first few days following Brown's death, which sparked a national debate about police militarization . Rosalind Hagedorn spins her hula hoop while joining protesters in front of the Ferguson police station on Tuesday in Ferguson . The reason for the arrests wasn't immediately clear. Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman from the Ferguson area who was at the protest, said protesters were warned against violence-inciting language, but she didn't know what the protesters said. Other local media reports say the protesters were cited for violating a noise ordinance. A Ferguson police spokesman did not respond to messages seeking comment. The protesters were taken to a jail in neighboring St. Ann, and some were placed on 24-hour hold, Bynes said. Tony Rothert, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union office in St. Louis, said several complaints have been lodged about Thursday's arrests and the ACLU is investigating. 'There do appear to be, if not bogus, at least unnecessary arrests,' said Rothert, who had no details about why the protesters were arrested. He also questioned why they'd be jailed on a 24-hour hold. 'Holding people unnecessarily long, arresting them when it's not necessary — that's an indication of overreach,' Rothert said. 'It certainly appears that the purpose is to discourage people from coming to Ferguson to protest.' Hundreds of people have been arrested during nearly two months of protests in Ferguson, including journalists and clergy members. The Rev. Osagyefo Sekou was arrested Monday after he sat down on the sidewalk with other protesters and was charged with failure to disperse — a misdemeanor that is the most common charge protesters have faced. A grand jury is still hearing testimony to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson (right) should be charged with the Aug. 9 shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18 . Hanson said Moore was shooting video of the arrests when one of the protesters handed her a cellphone. When Moore took it, she was arrested, Hanson said, and officers confiscated her camera. Asked what the protesters were saying or whether they were being noisy, Hanson said, 'They were chanting, ""Show me what democracy looks like.'"" Hanson said the family had received no explanation from police, and that she had not heard from her mother as of Friday morning. 'Nobody really knows what's going on,' she said.

"The family of a girl who was beaten to death in 1985 is trying to stop one of the killers from releasing a memoir that could see her bank thousands. Michelle 'Missy' Avila, 17, was drowned and stabbed by her two best friends Karen Severon and Laura Ann Doyle who left her face down beneath a log in Angeles National Forest, LA. The pair were convicted of murder in 1990 and served 21 years in jail. Profiting? Karen Severson (right, today) has written a book about the day she murdered her friend Michelle 'Missy' Avila (pictured left aged 17 in 1985) before pretending to help the family find the killer for three years . Distraught: Missy's mother Irene Avila  explained her desperate fight to stop Severson earning from her crime . But now, Severson, who has been working as a telemarketer since her release in 2011, is promoting a new memoir about the moment she set up Missy. Severson claims she will donate a portion of the profits to anti-bullying charities in Avila's name - but not all of it because 'I have to live, it's hard to get a job out there'. The move has enraged Missy's family, who are desperately trying to approve 'Missy's Law' in California - which would bar convicts from profiting from their crimes. 'My daughter is dead in the ground and Karen is going to profit out of writing a book about her?

Eventually after a tip-off from a witness, she was arrested and convicted. The book: This is Karen's latest account of the event in 1985 and she is also planning a documentary . It emerged in court that the two girls had drowned Avila face-down in the water, knifed off her hair and ripped out her hoop earrings. It was not until a 2002 parole hearing that Doyle admitted to luring Avila to her death. The 46-year-old murderer claims she will donate a portion of the profits to charity from her forthcoming book and a documentary she plans to make. Nonetheless, Missy's family is enraged. 'We teach our children that crime doesn't pay, but in California it does pay,' said Avila's sister-in-law, Shavaun Avila, who is working with Crime Victims United to craft a new law to withstand constitutional scrutiny. Opening up about her horrific crime, Severson said she killed Missy out of jealousy. 'I pushed her,' she said. 'I was tired. I was frustrated. All this stuff, everything we were accusing her of, she knew she did it, but not one time did she say sorry.'

"A union has slammed train companies after a rail worker took pictures showing tomatoes growing in human excrement on the tracks. The pictures, taken at Rochford on the Liverpool Street to Southend line, appear to show human waste left on the commuter line in Essex. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) called on the Government to ban trains using old-fashioned carriages which flush sewage onto the tracks. Tomatoes were seen growing from human excrement on the on the Liverpool Street to Southend line at Rochford by a rail worker . The union says dumping waste on the track is 'dangerous' and that rail staff are often 'sprayed' with excrement. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: 'It shames Britain's railways that tons of human excrement is being dumped straight on the tracks while the private train companies make huge profits and the Government does nothing. 'Not only does this create filthy and dangerous working conditions for rail staff who are routinely sprayed with this waste but it also shows that the Government are prepared to tolerate this scandal while greedy rail operators make a killing. 'RMT will continue to fight for an end to this disgusting and dangerous practice and it’s the greedy, profiteering train companies who should foot the bill.' The line is used solely by Abellio Greater London trains. A spokesman said: 'A number of our trains already have retention tanks fitted and some additional carriages are going to be upgraded with new toilets and retention tanks. 'We are also looking into the potential options for extending these facilities across the rest of the fleet of trains used on our services in the future.' Earlier this year, great-grandmother Susan Leigh, 64, was forced to ban her young family from playing in her back garden because passing trains kept spraying it with excrement . A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail operators and Network Rail, said: 'The rail industry takes this issue, and feedback from customers and staff, very seriously and understands that it can be very unpleasant for track workers. Most modern trains are built with retention tanks, which hold waste in a septic system until it can be removed at a depot. But older trains, particularly those built before the rail network was privatised in the 1990s, are still running with the older system which sees waste flushed directly from the toilet on to the tracks. Most of the offending trains are rolling stock or high-speed diesel locomotives. Because of their size, it is not always possible to fit the tanks onto trains built in the 1970s and 1980s, however the older models are gradually being phased out. 'Investment in new rolling stock since the mid-1990s means the majority of trains do not have to discharge waste onto tracks, and we continue to find ways to modify older vehicles. 'The minority which do not have toilet tanks fitted will reduce further as new trains are introduced.' Earlier this year, great-grandmother Susan Leigh, 64, was forced to ban her young family from playing in her back garden because passing trains kept spraying it with excrement. Trains using the line between Wrexham and Bidson, on the Wirral, are also too old to have sewage tanks fitted, meaning that waste was dumped on to the track by Mrs Leigh's house. She said at the time: 'It covered my sheets and pillow cases and I had to shut all of the windows. I didn't know where it had come from - I thought it was coming from planes flying overhead. 'I couldn't believe the mess, it was atrocious. 'I've got two great-grandchildren of two and five and I can't let them play in the garden because it is very dangerous.'","Tomatoes pictured growing in human excrement on lines in Rochford, Essex .

"MPs last night backed a symbolic call for Britain to formally recognise the state of Palestine. In a landmark move, MPs voted by 274 to 12 to urge the Government to ‘recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel’. But fewer than half of MPs voted on the backbench motion. And the Government, which abstained, is not bound by the vote. Formal recognition of Palestine as an independent state is opposed by Israel, and several MPs said it should be granted only as part of a wider negotiation. Scroll down for video . A landmark vote last night saw MPs vote 274 to 12 to urge the Government to recognise the state of Palestine . Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood said that although the UK supported a two-state solution to the Middle East crisis, ministers would grant Palestine formal recognition only when the time was right. He said the timing of the move was ‘critical’, adding: ‘You can only play this card once.’ Labour has been thrown into turmoil by the issue in recent days, after Ed Miliband indicated all Labour MPs would have to back the call. But shadow ministers were yesterday told they could stay away from the vote, after some said they were uneasy about backing a unilateral intervention in the troubled Middle East peace process. The Labour leadership also backed an amendment to last night’s Commons motion from former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, which was designed to draw the sting from the debate. It said that recognition of Palestine – which is opposed by Israel – would be only ‘a contribution to securing a negotiated two-state settlement’. Some Labour MPs said they had originally been told that a three-line whip had been placed on last night’s vote, which would have forced frontbenchers who disagreed to quit their posts. A senior Labour source denied this was true and said that although unilateral recognition of Palestine was now Labour policy, MPs who had reservations about the move had been told they could ‘stay away’. An amendment to the motion to clarify it would only be a 'contribution to securing a two-state settlement' with Israel was made by former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw (pictured) and accepted by the Labour leadership . Pro-Palestinian supporters position a giant banner in Parliament Square yesterday prior to last night's vote . Labour’s Grahame Morris, who called the debate, said the ‘small but symbolically important’ step of recognising Palestinian statehood was the only way forward in attempts to secure a peace deal based on a two-state solution. Mr Straw said the vote would send a ‘strong signal’ to Israel that Parliament backed a two-state solution. He said: ‘I support the state of Israel, I would have supported it at the end of the 1940s. ‘But it cannot lie in the mouth of the Israel government of all governments to say that they should have a veto over a state of Palestine when for absolutely certain the Palestinians had no say whatsoever over the establishment of the state of Israel. ‘Today’s debate will, I hope, send a strong signal that the British Parliament stands four-square behind the two-state solution set out in the road map.’ Former Tory foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the vote was ‘premature’ because there were questions surrounding how a Palestinian state could operate in keeping with norms associated with a state. He said efforts by other UN nations to recognise Palestine had had little impact beyond 24 hours of publicity, adding: ‘I simply say there’s a very great risk that we will today make ourselves feel important, our own frustration will lead us to vote for a motion which will not have the desired effect and will perhaps make the problems that have to be addressed in reaching a two-state solution more difficult to realise. ‘Symbolism sometimes has a purpose, it sometimes has a role, but I have to say you do not recognise a state which has not yet got the fundamental ingredients that a state requires if it’s going to carry out its international functions and therefore, at the very least, I would respectfully suggest this motion is premature.’","MPs have voted overwhelmingly to formally recognise Palestine as a state .

"Actor Timothy Spall spent two years studying art to prepare for his role as J.M.W. Turner in a film about the famous artist. And now, the film star's replication of Turner, carried out under the tutorship of London artist Tim Wright, will form part of an exhibition next year. The culmination of his training was a full-size copy of Turner's Snow Storm - Steam-Boat off a Harbour's Mouth Making Signals in Shallow Water, and Going by the Lead from 1842, which will be on show at the exhibition. Scroll down for video . Timothy Spall will play J.M.W.

Tim Wright (pictured) tutored Spall for his role in the biographical film at his studio in Clerkenwell, London . A work painted by Timothy Spall whilst being trained by artist, Tim Wright in preparation for Mr Turner . It will take place at Petworth House, in Sussex, where Turner was regularly a guest and painted in the grounds. It will also feature some of Spall's London landscapes and life drawings. Spall, 57, who played Winston Churchill in the King's Speech, was trained by Mr Wright, who devised a 24-month programme which included a study of the 'basics', before moving on to Turner's style, as well as trips to the Tate Gallery to study the painter's archive. Mr Wright told the Independent: 'I quickly realised he was the sort of person who was going to be responsive and intrigued by the subject. Wright said that though Spall had no real training, he did have an interest in art and was 'obsessed' by Turner . Mr Spall worked tirelessly in order to ensure his portrayal of the artist J.M.W. Turner was as complete as possible. Above, the actor in a scene from the film . 'He had an interest in art as well – no real training but he was certainly interested in Turner, obsessed by Turner.' Wright added: 'There are things that are very difficult but he was very tenacious. He never cut corners and was very diligent – it was quite impressive to see.' Snow Storm was the final project before the shooting of the film and supposedly shows a boat called Ariel struggling in a violent storm at Harwick. Turner, by some accounts, was present at the scene. Spall said: 'You always spend a lot of time working on a character, but preparing for Mr Turner is the most I've ever done' The actor was trained by Mr Wright, who devised a two year programme which included a study of the 'basics', before moving on to Turner's style.

"A creative pet owner has made sure that her dog turns heads when out for a walk by painting her to look like a tiger. Dog groomer Jackie Simmonds transformed pint-sized cavachon, Millie, into the big cat by covering her in orange and black stripes with special dye for pets. The 44-year-old shocked her husband Ian, 47, and their three children, Stephen, 29, Elliott, 16, and Molly, 14, when she unveiled the outrageous look after the two-and-a-half-hour makeover session. Scroll down for video . Roaring success: Dog groomer Jackie Simmonds transformed her cavachon Millie into a tiger with special dye .

Makeover: Millie is almost unrecognisable in this photo taken before her dramatic transformation (left) Local celebrity: The pooch proudly shows off her bold stripes as she poses for a selfie with two local children . Mrs Simmonds, from Burntwood, Staffordshire, said her family didn't know what to make of their pet's new look when it was debuted last week. And her creative grooming has proved a hit with neighbours, who stop and ask to take photos with Millie when they see her on the street. But the RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'. A spokesman said: 'There is the potential for the dye or paint to be toxic and harm the animals. 'Although some substances may be labelled as being suitable for human consumption, this does not mean that these substances would therefore be suitable for animals. 'There are many things which humans can eat and drink which are not safe for animals.' Mrs Simmonds said: 'I thought I'd try and get into creative grooming and give the family a surprise - who doesn't like tigers? 'My husband looked at me like I was mad and the kids were a bit embarrassed but once they've all seen the reaction she's getting I think they have changed their tune. 'I spent about two and a half hours in total using special dye that you can buy from groomers online for about £7.50. 'Its a trend that's big in the USA and Asia but I think it will finally take off in Britain soon as well. Is that you?

Striking stripes: Millie's new look has attracted plenty of attention from shop owners and neighbours . 'I can't say she's very ferocious looking though she's as soft as anything. She looks like a baby Tigger from Winnie the Pooh. 'When we went up town everybody wanted selfies, from shop owners to the tattoo parlour guys.

"Alex Salmond will tomorrow face one of the biggest tests of his political career as he prepares for a TV showdown that he must win to have any hope of referendum victory. The First Minister is under intense pressure going into the STV debate, with a new poll revealing that only a quarter of No voters expect Mr Darling to win the contest. Failure to land a killer blow could end Mr Salmond's hopes of splitting the United Kingdom, and he is receiving help from taxpayer-funded civil servants and a lifestyle guru in a last throw of the dice before the referendum. Scroll down for video . First Minister Alex Salmond will go head-to-head with former Chancellor Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign against independence . Campaign leaders in both camps are taking the two-hour TV programme very seriously, right down to the colour of tie the two politicians should wear, and the broadcaster is hoping for an audience in seven figures. However, experts have warned such programmes rarely reshape the political landscape. As an uneasy truce for the Commonwealth Games comes to an end, there will now be open warfare between both sides for the final few weeks of the referendum battle, with families set to be bombarded by mailshots costing taxpayers more than £850,000. Time is running out for the SNP, with a new poll for The Scottish Mail on Sunday showing Unionist campaign's lead has increased slightly in recent days. The findings are a massive humiliation for Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who used a Sunday newspaper interview yesterday to claim that Scotland's stunning success in the Commonwealth Games could give the Yes campaign the 'momentum' to win the referendum. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg last night accused her of 'sullying' the Games. A fan waved a St George's flag during last night's closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games . AT a Commonwealth Games dominated by the 'photobomb', Alex Salmond should have been on high alert. An England fan mocked the First Minister of Scotland by waving the St George's Cross behind his head as he watched Tom Daley compete in the diving. It was a lighthearted reference to Mr Salmond's stunt last year, when he waved the Saltire behind David Cameron's head at the Wimbledon finals. The prank comes just six weeks before the Scottish independence referendum. Alex Salmond waved the Saltire behind David Cameron at Wimbledon last year . In fact, only 12 per cent of those surveyed said Glasgow 2014 had made them more inclined to vote Yes, but four-fifths of that number said they were planning to vote for independence in the first place. The Survation study found more than 80 per cent said the Games have made no difference to how they would vote and 7 per cent said it would make them more inclined to vote No. Overall, the poll shows that 40 per cent of Scots plan to vote Yes - down one point since last month - with no change for the level of support for No at 46 per cent. The poll also found that only 11 per cent of voters expect Mr Darling to win tomorrow's TV debate, with 37 per cent backing Mr Salmond. Among Yes voters, 69 per cent said they backed the First Minister, while just 24 per cent of No supporters said they believe Mr Darling will emerge victorious. Alan Schroeder, associate professor at Northeastern University School of Journalism in Boston and author of Presidential Debates, said: 'While debates make great political theatre, they don't necessarily have the power to reshape the political landscape. 'Whatever happens on Tuesday, there is too much at stake for Scots voters to let two hours of televised combat determine their future.' Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University said: 'It's clearly true the Yes side need it to make a difference. 'All Alistair Darling, frankly, needs to do is try and hang on to what he's got. I would say to him, play to type and make this as boring as possible.' It is understood Mr Salmond has preparing for the debate for around a week, enlisting the help of Claire Howell, a psychologist more used to dealing with Premiership football teams. Asked if taxpayer-funded civil servants have been involved in the preparation, a spokesman for the Scottish Government said: 'This is a standard media event. Alex Salmond was invited as First Minister and has the normal office support.' Better Together campaign director Blair McDougall said: 'The pressure is on the First Minister to finally give people honest answers to fundamental questions when he debates with Alistair Darling. 'The Commonwealth Games had nothing to do with the referendum.' Miss Sturgeon said: 'I do think the momentum is with us. I think [the Games] will inevitably leave a feelgood factor.' But speaking during a visit to Edinburgh, Mr Clegg said: 'I think it was very gauche of Nicola Sturgeon to try and extract political advantage from the Commonwealth Games. 'The Commonwealth Games is a wonderful festival and it really shouldn't be distorted or sullied by the politics of the SNP.' Mr Salmond responded: 'Nick Clegg describing anybody else as gauche - that must be one of the quotes of the year. 'I'm not really annoyed by this. My self-denying ordinance and Nicola's ends tomorrow and then there's time enough to take on Nick Clegg or anyone else.'","First Minister to go head-to-head with former Chancellor tomorrow night .

"Roman Suru, 40, from West Bromwich, allegedly staged a sham gay wedding to help an illegal immigrant secure UK citizenship . Two migrants plotted a sham gay marriage at Gretna Green while one of them was living with a woman, a court heard. Father-of-two Ramon Suru, 40, from Slovakia, is accused of setting up the bogus ceremony with Gurmail Joshan after meeting the Indian national in a pub. A court heard the two men became friends and hatched the plot because Joshan had been in the UK illegally after overstaying a student visa. Divorced Suru had even arranged for the girlfriend he was living with, fellow Slovak Marianna Bartkova, 40, to attend the fake ceremony as a witness. But the marriage was halted when immigration and police officers swooped on Gretna Green Register Office in June last year as the men prepared to tie the knot, prosecutor Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said. The police had been alerted after a registrar had raised ‘question marks’ about the legitimacy of the relationship when the pair submitted details of the planned ceremony, the jury was told. Suru and Bartkova - who were living together at the time - have now gone on trial accused of conspiring with Joshan to facilitate a breach in immigration law. The court heard Joshan and Suru began hatching the plan after meeting at The Goose pub in West Bromwich, West Midlands, in November 2012. Joshan had already booked three different services at West Bromwich Register Office between January and April last year - but never turned up. Elisabeth Bussey-Jones, prosecuting, said the sham marriage was stopped  as the men prepared to tie the knot. She said: 'The registrar had raised question marks about the legitimacy of the relationship when the pair officially registered details of the planned ceremony.' She added: 'Illegal immigrants can apply to stay as a citizen of the UK if they marry nationals from EU countries, such as Slovakia, who are living here.' Jurors have not yet been told from where Joshan hails. Detective Sergeant Andy Carter, who was involved in the swoop in Gretna Green, gave evidence on the first day of the trial. He said the two men, Bartkova and another Czech woman - who was also expected to be a witness of the ceremony - had travelled from the West Midlands to Scotland in a black Audi A6 for the planned civil ceremony. The plan was foiled when by immigration and police officers, after the registrar at the registry officer in Gretna Green raised concerns about the legitimacy of the relationship, Wolverhampton Crown Court . Suru and Bartkova, from West Bromwich, deny the charge, which is alleged to have occurred between November 9, 2012 and June 29, 2013. The trial continues at Wolverhampton Crown Court (pictured) The officer said Bartkova was found in possession of an envelope containing £1,000, along with a debit card of Joshan's. A non-British person who marries someone either from the UK, or someone who is exercising 'free movement rights' in the UK from a European Economic Area (EEA) member state, can stay in the UK for up to five years. After that, the spouse or civil partner may be eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK. Under Brussels rules, they can then apply for permission to bring in their extended family. The court heard Suru had arrived in Britain ten years ago. After splitting from his wife, he set up home in August 2012 with fellow Slovakian Bartkova, also a divorcee, in a one bedroom flat. The court was also told Bartkova had described Suru as her partner in unrelated dealings with the police. She later insisted that they slept separately and were just friends. Suru and Bartkova, from West Bromwich, deny the charge, which is alleged to have occurred between November 9, 2012 and June 29, 2013. The trial is being heard in Bartkova's absence. Joshan, also from West Bromwich, has already admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach in immigration law. The trial  continues.

"Carer Agneskia Sztokmanska, 45, was convicted of neglect at Salisbury Crown Court after leaving her patients  feeling 'scared, angry and helpless' A senior carer who threw shoes at elderly dementia patients and dragged one across the floor by the hair has been convicted of neglect. Agneskia Sztokmanska, 45, called her vulnerable patients 'monsters' and left them feeling 'scared, angry and helpless' during her reign of terror at Milford Manor in Salisbury, Wiltshire. She was convicted of ill treatment or wilfully neglecting a person who lacks mental capacity yesterday at Salisbury Crown Court and could face jail. The 45-year-old carer was investigated when a staff member drew attention to two 'small marks' on the face of a resident. She denied seven counts of ill treatment, but was convicted of five, including throwing four or five shoes at one resident's chest to get him to sit down. A witness said she told all residents - many of whom would wander around at night - to be in bed at 10pm so she could 'relax on the sofa' in the lounge. Sztokmanska worked at Milford Manor care home from 2010 to 2013, becoming a senior carer in 2012. Prosecutor Sharon Douglass said: 'Agneskia Sztokmanska was supposed to care for her patients, who she knew were vulnerable and dependant due to the fact that they suffered from dementia. 'She had been a senior carer at Milford Manor Care Home for three years and would have received the necessary training and therefore knew that the way she was treating her patients was wrong and cruel. 'Other carers at the care home raised the alarm when they noticed bruises on some of the patients and witnessed the defendant throwing her shoe on four occasions to the chest of one of her patients to make him sit down. 'Other colleagues also noticed how she used derogatory terms to describe the patients such as 'monsters' and 'idiots'. 'We would like to thank all the carers who gave evidence at the trial and who helped us to secure this conviction. Sztokmanska worked at Milford Manor care home from 2010 to 2013, becoming a senior carer in 2012 . 'This prosecution sends a strong message to those who abuse vulnerable people who lack mental capacity believing they will not be caught. 'Our thoughts go to the victims in this case, some of whom have since died, and their families, who had to deal with the knowledge that their loved ones had been mistreated in this way. 'The Crown Prosecution Service and the Police take these offences very seriously and the CPS will prosecute vigorously these cases when it has sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest.' Sztokmanska will be sentenced at Swindon Crown Court on Friday October 24.

There it all was: incorrect decisions, revealed close up with replays, slow motion with HD quality and booed widely around the stadium. The new, almost shadow-free floodlights cast further light on other mistakes by the referee. When is a try not a try? When it’s shown on scoreboards that look as big as cinema screens for everyone else to see what the referee has missed. In football, they aren’t allowed to expose contentious decisions inside the stadium for fear of increasing pressure on the referee or starting a riot of idiots. The new giant screens at Twickenham were used for the first time during England's defeat by New Zealand . The screens - each measuring 169sq metres - were hung from the roof behind both posts . Replays on the big screen cast doubt on Aaron Cruden's try - which was awarded by referee Nigel Owens . The newly installed flood lights at Twickenham are shadow-free and put the spotlight on the referee . Inside Twickenham, they have a different class of audience and so they showed those moments again and again to a cascade of boos, although the chap from the Sunday Times wrote that official Nigel Owens had ‘an excellent’ game in his report. I guess he had the advantage of seeing all of the game and didn’t have to queue for his refreshments. I missed three minutes at the of the first first half to try to get ahead of the stampede, the entire half time and another five minutes of the second half before I was served. A total of 23 minutes for two pints of Guinness, costing £6 each (in a 'fan cup'). Enough time for a Scandinavian chap in the queue to remark: ‘We could have gone to Dublin and got this quicker.’ England got off to the best possible start when Jonny May ran in to score his first international try .

The 50-year-old was accompanied by his brother Jo, MP for Orpington; sister Rachel, a columnist for the Mail on Sunday; mother Charlotte, a painter; and father Stanley, a former MEP, for the event.

Relatively speaking: Mr Johnson's father Stanley (left) is a former MEP, his sister Rachel (second left) is a columnist for the Mail on Sunday, and his brother Jo (right) is MP for Orpington . Mum: Mr Johnson was also seen with his mother Charlotte (left), who divorced his father when he was a child . Descendants: Members of the Churchill family were there, including his great-grandsons Randolph Churchill (left) and Jack Spencer-Churchill (far right), and great-granddaughter Jennie Churchill Repard (second right) Conservative politicians: Mayor of London Mr Johnson puts his arm around Chancellor George Osborne (right) Members of the Churchill family were also at the event, including his great-grandsons Randolph Churchill and Jack Spencer-Churchill, and great-granddaughter Jennie Churchill Repard. Also in attendance were Chancellor George Osborne, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, radio host Nick Ferrari, magazine editor Emma Soames and designer Thomas Heatherwick. Mr Johnson wrote the book to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime prime minister’s death next January. He said: ‘The point of the Churchill Factor is that one man can make all the difference.’ The book - which took the author more than a year to research - claims Churchill's bravery in leading Britain during the Second World War may have been down to him suffering 'short man syndrome'. Launch: Mr Johnson wrote the book to mark the 50th anniversary of the wartime prime minister’s death . Posed: In attendance were magazine editor Emma Soames (left) and designer Thomas Heatherwick (right) Leaving his mark: Mr Johnson signs a copy of his new book as he stands next to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin (left), and Mr McLoughlin's son James (right), who works for the Institute of Directors . Leaving by bicycle: Oxford graduate Mr Johnson is now the prospective MP for Uxbridge in west London . Mr Johnson says that with Churchill standing at just 5ft 6in tall, there is evidence to suggest he was driven to succeed to prove a point to bigger bullies at school, who teased him for his height. So-called 'short man syndrome' has been described by scientists where short men overcompensate for their lack of height through acts of aggression. In the book he also explains how Churchill's early life as a pupil at the prestigious Harrow School may have led him to show he was made of stern stuff after being bullied for being a 'runt'. Last week Mr Johnson claimed he suffers from extremely poor eyesight and can barely see anything around the house without his glasses on. Oxford University graduate Mr Johnson is now the prospective MP for Uxbridge in west London.

"American children aren't the fattest in the world any longer - that distinction belongs to Greece and Italy. A new report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks kids in the United States fifth - after the two Mediterranean countries, New Zealand and Slovenia. About 30percent of American children age 5 to 17 are overweight or obese, compared with 44percent of boys and 38percent of girls in Greece. In Italy, the rate is 36percent for boys and 34percent for girls. Greece in the lead: The United States has the fourth-most obese children in the world - not the first - according to a new OECD report . The United States is still well ahead of the pack in terms of childhood obesity. The average rate for the 34 nations in the OECD is 23percent for boys and 21percent for girls. England is below-average for boys, 22percent, but above average for girls, 26percent. The new OECD report blames the rise in childhood obesity in Italy, Greece and Slovenia Europe's financial crisis. All three nations were forced to reign in government spending - which led household budgets to fall. With less money for groceries, families opted for less healthy foods - more pre-packaged meals and fewer fruits and vegetables. During the 2008-2009 economic downturn, families in Britain, for example, decreased their food spending by 8.5percent, which increased their caloric intake by 4.5percent - adding more sugars and saturated fat to their diets. Still the biggest of the bunch: The USA still has the highest obesity rate in the world - though the rate has stopped increasing in recent years . For overall obesity rates, however, Americans are still the biggest of the bunch. In 2012, 35percent of US citizens were obese - nearly twice the OECD average of 18.4percent. The United Kingdom came in eighth with 24.7percent. The adult obesity rates for Greece and Italy are much lower - 19.6percent and 10.4percent, respectively. Overall, obesity rates in the U.S. has stopped growing in recent years, a small consolation for the fattest country in the world. Between 2008 and 2012, the obesity rate actually decreased slightly after skyrocketing since the 1970s.","Children in the United Sates are the fourth-fattest in the world, with a rate of 30percent .

"Pierluigi Collina had spent the best part of half an hour happily explaining why additional referees are the best way of eradicating mistakes in the penalty area when I asked him why FIFA had not bought into his ideas. It is a curious situation for football at the very highest level, after all; the fact that two extra officials will be present at Champions League matches and at a European Championship but are nowhere to be seen come the World Cup. It's as if they are ignoring one of the finest referees football has ever seen. Someone surely worth listening to in his role as UEFA's refereeing chief. 'Politics?' I asked Collina, my inference being that common sense has lost out to the apparent power struggle between Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini over the use of goal-line technology. For the first time the otherwise ebullient Collina fell silent. Mark Clattenburg gestures during Tottenham's Capital One Cup win against Brighton at White Hart Lane . Clattenburg was punished after going to see popstar Ed Sheeran (left), pictured with Wayne Rooney . Football is a fiercely political arena and refereeing doesn't appear to be immune to the kind of nonsense that can actually hinder progress. There is a lack of unity, a lack of consistency, and a sense that the game is suffering as a result. The last week or so has been less than positive for English refereeing, and not just because two of the three finest officials in the country have been exposed for breaking professional refereeing protocol. Pierluigi Collina wants extra refs behind each goal . Mark Clattenburg was left off the list last weekend as a result of his Ed Sheeran concert controversy, on what proved to be a weekend when the Premier League could have seriously done with him. Michael Oliver, it has now emerged, has also been guilty of breaking protocol this season, by giving his girlfriend a lift in an official vehicle. Unlike Clattenburg, Oliver does not appear to have been punished. Nobody representing the Professional Game Match Officials is prepared to tell us why. But Oliver was among those guilty of making some fairly high profile mistakes at the weekend and prompting the former English referees chief to launch what read like a serious attack on his successor. Keith Hackett now gives his views on the internet and his last blog would not have been well received by PGMOL chief Mike Riley when it was so critical of his 17 top level referees and their working practices. 'Sadly another weekend of fixtures has witnessed our group of professional referees producing less than acceptable performances,' wrote Hackett. Hackett's damning indictment continued with a claim that England's leading referees are not fit enough and at this moment are employing 'an inconsistent approach to decision making'. He also demanded more of Howard Webb, the former World Cup final referee who does seem to have remained very much in the background since joining Riley to become the PGMOL technical director. The PGMOL would refute Hackett's claims, and they would do so supported by what they would argue are hard facts. They could point to the results of physical tests that reveal the fitness of our professional referees has improved year on year in the five years since Riley took over. They might also wish to remind Hackett that England is one of only three countries in Europe to boast three elite FIFA referees; namely Clattenburg, Oliver and Martin Atkinson. When it came to selecting a referee to take charge of what UEFA probably suspected could be an explosive encounter between Serbia and Albania, it was to the experienced Atkinson that they turned. Last weekend's games might not have been the finest advert for English officiating but the PGMOL could quote statistics from last season claiming clear signs of improvement. Keith Hackett has criticised the performance and fitness of English referees in his online blog . Mike Riley (left) has overseen an improvement in fitness and performances over the last five years . The accuracy on major decisions – fouls, penalties, cards and so on – rose to 95 per cent last season from 94.1 per cent the previous year. Accuracy in the penalty box has risen to 98 per cent, while offside decisions rose to 99 per cent when they stood at 92 per cent when Riley took charge. Seasoned, expert observers outside the PGMOL would agree that Hackett is probably wrong; that fitness is not the concern. But they would say that English football needs more referees like Clattenburg on the pitch rather than in the sin bin. What Clattenburg does, say the experts, is put in the hard yards that might avoid some of the problems we are seeing this season, and is makes a fair bit of sense. Clattenburg does not play it safe. He runs wide when it would be easier to run down the middle of the pitch – and so stay closer to the action - and he does so for one simple reason. Because by running wide he gives himself a better angle of vision to see what is actually going on in the penalty area when a referee running just behind the players is more likely to have his view obscured; something we saw this weekend in the case of Oliver and Phil Dowd on Monday night. Michael Oliver, pictured sending off Chris Smalling, ignored three Manchester City penalty appeals on Sunday . Clattenburg runs wide during games to give himself the best possible view of the action as it unfolds . Such an approach does come with certain risks if you are being assessed and your livelihood depends on good reports backed up by statistical analysis. For a start a referee might struggle to argue they got it wrong – or failed to act at all - because their view was obscured. But Clattenburg is so highly rated by his peers because he gets himself in the position to make a call. He didn't have the wit to flag up his desire to go to a concert when it would have been easy for the PGMOL to move him off West Brom versus Crystal Palace, and that might lose him friends. But he's a damn fine referee who needs to avoid getting himself left off the list. This might be closer to the point Hackett is making when he complains of an inconsistent approach to decision making. Maybe he sees referees playing it safe and not enough officials like Clattenburg. Maybe he sees different methods being applied by referees working under the same leadership at PGMOL. The PGMOL would refute that too. But at a time when FIFA and UEFA can't even agree on how best to referee the penalty area, raising the concern that there is an alarming lack of consistency seems perfectly reasonable.","Mark Clattenburg was punished after going to see an Ed Sheeran concert .

"Robin Williams fans in Australia have expressed their outrage after Foxtel neglected to show their favourite films by the late actor during a day-long tribute. The broadcaster made their Foxtel Movies channel available to all customers on Sunday for a Williams movie marathon after his death on August 11 but left off his biggest flicks like Mrs Doubtfire. Viewers took to social media to complain after Foxtel posted that they would be showing The Big White, Cadillac Man, Man Of The Year, Death To Smoochy, RV and Patch Adams instead of his better known films. 'No Mrs Doubtfire, Seriously?,' Matthew Drummey wrote on Facebook. Scroll down for video . 'No Mrs Doubtfire?!': Robin Williams' fans were not impressed with Foxtel's selection of films during a day-long tribute . 'Probably chose some of his worst movies,' William Bragg said. And Carrie Betwistle replied: 'I was hoping to see Mrs Doubtfire or Hook heck even Aladdin!'. Erin Taylor asked: 'Why choose some of his worst? Why not remember this amazing man from his best movies Mrs Doubtfire, Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting and Good Morning Vietnam... shame on you Foxtel!' The Foxtel selection missed out one of Williams' most critcally acclaimed films - Good Will Hunting, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor alongside Matt Damon. Missing hits: Some of Robin Williams most famous films were missing from Foxtel's scheduled tribute on Sunday . Listings: Foxtel said they would celebrate the life of Robin Williams with a special marathon showing films such as Death to Smoochy . 'Some of his worst': Viewers complained that Williams' hits like Aladdin weren't being shown . 'Rubbish effort': One Twitter used said Foxtel had 'disappointed' her . There was also no sign of Disney favourite Aladdin, where Williams' played the lovable blue-bottled Genie. However, viewers seemed most disappointed that they couldn't rewatch Williams in his iconic 1993 role of Mrs Doubtfire . Others pointed out that the comedy had been shown on Channel 10 earlier in the week. Channel 10 showed the flick on the night of Williams' death and 891,000 viewers tuned in to watch it. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Foxtel for comment. After Williams' untimely death his former Mrs Doubtfire co-stars paid tribute to him. Child star Mara Wilson, who played Williams' daughter Natalie in the film, wrote on her blog: 'When I heard about Robin’s death, I was shocked, confused angry, regretful, and above all, sad.' Foxtel showed one of Williams' less successful films Death to Smoochy, a 2002 black comedy film directed by and starring Danny DeVito . 'Poor choice': Jam Marie said Death To Smoochy was a bad film to show after Williams died . 'While Robin and I had not talked in a few years, there is no question he had a great impact on my life. He was as warm and talented as everyone says, and a joy to be around. It’s as if my favourite teacher died,' she added. Sally Field, who played Williams' wife in the film, said in a statement: 'I feel stunned and so sad about Robin. I'm sad for the world of comedy. And so very sad for his family. And I'm sad for Robin. 'He always lit up when he was able to make people laugh, and he made them laugh his whole life long... tirelessly. He was one of a kind. There will not be another. Please God, let him now rest in peace.' Co-star Pierce Brosnan also paid tribute to the late actor: 'Dear Robin... you made me laugh like no other... You bedazzled the world with your brilliant genius. Mrs Doubtfire and you will forever be in my heart, and the memory of you good man, shall remain constant through out my days. 'It was a joy to work with you on a film that will be passed on from generation to generation. And to your loving family I extend my deepest heartfelt sympathies and prayers. Peace be with you.'","Foxtel had a Robin Williams movie marathon on Sunday .

"A former Premier League footballer tested positive for cocaine, yet only received a two month suspension, it was revealed tonight. In a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, ex-Birmingham City striker Gary O’Connor was revealed to have tested positive for the drug during the 2009/10 season. The programme also unveiled a cover up by both the club and the FA after former manager Alex Mcleish said that the striker was out injured. Positive test: Former Birmingham City footballer Gary O'Connor was found to have taken cocaine in 2009, but was banned for just two months . Mcleish said that he had had a reaction to an operation the previous year so would miss three or four months of action. Neither O’Connor, Mcleish or Birmingham City would comment on the allegations. The programme, who obtained a secret document, also named several players as having tested positive over the past eight years. They included Elvis Hammond, a former Fulham player who now plays for a lower league club, who tested positive in September 2003. He was banned for six months. Banned: Elvis Hammond was given a six-month suspension after he was found to have taken cocaine in September 2003 . The programme also named Rochdale player Lee Thorpe, while specifying that unnamed players from Everton, Nottingham Forest and Tranmere have also tested positive. The investigation also uncovered widespread discrepancies in the bans given to players who had been found with the drug in their system. It found that footballer’s ban was dependent on when the offence occurred; with Roman Bednar of  West Bromwich receiving a three month ban as he was not caught on a match day. However Shaun Newton, a West Ham player, who was caught following a game, received just seven months. In many other sports he would have received a two year ban. Dispatches found that the UK anti-doping agency have caught up to 43 professional footballers using cocaine, ecstasy or cannabis in out-of-competition testing. The programme also discussed 240 ‘abandoned’ tests between April 2007 and August 2010. This is when testers arrive at training grounds to discover that the players targeted were not there. It found that Portsmouth had been involved in eight abandoned tests, while Swansea were involved in 15 and Scunthorpe 12. The FA has said it will wait until the programme has finished until responding but it is understood officials were disappointed because they consider their testing to be more extensive . than in any other sport in the country. In . a statement to Dispatches, the FA said: ‘The FA operates a . comprehensive anti-doping programme which is the largest of any sport in . the UK. The FA go beyond the WADA Code by proactively testing all . samples for social drugs, irrespective of whether the tests are . conducted in or out of competition.’ Exposé: The document revealed that  43 professional footballers have been caught using cocaine, ecstasy or cannabis in out-of-competition testing . Football . pays for more than 60 per cent of tests on athletes in the UK, and . their policy of protecting the identity of players who fail . out-of-competition tests for recreational drugs is not in breach of any . World Anti-Doping Agency regulations. WADA don’t even demand that . athletes are tested out of competition for recreational drugs. Those . who fail tests for these sorts of drugs in competition are named by the . FA. But the policy of protecting those exposed this evening - the FA . consider it better to treat and educate them privately - is questioned . by the head of WADA, David Howman. Asked . whether the FA should disclose how many players are tested or how many . tests take place, he replied: ‘The answer to that is why not? If you . don’t then you are susceptible to an allegation that you’re hiding . something. ‘They’re . saying they haven’t got a doping problem because there are not many . positive tests. I think the answer to that is: don’t we need to conduct . better research to see what the prevalence of doping is? Until we are . satisfied by the use of all the gathering of evidence I don’t think . we’re in a position to say (there is not a drug problem in English . football).’","Failed drug tests were never made public by FA .
FA will wait to see programme before responding ."
"Autopsies have helped identify 63-year-old twin brothers who were found dead last weekend in their Chattanooga home. But the medical examiner still hasn't been able to resolve the mystery of what happened to the brothers and how their bodies could have remained in the home for about three years without anyone noticing. Police found the skeletal remains of Andrew and Anthony Johnson sitting in their recliners in a living room in their home Saturday. The conditions of the bodies suggested that both men had been dead since 2011. After the autopsies, investigators still believe the brothers have been dead for about three years. Home: The badly decomposed bodies of two identical twins Andrew and Anthony Johnson, 63, were found sitting in recliners in their living room in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Saturday . There were no signs of trauma or anything to indicate the two were victims of homicide, but investigators are waiting for the results of toxicology tests to come back, Chattanooga Police Sgt. Wayne Jefferson said. 'Right now there is nothing to indicate that they died of anything outside of natural causes,' Jefferson said. He cautioned that results of blood tests that come in later could tell a different story. The neighbors, according to police, had no idea anything was wrong because there was no odor coming out of the house and the brothers lived like hermits and had little contact with family or anyone else. Jefferson said he believed that somebody continued to mow the brothers' lawn all those years. Police had actually gone to the Acorn Street home back in 2011 after family members became concerned because they hadn't seen the brothers. The house, according to police, appeared to be vacant, and a note inside the mailbox indicated that mail delivery had stopped because the postal service thought the Johnson brothers had moved. Tragic: The men were hermits who rarely spoke with family or neighbors . At the time, police said, there were no signs of anything but a vacant home, so officers did not force their way inside the home. Also, police said a relative said in 2011 that it would be unsurprising if the twins moved without telling anyone in the family. Family members who had a key to the . home called police on Saturday and asked officers to go inside and check . the house. Police discovered the bodies after getting permission to . open the door. Investigators . say there was no indication that the brothers suffered from mental . illness. Both had valid driver's licenses, insurance, owned vehicles and . even had records of having owned at least one business in the past. The . two reportedly suffered from diabetes. Chattanooga police say officers who . checked the outside of the home in 2011 followed normal procedure . because investigators didn't have indication that anything was wrong or . evidence that would justify them forcing their way into the house. Investigators have established the date of death based on the time stamp found on a receipt near unused cans of Coke. The . discovery has shocked neighbors who didn't think anything was wrong . because the grass was regularly cut and the mailbox wasn't overflowing. Finally found: On Saturday, family members called police after finding a key to the residence and officers found the deceased men inside . The twins were known to live a hermit lifestyle and did not communicate regularly either with family or anyone else, reports WRCB. A sister of the twins had tried to check on them in August 2011, but didn't have a key. She had called police and they found that the residence appeared to be vacant. A letter from the Post Office was found in the mailbox stating that they believed the residence to be vacant and to cease delivery of mail to the address. Officers also discovered in 2011 that there were no signs of forced entry to the residence, no foul odors, no signs of foul play or suspicious activity, and no visible/evident reason to allow forced entry to the residence. At that time, family members indicated that they would not have been surprised if the brothers had moved without telling anyone. On Saturday, family members called police after finding a key to the residence. Officers were given the key and found the men deceased inside the residence. The twins' family has declined to comment.

Robin Williams, 63, who took this photo with a member of staff at a Dairy Queen in Lindstrom, Minnesota, was receiving treatment at the nearby Hazelton rehabilitation centre when he met Teresa Cohen, 32 (not pictured) She told The Sunday Express: 'Even though he would goof around from time to time, just like he did on screen, there were many other occasions where his face reflected deep depression and unhappiness. 'He said he was weary to his bones and didn't believe he could really relax for a moment. Miss Cohen, who has separated from her husband, said that at one point the comedian told her: 'When I go, I want it to be quick and I want to be clean and sober. I don't want to die the slow agonising death of an addict who makes everyone around him suffer.' Miss Cohen described how the star burst into tears when he opened up about his fears of relapsing and returning to drink . She also described how he burst into tears, fearing that he would relapse and return to drink when he left the centre .

"Denise Van Outen will cycle 250 miles across Vietnam and Cambodia in January . She was one of the original ladettes, but now Denise Van Outen is a poster girl for charity sporting challenges. The former Big Breakfast presenter has signed up for an epic eight-day 250-mile cycle ride across Vietnam and Cambodia in January to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital. It’s just the latest in a string of hard slogs. Denise has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and trekked the Great Wall of China, and in 2012 completed a 180-mile cycle ride across India to help the hospital. She will be accompanied on the latest challenge by TV friends Lydia Bright from The Only Way Is Essex and Zoe Hardman from Take Me Out, and their publicist friend Kirsty Williams. The friends are putting the training hours in on country roads – often around Essex – most weekends, and taking indoor spinning classes. They’ve also been experimenting with foods to eat on the bike, such as flapjacks and energy bars. As a result Denise, who recently turned 40, says she is now fitter than she was in her 20s. The former Big Breakfast presenter trekked up Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, for Comic Relief in 2009 . Drinking in moderation does not cause a beer belly . Refreshing news for beer lovers – drinking in moderation does not lead to a beer belly. In a study, more than 2,000 participants were given a ‘food frequency’ questionnaire and asked to list their intake of foods and beverages in an average week. The researchers also measured their waist and hips and found that there was no significant correlation between moderate intake of beer (just over a pint a day for men or half a pint for women) and higher waist circumference. ‘The conclusion is that beer seems to play no role in the so-called beer belly,’ says Dr Corina Zugravu of Bucharest University, where the study was carried out. ‘It may just be a scapegoat for men who put on weight, which is often due to eating fatty foods and low exercise levels.’ The World Health Organisation recommends a waist circumference under 37in for men and 31in for women. Poor oral hygiene could be a sign of infertility in men. Researchers measured the mouth hygiene of 76 men, 50 of whom had low sperm counts. They found that 80 per cent of the 50 also had poor oral health. The men with good oral hygiene were more likely to have a normal sperm count. The team of dentists and fertility experts, writing in the Journal Of Contemporary Dental Practice, say it is evidence of the wider physiological effects of oral hygiene. Other research has suggested that gum disease in pregnant women could be a risk factor for premature birth and low birth weight.

"Jailed: Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck cycling postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, California, on June 26 last year . The daughter of a LAPD sergeant who attempted to cover up a fatal hit-and run by reporting the car stolen has been jailed for two years. Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, near Vermont Avenue, in Gardena, California, on the night of June 26 last year. Mr Dotson, 60, who had been riding his bicycle, was taken to hospital but died of his injuries three days later. Yanez, who admitted she had been drinking before the collision, failed to stop and told Huntington Park Police Department the next morning that her vehicle had been stolen. But a police officer had seen news reports of the collision and notified Gardena police about Yanez’s possible connection, the Los Angeles Times reports. Yanez’s car was found with its windshield shattered at her family home less than a mile from the crash site and is said to have surrendered to police when they went to her address. In August, she pleaded no contest to two felony counts - leaving the scene of a crash and perjury. She later pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter. Yanez is the daughter of LAPD Sergeant Arturo Yanez - and the veteran police officer is currently the subject of an internal investigation into whether he had any role in his daughter's attempt to cover up the crime. LAPD said the investigation in ongoing, NBC reports. Addressing Yanez in court, Mr Dotson's sister, Annette Dotson Woodard, said: 'You left my brother for dead. All along you knew you hit a human being. Annette Dotson Woodard (left) angrily asked Yanez why she left her brother Jesse Dotson Jr (right) to die .

Somebody that should have taught their child to do the right thing.' The family believe that Yanez’s two-year sentence was far too lenient, but with no criminal history prosecutors claimed the maximum six year term was always unlikely.

"Sir Alan Sugar stormed out of his own boardroom and accused a BBC Radio 4 reporter of 'gutter journalism' after he was questioned about being a bully. The frosty exchange between Lord Sugar and Today Programme business reporter Justin Rowlatt left listeners stunned during an interview to mark the 10th anniversary of The Apprentice. The BBC had been invited to question Lord Sugar at his Essex HQ but minutes into the interview the tycoon accused Rowlatt of being a 'gutter journalist' and 'picking up c**p'. Scroll down for video . Sir Alan Sugar reacted angrily when BBC reporter Justin Rowlatt suggested he bullied Apprentice contestants . Mr Rowlatt, 48, asked Sir Alan: 'Do you think there's an issue for you personally because you've got reputation of being, you know frank speaking, to the point of, and accusations have been made a number of times, to the point of being bullying?' Sir Alan, 67, replied: 'Do you know I've got hundreds and hundreds of employees here who work for me because they enjoy working for me. 'We don't bully people here it's as simple as that. I'm not getting involved in discussing that with you.' In an attempt to rescue the interview, which was printed in the Radio Times, Mr Rowlatt said: 'That's fair enough but the point I'm trying to get across is do you think it's difficult, because you speak your mind and that's the most impressive thing.' Interrupting the reporter, Sir Alan said: 'It's not bullying if you speak you're mind is it.' Mr Rowlatt then attempted to laugh it off, saying: 'Well not necessarily but some people may interpret it that way.' But Lord Sugar replied: 'Well that's their problem. I don't flower my words and if I think someone is useless I'll tell them but if I think someone has done a good job I'll also tell them.' Mr Rowlatt went on: 'For me one of the impressive things about the programme is in the boardroom and it's your ability to cut through the nonsense and see the real character of people.' The interview took place ahead of a new series of The Apprentice, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary . Lord Sugar replied: 'That's not bullying, that's just cutting through the nonsense as you put it.' He then told the reporter: 'If we can just get off that subject, I'm really insulted by that really. 'You're a gutter journalist picking up that c**p.' The  interview continued until for a few more moments until Sir Alan said: 'I'm off.' Earlier Lord Sugar also lived up to his grumpy image by criticising the 'claim culture' in British business. When asked how being a boss had changed over the last decade, he said: 'Work, rules and regulations, health and safety, the claims culture of people who have worked out there are ways and means of claiming benefits or claiming benefits from employers. 'That is the thing that upsets me and what's changed. There are not enough honest, genuine people around.' Listeners gave a mixed reaction to the interview yesterday. Mr Rowlatt laughed off Sir Alan's angry replies as the businessman accused him of 'gutter journalism' Sir Alan ranted about regulations placed on business before ending the interview by saying: 'I'm off' John Wilcox, 34, of Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'To be honest, it was great radio. Good on Justin Rowlatt for turning what could have been a fluffy piece into something entertaining. 'If anyone came out of that looking bad it was Alan Sugar. 'Short of telling Justin ""you're fired"" he sounded like he threw a tantrum because someone suggested he might come across as a bully.' Meanwhile mum-of-two Janet Fenton, 45, of Ledbury, Herefordshire said: 'I personally think Alan Sugar has contributed a great deal to Britain and I thought the line of questioning was a bit off. 'It was a cheap shot to bring up bullying and I was impressed with the way he handled the reporter whose style of laughing through the questions was irritating in the extreme. 'I would have hoped for a bit more professionalism from the Today programme.' Rowlatt, who calls himself @EthicalMan on Twitter, uploaded the interview for his 5,888 followers minutes after the interview was broadcast.","Interview to celebrate 10th anniversary of TV show The Apprentice .

"Apple users have seemingly stopped upgrading to its latest iOS 8 software, which has had tech analysts wondering why. Since it was released in mid-September, barely half of users have made the switch from iOS 7 or earlier versions, according to official Apple figures. But now a developer has claimed that the reason is that the software is too ‘nerdy’, and its features simply go over the heads of regular people. Scroll down for video . California-based Apple has been struggling with iOS 8 uptake (shown in image). Since its release in September barely half of Apple users have upgraded. Developer Andrew Clark tells Wired this may be because it's a 'nerd release'. He said many of the features may go over the head of casual consumers . As of 5 October, only 47 per cent of Apple owners were using iOS 8, which includes those using iPhone 6 and 6 Plus's pre-installed version . Speaking to Wired, developer Andrew Clark said: ‘[iOS 8 is] a nerd release. ‘Can you think of any non-power-user features that it’s worth upgrading for?' He said that of the various features included in iOS 8, many of them were simply not of interest to casual owners. Mr Clark continued: ‘Home Kit and Health Kit are useless until all the accessory makers get on board. Extensions and third party keyboards are great, but a casual user isn’t going to understand or care about them.’ In addition other planned features for iOS 8 are yet to be released. Continuity, which allows users to switch tasks between Apple devices, comes out later this month, around a similar time that Apple's mobile payment service Apple Pay will be available. So it might be that some are simply waiting for these new features - or perhaps the appeal of iOS 8 is just not alluring enough to tempt people to switch. Earlier this week it was revealed the flood of people downloading iOS 8 had slowed to a trickle. From 21 September, four days after iOS 8 debuted, the percentage of users accessing the App Store on iOS 8 had increased only 1 per cent to 47 per cent of users. This follows various teething problems for iOS 8 after its release. Users complained of a glitch in the updated Messages app that sent accidental selfies to contacts and the Health app had a bug that forced Apple to pull other third-party apps. The iPhone 6 (shown) had record-breaking sales during the first days of its release, but users on other phones have been hesitant to adopt the new iOS 8 platform as numerous bugs and glitches have been reported. Apple was forced to kill an early update after it stopped the fingerprint sensor from working . The first update to iOS 8 was worse, with software that stopped the fingerprint sensor from working and prevented users from making calls. Apple was forced to kill that update in the first few hours and offer a way for people to downgrade to a previous version. However it was reported by Huffington Post that the method the company uses to measure users, tracking when they visit the App Store, is ‘very unscientific’. This may account for the seemingly slow uptake by users. MacRumors reported that the iOS 7 adoption rate was 69.7 percent 20 days after the update was launched back in 2013. The search function on Apple’s Photos app (pictured) has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates or album name. Users can fine-tune edits, and the latest smart composition tools automatically straighten horizons, and crop images . PHOTOS . The search function on Apple’s Photos app has been improved to make it easier to find photos, based on location, dates or album. Users can fine-tune edits, and the latest smart composition tools automatically straighten horizons, or crop the image. The Messages app takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music . There are also smart adjustments that modify the overall light and colour in a photo to balance exposure, brightness and contrast. Apple has now added time-lapse video modes, accessible through the Record button on the Camera app. MESSAGES . The Messages app in iOS 8 takes on Whatsapp by letting users capture sounds to send in conversations, including voice notes, ambient sounds or music. To play these sounds, users can either press the Play button, or hold the device up to their ear and listen like a phone call. The new Messages app additionally lets users send videos, start group conversations and enable Do Not Disturb to hide group notifications until a later time. Elsewhere, users can send their location to friends, which appear on a interactive map, and send multiple photos and videos from the Camera Roll. There is also a Snapchat-style self-destruct button for video messages. INTERACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS . One of the stand-out features mentioned by Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, at iOS 8's unveiling in June was the Interactive Notifications tool. This feature let users reply to texts, emails, accept calendar invites, tweet and send Facebook messages straight from the notification banner. This means they don’t have to open the specific app, or leave the app they were already using. With iOS 8, pressing the Home button twice opens the multitasking menu. Along the top, users will now see the faces of people they’ve recently talked to, and by swiping to the right, their favourite contacts. This means they can call or text these people with one tap. And when contacts send calendar invites, for example, they can be added to the diary from the top of the screen. QUICKTYPE . In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text. In iOS 8, Apple has added support for more third-party keyboards and improved its own keyboard to add predictive text (pictured) As a user types, they’ll see a choice of words or phrases the software thinks they will type next, based on past conversations and writing style. The software can also distinguish between informal languages uses in the Messages app, for example, and more formal language when using the Mail app. It also adjusts the style based on the person the user is communicating with, because their choice of words is likely more laid back with a spouse than with a boss. FAMILY SHARING . With Family Sharing, up to six people in a family can share purchases from iTunes, iBooks and the App Store without sharing accounts. This means family purchases can be paid with the same credit card, and a child’s spending has to be approved from a parent’s device. Photos and family calendars can also be shared more easily, and everyone on the account can contribute photos to shared albums, for example. HEALTH . The new Health app on iOS 8 features a dashboard showing all the user’s health and ﬁtness data. Apple has also created a tool for developers called HealthKit, which syncs other health and fitness apps together. The Health app puts all heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, and cholesterol information in one place, and blood type and allergy information can be accessed from the Lock Screen, in case of an emergency. Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, (pictured) which searches for files and information on the device, and the web.The app now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices . SPOTLIGHT . Apple has also improved its Spotlight tool, which searches for files and information on the device, and the web. The tool now considers the answer, and uses context to provide the most relevant choices. When searching for a person, item or term, a Wikipedia snippet will appear. The new Spotlight identifies hot topics, and knows what’s trending. And typing the name of a restaurant reveals the closest branch, including phone number and opening hours, for example, too.","California-based Apple has been struggling with iOS 8 uptake .

"Imagine a world where your credit score is judged by the company you keep on social networks, and not just on your spending habits. Or a time when you pay for shopping using an eye-scanner, transfer money with the flick of a finger and meet your bank manager in the local supermarket. These are just some of the predictions made by financial technology expert Gi Fernando for the future of banking - and he believes the wheels for this revolution are already in motion. Scroll down for video . Financial tech expert Gi Fernando has revealed his vision for the future of banking. He said cards will soon disappear, to be replaced with mobile phones or tablets, used to tap against readers to pay for goods and service. Mr Fernando also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops, cafes and supermarkets . Mr Fernando,  sold his last start-up to Experian in 2011 and launched Free:Formers, a digital training firm for banks among other businesses,  a year later. Speaking exclusively to the MailOnline, he said: ‘We’re on the brink of some seismic changes in the way we all use money.’ He said Facebook users are already familiar with security prompts asking them to identify a friend’s face before their log-in process is completed, for example. And in the future, banks could rely on such social networks in a way their customers have never seen before. For example, as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority, banks could ask their clients for permission to access them.

Fernando also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops, cafes and supermarkets. And he believes that stripping away card systems in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queues. And those without accounts could be penalised when applying for credit. Users with a stable social network would be seen as less of a credit risk than those whose friends chop and change regularly - giving them access to better credit. Fernando said: ‘The old saying largely remains a truism. You are defined by the company you keep. ‘You could easily have a scenario in ten years where a customer’s chances of credit are determined not only on their spending, but also on their friends, family members and their social profile. ‘By giving up a bit more information to the banks, you might stand to benefit in a wider choice of products.’ Mr Fernando, 43, continued that financial services are already facing competition like never before from the likes of eBay, which last month said it would offer finance to hundreds of thousands of small UK firms already signed up to its PayPal payments service. As a result, banks are being forced to innovate quickly, with credit and debit cards likely to be the first casualty.

Card systems are expensive to run, relatively insecure and pretty easy to copy,’ added Mr Fernando. ‘Soon you'll simply walk into a shop, zap your phone [or smartwatch] against a contact point or barcode, and money will be taken from your account to pay for it. ‘Apple is already running this type of system through the Apple Store app’s EasyPay feature. You just scan the barcode of an item you want to buy and, in a second, it’s yours.' Apple Pay will also mean more people can pay for items using their phones. ‘But that won’t last long either,' continued Mr Fernando.

Instead of using a PIN or password, Barclays customers press their finger on a scanner plugged into their computer. Apple's EasyPay lets people scan barcodes and learn more about products, using their phone . The reader uses infrared lights to scan the veins and blood flow under the skin to confirm the user’s identity. Customers then have to scan the same finger a second time to confirm their transaction as part of the bank's ongoing bid to combat fraud. The banking giant is additionally leading the way with contactless payment wristbands. ‘But that’s really just the start of how tech is changing the banking industry,’ added Mr Fernando. ‘The bank of the future is going to be a lot more fun to engage with for customers than it is right now.’ Fernando also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops, cafes and supermarkets as banking goes back to the future. He believes that stripping away clumsy card systems  in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queue. It also means customers will be able to get more tailored, expert advice as bank staff come to them. Fernando said: ‘The advance of tech means the end of clunky processes and waiting six weeks for an appointment to see a manager. ‘Back in the fourteenth century, banking was done in coffee shops - that’s where we’re going back to. ‘Banks are already looking at getting their advisors to their customers more directly. This is just a natural progression. ‘The bigger branches can become versions of Apple’s Genius stores - stripped back, slicker and offering the kind of service customers can only dream of now. ‘If you cut back on transactional costs, it means banks can offer more specialised advice on mortgages and investments to everyone, not just the privileged few.’ But Fernando said firms, including banks, need to give their staff the skills now to face the digital future. ‘The companies that take digital seriously now, that give their employees training in coding, apps, social media and security, will take the initiative. They won’t get left behind.'","The predictions were made financial tech expert Gi Fernando .

"A 55-year-old man was found dead on Monday hanging from the framework of a huge artificial 'New Year tree' in central Kiev today which has become a symbol of anti-government resistance, Ukrainian police said. Police said they removed the body, which was hanging inside the cone-shaped tubular steel construction on Kiev's Independence Square. The 'tree' is festooned with a poster of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko and scrawled with graffiti attacking President Viktor Yanukovich. The body, that of a man from Volyn region in western Ukraine, bore no external wounds and was being examined to establish the cause of death, the police statement said. The incident was especially bizarre since the square has been swarming with protesters day and night since the onset of mass protests against Yanukovich in early December. The discovery came as Ukraine's embattled justice minister threatened to call for a state of emergency following the seizure of her ministry building by anti-government protestors last night. Scroll down for video . Yesterday a man was found dead hanging from Independence Square protest 'tree' in Kiev. The 'new year tree' has become a symbol of pro-EU and anti-government protests . President Viktor Yanukovych has also offered an amnesty to imprisoned demonstrators if activists cease their occupation of central Kiev . Azarov's departure will be welcomed by the activists, as he was a particular target of anti-government hatred . Standing guard: Demonstrators stand guard at the entrance to the Justice Ministry, which became the fourth government building to be occupied during the protests, but was quickly abandoned after the justice minister threatened to declare a state of emergency . Violent: Hundreds of protestors burst into the building on Sunday night. They erected a number of barricades, before burning a portrait of President Viktor Yanukovych . Elena Lukash said she would also halt . negotiations with demonstrators if they refused to leave the building, . situated just several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in . central Kiev. The government has since said it has no immediate plans to declare a state of emergency after protesters evacuated the building. Although . the building's seizure ended, it underlined protesters' growing . inclination to take radical action after two months of largely peaceful . demonstrations. Long-brewing anger boiled over into violence a week ago . when protesters launched into clashes with police, infuriated by harsh . new anti-protest laws hurriedly pushed through by President Viktor . Yanukovych. Three . protesters died in the clashes last week, two of whom were shot by . hunting rifles, which police insist they do not use. With protesters now . willing to risk injury, a state of emergency would be likely to set off . substantial fighting on the streets of the capital. ""Today, such a measure is not on the table,"" Foreign Minister Leonid Kozhara told journalists. Defence: The ministry is situated several hundred metres away from the main protest camp in central Kiev. Above, a protester erects a barricade near the building . Action: Speaking to a local TV crew, Ms Lukash said the 'so-called protesters' had seized the building as ministry employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to protesters. Above, demonstrators pull a public bin to be used in the construction of barricades . Seized: Staff had also been attempting to make changes in the constitution, she said. Above, three anti-government protesters stand guard at the ministry with icons . Speech: Opposition leader and former WBC heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko (pictured) addresses the media in front of the ministry in Kiev today . EU . foreign police chief Catherine Ashton said in a statement that she was . alarmed by reports about the government considering a state of emergency . and warned that such a move ""would trigger a further downward spiral . for Ukraine which would benefit no one."" Ashton, . who is set to travel to Ukraine Tuesday, called for a dialogue and . urged the opposition leaders to dissociate themselves from those who . resort to violence. The . protesters still occupy three sizable buildings in downtown Kiev, . including City Hall. One of the buildings was seized in a spectacular . assault early Sunday, when hundreds of protesters threw rocks and . firebombs into the building where about 200 police were sheltering. The . crowd eventually formed a corridor through which the police left. Lukash, . in a televised statement, noted that protesters seized the building as . justice employees were working on measures to grant amnesty to . protesters and to make changes in the constitution to restore more power . to the prime minister. Yanukovych . on Saturday offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one . of the opposition's most prominent leaders. Yatsenyuk, while not flatly . rejecting the offer, said protests would continue and that a special . session of parliament called for Tuesday would be ""judgment day."" Demonstrations: Beleaguered President Viktor Yanukovych offered the prime minister's post to Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Saturday, which he declined . Chaos: President Yanukovych also offered former boxer Vitali Klitschko, another opposition leader, the role of Deputy Prime Minister. Above, protestors face riot police . Upcoming 'judgement day': Mr Yatsenyuk said protests would continue and that a special session of parliament called for Tuesday would be 'judgement day' t's . not clear if constitutional changes will be on the agenda for that . session, but granting more power to the prime minister could both . sweeten the offer and allow Yanukovych to portray himself as offering . genuine compromise. The . fears of a state of emergency come after other official statements . suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the . protesters. Interior Minister Vitali Zakharchenko, an official . deeply despised by the protesters, on Saturday warned that demonstrators . occupying buildings would be considered extremists and that force would . be used against them if necessary. He also claimed demonstrators had seized two policemen and tortured them before letting them go, which the opposition denied. The . protests began in late November when Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited . agreement to deepen ties with the 28-nation European Union and sought a . bailout loan from Russia. The demonstrations grew in size and intensity . after police violently dispersed two gatherings. Demonstrators then set . up a large tent camp on Kiev's main square. After . Yanukovych approved the new anti-protest laws, demonstrations spread . into other parts of the country, including to some cities in the . Russian-speaking east, the base of Yanukovych's support. A city in flames: The president's announcement came as fresh violence erupted in Kiev, with a large crowd attacking a government exposition and conference hall . Danger: Demonstrators were throwing firebombs into the Ukrainian House building and setting off fireworks - to which police responded with tear gas . Deal: President Yanukovych has offered the role of Prime Minister to Arseniy Yatsenyuk (left) with fellow opposition leader Vitali Klitschko (right) as his deputy. Concern: Today's prospect of a state of emergency also follows other official statements suggesting the government is considering forceful moves against the protesters in the wake of the violent clashes. Three protesters have now died in the protests - two of them after being shot and one of unspecified injuries .

"One of Robin Williams' most notable film roles was Patch Adams, where he played a medical student who helped his patients by making them laugh with his zany antics. However, the actor, like the character he portrayed, also had a heart-warming dedication to helping patients after the cameras stopped rolling. Family members of those he comforted have paid tribute to the 63-year-old, who was found dead in his San Francisco mansion at around noon yesterday. Garry Kravit, whose nephew David Buist was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, called the star a 'comedic Mother Theresa'. Scroll down for video . The best medicine: Robin Williams in Patch Adams, where he played a doctor who helped patients by making them laugh. The actor showed extaordinary kindness to real-life child patients . Loss: Teenager Jessica Cole, who spent a day with Robin Williams two weeks before she passed away. He chartered a private jet to go and see the girl when she became too ill to travel . David bravely decided that he wanted to see a new Ronald McDonald House - a charity that provides accommodation for families with children in hospital - built in New York before anything happened to him. Kravit met Robin Williams at an event and asked him for autographed items for their fund-raising efforts. Williams went much farther and started calling David to help keep his spirits up as his condition deteriorated. 'When David was suffering at his worst, Robin would call him to perk him up. David treasured Robin's calls and it helped to push him forward,' Mr Kravit said. Williams even invited the pair to a filming of a comedy special in New York in 2004. 'He hugged him and spent 20 minutes with him. He didn't care about anything but David,' Kravit told CNN. Buist eventually beat his cancer and is now married with children. Pictured, Robin Williams with his daughter Zelda Williams. Right, in his hit role as Mrs Doubtfire, the favourite film of cancer sufferer Jessica Cole, who spent the day with him just two weeks before she died . Another relative of a cancer sufferer, Mark Cole, reminisced about the star's generosity of spirit. His 13-year-old daughter Jessica had an incurable brain tumour and, as a huge fan of Mrs Doubtfire, requested a visit to see Williams through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Kind: Williams in the film Old Dogs. During filming he helped an extra struggling with a heavy golf bag . But she became too ill to make the trip, so the actor chartered a private plane to her Greensboro, North Carolina, home, where he spent the day with the teenager. 'I couldn't believe it,' Mr Cole said. 'I felt very privileged that he came to spend the day with her like that. It was the most moving thing I've ever seen in my life.' Jessica died two weeks later. Numerous stories about his kindness have emerged since his apparent suicide. Susan Jeffer was an extra hired to play golf in the background of 'Old Dogs', starring Robin Williams. After filming had finished, the strap on her golf bag broke and she had to carry it across the course in the hot sun. The only person to help her was the Oscar winner, who, knowing she would get in trouble if she was seen being helped by the star, carried the bag but handed it back just before they reached the rest of the actors and crew. She said: 'He really saved me that day. I'll never forget it.' Canadian comedy actor Will Arnett, who appeared in the 2006 road comedy RV with Williams, spoke about William's kind-heartedness last night on TV talk show Conan. He said: 'As funny as he was - he's one of the all-time greats - he was even better as a person. 'He was just the loveliest and one of the kindest guys that anyone ever worked with.'","Like in his famous film role, Williams comforted and helped sick children .

"It’s the moment every parent dreads – soothing a child who's had his heart broken. But this little boy's heartbreak happens in the worst possible way when he hears the news... from his own mother! Chatting to the boy during their drive in the car, mum starts a conversation that soon balloons into a full-blown histrionic affair, complete with dramatic sobs, distraught weeping and angry tears. This four-year-old gets his heart broken when his mother tells him that his playschool pal Emily has made friends with other boys . At first he is bewildered and doesn't seem to understand when she tells him that his friend Emily likes a boy who called her. The boy opens his mouth wide and starts wailing: 'I don’t like that.' Gasping between his sobs, he wails: ‘It hurts my feelings… I thought her [sic] was my friend but now her [sic] doesn't like me anymore.’ His words eaten up by more sobs, the child is unable to complete his sentence. The highly amusing conversation slowly spirals out of control as the mother tries to calm her child, who becomes more and more inconsolable as the conversation continues . Strapped into his child seat, the four-year-old wails in consternation (left)  when he discovers that his friend Emily has decided to see other people . Mum does her best to reassure him but his wails grow louder and more distraught as he realises that Emily is not solely his friend. She reminds him that he likes other people, saying: ‘You know how you have so many friends at school?’ She then tells him that Emily can have lots of friends as well, but the boy is not having any of it. ‘But I don’t like it if she doesn't call me anymore,’ he yells, getting to the crux of his problems. ‘Well then you call her, the mother suggests. ‘But I don’t know how to call her,’ he shouts, frustrated that his mother doesn't understand his problems. ‘First I was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend,’ yells the little boy, who doesn't want his friend Emily to be pally with anyone else other than him . ‘I just want her to like me more better’ he says. ‘First I was her best friend but now the other boy will be her best friend.’ Mum tries to convince him that Emily can have lots of friends but his backseat crying continues, and even the reminder that he has lots of friends does nothing to ease the child’s woes. ‘I want to call her right now,’ he says, clearly a man of action. But his plans to get his plan to get the friendship back on are thwarted when mum tells him that he can only get in touch with Emily later. He tearfully agrees with the suggestion, but not without articulating his feelings one last time, yelling: ‘I don’t feel good because of Emily,’ heart-wrenchingly.","Wails in agony when mum breaks news that Emily is talking to another child .

"The world's largest aircraft is now flying the longest route with the launch of non-stop Qantas flights between Sydney, Australia and Dallas in the Airbus A380. The airline this week announced that the expansive planes have taken over the nearly 16-hour route from the Boeing 747, operating six return services per week. The aircraft switch means that first class is now available for the first time on the route,  popular with business travellers. Scroll down for video . Long haul: Qantas has announced that their A380 aircraft will take over the non-stop route from Sydney, Australia to Dallas/Fort Worth . Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce says of the move: 'Today, Qantas is leading the way again with the introduction of the world’s largest passenger aircraft on the world’s longest route, Sydney to Dallas/Fort Worth, with a flying time of almost 16 hours. 'We know our customers will value the comfort of the A380 on this route. It’s also a vote of confidence in Qantas’s business going forward. 'Not only will the A380 increase seats on the route by more than 10 per cent each week, it will also provide us with greater fuel efficiency and the range to operate the return service direct back to Sydney. Corporate route: The new aircraft means first class will be offered for the first time on the route, popular with business travellers . 'Our customers also now have the choice of four cabins to both Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth as we introduce our Marc Newson designed First Class Suites on the Dallas/Fort Worth route for the first time.' Mr Joyce explains that the 13,804km Sydney-Dallas route is particularly popular with corporate customers flying to the US for its great connections. 'Since starting on the route in 2011 the feedback from our corporate customers, especially those in the resources, technology and agricultural sectors, tells us they like flying into the Dallas hub because it gets them closer to their final destination in the US and offers great onward connections. Take off: The flight will take 14 hours 50 mins from Sydney to Dallas, and 15 hours 30 mins on the return leg . 'The Dallas/Fort Worth service offers direct access right into the heart of the US with over 50 connections to all US major cities all within four hours, including Orlando, Boston and Houston.'

"Wreckage of German submarine U-576 was found next to the merchant vessel it sunk in its last naval battle 72 years ago off the coast of North Carolina. Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration discovered both ships on the ocean floor 30 miles from Cape Hatteras, the agency announced Tuesday. 'This is not just the discovery of a single shipwreck,' said chief scientist Joe Hoyt of the NOAA Office of Marine Sanctuaries expedition that made the discovery. Scroll down for video . Peace: The crewmen of U-576 found their final resting place at the bottom of the Atlantic after being sunk trying to disrupt Allied shipping . 'We have discovered an important battle site that is part of the Battle of the Atlantic,' he added. 'These two ships rest only a few hundred yards apart and together help us interpret and share their forgotten stories.' Jan 1942: Freighter SS West Ivis broke in two after being torpedoed by U-125 off the coast of Virginia, 45 killed . Feb 1942: Tanker SS W. L. Steed torpedoed off the coast of New Jersey by U-103, 34 died . June 1942: Passenger ship SS Cherokee sunk off Cape Cod by U-87, 87 killed . July 1942: SS Bluefields and two other merchant ships torpedoed off North Carolina, four dead . June 1943: Tanker SS Esso Gettysburg torpedoed by U-66 off the coast of Georgia, 57 killed . Apr 1945: Tanker SS Atlantic States stalked and torpedoed off the coast of Cape Cod, no fatalities . May 1945: Collier SS Black Point torpedoed two days before German unconditional surrender, 12 died . Merchant vessels often came under attack, and though the official count of wartime casualties is not known, the merchant marines suffered thousands of losses. The merchant tanker Bluefields, flying the Nicaraguan flag, was part of a 24-ship convoy with air cover on its way south from Virginia to Florida on July 14, 1942. U-576 was at the time limping back to port in Germany, having sustained damage during a month of unsuccessfully hunting Allied shipping vessels along the American coast. The German sub, commanded by Kapitanleutnant Hans-Dieter Heinicke, engaged the convoy, singling out the Bluefields. 'In spite of his damaged ship, Heinicke decided to attack at all costs,' a document held by the Monitor National Marine Sancturary reads. 'However, at 4:00 pm just before he could fire his torpedoes, one of the Coast Guard cutters picked up a sonar contact.' The Coast Guard escorts dropped a series of three depth charges, soon followed by five more. Determined to strike against the convoy, Heinicke fired four torpedoes that sunk the Bluefields and damaged two other ships. Kingfisher floatplanes escorting the convoy zeroed in on the sub, hitting it with depth charges, while the Unicoi merchant ship swung around its deck gun and fired. Both vessels sank, but a grisly end awaited the crew of U-576, as all 45 sailors died aboard the doomed sub. The NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer did the initial surveying for the wrecks based on historical records, while the SRVx Sand Tiger confirmed both ships' identities in August. Close range: The wreckage was found near the coast of North Carolina east off Cape Hatteras along a shipping route used by merchant vessels . Commander: Kapitänleutnant Hans-Dieter Heinicke (right) decided to engage the convoy, in spire of the German sub already being damaged . Hands: Members of the U-576 watch crew keep a look out in the conning tower about the German submarine in transit .

Discovery: Scientists from NOAA found the wreckage of U-576 using sonogram on the ocean floor off the coast of North Carolina . The wreck of U-576 will remain under the sovereign ownership of Germany, in accordance with US policy. 'It is international custom to view the wreckage of land, sea, and air vehicles assumed or presumed to hold the remains of fallen soldiers as war graves,' read a statement from the German Foreign Office. 'As such, they are under special protection and should, if possible, remain at their site and location to allow the dead to rest in peace.'","U-576 was discovered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Marine Sanctuaries expedition .

"A couple who trafficked vulnerable young women into the UK and forced them into sham marriages have been jailed for three years . Abdullah Saleem and his wife Anna Styputkowska were the ringleaders of a bogus marriage operation in Slough, Berkshire, where they used false advertisements of well-paid jobs to entice girls from Poland. The girls were then set up with non-EU men who 24-year-old Saleem had lined up. Jailed: Abdullah Saleem (left) and his wife Anna Styputkowska were the ringleaders of a bogus marriage gang, with the latter attracting girls from her native Poland by falsely advertising well paid jobs in the UK . The pair were caught after one of three girls they had brought to the UK, Estera Sztogryn, who believed she was going to be working as a cleaner, escaped from a house where they were holding her. After being arrested and then released on bail, Saleem and 21-year-old Styputkowska tried to flea the country but were apprehended at Dover where officials discovered them hiding in the back of a lorry bound for France. Sentencing the couple at Reading Crown Court, Judge Zoe Smith said arranging sham marriages to get around immigration rules was a very serious offence. Fake adverts were placed on Polish websites and Facebook to tempt girls into moving to the UK. The prosecution said three girls were found when police swooped on houses in Slough, Berkshire, that were part of the ring. All from poor backgrounds and needed money. One of them, 21-year-old Estera, needed money to pay for her mother’s cancer treatment. Escape plan: Saleem and 21-year-old Styputkowska made a bid for freedom but were found trying to smuggle their way out of the country in the back of a lorry in Dover that was bound for France (file picture) She arrived in the UK on August 28 last year, where she was met by the defendants at Luton Airport and taken to a house in Whitby Road, Slough, where Saleem and Styputkowska lived. Prosecutor Wendy Hewitt said: 'At that point she was still under the impression that the employment and accommodation would involve something like cleaning.' She was allowed out of the house at times but only under supervision. Estera first became alarmed about what was going on when she overheard the defendants talking about transferring her to another house and raised her fears with Styputkowska. Miss Hewitt said: 'The conversation goes along the lines of ‘don’t make us angry about this’. 'The following day she is told to pack and the Crown says it is made plain that she is not to argue with them any longer about it.''She became tearful about it. She is told she has to go along with it.' The girl was then taken to a house in Tintern Close, Slough, where she was left with another man, who told her she would have to have sex with her new husband to make the marriage appear real. Estera was able to escape from the house on August 30 and call police, who then raided both addresses. Case: Reading Crown Court heard that Styputkowska had herself originally been brought to the UK as part of a sham marriage arrangement but 'didn¿t like the look of' the man she was expected to marry. At the Whitby Road home they found two other Polish girls, Justyna Hajkowska, aged 18 years, and Barbara Dzielak, aged 27 years. They had originally been going to take part in a sham marriage in Ireland but did not like the arrangements and got in touch with Styputkowska after remembering her advert. The defendants were arrested and interviewed on September 2 before being released on bail. On September 8 they were found with 23 other people in the back of the lorry headed for France and arrested again. 'They were both trying to leave the country before any further steps could be taken in these proceedings,' said Miss Hewitt. The court heard that Styputkowska had herself originally been brought to the UK as part of a sham marriage arrangement but 'didn’t like the look of' the man she was expected to marry. She then met Saleem and they married legitimately. Fake: When police searched an address on Whitby Road in Slough, they found three girls who had become victims of the scam . The prosecutor said there was no evidence any marriages had actually taken place as part of the defendants’ arrangement or that any money had changed hands. Defending a tearful Styputkowska, Kate Hughes said: 'My client is regretful of the choices she has made. 'She looks forward to living a completely crime free life upon release.' Saleem’s defence representative, Stephen Butt, said it had not been a large conspiracy and not many people were involved. At a hearing on December 16 the pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to do an act to facilitate the commission of a breach of UK immigration law.","Abdullah Saleem and Anna Styputkowska were the leaders of operation .

"Bribery and corruption has surfaced in Liberia with victims' families paying off retrieval teams to let them keep their loved ones bodies and give them traditional burials. The virus is highly infectious through exposure to bodily fluids, and its early rapid spread in west Africa was attributed in part to relatives touching victims during traditional funeral rites. Teams have since been employed to either cremate or bury victims, but the outbreak continues to show no sign of slowing with more than 4,000 dead and twice as many infected. Liberian Red Cross health workers remove the body of an Ebola victim who died in a treatment centre. Stock image used . A health worker indicates there are three bodies to be collected for cremation in Monrovia, Liberia . The Wall Street Journal has now reported the certificates are being issued to family members often still grieving as the retrieval teams arrive. Vincent Chounse, a community outreach worker from Monrovia, told the paper: 'The family says the person is not an Ebola patient, and (the retrieval team) pull them away from the other people. 'Then they say: ""We can give you a certificate from the Ministry of Health that it wasn’t Ebola"".' The price of the certificate ranged from $40 all the way to $150, the paper reported. While the Liberian Government acknowledged there had been reports of retrieval teams issuing fake death certificates, it claimed the teams did not have the 'capacity' to issue certificates. Meanwhile, Liberian health workers have reported for duty at hospitals, largely defying calls for a strike that could have further hampered the country's ability to respond to the epidemic.

Nurses escort a man from the JFK Ebola treatment center in Monrovia . Nurses and other health workers - though not doctors - had threatened to strike if they did not receive the higher hazard pay they had been promised by the government. Liberia has the highest number of Ebola infections and deaths of any country, with 2,316 deaths. Alphonso Weah, head of medical staff at Liberia's 150-bed Island Clinic in the capital Monrovia, said workers had decided to come in after appeals from the general public. 'We have agreed, collectively as a community, to go back to work,' Weah told a popular radio talk show. But George Williams, secretary-general of the National Health Workers Association of Liberia, said the government was pressuring workers by trying to shame them and offering money. 'The President went to various Ebola Treatment Units, giving them money and asking those who are not a true Liberian to put up their hands that they would strike.' Disinfected boots and gloves are left hanging inside the Elwa 3 Ebola treatment centre in Monrovia . Two Liberian Red Cross workers prepare to collect the bodies of victims from a treatment centre . A doctors warns a local bystander to stay away from a unit where Ebola victims are being held . Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable to Ebola because the disease is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person. More than 95 healthcare workers in Liberia have died, about the same number as in Sierra Leone . The two people who have been infected outside Africa were both healthcare workers - nurses - who treated Ebola patients. Health Minister Walter Gwenigale said he was working to implement a promised pay rise. He said: 'That money is available and is being paid. So please, please stay with your patients.' Months into the crisis, concern that Ebola could spread globally has spurred the international community to step up support for the affected countries with medical personnel, material and pledges of about $1billion to tackle the epidemic. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, said: 'I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries. 'The outbreak spotlights the dangers of the world's growing social and economic inequalities. The rich get the best care. The poor are left to die.'

Ellie Levenson, the author of The Noughtie Girl’s Guide to Feminism, told The Times the designer’s explanation about making women appear more vulnerable is taking a backwards step.

Designer McCartney, pictured after her show at Paris Fashion Week, has been criticised for the comments . Cara Delevingne walked the catwalk as part of McCartney's show yesterday wearing a black cape . The spring/summer 2015 collection promised clothes with ‘effortless movement and a fluid silhouette’ TV historian and feminist Mary Beard, a professor of classics at the University of Cambridge, told the paper McCartney, who is said to be worth £46million, could have been trying to say something more complicated about the nature of strength. ‘Possibly that brute force doesn’t equal strength. In which case I agree, but then I’m not a designer,’ she said. McCartney’s collection was taken down the catwalk at the Palais Garnier opera house, which seats 2,000, in the centre of Paris. Cara Delevingne was among the models on the runway and wore a black cape decorated with grey flowers. The show promised to deliver clothes with ‘effortless movement and a fluid silhouette’ and was watched by several high powered women, including Anna Wintour – the editor of American Vogue.

But users on the photo-sharing network have criticised the health of the model with some saying she looks ‘terribly thin’ and ‘sick’. Greylady62 commented on the post: ‘Appalling image....this young lady is clearly very ill & the body image being used is all that is wrong with the fashion world’.

"A controversial plan which would have forced the unemployed to apply for at least 40 jobs a month before being granted the Newstart Allowance has been scrapped. The backdown on a key plank of the Federal Government's welfare benefits reform has come about after a stream of negative feedback. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, however, is defending his government's about-face, insisting he's 'fair dinkum' when it comes to listening to feedback. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has defended the government's about-face on job-seekers, insisting he is 'fair dinkum' about listening to feedback on policy . The government's proposal to double the job application target for Newstart Allowance recipients was widely criticised as punitive for job seekers and an administrative nightmare for businesses. The status quo of 20 applications will remain. The Prime Minister conceded the government had made some significant 'refinements' to the practicalities of the policy. 'The only fair dinkum consultations are (ones) that can and do result in some refinements and where necessary some changes,' Mr Abbott said. 'I would like to say isn't this the whole point of consultation? Consultation that can't result in any changes is meaningless. 'The consultations that this government has will be fair dinkum.' The government's proposal to double the job application target for Newstart Allowance recipients was widely criticised as punitive for job seekers and an administrative nightmare for businesses . Employment Minister Eric Abetz said the government had acknowledged the policy would have put a burden on business and possibly diminish the value of job applications. At the same time, he maintained it should be the full-time job of the unemployed to gain employment and believes the 40 job application target would not have been too onerous. He has previously stated that seeking one job in the morning and another in the afternoon was 'not too hard'.

The backdown on a key plank of the Federal Government's welfare benefits reform has come about after a stream of negative feedback . Greens Leader Christine Milne said she was pleased the government had backed down. She says the next step is for the government to abandon plans to force those under the age of 30 to wait six months before they can claim the dole. That program is set to come into vogue in January 2015. St Vincent de Paul Society CEO, Dr John Falzon, is also urging the government to rethink its plans. 'What we had hoped for was a jobs plan, what we have got instead is a bashing the young unemployed plan.' The Greens have also called on the government to abandon plans to force those under the age of 30 to wait six months before they can claim the dole . The government also plans to extend the work for the dole program. Those under 30 will have to complete 25 hours a week of the program. Older job seekers between age 30 and 50 will have to complete 15 hour . He said the government has missed the point and the labour market structure is the problem, not those seeking work. 'You don't help young help people into work by forcing them to live below the poverty line and you certainly don't help them into a job by forcing them to rely on charity to survive,' Dr Falzon added. The government also plans to extend the work for the dole program. Those under 30 will have to complete 25 hours a week of the program.

"Lesley Figgis is a Guide Dog puppy raiser in Sydney and is urging more families to get involved . Urgent calls are being made for guide dog puppy raisers in capital cities across Australia as the demand increases in the run up to Christmas. Candidates need to have a fenced-in backyard, to live in a metropolitan area, access to a car and a lot of time to invest in the pups.

Around 40 Guide Dog raisers are needed in the Sydney area alone and there are more than 30 people across NSW and the ACT are currently waiting for a dog. Lesley and Greg Figgis, from Woolwich, Sydney, are puppy raisers for Guide Dogs NSW/ACT. Mrs Figgis, 55, said: 'We decided to become puppy raisers because Guide Dogs NSW/ACT is such a fulfilling and worthwhile cause and the service a guide dog plays to someone who is vision impaired is so beneficial. 'Plus we wanted the joy of having a dog in the house – we’ve had dogs before and puppy raising is a great way to enjoy this.

'I’m blind in my right eye due to an accident as a child and two years ago I lost the central vision in my left eye, which was really frightening. 'But I’ve since had treatment and that has been a success but I don’t know what will happen in the long-term. 'After this, it prompted me to look into becoming a puppy raiser and I saw an article in the paper and applied. 'Our first pup was Scout, who has since graduated as a Guide Dog but we’re temporary caring for her at the moment as she waits to be placed with someone who is blind or vision impaired. In May we received Essie, a black Labrador pup.'

Barbara Bonfield with her beloved Guide Dog Samara who helps who live her life to the full everyday . Barbara Bonfield's life was changed when she became the owner of Guide Dog in 1993 having got by for over 50 years with little to no sight aids to help her. Mrs Bonfield, 70, from Penrith, west Sydney, was born with an unidentified degenerative disorder of her retinas and she has been legally blind since she was 12 years old. She currently has a Guide Dog called Samara who helps her live an active lifestyle and do everything she loves like shopping, bush walks, volunteering and travelling. During her early years of growing up Barbara received no professional assistance available to manage her vision loss. She got married to Allan and had their daughter and cared for her with no help. When Barbara got to 40 she decided she needed extra help and she got her first Guide Dog called Quella because her sight was worsening. Mrs Bonfield told Daily Mail Australia: 'Prior to having a Guide Dog I used my other senses to get around and also had a long cane for some years. 'For a long time I didn't want anyone to know I was different, I got my first job in a factory when I left school at 14 and used my senses of touch and hearing to get around. 'My husband calls it resilience and that is how I have got by. I have never been able to see people's faces and I touch everything all the time. 'Looking after a baby is a very hands on type thing and I would wipe her face after she was fed and as she started getting around we when we went out together, I always put a harness on her. 'Until I reached the age of 40 I had never really been able to go anywhere on my own, I did sometimes go out alone but not very often. 'I got my first Guide Dog 21 years and the independence that the dog gave me was just incredible, I never have a day when I don't think what a wonderful, brilliant animal Samara is.

Every day 28 Australians are diagnosed with uncorrectable vision loss, including nine who become blind . 'She is my fourth dog and makes my life so much easier.' Mrs Bonfield says it is very important for more families to come forward to raise the puppies in a 'normal family environment'. She added: 'I have been to quite a few puppy graduation ceremonies and the puppy raisers are like proud parents. 'They think their dog is the best and it is just a very rewarding thing to do. 'Some people find giving the puppy back quite distressing but the pleasure they get and doing something worthwhile compensates for the distress of losing the dog. 'It is such a worthwhile community service, without puppy raisers there would be no Guide Dogs and without them there would be hundreds of people who would have a more restricted life across Australia.'

"Jeremy Hunt has admitted that he fears for the future of his three children who are half Chinese – because uncontrolled immigration risks causing ‘tensions’ in Britain. The Health Secretary said he was worried that mounting anger against migrants would mean his Chinese wife and their children would face hostility for using the NHS. He warned that unless the level of immigration was brought back under control, the UK would have to face up to the sort of ‘social divisions’ that had tarnished other countries. Mr Hunt said that if the NHS did not get better at tackling ‘health tourism’, the country may not be able to afford decent care for everyone. At least £500million a year is being lost because hospitals do not ask many foreigners to pay for the care they receive, he said. Scroll down for video . Family man: Jeremy Hunt, pictured with his wife Lucia Guo and two of their children in 2012, fears his half-Chinese children will face hostility for using the NHS if immigration is not curbed . There would be growing anger among voters if it looked as if they were being denied NHS care because the cost of treating migrants and overseas visitors was so high, Mr Hunt added. He made his hard-hitting warnings about immigration in a phone-in programme hosted by Iain Dale on LBC Radio. ‘I’d like to make one general point about immigration,’ he said. ‘My wife is Chinese and she obviously lives with me in London. ‘My children are half Chinese and I do not want them to grow up in a country where people look at immigrants and say it’s difficult for me to access NHS services because of people like you. ‘And that’s why it’s so important to have sensible, balanced, controlled immigration in this country. Because otherwise we’ll have social divisions, we’ll have tensions, which thankfully in this country we’ve avoided for many years unlike other countries.’ Mr Hunt met his wife, Lucia Guo, six years ago at a conference in London where she was working as a recruiter for Chinese students. Their children are Jack, four, Anna, two, and Eleanor, who was born in July. His warning has come after the Tories failed to meet their election pledge to cut immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Although immigration from outside the EU has been cut, the Coalition has been unable to tackle immigration from the continent because of freedom of movement rules. Jeremy Hunt, wife Lucia and two of their children at a wedding in 2012 . David Cameron has vowed to claw back powers over our borders from the EU ahead of an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. Last week, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned that some communities felt ‘swamped’ and ‘under siege’ from migrants. Senior doctors have warned of the disastrous effect of ‘health tourism’ on the NHS, with people coming to Britain to access free cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment. Mr Hunt added: ‘It is a National Health Service and not an International Health Service and we have to do something about this – we are doing something about this. We simply can’t afford to give everyone free medical care. It is important to say that 40 per cent of doctors in the NHS are from an ethnic minority and we benefit massively from foreign nurses, foreign doctors.’ But Mr Hunt said the NHS was not good enough at collecting money from foreigners, who ‘don’t have a right to free care on the NHS’. But he added, however, that action was being taken, such as ‘stopping the issuing of NHS numbers to anyone who turns up in a GP surgery’.","Health Secretary worries about 'tensions' due to uncontrolled migration .

"Condensation mists up the windows, and neon lights bounce off the mildewy walls, but these small discos are still a magnet for young people living in the rural villages of Lithuania. The tiny, rundown and often near-empty nightclubs have been documented by Seattle photographer Andrew Miksys, who has traveled through the former Soviet Union country in search of rural nightlife for the past ten years. 'It seemed like a perfect backdrop to make a series of photographs about young people in Lithuania, a crumbling past and the uncertain future of a new generation together in one room,' he said. Quiet party: A girl dances under a glitter ball on a sparse dance floor in one of Lithuania's rural night clubs . Off the beaten track: Andrew Miksys searched villages around the former Soviet bloc country to find tiny clubs . Miksys said that he found a young generation ready to ignore the hardships of a struggling economy, and 'just get drunk, make out, dance and sometimes fight'. Gaining access to the tightly knit communities where the village discos are held was often tricky and dangerous for a stranger. 'My anxiety was often quite intense when I got in my car and left the familiar lights of Vilnius searching for discos on mostly empty back roads,' Miksys told Landscape Stories. 'But the prospect of discovering a disco somewhere in the dark with colored lights pouring out the windows and pulsating music pushed me forward.' The photographer often found remnants of Lithuania's Communist past, with broken paintings of Lenin, gas masks and posters for Soviet films dumped in the back of the halls. 'I was quite fascinated by all this debris of a dead empire,' Miksys said. He was voted one of the top 30 emerging photos to watch by Photo District News in 2002. Night life: Young people still gather in dingy halls to dance, drink and meet new friends . Light show: The damp halls with dodgy decor are turned into clubs in remote Lithuanian villages . Comrades in arms: Like clubs across the world, these tiny discos offer the chance to dance, flirt and make out . Lithuania was under Communist rule from 1944 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. During this period its people clung to their culture and Pagan roots to maintain a sense of identity. The reach of Communist influence during the Soviet years would have had an impact on the clubs. Several bands were banned for being ideologically harmful, including the Village People, who were considered 'violent', Tina Turner and Donna Summer were seen as being too erotic, and Julio Iglesias, who was barred from playlists for being 'neo-fascist', according to the Scotsman. Miksys said however, that the spark of life in the young people gathering to drink and meet reminded him of the country's pagan past, according to Flavorwire. The photographer, who splits his time between Seattle and Vilnius in Lithuania, said that for solstice the country's pagans would run naked through the forests, dancing and jumping over fires, and having sex in the bushes. Although many young Lithuanians move to cities, or try to find work abroad, the summer solstice is still a festival that brings them back together. During the Pagan celebration, celebrated on June 21 this year, the near-deserted villages become overflowing with revelers. Macho: Clubbers were often suspicious as to why Miksys wanted to photograph them . Disco inferno: The club reminded Miksys of Lithuanian Pagan festivals with naked dancing in the woods . 'While it’s assumed that discos are a . product of urban culture, it seems to me that these pagan traditions . from the forest could have been the first discos,' he said. The American-Lithuanian's heritage . helped him gain access to the rural communities, who were often wary as . to why he wanted to photograph them. 'My broken, heavily accented . Lithuanian certainly gave me away. In truth, it was probably my outsider . status that made me less threatening and kept me safe,' he said.

"Two U.S. Embassy military attaches in Venezuela have been wounded in a shooting at a well-known strip club in Caracas, local authorities say. Officers heard shots around 4.25am Tuesday at the Antonella 2012 club, better known as 'Angelus' in the upscale Chacao district, a police source told Reuters. An employee told Agence France-Presse that the the bar is a strip club that only admits men over age 30. Pictures of female strippers line the entrance to the club. One of the embassy employees, military attaché Roberto Ezequiel Rosas, was shot in the leg, according to a police report seen by Reuters and the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The second embassy official, Paul Marwin, was shot in the stomach but did not notice the injury until arriving home, the source said. The wounds are not believed to be life-threatening. A police source told AFP that a third American was involved, as well, but he was not wounded. The shooting happened just outside the strip club after the Americans got into an argument with other patrons of the nightclub, police say. 'Apparently it was a fight originating in a nightspot where these people were attacked and shots were fired at them and they suffered gunshot wounds,"" police spokesman Douglas Rico told Venezuelan TV channel Globovision. Party time: The nightclub's social media sites feature pictures of strippers dancing on poles, in cages and laying on beds . It's unclear what services the strip club offers patrons on these beds in private rooms next to the club . In a terse statement, the embassy confirmed an 'incident,' but gave few details. 'We can confirm that two members of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas were injured during an incident early this morning. Medical staff informs us that their injuries do not appear to be life-threatening,' the statement said. On Tuesday afternoon, Reuters reporters saw police detective vehicles parked near the club, which is popular among foreigners. Officials walked in and out of the club without answering questions. Venezuela has one of the world's highest homicide rates. Violent crime occurs primarily in the country's poor slums, but in recent years, assaults and shootings have become more common in well-to-do areas of the city. Last week, President Nicolas Maduro launched a security drive that puts soldiers on the streets of the capital. About 20 security initiatives have been implemented since 1999. The Venezuela shooting may revive memories of an incident that embarrassed U.S. officials in Colombia last year.

"One of Sydney's most listened to shock-jocks has threatened to punch a former reporter in the face live on-air following a clash of opinions over Woolworths' 'racist' singlets. 2GB presenter Ray Hadley called former Fairfax columnist Mike Carlton a 'dog' and a 'grub' and threatened to 'put one on his chin' during his regular morning segment on Wednesday. The shock-jock was responding to Mr Carlton's earlier tweet in which he had alluded to Hadley being a 'wife beater' after hearing of his support for the singlets. 'Funny to hear Ray 'Boofhead' Hadley ranting about that Woolies patriotic singlet. A garment sometimes known as a ""wifebeater"",' Carlton tweeted after hearing Hadley defending the garments on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . 2GB presenter Ray Hadley (left) called Mike Carlton (right) a 'dog' and a 'grub' on his Wednesday morning segment. Hadley also threatened to punch Carlton for his tweet which alluded to him being a 'wife beater' Appearing on Channel Nine's Today Show on Tuesday, Hadley slamming Woolworths for removing the blue tank-tops, which were emblazoned with an Australian flag and the words 'if you don't like it, leave'. 'What's the big deal? It's not offensive: 'if you don't like it, leave'. I mean what's the problem,' he said on the show. Later the same day, he clarified his position during his 2GB segment by saying he thought the shirts reflect 'a positive image' of 'team Australia'. 'If you reside here, if you're an Australian resident, or if you're an Australian citizen, then you love the joint,' he said. 'And if you don't love it, nick off. It's not racist; it's simply a fact of life. The tweet was posted following Hadley slamming Woolworths for removing the pictured singlets from their store's shelves after they were deemed racist on social media . 'This is the best country in the world. If you don't embrace it you don't deserve to be here.' Hearing the comments, Carlton took to social media with his offending tweet that alluded to Hadley as a 'wife beater'. A furious Hadley then verbally attacked the former newspaper columnist on Wednesday morning dubbing the tweet ‘a low dog act by a low dog man’. 'It's defamatory to call someone a grub but I think in this instance I could perhaps prove to a court that he is a grub,' Hadley said, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. 'No wonder Fairfax sacked you, no wonder you can't get a job anywhere you low dog. I've had a gutful of your sort of nonsense. How dare you describe me as a wife beater.' The offending tweet: Carlton wrote this on Twitter after hearing Hadley say to his listeners: 'this is the best country in the world. If you don't embrace it you don't deserve to be here' in defence of the singlet's slogan . He later added: 'Now Mr Carlton, if you wish to call me a wife beater do it in a public forum and you and I will be in the supreme court as quickly as we can and whatever assets you have, I'll be after. 'If you ever wish to have a discussion with me personally I invite you to do it but of course when I put one on your chin, not a king hit, but when I put one on your chin you'd crawl off to the coppers and whinge your head off, you dog.' Carlton clearly thought very little about the physical threat against him. In response to being notified via Twitter of Hadley's comments, he simply replied: 'Sorry I missed it. Hadley couldn't knock the froth off a schooner'. The duo have are well known rivals in the media industry. Unaware of Hadley's violent threats towards him, Carlton was informed via Twitter of the slurs . However his response indicated he was unconcerned . Following Carlton's suspension and resignation from Fairfax media in August this year, Hadley gave a scathing speech during his segment in which he reflected on the former talk-host's career, calling him 'yesterday's man'. He also claimed that Carlton had 'vilifeied' him during his career as well as 'called me names and taken to me on social media'. In 2013 Carlton appeared on ABC's Australian Story as a critic of Hadley, who was the prime subject of the television show. He later complained that his comments were edited to present a more positive image of the 2GB presenter.","Ray Hadley threatened to 'put one on the chin' of former Fairfax columnist Mike Carlton during his morning segment on Wednesday .

"Police investigating ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist, it emerged last night. Kent Police used the billing and call data of a journalist at the Mail on Sunday to unmask the go-between in discussions involving the paper and Constance Briscoe, the judge who was jailed in May for her role in the affair. Prosecutors in the case, in which Huhne and his wife Vicky Pryce were convicted of perverting the course of justice, wanted Briscoe to give evidence that Huhne had pressured his wife to take speeding points on his behalf. Police investigating ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce (right) secretly obtained the phone records of a journalist to unmask the go-between in discussions involving Constance Briscoe (left) However, she was abandoned as a witness after it became apparent she had lied to the police about discussing the story with journalists. The Kent force’s use of its power to obtain telephone records has emerged a month after it was revealed the Metropolitan Police obtained another journalist’s phone data to uncover a whistleblower in the Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair. The case will raise new concerns about the fundamental right of journalists to protect sources.

"A planner was killed in front of his anguished fiancée after being hit by a bus as he crossed at a dangerous junction outside a railway station, an inquest has heard. The accident unfolded as 26-year-old Peter Van de Bulk and his wife-to-be Lauren Barwis, both from Watford, were hurrying to catch a train from Euston station, London, in March this year. The court heard Mr Van de Bulk tried to cross the road while the red man was showing, but lost his footing and slipped under the wheels of the number 253 bus, which was turning into the station. But the coroner described the crossing as 'substandard' because it forces pedestrians to wait 78 seconds before crossing - a wait deemed 'unreasonable' by collision investigators. Peter Van de Bulk, 26, pictured left, from Watford, was killed by a bus as he tried to cross at a 'substandard' crossing outside Euston station with his fiancée Lauren Barwis, 25, pictured right with Mr Van de Bulk . Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Dr William Dolman said: 'The figure of 78 seconds sticks in my mind. That is far too long for pedestrians hurrying to catch a train to wait.' At the inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court, the court heard how Mr Van de Bulk, a project planning apprentice with Transport for London, stepped into the road because he was anxious to get the train. When he realised he had stepped into the path of the bus, he retreated back to the pavement. But his feet slipped under him, forcing his legs under the wheels of the bus. The court heard how Mr Van de Bulk was in the driver's blind spot, meaning it would have been impossible for driver Tolu Oyenuga - who had right of way - to see him. Giving evidence at the inquest, Ms Barwis said the pair had been returning from Great Ormond Street Hospital, where they had been visiting relatives. The 25-year-old told the court how she watched paramedics battle for an hour to save her fiancé's life. She described how Mr Van de Bulk - whom she was due to marry in September - made eye contact with her and opened his mouth to speak in the moments before his death. She said: 'We were in a hurry to get to the station. I was on my phone and he was beside me, a pace away, he was muttering about train times. 'We approached the crossing in front of Euston Station and Peter was a step in front of me as we were approaching. I was on the edge of the pavement. The pair, who had been visiting relatives at Great Ormond Street Hospital, were due to marry in September this year . 'He stepped onto the road and seemed to slip and fall backwards. To be honest I don't remember when the impact happened. 'I just remember him rolling under the bus and the wheels were on him. We shouted to get the bus to move forward. I had my phone in my hand, but couldn't work out how to use it. But there were lots of people around me and one of them called 999. 'He was conscious to start with. As I leant over him he made eye contact with me and he opened his mouth as if to speak, but then his eyes rolled back.' PC Simon Wickenden, who investigated safety at the junction, told the court there had been one injury at the crossing in the past three years but that it was 'basically uncontrolled'. He said: 'The junction was basically uncontrolled. People had to wait 78 seconds to cross the road which is a long time, it is unreasonable to expect people to wait that long. It's not in human nature. 'Pedestrians cross the junction all the time regardless of traffic lights, unless a bus was clearly approaching. It is a substandard crossing.' Driver Mr Oyenuga, who has worked for Arriva for two years, said the first thing he knew about the accident was when he felt a 'thud' as his wheels rolled over the victim. He said: 'The traffic lights were green. I was waiting in the box junction for the traffic to clear before turning right into the station. 'I had done the proper checks and was turning right, I did not see anyone. I felt a thud on the back left hand tyre and someone shouted I had run over someone. 'I was in panic when I got out of the bus. Someone shouted for me to move the bus so I got in and moved it forward.' The court also heard from witness Toby Jackson, who was walking behind the couple at the time of the accident and called the ambulance. He said: 'The bus was travelling pretty slowly, about 10 mph. He stepped out into the road, saw the bus and tried to withdraw but he slipped as he stepped backwards. 'The bus came and it ran over his legs and then he was under the bus.' Mr Van de Bulk stepped into the path of the 253 bus, pictured left, while rushing to catch a train at Euston station, pictured right (file pics) A post mortem carried out by Dr Mike Sheaff ruled Mr Van de Bulk had died of multiple injuries to his legs, arms and chest. His injuries caused a cardiac arrest, as well as bleeding to the brain. He added: 'He fell unconscious quickly, he could not have suffered and did not know what happened.' Detective Sergeant Christopher Osborne told the court CCTV footage had shown Mr Van de Bulk had been in the driver's blindspot throughout the accident. He said: 'There was no criminal prosecution. Mr Van de Bulk was in the driver's blind spot as he began to make the turn. 'He remained in the driver's blind spot as he stepped into the road and the driver would not have been able to see him as he slipped and fell backwards onto the ground.' Coroner Dr William Dolman told the inquest that measures were being taken to make the crossing safer for future pedestrians. He said: 'This was a tragedy. He died under sad circumstances. My sympathies are with the victim and his family, and the bus driver as well. This accident was a one off.' Speaking after the inquest, Ms Barwis, who was due to marry her fiancé on September 6th, said she was 'happy' with the result. She said: 'I said at the time this was a tragic accident and the verdict agrees with that. I would like to make it clear we bear no grudges and do not blame the driver for his death. 'Peter was a legend. He lived life to the max. He lived far more in his short time on earth than many do in a lifetime.'","Peter Van de Bulk, from Watford, was rushing to Euston station, London .

"Victor Anichebe has revealed he will put himself through a personal boot camp to revive his season. The West Brom striker is ready for a fitness drive during the international break after his injury struggles. He had a hernia operation in September and made his first Barclays Premier League start since August in Sunday’s 2-0 defeat to Newcastle. Victor Anichebe has vowed to get fitter after returning to action in Sunday's clash with Newcastle . The striker underwent a hernia operation in September and made his first start since August on Sunday . The Baggies next go to Chelsea on November 22 and Anichebe is planning to return fighting fit. He said: 'For me, over the international break, I need to go away, come back and be as fit as possible. I don't feel as sharp and fit as I was at the start of the season but that will come. 'I came back about a month or six weeks ago from hernia surgery, something which reoccurred after I did it a couple of years ago. 'I need to go away, come back and take care of my own body and be fitter than I have been recently. 'I have the medical team here, they have helped me a lot and I have guys in America I have worked with a lot. Between the two we have come up with a fitness regime which will help me to get to where I should be. Anichebe said that he will take full advantage of the international break by getting back to full fitness . Since his £6million move from Everton in September, Anichebe has made just 16 starts for the Baggies . 'I will go away and I will do parts to try to get myself ready but I'll also be with the team. We just need to come back after the international break and be ready for the difficult fixtures ahead of us.' The former Everton starlet has only netted four goals for Albion since his £6million move from the Toffees in September last year. He has also made just 16 starts for the Baggies in over 12-months after struggling with a series of minor injuries. Anichebe has scored once in eight appearances this term and is desperate to prove his worth at The Hawthorns. 'For me it's very difficult,' said the 26-year-old. 'I had niggling injuries here and there and I have just come back from hernia surgery and I had some complications. That's not an excuse or anything, it's just normal. 'I feel a lot better and hopefully, given the break we've got, I can go away, get myself right and come back and help the team.'","Victor Anichebe is ready to push himself to the limit to reignite his season .

"Some Newtown, Connecticut residents say in a new survey that they want the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter's home torn down and the property turned into a park or nature preserve. The Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation received more than 1,600 responses to the survey it released on Monday on town residents' unmet needs in the wake of the December 2012 shootings. The foundation has been deciding how to distribute more than $11 million in donations made in response to the shootings, which left 20 first-graders and six educators dead. Some survey responses said money should be set aside to tear down gunman Adam Lanza's house in Newtown, where he killed his mother before going to the school. This is a photo of the Lanza residence on December 19, 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut shortly after the shooting took place . The survey found that counseling and cash assistance services were among families' top priorities. Some of the charities paying for mental health care for children and families affected by the Sandy Hook massacre are running short of money and officials don't know how much they'll need — and for how long — to repair the psychological scars from the mass shooting. Newtown officials are applying for a federal grant and charities are pooling their resources in an attempt to ensure that free long-term mental health care remains available following the December 2012 shooting that left 20 first graders and six teachers dead. 'We hear in the media, 'Well Sandy Hook was 14 months ago, isn't everything fine?'' said Candice Bohr, executive director of the Newtown Youth and Family Services. Well, no it's not and we get calls every day from the school wanting to address an issue. I would love to say that in 10 years we're going to see a huge drop and everyone's better and we've moved on, but that's not the case.' Three of the charities that have been providing funds for services have started working together, while the charity that has raised the most money — the Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation — says that it will likely join the alliance soon. Adam Lanza shot his mother Nancy Lanza (pictured) in their Connecticut home before he made his final journey to Sandy hook Elementary School . Photo of Adam Lanza taken when he was a middle school student at St. Rose Catholic School in Newtown, Connecticut . Adam Lanza shot his mother in their Connecticut home before he went to Sandy-Hook elementary and shot 20 first graders and six educators . The Newtown Lions Club, which raised $350,000 for mental-health services in the wake of the shooting, has told the 250 people it served that it could no longer directly pay their mental health bills because fundraising was being outpaced by demand. 'The demand was well beyond anything we could have predicted,' said Peter McNulty, president of the Lions Club. Other charities are picking up the slack. The town's Rotary Club and the Newtown Memorial Fund, which had been spending a combined $30,000 a month on mental health care for 150 families, partnered with the Lions Club, said Brian Mauriello, founder of the Newtown Memorial Fund. Those who need help are being steered to the state's Office of Victim Services, which processes applications for money from a pool created by all three charities. So far, nobody has been turned down. 'I don't think anybody has a crystal ball to say whether there's going to be enough money or not,' said Linda Cimino, the director of the state Office of Victim's Services 'I do know that the plan is for a 15-year horizon.' The Newtown-Sandy Hook Community . Foundation has about $4 million left after giving more than $7 million . to the 40 families most affected by the shooting. Much . of the remaining money likely will go into the mental health care pool, . said Jennifer Barahona, the foundation's executive director. She said . they expect to announce an alliance with the Lions/Rotary/Newtown . Memorial Fund group in the coming weeks. We . recognize that as the largest of the funds, we will need to pick up the . slack over the years as some of the other funds really dwindle — as the . Lions' has,' she said. The idea is to still have money available as those who were in elementary school at the time of the shooting reach adulthood. Meanwhile, . the town is seeking more than $7 million in a federal grant, in part to . help cover the next 18 months of costs for the nonprofit agencies . providing free mental health care. The grant also would create a . 'recovery and resiliency' board, which would help match people with . specific services and programs. In this handout crime scene evidence photo provided by the Connecticut State Police, shows Lanza's house on Yogananda St. following the December 14, 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School . 'This is about building a safety net of ongoing support for those in the mental health system, and to capture new people who have needs,' Pat Llodra, the town's first selectwoman, told town officials when announcing the grant application two months ago. Bohr said her organization saw an 85 percent jump in clients after the Sandy Hook shooting, and had to quadruple its staff, adding 29 positions. They have been providing everything from intense one-on-one therapy, to simple advice to parents who come in asking how to deal with their children's questions about the shooting. Another nonprofit, the Resiliency Center of Newtown, opened in September. It has served about 500 people with free programs such as art and music therapy, grief counseling, and parenting classes. Stephanie Cinque, the executive director, said they have been funded with private donations, but she is counting on the federal grant money to keep the programing going. While they await a response to the grant request, Cinque said it's clear the services are having an impact. 'After all the therapy she'd been through since 12/14 we never thought we'd have her back,' the mother of a Sandy Hook student who completed a self-esteem program wrote in an email shared by Cinque. 'And we have our daughter back.'","The Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation is deciding how to distribute $11 million in donations made in response to the shootings .

"Jean-Paul Gaultier has never been one to shy away from controversy, having previously used transgender models and a topless Madonna on his catwalks. So it should come as no surprise to see bearded drag queen and Eurovision winner Conchita Wurst gracing the catwalk for his haute couture autumn/winter 2014 show. Conchita, the female alter-ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth, closed the couture show yesterday on the Rue Saint Martin in Paris. Scroll down for video . Breaking boundaries: Drag queen, Conchita Wurst closed the Jean-Paul Gaultier show at the couture shows in Paris . The singer wore a bridal gown that was entirely black and adorned with gold and red embellishment and finished with a black veil and a hairline of black sequins. It was evidently a proud moment for Gaultier, who took to one knee in front of the Austrian singer. Conchita was not the only alternative model to grace the catwalk, with 56-year-old Swiss model Catherine Loewe also making an appearance before taking a tumble while on the runway. Changing perceptions: Jean-Paul Gaultier is known for making political statements through his model casting . Not like a virgin: Conchita wore a black bridal dress completed with black wedding veil . Gaultier went down on one knee in front of his new friend Conchita . Rising star: Conchita has gone from strength to strength following her win at the Eurovision Song Contest . Details: Conchita had jewels laid out around her hairline and wore an impressive pair of false eyelashes . The collection itself featured dark, Gothic pieces, including black fur coats, paneled leather pencil skirts and circular crinoline skirts. Gaultier's most breath-taking piece was one he named 'Maleficent' - inspired by Angelina Jolie's recent role as the Disney villain - which saw a model wearing a black bustier with mink bands and dark crepe pants holding out a mirror in which she stared, pouted and cackled. Controversial: 56-year-old Swiss model Catherine Loewe also took to the runway . Oops! The model unfortunately took a tumble during her catwalk appearance . The use of drag in the designers show attracted much support and admiration from his fans including director, Baz Luhrmann who brought drag-queens to our screens in films such as Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet. The director, spurred on by the liberated show, spoke openly about gay rights, praising Gaultier for his groun-breaking approach. 'Gaultier was always about transgender sexuality, about high and low,' he added 'for him to be having his show crowned by the grand dame of drag queen or transsexual expression is appropriate.' Wicked: Jean-Paul Gaultier's collection is inspired by Disney Villains . The 51-year-old director referred to the recent backlash . against gay rights around the world, especially in France and several US . states, adding that seeing Conchita in a mainstream fashion show indicates that gay rights are advancing. 'What you see is a sort of reaction against how successful it's been.' This was not the first encounter between Gaultier and Conchita; the pair met at the 2014 Life Ball, one of the world's largest AIDS charities. Full support: Director, Baz Luhrmann praised Gaultier on changing the perceptions of gay rights. He is seen arriving at the show with his wife Catherine Martin (right) They were spotted later, hand in hand, at the Vogue Foundation Gala dinner at the Palais Galliera. Gaultier's controversial approach has seen him reap financial rewards: 'I can say yes, it is profitable. I love it as we have more and more clients. I am proud to be a designer of couture.' He says the secret of his success is to make wearable clothes, but to not compromise on the couture craftsmanship. 'Do couture truly as couture.'

"Sierra Leone's president has made a desperate plea for Australia to up their response to the deadly Ebola virus sweeping West Africa. In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Tony Abbott, President Ernest Bai Koroma said they need urgent help in the form of military aid, as Sierra Leone is quickly losing the battle against the disease which has already claimed the lives of thousands. In the letter, dated September 18, Mr Koroma warns the nation's health system had already been overwhelmed by the virus which, according to the World Health Organisation, has claimed 3338 lives and infected 7178 since the beginning of the year. The president of Sierra Leone has a made a direct request to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott for help fighting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa . 'While we are doing everything possible to stop the outbreak, further support is urgently needed from your friendly government to scale up our national response with ... education efforts, as well as infection control measures,' the letter read. Mr Koroma makes a specific request for Australia to deploy military health units, logisticians and engineers. 'Having watched the response of the Australian military to similar humanitarian emergencies, most recently Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, I know that it is uniquely placed to help us in the fight against Ebola.' President Ernest Bai Koroma sent a letter to Mr Abbott specifically requesting military aid, medical experts and logistical support . The letter finished with the admission that Sierra Leone is 'counting on Australia' to send the help the country so desperately needs . This comes as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced on Thursday Australia would immediately boost its financial contribution to fighting the worst ever outbreak of the deadly disease by another $10 million, taking the total commitment to $18 million. But so far the Australian government has ruled out sending medical experts and logistical support - which has prompted criticism from aid organisations, including Save the Children and Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). The organisations, while welcoming the additional aid money provided to the cause, were not satisfied with Australia's refusal to send medical aid, as other world leaders deploy troops and medical experts in their thousands. President Ernest Bai Koroma revealed in the letter that Sierra Leone's health system is totally overwhelmed by the disease . The Australian government has so far ruled out sending medical help, but on Thursday increased the financial contribution . Mr Koroma also wrote in the letter that Australian military aid could potentially help save thousands of lives. 'We are counting on Australia to send us the military personnel we so desperately need to fight back against the virus and prevent the positive developments of the last 10 years from being undone.' Ms Bishop on Thursday said the government has assessed that financial contributions were the best and most efficient way Australia could make a rapid contribution to the global response to the crisis. According to the World Health Organisation Ebola has claimed 3338 lives and infected 7178 since the beginning of the year . The US has committed up to 3000 troops while the UK will spend $185 million on its mission, including supporting 700 Ebola treatment beds across Sierra Leone. 'Make no mistake, this crisis is at tipping point. We need to act urgently and decisively,' Save the Children acting chief Mat Tinkler said. The UN is seeking $US50 million ($AU54 million) from donors to meet immediate needs over the next four weeks, including for logistics to deliver equipment, materials and supplies to Ebola response operations.","President Ernest Bai Koroma asked for military aid and medical experts .

"They may not have the rippling muscles and chiseled features of a typical pin-up. But these 12 men are set to become unlikely stars - after being picked for a calendar celebrating Britain's most boring men. A drain spotter, traffic cone enthusiast and brick collector are among the 'boring' Britons who appear in The Dull Men's Club calendar. A man who collects milk bottles, the founder of the Apostrophe Protection Society and a retired greenkeeper who loves lawnmowers have also made it into the top dozen. The Dull Men's Club has more than 5,000 male members, who are passionate about everyday mundane things. Leland Carlson, assistant vice-president of the Club, decided to publish the calendar to celebrate its dullest members and their very boring obsessions. 'We wanted to have a bit of fun.

March's mundane man is drain spotter Archie Workman, from Cumbria, who works as a lengthsman maintaining verges and ditches. He said: 'I find the drain covers so interesting. There's a lot of history behind them. It's interesting to observe the geometry of the drains and how they interconnect. There's a whole world underneath us that we don't realize.' Steve Wheeler, 66, from Malvern in Worcestershire, has spent 30 years collecting more than 20,000 milk bottles. This dull fetish has earned him a place as Mr April - because this is the month he likes to 'spring clean his bottles'. He found his first bottle in the mid-1980s and now Mr Wheeler, who admits he doesn't even like milk, houses them in an 80ft museum in his garden. 'I'm Mr April as this is the month I give the bottles their annual Spring clean,' he said. 'I've met some of the other people in the calendar and I think we are all the exact opposite of dull. It's just that we don't do the sport thing, we are individuals and not team players. 'I have people come to visit my collection from all over the world and I'm about to expand my museum by another 24 feet. 'Ironically I don't even like milk, I've always thought of it as baby food. But I do love glass. It's not only the bottles I love. It's the thrill of finding them and the people I meet when I'm collecting them.' May is the turn of Michael Kennedy, 73, from Hunstanton in Norfolk, who spends two hours every day, except Saturdays, moving rocks to build a seawall. He has shifted more than 200 tons of rocks over the past 14 years to prevent erosion of cliffs lining the coast. He said: 'I used to walk to Old Hunstanton and back, two and a half miles every day, but that wasn't enough physical exercise for me. 'I started moving rocks and now I can't stop. It's better than sitting in an armchair. I'll do it for as long as I'm healthy.'

'Some people probably think it's dull. If I go to dinner parties and tell people I'm a cone collector they quickly move on,' he said. 'My children are slightly embarrassed by my collection. I store them in the shed, the garage, the greenhouse and even under the bed. Luckily they stack well. 'I carry traffic cones with me in the car and if I see a rare one I ask if I can swap it.'

"The mystery of why a simple cold can trigger a life-threating asthma attack may have been solved by British scientists. They’ve shown that asthmatics make more of chemical that sends the immune system into overdrive. The exciting discovery, from Imperial College London and Kings College London, paves the way for drugs that will better control the distressing and potentially deadly attacks. Scroll down for video . Scientists have found that, when suffering from a cold, asthmatics make more of a chemical which sends the immune system into overdrive and can trigger attacks . Dr Samantha Walker, of Asthma UK, which part-funded the research, said: ‘Asthma still remains a relative mystery and the millions of people with asthma need more studies like this to bring us one step closer to new treatments.’ Almost 5.5 million Britons are being treated for asthma - that is one in every 12 adults and one in every 11 children. But while the condition is normally kept under control day to day using steroid inhalers, flare-ups are harder to treat and the lung condition kills some 1,200 people each year in the UK. Asthmatics make much more an immune chemical called IL-25 than other people. IL25 then triggers the release of other damaging chemicals which are believed to be behind the symptoms of a severe asthma attack . Many potentially deadly attacks are triggered by nothing more than a common cold – and now scientists think they know why. They’ve found that when they have a cold, asthmatics make much more an immune chemical called IL-25 than other people. IL25 then triggers the release of other damaging chemicals which are believed to be behind the symptoms of a severe asthma attack. The study’s joint lead author, Dr Nathan Bartlett, of Imperial College London, said: ‘Our research has shown for the first time that the cells that line the airways of asthmatics are more prone to producing a small molecule called IL-25, which then appears to trigger a chain of events that causes attacks. ‘By targeting this molecule at the top of the cascade, we could potentially discover a much-needed new treatment to control this.’ Co-lead author, Professor Sebastian Johnston, of the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London, said: ‘Existing medication containing inhaled steroids are highly effective at controlling regular asthma symptoms, but during an attack the symptoms worsen and can lead to the patient going to hospital. ‘This new study provides exciting results about potential ways to address this big unmet medical need.'","Asthmatics make more of an immune chemical when they have colds .

"A mother risked her own health for that of her unborn son when she delayed having chemotherapy until he was born. Justine Colbeck, 36, was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 31 weeks pregnant. She decided to delay chemotherapy treatment to give her baby boy the best chance of being born healthy. Sebastian, now nine months old, was born on Christmas Eve last year and Mrs Colbeck started her treatment for breast cancer just ten days later. Justine Colbeck, 36, was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was just 31 weeks pregnant but decided to delay chemotherapy treatment until after her son Sebastian, now nine months old, was born . Mrs Colbeck was able to breast feed Sebastian for ten days before starting chemotherapy treatment . After undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a mastectomy, she is now on the road to recovery. Mrs Colbeck, from Garstang, Lancashire, said she does not regret delaying her treatment. She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision - our baby had to come first. 'The cancer could have spread because we'd delayed the treatment. Sitting in the waiting room to find out with my ten day old baby was the most terrifying moment of my life. 'If I'd had treatment during my pregnancy then every time Sebastian got sick I would be questioning if it was my fault. 'I couldn't have lived with that.' Mrs Colbeck and husband Logan, 35, found out they were expecting a baby in June last year. They had always wanted a little brother or sister for their six-year-old son Zachary, but after five years, the pregnancy came as a surprise. Mrs Colbeck, a dentist, said: 'Sebastian was a very wanted baby, but I was working full time and having another baby had just gone to the back of my mind. 'We were delighted when we found out. 'My boobs got a lot bigger and both were lumpy during my pregnancies - it was the way I knew I was pregnant in the first place - but as I got further into this one I realised one of them was getting smaller. 'I knew something wasn't right, so I made an appointment with the midwife. 'I was very lucky she took me seriously. I have since heard stories of other women my age being fobbed off because they are ""too young for breast cancer"". Sebastian was born on Christmas eve, and his parents were delighted that Zachary, six, had a little brother . Breast cancer during pregnancy is very rare, occurring in about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies. Most women are between 32 and 38 years old when they are diagnosed. During pregnancy, a woman's breasts change in readiness for breastfeeding, with the breast tissue becoming more dense. This can make it more difficult to find changes in the breast that are due to cancer, such as a lump. In fact, research shows that during pregnancy, there is often a delay in diagnosis in women who get breast symptoms. Of those women diagnosed with cancer, most are able to carry on with their pregnancy. Rarely, some may need to think about whether to end the pregnancy (termination). But usually this is only necessary if chemotherapy is needed and the woman is less than 14 weeks pregnant. Usually it is possible to delay chemotherapy treatment until after  the 14 week stage. Source: Cancer Research UK . Following an examination by her midwife and her GP, Mrs Colbeck was urgently referred to the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. Further tests over the next two weeks confirmed her worst fears - that she had breast cancer. She said: 'It didn't come as a shock to me because of my medical background. By the time I was seen by the breast unit, the nipple was already being pulled to one side and the skin under my nipple was puckered due to the spreading cancer. 'I hadn't told Logan at that point because I didn't want to worry him when I had no proof, but when I did he was incredible. 'He came straight to the next appointment with me, where we were told about treatment.' Mr and Mrs Colbeck then faced the agonising decision of whether to start her chemotherapy straight away or delay it until after Sebastian was born, risking that the cancer would spread further. Mrs Colbeck said: 'There was an option for me to start chemotherapy straight away, with a reduced-strength drug, given weekly instead of once every three weeks. 'But I was already 33 weeks pregnant and it wasn't certain that I would see out the course before giving birth. 'There was also little evidence of what the drugs could do to my baby in the long term and it would have meant I couldn't breastfeed him when he was born. 'I had breastfed my first son until he was nine months old. I loved it and felt it gave the best of starts for the baby. 'Logan and I discussed it and we decided we needed to put him first.' In the end, Mrs Colbeck was induced three weeks early and Sebastian was born on Christmas Eve, weighing 5lb 8oz. She she said she tried to keep Christmas as normal as possible for Zachary and opened presents in the hospital as a family. Mrs Colbeck is now at home enjoying time with her two boys Zachary, six and Sebastian, nine months old at their family home in Garstang, Lancashire . She was then able to breastfeed Sebastian for 10 days before she started chemotherapy on January 3 this year. She said: 'I was worrying about making the switch, but because it was just 10 days, Sebastian did it no problem. 'With all the ""breast is best"" publicity I was worried about him, but I needn't have. He has grown into a perfectly healthy little baby.' She endured six rounds of chemotherapy at full strength, but then developed an infection which delayed her mastectomy until June. Seven weeks after the surgery she started radiotherapy, which finished three weeks ago. She now must have a chemotherapy injection every three weeks until March, and after that will take tablets for the next 10 years to help prevent the cancer coming back. Mrs Colbeck said: 'I don't regret the decision for a second. 'I could never have forgiven myself if I'd had the treatment while pregnant and something had happened to Sebastian.' Mrs Colbeck and husband Logan, 35, a strategic manger were 'delighted' when they discovered she was pregnant with her second child as it came as a surprise . Her husband, a strategic manager, has now carried out a charity swim for Cancer Care and they are hoping to raise money for the oncology unit at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. He said: 'I never thought that I would be 34 years old and being told my wife has cancer. 'My main worry was the boys. To not have their mum around from an early age would have been devastating. 'We worked through the problem together and decided to get the baby here first. 'Spending Christmas in hospital was different, but we made it work. 'We couldn't have asked for more from Justine's treatment. '[The local charity] Cancer Care were also there for us the whole time. They had chats with the whole family to make sure everyone was okay. 'The swim raised around £1,300 and we are now looking to do something for the oncology unit.'","Justine Colbeck, 36, was 'delighted' to find out she was pregnant .

"Germans are marking 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it seems some can't resist reliving the 'bad old days' of Communism. Deep in the forests of former East Germany they are spending the night in an authentic Stasi bunker - complete with military uniforms, rations and formal training for a Cold War chemical attack. Teenagers not yet born when the wall fell are among those signing up for the 14-hour tour at the Bunkermuseum Frauenwald, a 38,750 sq ft underground complex which once had enough supplies to last 130 occupants up to a year. Nostalgia for the East: At 15 years old, Jesset Kogel (pictured) was not yet born when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 - but he is now one of a growing number of people spending the night as soldiers in a Stasi-built Cold War bunker hidden in the woods near the city of Suhl . Listening in: A night in the bunker, which had a radio transmitter to reach the outside world, costs punters £87 including their rations . Shrine: The Stasi re-enactors brush up on the news of the day next to a banner depicting Karl Marx laid out on the conference table . Camouflage: Twin staircases leading to the 38,750 sq ft complex were concealed in a warehouse, with only this lookout post as a clue . Hidden in the woods near the city of Suhl, it was one of at least 15 similar bunkers meant to serve as command and administrative centres in case of war. The airtight bunker - whose twin access staircases were concealed inside a warehouse - had decontamination units and oxygen tanks in case of a chemical weapons attack in the world outside. It also had cooking facilities, bedrooms, a dining room, its own power supply and a command centre which used telegraph wires and a radio transmitter to keep up contact with the outside world. But the bunker was not perfect - as it was not radiation-proof, and would have been safe for only a week in an all-out nuclear war. Its active service ended in 1990 when Germany was reunified, and in 1997 it was turned into a museum which now has 20,000 visitors a year. Rations: Many original East German food products were taken off the shelves after reunification in 1990, and there is an interest in finding old examples. The biscuit in this picture are genuine, but the 'NVA field soup' was produced later to poke fun at the regime . Say cheese! Visitor Tobias Merkel, dressed as a soldier from the East German National People's Army (NVA), photographs his friend Andreas Zahn with a mannequin in a gas mask in the warehouse placed over the bunker. It now holds a military vehicle display . Drill: The 14-hour overnight 'experience' includes preparations for chemical warfare. The bunker had oxygen tanks and air filters . Cramped: Tobias Merkel inspects his accommodation in a small dormitory. The phenomenon of reliving Communism is called Ostalgie . I call top bunk: Jesset Kogel, 15, assigns his fellow visitors to bunk beds. Others will take part in the night watch to check for 'attacks' Dinner time: The participants preparing to cook for themselves. The bunker had supplies to keep inhabitants safe for up to a year . Not all of it survived, as top-secret aspects of a technical base in the warehouse over the bunker were destroyed completely. The warehouse now houses military vehicles instead. Nowadays the Bunkermuseum Frauenwald is a privately-owned museum which teams up with a local hotel for its £87-a-night stays. Visitors dress as East German army soldiers for a more authentic experience and cook their own meals, before donning gas masks and training for a chemical weapons strike in the darkened woods. The more hardy among them take up night watches as well as sleeping in the bunker's cramped, windowless dormitories. But it's not quite the feat of endurance faced by their Stasi predecessors, as the fee includes 'relaxation time' the next morning in the hotel's sauna. Thomas Krüger, who helps run the tours, told MailOnline they were popular with visitors under 30. 'The bunker is visited by some people to experience how such military installations were created and equipped,' he said. 'Others are interested in the historical and political aspect that goes into these systems. 'The level of interest is high because such military or intelligence objects are secret and unavailable to the public while they are in active operation.' 'Younger people show an interest in the museum. They are often encouraged or taken by schools and parents to visit the bunker.' Last week Germany marked 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989. TV footage of jubilant Berlin citizens perched atop the wall, an act which for decades would have earned them a gunshot to the back, inspired people around the world and has grown in legend to become the defining image of the fall of Communism.

Saving lives: Museum employee and 'Sergeant' Olaf Schumann explains the functions of the original gas mask system to his visitors .

Play a Stasi officer: Visitor Marco Schmidt contemplates the state of the Cold War next to a hand-drawn map in the control room . Young soldier: Jesset Kogel examines  military telecommunications equipment. The visit came 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall . The Bunkermuseum's popularity has increased with the rise of Ostalgie, a phenomenon which sees Germans paying big money to relive the days of the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR). The word is a combination of Ost (East) and nostalgia (nostalgie), and came to prominence a decade ago with the release of the hit film Good Bye, Lenin! 1800 Arrival and briefing at forest bunker . 1830 Cook dinner with original DDR rations . 2000 'Basic training' and a bunker tour . 2330 Bed time - or start of the night watch . 0730 Wake-up call and 'breakfast sports' 0800 Vacate the bunker and debrief . 0830 Retreat to a sauna in nearby hotel . The Bafta-nominated bittersweet comedy followed the fictional character Alex Kerner, whose mother falls into a coma shortly before the Berlin Wall falls and awakes during the rise of capitalism. Convinced she will be unable to accept Germany's brave new world, Alex goes to impossible lengths to trick his mother into thinking the Communist state is still alive and well. The film was followed by a string of other cinema releases and TV shows which observed the everyday lives of people in the DDR, while manufacturers of nostalgia saw sales increase. Other relics from the Communist past - such as the hat-wearing green man (Ampelmann) marking road crossings in East Berlin - remained popular almost from the day the wall fell. So-called Ostalgie sparked a debate in the German media when it emerged. While many said it was a good way to remember the past, some support groups accused the trend of 'glorifying' the past and glossing over its downsides, which included stifling state surveillance and the execution of 'traitors'. A later hit about life in East Germany, The Lives of Others (2006), won the Oscar for best foreign-language film by painting a much grimmer picture of the DDR - delving into the Stasi's eavesdropping on those suspected of being disloyal to the regime, and the human tragedies it caused. But Mr Krüger insisted: 'Our visitors are no more or less nostalgic than any other human being. 'They want nothing more to learn from their own history, to see and understand the political history of their country, especially if they were not involved in  intelligence or military service.' Comrades: The bunker hidden deep in the forest has original Cold War-era memorabilia, including this East German radio and an image showing a Soviet (right) and East German soldier with the motto: 'Class brothers - weapons brothers - unified unconquerable!' A little out of date! In one corner, a portrait of Communist Party Secretary Erich Honecker hangs over a 'modern' Robotron computer . Ears close to the ground: Military telecommunications devices in the bunker. The Stasi were famed for their surveillance programmes . Hello operator: In the case of full-blown war between East and West, the bunker would have served as a vital command post . Affectionate: An original calendar which still hangs in the bunker museum carries a pencil sketch of an East German military vehicle . Remembering the past: Visitors Eric Merkl, Marco Schmidt and Tobias Merkl mingle during the £87 tour under memorabilia of the former communist East Germany (DDR) - including the East German flag and portraits of Vladimir Lenin and other communist-era leaders .","Underground chamber was built by 1970s East German secret police in a hidden pocket of forest near city of Suhl .

"Police are investigating the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl at a private international school in the Indian city of Bangalore. According to the complaint, the girl was crying when her mother picked her from the school and initially said that someone beat her up. The mother noticed wounds on the girl's private parts and she then admitted that she had been sexually abused by 'an uncle in school'. Schoolchildren shout slogans as they carry placards during a demonstration in New Delhi against the rape of a five year old girl in April . Police are examining CCTV footage for clues and are awaiting a report on the child's medical condition after she was admitted to hospital. 'The preliminary medical report revealed injuries to her private parts. The girl is in shock. We will question her on Wednesday,' a police officer told The Times Of India. Senior police officers visited the school campus on Tuesday night and interrogated six male teachers. No arrests or detentions were made. A criminal case has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012 and under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code for rape. The school has eight campuses in Bangalore, besides branches in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. The incident is the third case in four months of a young female student being allegedly sexually assaulted on a Bangalore school campus. Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau in India for 2013 show one rape was reported every 21 minutes . In August it was revealed that an eight year-old girl had been allegedly sexually assaulted by her 63-year-old teacher over a period of time. A month earlier the 'gang-rape' of a six-year-old girl at Vibgyor High School provoked public outrage, with many accusing the school of not handling the situation properly. In the wake of the demonstrations, police came up with elaborate guidelines for schools to better secure the campus for children. Several schools have complained about the guidelines and claim they will drain them of resources. The guidelines include the installation of CCTV cameras on campus and GPS on school buses. Scrutiny of sexual violence has grown in India since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a Delhi bus. The crime sparked days of protests and forced the government to introduce tougher anti-rape laws, including doubling prison terms for rapists to 20 years and the death penalty. The law also made it a crime for officers to refuse to open cases when complaints are made. But the law appears to have failed to act as an adequate deterrent. Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau for 2013 show one rape was reported every 21 minutes.","Police are investigating the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl at a private international school in Bangalore .

"Josh Elliott has opened up about the ‘absurdist melodrama’ that has started since his sudden decision to leave Good Morning America was made public on Sunday. ‘It has been really difficult,’ he said. ‘It's been difficult to read categorical falsehood after categorical falsehood.’ He wouldn't comment on ABC News President Ben Sherwood's memo to ABC News employees announcing his departure this weekend, where Sherwood wrote that ‘we worked hard to close a significant gap between our generous offer and his expectations.’ Scroll down for video . Making the switch: Josh Elliott, pictured here in 2012, said that the root of his move to NBC was his love of sports but it is widely understood to be as a result of contract negotiations . Neither party has commented on the . specific details of his contract negotiation, it has been widely . reported that ABC offered him $5million to stay with Good Morning . America but he wanted double that, asking for $10million. A source told People that he will now be paid less than both of those figures, reportedly accepting a $4million deal with NBC. ‘In the end, it had nothing to do with money,’ he said. ‘It . wasn't at all about anyone or anything at ABC... It was about what lies . ahead for me at NBC Sports. I have always wanted to be part of an . Olympics broadcast, and the opportunity to cover sports that captivate . America was too good to pass up,’ Elliott told People. ‘There were two great offers on the table, and it certainly was a difficult choice to make. I feel I made the best one.’ He . turned down the offer to remain at ABC's top-rated morning show to be . what he described as ‘the last man on the bench with the showtime . Lakers’. Leaving 'the family': Elliott was part of the team that helped ABC beat Today in the ratings war, but now that he left his colleague Amy Robach (right) has been promoted to one of the main anchor positions . During a conference . call on Wednesday arranged by his new employer, NBC, Elliott credited . Sherwood with giving him the big break in his career. Sherwood ‘is and always will be the reason I'm here,’ Elliott said. ‘I will forever love him deeply and passionately for it.’ ABC . said there will likely be a taped tribute to Elliott on ‘Good Morning . America,’ but it won't include a live appearance by him. Elliott . reiterated that his defection from ABC's ‘Good Morning America’ for NBC . is a ‘deeply personal’ move to get back to his sports reporting roots. NBC . described his role during the Wednesday conference call, explaining . that he will cover future Olympics, NFL football and other events. His NBC debut is planned for the May 3 Kentucky Derby broadcast. ‘I have loved sports since before I could walk,’ said Elliott, 42. Eying a spot: Michael Strahan (pictured today) confirmed that he is in negotiations to join the GMA team in addition to co-hosting 'Live with Kelly and Michael', which also airs on ABC . He said he dreamed of being on an Olympics broadcast before he even knew he wanted to be in television. He . worked at Sports Illustrated and then ESPN before 2011 when Sherwood . played a hunch and hired him as news anchor at ‘Good Morning America.’ The . arrival of Elliott and Lara Spencer built a feel-good team in the . morning that prospered as ‘Today’ went through the excruciating exit of .

"A property in Scotland so filthy neighbours named it 'Steptoe House' has been sold for £100,000 despite the council spending more than £30,000 cleaning it up before auction. The four-bedroom home in Monikie, Angus, descended into squalor over ten years during which Angus Council pleaded with its residents - a couple jailed for committing fraud - to clear some of its clutter. Once Alexander and Moira Ewart were released from jail for plundering the estate of an elderly relative, officials implemented an enforcement action and began clearing the site, using a 40-tonne crane to remove cars and boats from its grounds. The house in Monikie, Angus, was so filthy neighbours nicknamed it the Steptoe House after a sitcom about poverty and squalor . The property descended into squalor when its residents were both jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud offences . The council implemented two enforcement actions to the cost of around £30,000 including interest following complaints from other residents . But despite spending £32,000 on tidying the grounds, there may not be any money left over from the sale of the property once other creditors are reimbursed. Chief among them is Halifax Bank of Scotland which has security over the property. 'Together with the sequestration fees I don't think there will be very much to be realised towards the council and there are other avenues we could explore regarding the recovery of the debt,' said a senior council official said. 'The secure creditor is Halifax Bank of Scotland who has the security over the property. My understanding is that security will swallow up most of the amount that was recovered from the sale.' Angus Council officials intervened when the Ewarts failed to clear the property after their 18-month jail sentences in 2005. A 40-tonne crane had to be brought to the property for officials to remove cars and boats that were rotting in its grounds . Angus Council used more than 20 skips to clear some of the rubbish during two enforcement actions in 2007 and 2009 after the residents failed to clear up the clutter . It is thought the couple handed over ownership of the house to their son, who was declared bankrupt earlier this year . Dirty clothes and towels hang in the cluttered garden at the home described by one councillor as the Steptoe House for its filth . Bankruptcy officials sought permission to list the house for sale at auction, with an anonymous buyer offering £100,000 for the property last month . 2005: Alexander and Moira Ewart are both jailed for 18 months after plundering estate of elderly relative . 2007: Angus Council imposes an enactment action to clear property costing around £16,000 . 2009: A second action is taken to improve the state of the property, adding another £13,000 to council's bill . August 2014: The property is listed with Future Property Auctions after KPMG bankruptcy officials receive permission from court to sell house . September 2014: The home is sold for £100,000. Angus Council officials remain hopeful they will see some of the money spent on the house returned through proceeds of the sale . October 2014: At a council meeting it is suggested that no funds will be reimbursed, with the security holder Halifax first in line to receive cash from the sale . The house has been known to local residents as the Steptoe House since a councillor remarked it was similar to the squalor depicted in the television series, Steptoe and Son. The BBC programme, which began in 1962, tells the story of a British man Harold Steptoe (played by Harry H. Corbett) and his father, Alfred Steptoe (played by Wilfrid Brambell) who run a rag'n'bone business in London and live in abject poverty. It ended in 1974 after four popular series. In 2007, more than 20 skip-loads of rubbish were removed from the garden after it was described by a councillor as looking like a scene from the television programme Steptoe and Son. The effort cost more than £16,000, with interest rates adding another £3,000 to the bill.  A second clear-up was carried out in 2009 to the tune of a further £13,000. The couple then transferred the property to their son, who was declared bankrupt. In September it was listed by Future Property Auctions, which said the property would require 'a degree of refurbishment prior to habitation.' Despite selling for three times as much as what was spent by the local authority, the majority of proceeds from the sale will be used to settle unpaid tax and bank bills. Angus Council declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.","Angus council spent around £32,000 and nine years attempting to clear up the squalid property in Monikie .

"A man and his girlfriend have been arrested and been charged multiple times of cruelty to animals, including owning animals to fight. Hewitt Grant II, 47, and his partner 44-year-old Nickie Nicole Sanders are being held in the Polk jail in Fort Meade, Florida, awaiting their first court appearances. Deputies learned of the suspected dog fighting and animal cruelty after receiving a tip from Crime Stoppers. They found 69 dogs, many with scars and with recent fighting wounds.

The practice helps to strengthen the animals' necks for fighting. The sixty or so remaining dogs were in wooden kennels and crates in filthy and dirty conditions. Jail records show that Grant has been accused of mistreating animals in the past. He was arrested in 2006 after finding 139 dogs, 123 of them pit bulls, at his home near Mulberry. All of them had to be euthanized. A year later he was found guilty of 80 counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and sentenced to 364 days in county jail. These pens use to house pit bull dogs in the most appalling conditions. Most of them will have to be put down . This Pit Bull was one of 69 confiscated by the Sheriff's Office during raids on Bartow and Fort Meade properties in Florida . This isn't the first time Grant has been accused of mistreating animals. In 2006 he was arrested  after police found 139 dogs at his home. A year later, he was found guilty of 80 counts of animal cruelty and jailed for a year . Seven dogs at the former bar and four at Grant's house were chained with heavy logging chains — a common practice used to strengthen the animals' necks for fighting . Despite being told that it would be illegal for him to ever own dogs again, Grant went ahead regardless. In a bizarre twist of events, Grant launched an appear which found the search of his property was illegal (despite have well over a hundred dogs on the premises). He then even filed against the Sheriff's Office seeking more than $10 million in damages. The suit was dismissed two months later. Much like the dogs found in 2006, Martin said, the fate of the 69 found Wednesday does not look good and most of them will h ave to be euthanized because of their exceptionally aggressive behavior. 'We like to think we rescued these dogs, but the reality of it is, this guy created dogs that are really dangerous,' police said. 'So our hands are kind of tied because these dogs are so dangerous they're not dogs that people will want to take home. We don't want to put these dogs down, but obviously that's going to happen to some of them and we don't have a choice.' Deputies learned of the suspected dog fighting and animal cruelty after receiving a tip from Crime Stoppers as many of the dogs were stored in this home which looks entirely unsuspecting . The Pit Bulls were conditioned to be aggressive and only had a very small space in which to live .","Hewitt Grant II, 47,  and his partner 44-year-old Nickie Nicole Sanders are being held in custody in Fort Meade, Florida .

"More children can identify Simon Cowell than an avacado, new figures reveal. While 80 per cent of children could instantly recognise the X Factor judge, only 62 per cent were able to name the avocado when shown a picture of the vegetable. The research, which polled six to 10-year-olds found famous faces were more familiar to children than the avocado. More children could identify Simon Cowell, left, than an avocado. Only 62 per cent of those survey correctly recognised the vegetable while 80 per cent knew who the X Factor judge was. According to the poll, which surveyed 500 children, 85 per cent correctly identified David Beckham, with 72 per cent also recognising Prince William from a picture and 70 per cent correctly identifying prime minister David Cameron. But when it came to the avocado, just 62 per cent knew what it was, while the other children said they didn't know or mistook it for another fruit or vegetable. This compares to other fresh food, with 93 per cent correctly identifying a picture of a cucumber and 95 per cent knowing what an apple was. David Beckham, left was more recognisable than the avocado with 85 per cent of children correctly identifying him. Prince William, right was also identified by 72 per cent of children . But when it came to trying different fruits and vegetables, more than half had not tasted an avocado and 68 per cent had never tried kale. However, other vegetables were more widely known, with only 15 per cent saying they had not tasted cabbage, nine per cent having never tried broccoli and one in ten saying they had not tried onions. The research released today was commissioned by Alton Towers Resort and carried out by One Poll. When asked, 70 per cent of children could identify David Cameron, left, while 88 per cent knew that they lived on planet Earth . And when it came to identifying different shapes, children fared a lot better with 90 per cent knowing a square had four sides, and 96 per cent identifying a triangle. However, showing a gap in their knowledge, only 88 per cent realised they lived on planet Earth, with some believing they lived on Saturn or Mars. Meanwhile, only 64 per cent of children correctly recognised the National Anthem. The research comes as CBeebies Land at Alton Towers Resort prepares to open its gates for the first time on May 24. Children fared better when identifying shapes with 90 per cent of them knowing a square has four sides. And even more children, 93 per cent were able to correctly identify a picture of a cucumber . Mat Way, BBC Worldwide's commercial director, Live Events, said: 'We've found that children learn best when they're interacting and CBeebies Land will continue to encourage learning through play. 'By giving children the chance to discover things for themselves, we can help improve their development while they're having fun.' Katherine Duckworth, from Alton Towers Resort, added: 'We're really excited about the launch of CBeebies Land and can't wait to see the children having fun with the different characters. 'While this poll shows that some older children have some gaps in their general knowledge, CBeebies Land is a place where children can come and enjoy themselves but also learn a little more about the world around them.'","Only 62 per cent of children know what an avocado is when shown a picture .

"Police have reopened the case of a 7-month-old New Jersey girl who went missing more than 26 years ago. Melissa Diane McGuinn disappeared from her Trenton, New Jersey, home on March 6, 1988, and while her family haven't seen or heard from her since, her mother, Becky McGuinn House, is convinced she's still alive. And recently Trenton police got a new lead that could prove she's right. 'I've always felt in my heart that she is out there,' House told ABC News. 'It's not just a whimsy feeling. It's a strong feeling. I feel she is alive.' Scroll down for video . Tragic: Becky McGuinn House with her daughter Melissa who disappeared aged just 7 months . When Melissa went missing, House and her husband Robert McGuinn were sharing a row house in Trenton with another couple - Wanda Reed and her partner - who had an infant son. The two young mothers became close friends and regularly cared for each other's children to give the other a break. So House was not worried on that fateful day when Wanda took her baby girl downstairs while House got dressed. But minutes later, House heard arguing and a neighbor allegedly came running up the stairs and asked where Melissa was. '(I felt) like somebody had ripped my heart out,' House said. A massive search began but there was no sign of the missing infant. Reed was arrested on kidnapping charges but her story about what happened chopped and changed and finally she was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial. 'She was 30 years old, but she had the mind capacity of a 5-, 6-year-old,' House told ABC. ABC News | More ABC News Videos . Search: New Jersey police searched for the missing baby but the case went cold after several years . Reopened: However, police have now reopened the case of Melissa, who they believe would look like the picture, right, now . She reportedly first told detectives she . gave baby Melissa to a man in a car but her description of the car . changed when pressed. She later said she threw the baby in the nearby Delaware River. An intense search of the river ensued but police found no evidence the story was true. Law enforcement continued to chase leads for several years but then the case went cold and was closed. After their loss, House and McGuinn moved to Arkansas where they started a new life, having more children. But they always held out hope of finding their little girl. 'The hardest part is not knowing,' House told ABC. 'Knowing that there's a beautiful young lady out there somewhere that is mine. And I don't know: dead, alive, mistreated, happy?' After her husband died in 2008, House said she always lost hope she'd be reunited with Melissa. But that same year she received a call out of the blue from New Jersey State Police Sgt. Wanda Stajanov who had a new lead in the case. Hopeful: Becky McGuinn House, pictured, has never lost hope that she'll find her daughter . While the lead didn't go anywhere, Stajanov was moved by the case. 'When she called, I felt like there was some hope that somebody actually cared,' House told the TV network. With Detective Paul Sciortino, Stajanov has been re-interviewing witnesses and going through old police reports in an effort to finally solve the mystery of where House's little girl disappeared to. 'I absolutely believe that she's still out there,' said Sciortino. And luckily the investigators actually have a sample of Melissa's DNA, so if they find someone who fits her description they'll easily be able to match her. So far four women all in their mid-twenties have been tested, and all but one have been ruled out. House and the detectives are eagerly waiting DNA results on the fourth but if that too is not her daughter, she said she'll never stop looking. 'I feel one of these days, I'm going to walk up and actually look at myself, just younger. And it's going to be her,' she said.","Melissa Diane McGuinn disappeared from her Trenton, New Jersey, home on March 6, 1988 .

"Former Manchester United trainee Sean Geddes was Worcester City’s hero as the Conference North side sensationally dumped Coventry City out the FA Cup. Geddes played in the same Old Trafford academy team as Danny Welbeck and Ravel Morrison but left to join Walsall before dropping down into non-League football. But he will be the toast of Worcestershire on Sunday night for converting a first-half penalty after Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge had been sent off for kicking out at Daniel Nti and then smashing home a second-half winner to sink the League One side. Former Manchester United academy player Sean Geddes celebrates after scoring against Coventry . The first of Geddes' two strikes at the Ricoh Arena was from the penalty spot in the first half . Geddes (centre) celebrates with team-mates Daniel Nti and Ellis Deeney after making it 1-0 from the spot . Coventry City: Burge; Willis (McQuoid 57), Johnson (C), Martin, Haynes; O'Brien, Barton (Tudgay 66), Finch, Maddison; Nouble (Allsop 39), Jackson . Substitutes not used: Webster, C.

Worcester City: Vaughan, Williams, Hutchinson, Thomas, Weir, Nti (Dunkley 74), Deeney (c), Geddes (Gater 72), Jackman, Murphy, Symons (Wright 51) Substitutes not used: Rowe, McDermott, Taylor, Kier . Scorer: Geddes (penalty) 40, 54 . Booked: Deeney, Jackman, Vaughan, Deeney . Referee: Ross Joyce . Attendance: 8,439 (3,220 away) His 54th-minute strike from just inside the penalty area after a neat touch capped the club’s most famous Cup win since they knocked out Liverpool back in 1959. The Sky Blues pulled a goal back late on through captain Reda Johnson, who had earlier seen a penalty saved by Worcester stopper Nathan Vaughan. But lacklustre Coventry were undeserving of a second chance in a replay having been well and truly shown up by their unfancied opponents, who clung on through seven minutes of stoppage time. The streets of Worcester must have been eerily quiet as kick-off drew near. Half the city seemed to have migrated and the travelling hoardes were queuing for the turnstiles to open 90 minutes before kick-off. Once inside, they created an almighty din. It was a grand day out for a proud club that has fallen upon difficult and uncertain times. Forced to share Aggborough with Kidderminster Harriers for the last 18 months after departing their traditional St George’s Lane ground, progress towards a new home remains painfully slow. Ambitions have been put on pause. Worcester's first goal came after Coventry goalkeeper Lee Burge was sent off for kicking out . Referee Mr R Royce ushers Burge off the field after sending him off in the first half . Worcester goalkeeper Nathan Vaughan (centre) celebrates after saving a penalty from Reda Johnson (left) This was their first appearance in the competition proper since 2005, when they were beaten 1-0 by Huddersfield Town in a televised second round tie and their manager Carl Heeley urged his players to leave the Ricoh Arena pitch with “no regrets.” As their 3,200+ travelling fans cranked up the volume in an otherwise sparsely-populated stadium, their team was nearly a goal ahead inside 20 seconds when Nti seized control of the ball and fired inches wide from 25 yards as it sat up nicely for him. 64 places separated Worcester, mid-table in the Conference North, and Coventry, just above the relegation zone in League One but you wouldn’t have known it. Indeed, it took the Sky Blues, Cup winners in 1987, a good 20 minutes to cobble together a move of note. Jim O’Brien switched the ball side to Ryan Haynes, whose cross was easily gathered by Vaughan. Johnson could have pulled one back for Coventry, but fluffed his lines from 12 yards out . Geddes looked delight to grab his second of the match, which ultimately secured the win for Worcester . Coventry's James Maddison (left) breaks away from the challenge of Ellis Deeney during the game . The Worcester keeper also reacted well to a Frank Nouble flick-on from an O’Brien free-kick but that was all the listless hosts could muster. By contrast, Worcester were bang up for it. Lively from the off, they hustled and harried the Coventry back line, every corner and throw-in won cheered to the echo by their fans. Geddes was the stand-out player and his outside-of-the-boot effort from 20 yards on 34 minutes had Burge alarmed. A minute later, his brave diving header dropped just wide of the mark. Then came the moment that defined the match. Burge had cleanly collected the ball from a cross but took exception to Nti’s attempts to reach it, kicking out senselessly and earning a straight red card. Simeon Jackson (left) vies for the ball with Worcester defender Wayne Thomas at the Ricoh Arena . Geddes jumps into a knee-slide after putting Worcester 2-0 up in the FA Cup . Ryan Haynes (left) has a shot on goal under pressure from Worcester City's George Williams . Nouble was the man sacrificed as substitute keeper Ryan Allsop came on and his first duty was the pick Geddes’ precise penalty out the back of his net. Cue delirium in the away corner. “Worcestershire is wonderful” was the cry before a noisy rendition of ‘Ring of Fire’. But they were soon silenced. James Maddison was brought down by Ellis Deeney, brother of Watford striker Troy, in the box and referee Ross Joyce evened the penalty count. Captain Johnson took responsibility but it was a poor kick and Vaughan dived low to his right to save. Steven Pressley sent Coventry out five minutes early for the second-half. Ronnie O’Sullivan was on the baize playing Judd Trump in the Champion of Champions snooker tournament downstairs and Coventry had clearly been given a rocket of their own at half-time. It had little impact. From their first set-piece of the second half, Worcester’s Jordan Murphy saw his header clawed off the line by Allsop. And two minutes later, Geddes blasted home from just inside the area to put Worcester two-up and into dreamland. The fans at the back of the stand performed the Poznan as jeers echoed around the home section. Coventry simply had to do something. O’Brien saw two efforts blocked at the near post. It would have been a contentious goal as Vaughan had clattered his own defender Wayne Thomas, who was left lying on the ground. With their numerical advantage, Worcester looked the more threatening. Substitute Nick Wright saw his effort deflected wide by a desperate block. Both Geddes and Nti were taken off to rapturous receptions but tired legs were not an issue. They continued to press and Deeney dragged a shot wide with 13 minutes left on the clock. But a nail-biting finale was ensured when Johnson halved the deficit for Coventry with a back post header from Maddison’s cross with nine to play. The announcement of seven minutes added on was greeted with groans from the away fans but the Coventry onslaught never materialised and Worcester celebrated as if they'd won the Cup.","Sean Geddes opened the scoring with a first-half penalty .

"Tragic Erin Corwin – the newly pregnant 19-year-old woman killed and dumped in an abandoned mine-shaft in the California desert – was ‘super-excited’ at having a baby after suffering a miscarriage earlier this year, MailOnline can reveal. Erin was heart-broken when she lost her first baby in February after complications during a brief pregnancy. But friends say the young girl was thrilled to fall pregnant for a second time and was looking forward to having a healthy baby. This comes as the man accused of her murder and Erin’s alleged lover, former Marine Christopher Brandon Lee, was charged on Tuesday with killing her. Tragic Erin Corwin – the newly pregnant 19-year-old woman killed and dumped in an abandoned mine-shaft in the California desert – was ‘super-excited’ at having a baby after suffering a miscarriage earlier this year, MailOnline can reveal . The San Bernardino District Attorney’s Office also filed the special circumstance allegation of 'lying in wait', increasing the potential penalty to life without parole or death. 'The decision regarding which penalty will be sought will be made after a full review of the facts and evidence in the case,' District Attorney Michael Ramos said. Lee was arrested on Sunday by officers in Alaska on suspicion of murder and is currently awaiting extradition to California. Police sources say he has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal, and a witness told detectives that Lee asked him 'what was the best way to dispose of a human body,' a sheriff's investigator wrote in a document filed in San Bernardino County Superior Court in support of an arrest warrant. In addition, .22-caliber fired casings and rebar were recovered from the scene where Erin's body was found late on Saturday in an abandoned mine shaft. The head stamp from the casings matched those on casings found in Lee's vehicle and home, the document said. Police claim that Christopher Brandon Lee has admitted conducting internet searches on human body disposal and .22-caliber fired casings found at the murder scene match his gun . Erin’s chance of becoming a new mom was cruelly snatched away on June 28 when she vanished. She was allegedly murdered and her killer dumped her body down a 140ft deep mineshaft in a remote area around two miles from her home on Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California. She was three-weeks pregnant. Erin had told her Marine husband Jonathan Corwin she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park to scout trails she and her mother could later bike, but she never returned home. Her Toyota Corolla was found two days later abandoned just blocks from the Twentynine Palms Marine Base. According to search warrant documents, tire tracks matching those of Lee’s Jeep were found near to Erin’s car. Search and rescue teams scoured a 300-square-miles area round Joshua Tree National Park, including more than 100 mine shafts, for nearly two months before Corwin's body was found. The investigation grew to focus on Lee, who was the Corwins' neighbor at the Marine Base, according to court papers. Erin’s friend told investigators that Corwin and Lee were having an affair and that the unborn child might be Lee's, the papers show. A close friend said Erin had become friends with Lee and his wife Nichole and the trio often visited a horse ranch just outside the town of Joshua Tree. Erin Corwin, pictured with husband Jonathan, a corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, was three weeks pregnant when she disappeared in June. He was 'super-excited' to be having a baby after a miscarriage in February . Michele Herring said she was in ‘shock’ over the murder and still can’t believe married father-of-one Lee has been charged with murder. She told MailOnline: ‘Lee is a nice person, kind and laid back, you never saw him get angry, if anything he was the kind of guy who would step in to diffuse a situation.’ Michele said Lee and Nichole would come to the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch at least twice a week to care for two horses they sponsored named Humorous and Mack. She said Erin also visited with the couple and the three seemed like good friends. ‘Chris was always himself, a nice guy. I saw him hanging out with Erin but he didn’t seem flirty or give off the impression anything was going on. ‘He and Nichole were high-school sweethearts, they are very much in love and seem really close, like best friends. They have a daughter called Liberty. ‘They knew Erin from the base and she sponsored a horse called Casey so would come up to the ranch, her husband never came because he didn’t really like horses.’ Michele said Erin was 'super-excited' by her pregnancy after tragically losing a baby due to a miscarriage in February. She said: 'She was so excited to be having a baby, she was a sweet girl, I just can't believe she's dead, who would do such a thing, they threw her away like she was a piece of garbage and to someone who was pregnant.' Michele Herring, a close friend of Erin, Lee and his wife, said she was in 'shock' over the murder and still can't believe married father-of-one Lee has been charged with murder . Erin, together with Lee and his wife Nichole, would often visited the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch just outside the town of Joshua Tree, California . Erin Corwin disappeared after leaving her home on the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps base on June 28. Her alleged lover Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, was arrested on Sunday in Alaska in connection with her death . Michele said Chris never showed any aggression during the year and a half she knew him. She said he was always 'calm' and was ‘amazing’ with the rescue horses, catching the more troublesome animals with ease. ‘They all seemed to take to him, even the skittish ones,’ she said. ‘He and Nichole liked to go riding and they often volunteered helping the ranch with repairs. It was a very social thing, there is always people around the ranch. ‘I loved them both, they were part of my ranch kids, I would never in a million years have thought Chris was capable of murder.’ Lee is being held on a federal hold and will be extradited to California from Alaska where he and Nichole had moved to in July. Authorities say Lee's wife is a 'person of interest' in the death. But Michele says the couple didn’t flee to Alaska as some reports have suggested, in fact she says they had been planning the move for several months. ‘Chris had left the military and it was always their plan to move back home in July, his last day was on July 6 and he wanted to go back to school to study,’ said Michele. Scene: Erin Corwan's body was found at the bottom of a mine shaft several miles away from Twentynine Palms Marine Base in California where she lived. The exact location is unknown. She told her husband on the day she went missing that she was headed to Joshua Tree National Park . She said Lee and Nichole stayed at a bunk-house on the horse ranch before leaving for Alaska and it was here police carried out a search warrant. Michele said Lee seemed ‘baffled’ when cops turned up. Police seized a .40 caliber rifle and ammunition and a destructive device known as a potato gun. Lee was then arrested for illegally possessing the potato gun and spent two days in jail. 'Nichole was beside herself,' said friend Michele. But for another friend of Lee and Nichole the search warrant raised a few suspicions. Former Deputy US Marshall David Lange, 68, who also visits the horse ranch, said he believed Lee knew police might search his house. ‘He hid his rifle in the main house where Isabella lives and put the spud gun in the trunk of her car,’ he told MailOnline. ‘Why would you hide those things unless you thought the police might find them. It just seemed a little odd to me. ‘Some have said that maybe he was keeping it away from his daughter but I’ve seen him up here plenty of times with his rifle, he once asked to use the bunk house so he could clean it. 'Isabella rang me after the police came round and she said she knew nothing about the rifle, Chris hadn't told her he was keeping it in her closet.' Former Deputy US Marshall David Lange, 68, who also visits the horse ranch where Erin used to visit, said he believed Lee knew police might search his house . The murder case is being investigated by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department and the investigation is ongoing. Deputy District Attorney Sean Daugherty is prosecuting the case. 'Once again, we are faced with a terrible crime that shows absolutely no regard for the value of human life,' DA Michael Ramos said. 'Make no mistake that this office will fight to see that justice is carried out for our victim and her family.' Authorities have so far declined to release the manner of Erin’s death. 'It is highly likely that Erin could have been harmed by an unknown firearm,' investigators wrote in the court documents. 'Sometime after Erin left with Lee, her phone was deactivated (turned off). Detectives believe if Erin was injured and left at an undisclosed location, she would not (be) able to call for help.' Members of the Urban Search and Rescue team from San Bernardino County's Sheriff's Department prepare to recover the body of Erin Corwin from an abandoned mine shaft near Twentynine Palms, California on Sunday. Her body was found on Saturday night . Other evidence was found in the abandoned mine-shaft - one of more than 100 in the area - but San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon refused to disclose what that was. Lee, a former Marine, told investigators he was not with Erin the day she went missing and had been hunting in Joshua National Park. He told police that although the two had kissed, they had never had intercourse.

"Charges: Brandon Abbott, 31, was arrested and charged Thursday in connection with the deaths of his twin sons who died in a house fire . The Indiana father of the three-year-old twins who died in a house fire was arrested and charged in connection with their deaths Thursday. Seven months after a house fire resulted in the deaths of his twin sons Liam and Landon, Brandon Abbott, 31, has been charged with two neglect of a dependent charges as well as other drug-related felony charges and two misdemeanors, according to the IndyStar. An investigation proved that Abbott had firearms in the rented house near Mulberry and was conducting a 'marijuana growing operation' inside the house, according to a probable cause affidavit. The affidavit states that officers found a loaded handgun, more than 200 grams of marijuana, as well as a variety of other drugs in the home. Abbott, a convicted felon, is prohibited from possessing a firearm, Indy reports. The cause of the April house fire that resulted in the death of the twins remains unknown. Authorities reportedly arrived at the home around 11am that Saturday morning in April, after dispatchers received a call, to find Abbott and Nicole Thomas, 31, on the front lawn of the home with injuries as the house continued to burn. Authorities rescued the twins from the burning home after finding one boy on the floor and another on a bed in the downstairs bedroom. Both died shortly after being taken to the hospital as a result of the blaze. Twins: Layla Abbot (above) was wary about allowing her twin sons, Liam and Landon (above), to visit with her estranged husband Brandon who had a history of drug use . At the time of the fire, Layla Abbott, the boy's mother, knew her estranged husband (Brandon) was to blame. Shortly after the death of her two sons, Layla told WTHR that, against her wishes, a judge ordered her to make visitation arrangements for the boys with Brandon, who she knew was not fit to care for them properly. 'He asked for them on Friday and I let him take them and I wish I wouldn't have,' Layla told WTHR just days after the fire. '...I knew they weren't safe with him. I knew something bad was going to happen.' Layla's intuition has proved to be correct. Ordered: A judge ordered Layla to make visitation arrangements with the twins and Brandon against her wishes . Blood tests confirmed that Brandon had marijuana, Ecstasy, and hydrocodone in his system the night of the fire and Thomas tested positive for Ecstasy, marijuana, amphetamine, Hydrocodone, and fentanyl. Though the cause of the fire remains undetermined, authorities say they discovered an exploded propane canister in a 'black light room' on the first floor of the home. Abbott told authorities that he used the propane torch to smoke 'dab' -- a slang term used to describe a waxy marijuana extract, Indy reports. Indy reports that Abbott told authorities that he laid the two boys down to sleep on a sofa in the black light room before going to his own bedroom upstairs where he spent the night with Thomas. Blames: Layla said she blames Brandon for the deaths of her sons and said she wishes she wouldn't have let them visit their father . The affidavit stated that Abbott told police at the hospital, where his sons were taken after the fire, that the two boys must have started the fire then hid when he tried to find them. In a series of Facebook posts by Abbott back in April, according to Indy, he claimed the fire was caused by the children as a result of his poor housekeeping. In another post he detailed the incident saying he tried to put the fire out using a blanket and water before he drove his car through the house's garage door in an attempt to save his children. However, an investigation found the car to be covered in soot but otherwise completely in tact with a fresh handprint on the trunk sparking speculations that something may have been hidden. Abbott is being held at Tippecanoe County Jail. Each neglect of a dependent charge is punishable by up to 50 years in prison.","Brandon Abbott, 31, is charged with two counts of neglect of a dependent in connection with the deaths of his twin three-year-old sons .

"The Michigan woman who was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison this month after attempting to kill her 14-year-old autistic daughter in a botched murder-suicide, has spoke out from behind bars to detail the morning she planned to die. Kelli Stapleton's murder-suicide plan was foiled when police rescued her and daughter Isabelle from carbon monoxide poisoning last year. The fact that Isabelle - called Issy - remained unconscious for four days after the incident, and Stapleton was easily resuscitated, has been used as evidence by members of her now ex-husband Matt's family that she only ever meant to kill her daughter. But Stapleton has maintained that her depression was real and that she was pushed to hopelessness the day she picked up her then 14-year-old daughter from a special treatment facility her insurance company had stopped paying for. For months, the mother of three had been writing a blog about the trials and tribulations of raising a daughter who physically abused her, and of whom she feared - even posting pictures of her wounds and videos of Issy's violent attacks. Scroll down for videos . Desperate: Kelly Stapleton (left) attempted to kill her then 14-year-old daughter Isabelle (right) last year in a botched murder suicide. The two survived the attempt . Behind bars: The mother of three (pictured right) was sentenced in October to 10-22 years in prison after pleading guilty to felony child abuse . While Issy had been doing well at the facility, Stapleton lost faith that she would ever be able to control her daughter when the teen hit her in the head upon arriving home that day. After another beating two days later, Stapleton hatched a plan to kill her daughter and then commit suicide, believing it would make life easier for her husband and their two other children. 'We will be done with autism completely,' Stapleton wrote in present tense, in a letter to New York magazine from behind bars. 'She is going to be 100 per cent happy. She is going to be 100 per cent Isabel and I cannot wait to see that child.' The evening of Labor Day 2013,  Stapleton started tying up loose ends with her family. She finished the laundry, told her son McKewan how proud she was of him and gave youngest daughter Ainsley a bracelet which read 'REMEMBER TO LOVE'. Injuries: Before her attempt at murder-suicide, Stapleton wrote a blog about raising an autistic teen and shared these pictures of her injuries after violent episodes with her daughter . The next morning, Stapleton woke up happy and eager to carry out her plan. 'I am so excited because we are going to be in Heaven before noon,' she recalled. 'For the first time in my life I am going to be able to have a real conversation with her, and see her. Get to know her, without the perseverations and the aggression.' First, she drove McKewan and Ainsley to school and texted Issy's caretakers that they had the day off.  Then she packed up the back of the van with a mattress, pillowcases from each of her kids' beds, a shirt from her husband and a hibachi grill. Stapleton took her daughter to a wooded area near a hiking trail she had visited with a friend before, parked the car and got out the grill to make s'mores. After letting Issy eat two of the treats, she gave her daughter a double dose of Risperdal, a drug that helps combat her aggression and makes her sleepy and tucked her into the van. Conclusion: Stapleton (left) told New York magazine that she thought life would be easier for her husband and two other children if she and Issy (right) were gone . The mother then brought the still-smoldering grill into the van and closed all of the doors, hoping the trapped smoke would kill them both. Stapleton recalls the last moments before passing out, saying she and Issy talked about their pets and all of the items they would bring on a vacation to Florida. She says they laid down on the mattress, nose to nose, and shared a final 'I love you' with each other. But when police discovered the car that evening, they described the scene with a few notable differences in their reports. First of all, Issy was not laying down next to her mother but strapped in to the front seat, her throat 'raw as a hamburger', her mouth foaming and unresponsive. Meanwhile, Stapleton was found in the back seat, laying on the mattress stripped down to her underwear with a considerably lower body temperature and carbon monoxide poison intake than her daughter. Arrested: Stapleton pictured after her September 2013 arrest. She has since let her naturally darker hair grow out to replace the bleach blonde . While Issy spent the next few days on a ventilator fighting for her life, Stapleton was easily revived and was already talking to paramedics responding on the scene. Stapleton was arrested and charged with  attempted murder - charges her attorney Heidi Hodek hoped to fight with an insanity plea. But Stapleton ruined those changes when she gave an interview with Dr Phil from behind bars, ruining their case that the attempted murder wasn't premeditated. Two weeks before her murder case was set to go to trial, Stapleton conceded by taking a plea deal. On September 9 she pleaded guilty to charges of felony child abuse. At her exceptionally long sentencing, friends defended her as a good mother who baked her kids cookies after school. From the other side of the court, her ex-husband's family spoke out to call her 'evil'. Stapleton herself  let guilt get to her behind bars, letting her natural hair grow out and replace its usually black blonde and aging several years from the pretty football coach's wife she was before. 'I am not worthy to speak her name,' Stapleton said of her daughter at sentencing, asking the judge for 15 years in prison. 'She is not the monster. I am.' Stapleton was sentenced to 10-22 years in prison.

"Ever wondered why a drink of sweet orange juice turns horribly bitter after brushing your teeth? According to experts, the sensation is down to a specific chemical, known as sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), a detergent commonly found in toothpaste. This detergent specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue, and destroys compounds designed to inhibit bitter sensations. Scroll down for video . Orange juice tastes horribly bitter after brushing your teeth because of a specific chemical, known as sodium lauryl sulphate, SLS, (pictured) commonly found in toothpaste. It suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth and destroys compounds  called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors . The chemical analysis was carried out by researchers from the American Chemical Society in Washington. In a video, the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth before reaching for a glass of orange juice, only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange. They added that the typical human mouth has more than 10,000 taste buds and 100 taste receptor cells. These are designed to detect five different types of taste - sweet, sour, bitter, salty and the newly recognised umami, or savoury. In a video, the scientists explained millions of people have experienced the unpleasant combination of brushing their teeth (illustrated with a stock image) before reaching for a glass of orange juice, only to find the taste is more bitter lemon than sweet orange . The reason why orange juice tastes horribly bitter after brushing your teeth is because of a chemical known as sodium lauryl sulphate. It is found in most toothpaste. This detergent - which makes toothpaste foam - specifically suppresses sweet taste receptors on the tongue. It also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors. Toothpaste has four main ingredients, which give the paste its consistency. Water adds body, abrasives help get rid of plaque, fluoride prevents cavities and detergent makes it lather or bubble. The most frequently used detergent in toothpaste is sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), which has already been noted for its strange effect on the mouth’s ability to taste. And now the new research has found that SLS suppresses sweetness taste receptor cells in the mouth. It also destroys compounds in the mouth called phospholipids, which are designed to inhibit bitter taste receptors. The study team said: ‘This opens up a clear pathway for bitter molecules to reach taste receptors in the mouth. ‘This is the most likely reason why orange juice turns from sweet to sour immediately after you brush your teeth.’ The findings were published in the American Chemical Society’s online video journal Reactions.

"Arsenal need to sign Real Madrid's Sami Khedira in January if they want to win the Premier League this season, according to former midfielder Robert Pires. Pires knows what it takes to win the title having won the Premier League twice during his time with the Gunners. And the Frenchman – who has just signed for Goa FC in the newly formed Indian Super League – believes Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger needs a dominant midfielder. Sami Khedira could be the ideal signing for Arsenal, according to former midfielder Robert Pires . Khedira helped Germany win the World Cup in Brazil this summer . Pires told The Daily Telegraph: ‘He [Wenger] needs a big player in the middle, like (Patrick) Vieira, strong, tall, because this position is very important for the balance between attack and defence. ‘The quality is there but you need more, maybe [someone] like Yaya Toure. He reminds me of Patrick Vieira, maybe they have an opportunity with Khedira. ‘It is likely in the January window. He played very well with Germany. My advice is if he can buy Khedira he can be the [new] Vieira, more aggression in the middle. Pires (2nd left) played for Arsenal with Patrick Vieira (left) when they last won the title back in 2004 . ‘He has a lot of experience. When you play in the middle you need experience, especially when your midfield is young like Arsenal's.’ Khedira's contract at Madrid runs out next year and Arsenal could snap up the World Cup winner for around £10million in January. Arsenal have not won the Premier League since 2003-04 when Pires was part of the side that went the whole season unbeaten. Wenger’s side are currently eighth in the table after seven games and are nine points behind leaders Chelsea.

"The unexplained disappearance of two Indiana moms who vanished within weeks of each other could be linked, according to police. Joelle Lockwood, 30 and Kristy Kelley, 27, from southwest Indiana vanished within five weeks of each other just 20 miles apart. Sheriff Brett Kruse from Warrick County police said: ‘It doesn’t . happen frequently that we have two women of the same age group that go . missing around the same time.’ Missing: Joelle Lockwood, 30, left, and Kristy Kelley, 27, right, from Indiana have both vanished . Ms Kelley: According to police, Ms Kelley was last seen at 1:30 a.m. Friday August 15 leaving a Boonville VFW club . However, while there is no material evidence to link the two women’s disappearances, police confirm that they are are sharing vital information from both investigations. Both have two children. And both were last seen wearing tank tops and blue jean shorts. ‘[The similarities are] something both agencies have to keep in mind, you don’t ever want to rule anything like that out,’ Sgt. Jason Cullum of the Evansville Police Department told The Huffington Post. According to police, Ms Kelley was last seen at 1:30am on Friday August 15 leaving a Boonville VFW club. Surveillance footage from a local ice cream parlor and a church --shows what police believe is Ms Kelley’s car heading in the direction of her home. But the footage is 'blurry' according to relatives who have viewed it. According to Ms Kelley's father, Todd Scales, she had been hanging out with friends at the VFW, a lounge and headed out about 15 minutes after they left. She left in her 2003 Nissan Xterra, but didn't make it back to her parents' house just two miles away. And oddly, investigators said she left her cell phone behind at VFW which was very uncharacteristic. Ms Kelley's distraught mother has expressed disbelief that her daughter is missing without a trace. Kathy Scales told Abc news: ‘I . just can’t explain the pit that I have in my stomach. And just knowing . that our daughter is out there and we can’t get to her. It’s very, very, . very rough.’ Sheriff Kruse said: 'There has been no activity on Ms Kelley’s bank accounts, and no evidence pointing towards any type of struggle.' But her parents said they became concerned when she did not return home to them and her children aged 3 and 6 or show up at her job at a local CVS pharmacy. Meanwhile, Ms Lockwood was last seen on July 9 leaving a party in Evansville, about 20 miles away. She was walking in the area of Park Street and Florida Street in Evansville.

"Outrage: Eppie Sprung Dawson, pictured arriving at Dumfries court yesterday, is now living Matthew Robinson, the student she was found to be having sex with when he was just 17 . A Sheriff has sparked anger after claiming a teacher convicted of having sex with a pupil had made ‘exemplary’ progress in counselling sessions – even though she is now living with her victim. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, lost her job and her marriage after being found half-naked in a layby with teenager Matthew Robinson, who was 17 at the time. It emerged last week that she is now living with him in her former marital home, only two months after being placed on the sex offenders’ register. He claims they are not in a relationship. Remarkably, when the case returned to court for an update on Sprung Dawson’s Community Payback Order (CPO), Sheriff George Jamieson said reports from social workers showed her progress was ‘exemplary.’ The comments were criticised by the family of Matthew Robinson, now 18, who also pointed out she had escaped having to do any actual work as part of her CPO. Last night, mother Sheree said: ‘There was no mention at all about Matthew being at her house. ‘When I heard she had been called “exemplary”, I couldn’t believe it. If she was truly exemplary – and had learned from this – there is no way she would be living with Matthew. 'It seems she has been helped, not punished, while our family has been going through hell. ‘We thought she would be picking rubbish off the street but in fact she just had to go and see a psychiatrist. She’s a very clever person. She’s got away with it.’ Mrs Robinson said Sprung  Dawson approached her at Dumfries Sheriff Court, where the hearing was held yesterday, and asked to talk to her – but she declined. Sheriff Jamieson was told by Sprung Dawson’s lawyer, David Finnie, that his client had responded well to counselling. Apparently unaware of reports that she was living with her victim, Mr Finnie said: ‘In the week prior to her review, for some mysterious reason, there seemed to have been excessive interest from the Press.’ Outcome: Sprung Dawson (right) was ordered to complete a course of psychosexual counselling and place on the sex offenders' register for six months after admitting to having sex with Matthew (left) Mr Finnie asked that the CPO should continue but without further court appearances – a request granted by Sheriff Jamieson, who said: ‘I fixed this review to ensure that you were complying with it. It wasn’t meant to be an easy order to deal with. ‘I have two reports – one from the Community Payback team – which indicated that your compliance is exemplary as far as I can see. ‘You are engaging with the various services you were asked to engage with. The order will be allowed to continue.’ Sprung Dawson, who made no  comment last night, had driven to a layby with the teenager after a school Christmas dance last year, before having sex with him. The pair were discovered by patrolling police officers. 'Got away with it': Matthew's family said they feel Sprung Dawson, above, has not been punished for her crime . Sacked: Eppie Sprung Dawson lost her job as an English teacher at St Joseph's College in Dumfries, above, after being found to have had sex with 17-year-old student Matthew Robinson . At the initial court case in July, she admitted sexual activity with a person under 18 while she was his teacher and in a position of trust. She was placed on the sex offenders’ register for six months and given a six-month CPO. She lost her job at St Joseph’s College in Dumfries and split from her husband of two years, Ranald . Sprung Dawson, also a teacher and son of former Solicitor-General for Scotland, Lord Sprung Dawson. A Dumfries and Galloway Council spokesman said: ‘The reports relating to a Community Payback Order are the property of the court. They are confidential and not in the  public domain. One of the reports was prepared by the criminal  justice social work department at Dumfries and Galloway Council.’ A spokesman at Dumfries Sheriff Court confirmed that Sprung Dawson did not have to carry out any work as part of her CPO but had to attend appointments with a doctor, psychiatrist or social worker. Scottish Tory justice spokesman Margaret Mitchell said: ‘This woman has served her punishment as far as the law is concerned and will find the loss of her teaching career a far greater penalty.’","Teacher was forced to sign sex offenders' register .

"This is the shocking moment that a voyeur was caught spying on his female housemate as she watched television in the early hours of the morning. A neighbour living opposite the Liverpool student house took these photos as the man lay outside the first-floor bedroom of 22-year-old Sam Walton. The man, who was performing a sex act on himself while looking at Miss Walton, had climbed on to the roof in order to reach his position at her window. He only moved when the neighbour shouted at him and disturbed him. Caught: A neighbour took photographs of the voyeur, circled, as he lay outside the bedroom of student Sam Walton, 22. He had climbed on the roof of the student house they shared in order to reach his position . But the voyeur climbed back up just five minutes later and continued performing the sex act. Concerned for Miss Walton, the neighbour's mother went over to the  house to warn the drama student what was happening. Miss Walton was horrified to discover that she was sharing a house with the man, a foreign student, who was later recognised by the neighbours. But despite phoning the police and giving them this set of photographs, the suspect was never charged and was allowed to return to his home country unpunished. Miss Walton said police told her he was not being prosecuted because of a lack of evidence. She said: 'The pictures is just haunting. I was just sitting there watching Breaking Bad in my pyjamas and while I heard a noise I didn't think anything of it. Unaware: Sam Walton, pictured, was watching TV in her pyjamas when a neighbour spotted the man outside of her first-floor window in Liverpool . 'About 45 minutes I heard a knock at the door, and I answered and there was a middle-aged woman I didn't recognise. 'She asked if I was the girl who lived in the back bedroom on the first floor. 'I told her yes, and she said ""My son has just woken me. There has been a man sitting on the roof outside your bedroom window."" 'I freaked out. I was afraid whoever was out there might have climbed in through my open window while I answered the door, so I asked the lady to come up with me while I closed it. 'I also noticed footprints on the roof near my window. I arranged a house meeting, and naturally they were worried. 'When I saw the picture and saw how close he was, it made me think he had done it before.' Miss Walton's boyfriend and parents urged her to immediately leave the student accommodation in Liverpool after the incident in April but she stayed, determined to catch the person responsible. A few days later her neighbour's son went to check on her and recognised the man in the kitchen where he was sharing the house with Sam and three other students. Miss Walton noticed that the markings on his distinctive trainers matched the footprints on her roof. She added: 'He pulled me aside and told me he was 100 per cent sure that I was living with the guy that had done it because he recognised him when we were in the kitchen.' Miss Walton then phoned the police but said it took them two days to take a statement. She said the man - a foreign student - was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism but was released and allowed to return to his home country after 24 hours in custody. She was later told the investigation was dropped because there wasn't enough evidence. Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, Miss Walton said: 'Unfortunately, as you can see, the pictures weren't the best quality but you can see how close the man was. Distinctive: Miss Walton, who continued to live in the house after the incident, said that the patterns on the soles of her flatmate's shoes matched the footprints she found on the roof outside her bedroom, pictured . 'When they arrived the policewoman told me that, based on the statements and evidence we'd given, they felt they had enough to make an arrest. 'When they came to arrest him, they found clothes matching the descriptions and those seen in the photos. 'The whole situation was hellish, and now this pervert's got off scot-free. There are clearly some real weirdos out there, and what is worse is that the police didn't seem to care. 'Would they have waited until a violent crime had taken place before pursuing a conviction?' Miss Walton, who is still living in Liverpool, added: 'This whole experience has certainly taught me a lesson. 'Don't take it for granted that people know what acceptable behaviour is and what is not. 'If nothing else, I'm now much more conscious of my personal safety, even of just keeping my blinds drawn all the time. 'I'm also a lot more wary of people, even those who at first seem OK.' The alleged voyeur has since returned to the continent and did not respond to a request for comment.","Neighbour saw man performing sex act on himself outside Liverpool house .

Burgess said he didn't know when he would be able to make his rugby union debut with English club Bath, but his recovery period is expected to take several months. 'It will be a while, but that is the least of my worries right now,' he said. 'Hopefully this face won't be damaged for too long. 'I have to get it fixed and then crack on.' Burgess was joined at Redfern Oval by captain John Sutton (left) and coach Michael Maquire (right) Lines to get into the Rabbitohs' spiritual home snaked halfway around the block following Souths 30-6 win over the Canterbury Bulldogs . Thousands of fans turned up to congratulate the Rabbitohs on their first premiership in 43 years . On Monday Burgess arrived at Redfern Oval for an fan day held to thank supporters looking very bruised and battered from the Sunday night clash. For Souths legend George Piggins, the man who successfully fought to have the club reinstated after its expulsion from the competition in 2000, Sunday's game was the first he had attended since Russell Crowe and Peter Holmes à Court took over in 2006. While impressed with Burgess's courage, Piggins pointed to John Sattler who played almost the entire 1970 grand final  with a broken jaw. George Burgess cracked open a beer as he met South Sydney fans at Redfern Oval on Monday . Fullback Greg Inglis scored the final try of Sunday's grand final and treated supporters to his trademark goanna crawl across the try line . 'I've never had a broken cheek bone,' Piggins told Daily Mail Australia. 'I've had a broken jaw. And I've got to say I've never had anything more painful in my life. 'With a broken jaw, when you come out of it all your teeth are wired up. It smells like a sewer rat. No risk in the wide world (a broken cheek bone) hurts. But I'll go for the cheek bone.' Piggins, who attended the grand final only because businessman John Singleton, the TAB and car deal Steven Nasteski donated a total of $120,000 to charity, said he would be happy to attend another game sometime. Dylan Walker cheered along with the thousands of fans who turned up to the club's spiritual home . Sam Burgess went out on top after playing his final game for the Rabbitohs before he heads back to the UK to play rugby union for Bath . About 10,000 people were expected to attend Monday's fan celebrations with the line snaking half way around the block . 'I might find myself doing that,' the 69-year-old said. 'If I can go to the football and I can sit where I want to sit and be with who I want to be with. 'I'd be interested to go back to another game but there wouldn't be all the fanfare. There's other things in life.' Lines to get into the Rabbitohs' spiritual home snaked halfway around the block following Souths  30-6 win over the Canterbury Bulldogs.

"A 76-year-old French woman has been brutally raped and assaulted after telling a group of young men to quiet down outside her apartment. The elderly woman was attacked by four masked men in her own home, located in a block of flats in a Parisian suburb. The men broke into the flat, assaulted and raped her before looting the flat, French media reports. Horror: The 76-year-old woman was brutally raped and assaulted in her own home in Ivry-sur-Seine, a suburb to Paris (stock image) The woman was attacked after telling off a group of youths that had been disturbing the peace outside her apartment in the Parisian suburb of Ivry-sur-Seine. ‘A group of unemployed young men would meet up there,’ a neighbour told Le Parisian. ‘They were often noisy and intoxicated.’ The neighbour said the situation had been deteriorating for some time, and that the woman had simply told the group to quiet down. The group responded with ‘anti-white’ insults and threatened to retaliate, The Local reports. Attack: The woman had allegedly told a group of young men that had gathered outside her flat to quiet down, after which they 'shouted anti-white abuse and promised to retaliate' Days later four masked men entered the flat after the unnamed victim’s partner had gone to work. According to reports, three intruders ravaged the apartment, while a fourth brutally sexually assaulted the elderly woman. ‘It’s appalling,’ the neighbour adds. ;Since that day her shutters are closed.’ Police have been able to identify and arrest the alleged rapist last week, but are still looking for three more suspects.","Elderly woman assaulted and raped in her own home in Paris .

"The 12-year-old boy who allegedly stabbed a 9-year-old playmate to death on a Michigan playground has been identified as Jamarion Lawhorn. Police say that after he stabbed Michael 'Conner' Verkerke in a Kentwood, Michigan, trailer park on Monday night, Jamarion called 911 and confessed - telling police dispatchers 'Hi. I just stabbed somebody. Please pick me up.' The Grand Rapids Press reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him, according to the newspaper. Shocking: Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young for his age . Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home . Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . Jamarion's lawyer entered a 'not guilty' plea and asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Suddenly, he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the weapon. Conner ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 in Pontiac, Michigan. Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife . Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press. Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed . He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy. 'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived. When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.","Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, will be tried as an adult in juvenile court .

"A man who was drunk when he crashed a powerboat into a construction barge, killing a bride-to-be and her fiance's best man, was sentenced on Tuesday to two years in jail. The victims' families, who say poor lighting on the barge was the main cause of the collision on the Hudson River, called the sentence 'incomplete justice.' Jojo John, 36, of Nyack, had pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter in the July 2013 deaths of two friends, Lindsey Stewart of Piermont and Mark Lennon of Pearl River, both 30. Jojo John of Nyack, New York, was sentenced to two years in jail on Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter in the July 2013 deaths of two of his friends . Stewart was to have been married two weeks later. John, groom-to-be Brian Bond and two others were injured. John's 19-foot Stingray crashed into a barge that was moored about 30 miles north of Manhattan as part of the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge. Prosecutors said John had nearly twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system and quoted him as telling first responders, 'I've been drinking all day,' or words to that effect. Before sentence was imposed on Tuesday, John turned to the victims' relatives in the gallery and said through tears, 'If I could, I would give my own life' to bring back his friends. Killed: Lindsey Stewart, 30, of Piermont was to have been married two weeks after the July 2013 tragedy and Mark Lennon, 30, of Pearl River was due to have been the best man . John's 19-foot Stingray crashed into a barge that was moored about 30 miles north of Manhattan as part of the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge . 'There is not a day that goes by that I don't think about those guys,' he said of his friends. He told state Supreme Court Justice William Kelly: 'There are days when I question why God took two people and not me. ... I find myself crying a lot because of how my heart feels about them not being here.' Mark Lennon's brother Raymond told the judge the crash caused both families 'incomprehensible heartache.' But he was sympathetic toward John, saying, 'He is facing a life sentence of his own.' He said other guilty parties, whom he did not name, were 'unscathed' and John's sentence was 'incomplete justice at best.' John's lawyer, David Narain, has insisted that the crash was caused not by intoxication but by a lack of lighting, and the victims' families have filed lawsuits against several construction companies. Carol Stewart-Kosic, mother of Lindsey Stewart, and her husband Walter Kosic arrive to the Rockland County Courthouse for the sentencing of Jojo John in New City, N.Y., on Tuesday . Lindsey Stewart was due to marry fiancee Brian Bond just two weeks after the crash in July 2013 . The Coast Guard and the state Thruway Authority, which is building the bridge, said the barge was properly lighted. Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe said outside court on Tuesday that John was 'solely responsible' for the crash and there was 'no evidence that would have supported any criminal charge' against bridge construction companies. The district attorney noted that John had been 'given a second chance' when he was granted probation on a drug conviction before the crash. 'He was not entitled to a third chance,' Zugibe said.

"Three G4S guards killed an Angolan deportee as they restrained him on a flight from the UK, a court heard. Jimmy Mubenga, 46, was heard by passengers to cry out repeatedly 'I can't breathe' as he was pinned down in his seat by the guards - despite already being handcuffed with his seatbelt on. They ignored his desperate pleas and 'disregarded their duty of care', by assuming that the married father was 'feigning' illness as the flight prepared to take off from Heathrow airport, jurors were told. Three G4S guards killed an Angolan deportee Jimmy Mubenga (pictured) as they restrained him on a flight from the UK, a court heard . By the time the cabin crew of the British Airways flight raised the alarm on October 12, 2010 it was too late, and Mr Mubenga had collapsed and gone into cardiac arrest. The whole incident took 35 minutes, the court heard. Terrence Hughes, 53, Colin Kaler, 52 and Stuart Tribelnig, 39, are on trial charged with the manslaughter of Mr Mubenga. In an unprecedented move, a section of the Boeing 777 with three rows of three seats has been specially constructed inside Court 16 of the Old Bailey to demonstrate to the jury how Mr Mubenga died. Colin Kaler (left), Stuart Tribelnig (right) and Terrence Hughes are on trial charged with the manslaughter of Mr Mubenga . Opening the case, prosecutor Mark Dennis QC told the court that Mr Mubenga had been accompanied by the three Group 4 Securicor (G4S) guards as he was put on a plane at Heathrow airport to be deported to Angola. At 8.20pm, the flight crew on the British Airways plane contacted the control tower saying they had a 'medical emergency' as they were taxiing towards the runway. Their message said: 'Yeah, we have a deportee who's restrained, he's collapsed, he's a very faint pulse and not responding to any stimulus.' G4S guards Terrence Hughes (pictured), Colin Kaler and Stuart Tribelnig deny the charge against them . An hour earlier, as he boarded the plane, Mr Mubenga, who left his family and children in the UK, had been 'fit and healthy' and 'thoroughly co-operative', Mr Dennis said. 'A few minutes after boarding, everything was to change. As Mubenga was returning from the lavatory, still accompanied by the three officers, something happened which set off a chain of events which ultimately led to his collapse and death. 'Mubenga and the three officers became embroiled in a commotion which quickly escalated into a physical struggle as the officers tried to force Mubenga into a row of seats and then into a seated position. 'He was then further restrained by the application of rigid handcuffs with his arms, hands bound in that way behind his back and his seat belt being applied around his waist thereby holding him into the seat. 'Such physical restraint should have been enough to hold Mubenga in the seat and above all to make Mubenga realise that there was no point in struggling further even if he had wanted to do so.' The prosecutor said that despite being in an 'excited state' 'there was little he could do but accept the situation and calm down because he was in such a confined space and bound from behind and strapped in his seat'. Mr Dennis said: 'The officers could, in effect, have simply stepped back and tried to calm the situation by words, only intervening with physical actions if the need arose thereafter. 'However, the officers did not take that course and instead sat one either side of Mubenga, with one leaning over from the seat ahead and between them endeavoured in effect to pin Mubenga down into his seat. 'In doing so, they held Mubenga in such a position bent forward that his ability to breathe properly was inevitably impaired. A section of the Boeing 777 with three rows of three seats has been specially constructed inside Court 16 of the Old Bailey to demonstrate to the jury how Mr Mubenga died . 'Each officer would have known from their training and from common sense that keeping someone in such a position was likely to cause a person harm yet they did so over a prolonged period and did so ignoring shouts from Mubenga that he was in trouble. ""I can't breathe"" shouts were heard by many a passenger seated further away.' The prosecutor went on: 'It may well be that the officers' actions were primarily motivated by the desire to ensure that the plane proceeded to take off, perhaps in the belief that once airborne they could release Mubenga from any restraint and that he would calm down knowing that it was too late to stop the flight. Mr Mubenga (right) had been ordered to leave the country after living in the UK with his wife Adrienne Makenda Kambana (left) and children for a number of years . 'However, some 35 minutes or so elapsed between the start of this commotion and the moment when the cabin doors were secured and the plane pushed back in order to taxi towards the runway. 'In that time the inevitable consequences of Mubenga's restricted ability to breathe and the officers continued ignoring of Mubenga's plight, resulted in his collapse. 'Even then, when Mubenga was seated motionless and simply staring open-eyed ahead of him, the officers would appear to have disregarded their duty of care and to have preferred to assume that Mubenga was simply feigning his condition. 'It was only when it finally dawned on one of the officers that Mubenga was in a critical state that the alarm was raised and the ""medical emergency"" urgently reported to the control tower. 'By then, however, Mubenga had almost certainly already suffered a cardiac arrest and was in all likelihood beyond recovery as sadly proved to be the case.' Mr Mubenga had been ordered to leave the country after living in the UK with his wife and children for a number of years. On Tuesday, October 12 2010 he was due to be lawfully deported having being held at the Brook House Removal Centre at Gatwick Airport. Although being tearful before his departure and upset to leave his family behind, he had acknowledged that he had to go back and was 'resigned' to the situation, jurors were told. Hughes, from Portsmouth, Hampshire, Kaler, of Kempton, Bedfordshire, and Tribelnig, from Horley, Surrey, deny the charge against them. The trial continues.

"A remote snow town in Canada has made a decision to cancel trick-or-treating this Halloween in order to safeguard their children from polar bears. An increasing number of bears have appeared around Arviat - a hamlet on the western shore of Hudson Bay in Nunavut - over the last few years, with a lack of sea ice forcing them ashore to find food. This year the town have announced they will host an indoor alternative to trick-or-treating at a local community hall on October 31 'in order to prevent tragedy'. There are about 2,300 people in the town, 1,300 of which are children. Roaming around: Arviat resident Kristy Suluk took this photo of three polar bears looking for food outside her house on October 21. Trick or treating will be moved indoors in the town this year for safety reasons . Remote: Of the 2,300 or so people in Arviat, Nunavut, about 1,300 are children, who will not trick-or-treat this year . 'It was clear that the majority of people liked the idea of providing a safer environment for kids to celebrate Halloween,' officials said in a post on Facebook. 'The goal of this event will be to make sure our kids remain safe and still have fun.' Arviat Senior Administrative Officer Steve England told CBC News that, being the middle of polar bear season, it was their only real option. 'It's a pretty obvious conclusion of what tragedies could come out of that,' he said. 'We're just trying to safeguard the younger population by offering an alternative.' Moving indoors: A candy-filled haunted house will be built inside Arviat's Kalluak Hall as an alternative . Remote: Arviat is a small town with a population of about 2,300 that sits on Hudson Bay in Canada's west . A haunted house will be constructed inside the community hall and there will be face painting. Prizes and candy will also be handled.

"The hunt is on for the culprits who sprayed four buildings at a Sydney high school with the phrases 'ISIS R coming' and 'ISIS beheads'. On Wednesday morning, East Hills Boys High School staff contacted police after making the terrifying find. A NSW Police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia the vandals would have broken into the Lucas Road school between 6pm on Tuesday and 7.30am on Wednesday. Staff at East Hills Boys High School made the terrifying find on Wednesday morning . But this is not the first time Panania's East Hills Boys High School - in Sydney's south-west - has been at the centre of a police investigation. A few weeks ago, Australian Federal Police officers came to the school to look into reports that a student had fled to the Middle East to join fighters of terror group Islamic State, The Daily Telegraph reported. It followed an incident in June where two students refused to stand up and sing the Australian national anthem, saying they only stood up for 'Allah', according to 7News. The two teenagers were believed to have associations with Hamdi Al Qudsi who was charged last year for recruiting fighters to travel to Syria. The school located in the suburb of Panania - in Sydney's south-west - is no stranger to police investigation . Just weeks ago, Australia Federal Police investigated reports a student had fled to Syria to join jihadists . It also emerged that a person in contact with the Sydney man was also running worship groups inside the school attended by students, which sparked the NSW Department of Education to re-jig its policies. The graffiti has since been removed by the school as officers from the Bankstown Local Area Command canvassed neighbouring premises on Wednesday, the police spokesman said. Parents of East Hills Boys High School have spoken out about their concerns. 'If this is in my son's school, it's very concerning to me,’ Liz Oddy told 7News. Vandals also got inside buildings and made threats against Australia on a whiteboard . Another parent Wadad Haidar echoed her comments. 'It's actually scaring all my kids because I've got four of them and they all go to school,' she said. Bankstown LAC's Inspector Scott McAlpine urged anyone with information about the incident to contact police, while the school's principal, Kevin Elgood, wrote to parents saying their sons' safety was their 'highest priority'.","Staff at East Hills Boys High School made the terrifying find on Wednesday .

"A  woman who fell pregnant just four months after beating cancer has given birth - despite doctors believing she was infertile. Clare Wolfswinkel, from Liverpool, found a lump on her groin at 27-weeks pregnant with her first child - she was quickly diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The 37-year-old was terrified the gruelling rounds of chemotherapy would not only harm her unborn baby but prevent her from becoming a mother again in the future. Scroll down for video . Happy families: Clare Wolfswinkel, with her husband and her daughter Sienna in June 2014, was diagnosed with cancer when pregnant with her first child. She has since gone on to beat it and welcome her second baby . Thankfully, her baby, Noah, survived and she fell pregnant with her daughter, Sienna, just four months after being given the all clear. Clare said: 'I was devastated when doctors said it was likely that my cancer treatment would leave me infertile. 'Me and my husband Geerling did want more children in the future but we were thrilled to have one healthy baby. 'We focused on our future together and I was determined to beat cancer for my family.' Beating the odds: Clare with Noah and Sienna in August 2014, gave  birth just four months after beating cancer - despite doctors believing she was infertile. All together: The couple were overjoyed when scans revealed Clare's cancer had been cured but they never imagined they were soon to become a family of four . Diagnosis: Clare, pictured with Sienna, found a lump on her groin at 27-weeks pregnant with her first child - she was quickly diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma . Acceptance: Clare, pictured with Sienna, said: 'Losing your hair and seeing yourself bald makes the whole process seem more real. You never expect to be pregnant and having to fight cancer' The couple were overjoyed when scans revealed Clare's cancer had been cured but they never imagined they were soon to become a family of four. Clare added: 'I couldn't believe it when I fell pregnant so quickly, it was amazing. 'I was equally petrified as I feared my cancer would return in my second pregnancy.' Clare was diagnosed in January 2013 after she was rubbing her bump and first noticed a walnut-like lump on her groin. She had also been feeling tired but thought it was just pregnancy related. Doctors quickly diagnosed Clare with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and on the same day underwent an MRI scan, bone marrow was taken and an operation to remove the tumour. Charitable: After being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant Clare tried to find other women in the same situation and discovered Mummy's Star charity, which is dedicated to helping pregnant women who are affected by cancer . She said: 'I was shocked and scared when I was diagnosed with cancer. I never thought in a million years it would be anything that serious. 'From that moment on I was in a daze, it didn't feel real.' She said: 'I can't praise the healthcare enough, the hospital was amazing and it was their quick actions that saved my life. 'I lost my long brown hair after just two sessions of chemo, that was awful but I was so lucky the cancer was treated so fast. Miracle baby: Clare said: 'Sienna is three-months-old now and she has completed our family, her brother, Noah, is just 18-months-old, so I know they'll have a close bond when they're older' 'Losing your hair and seeing yourself bald makes the whole process seem more real. You never expect to be pregnant and having to fight cancer. 'On top of this I also lost my job but my main focus was my son and beating cancer.' She went into remission in June 2013 and was able to start enjoying her maternity leave with Noah; Clare could only dream of one day becoming a mother-of-two. Clare added: 'Sienna is three-months-old now and she has completed our family, her brother, Noah, is just 18-months-old, so I know they'll have a close bond when they're older. 'My children are my life, they make me smile everyday and my husband was amazing all the way through my treatment, as was my family and friends. 'I had no problems with my second pregnancy and I just have cancer check-ups every six months.' After being diagnosed with cancer while pregnant Clare tried to find other women in the same situation. This is when she discovered Mummy's Star - an amazing charity dedicated to helping pregnant women who are affected by cancer. Clare said: 'Mummy's star has been amazing for me and through them I have connected with other woman who have been in my situation, we are like a little family. I think Pete has done fantastic in starting this amazing charity.' Pete Wallroth, Founder of Mummy's Star, said: 'When Clare first contacted us she explained that when she received her diagnosis when pregnant she had found absolutely no support at all for the situation she found herself in or someone else with shared experiences. 'Being pregnant and being diagnosed with any form of cancer, from my wife's experience, is so isolating as the common phrase we hear from women is that they feel like they are the only one. 'Clare has found our support and forums a massive help and we are just glad that we are now there for women and families like hers, where beforehand there were few if any options for such women to turn to.' Joining forces: The 36-year-old was terrified the gruelling rounds of chemotherapy would not only harm her unborn baby but prevent her from becoming a mother again in the future but after her ordeal, she wanted to find other women in her position .

"Soft-boiled eggs are back on the menu for pregnant women, according to experts. A study has found that stricter precautions taken by producers mean even babies can be safely fed runny egg, which it is claimed can stop them becoming allergic later on. NHS Choices still advises pregnant women to avoid soft-boiled eggs or give them to babies after weaning because of the salmonella risk. Dr Juliet Gray, registered nutritionist and co-author of the review, said expectant mothers may be unwittingly putting their children at greater risk of allergy by an avoiding eggs . Just nine per cent of babies are currently given eggs at six months, the recommended age to start weaning. Even at 12 months, only one-third are given eggs, with allergy concerns given as the main reason for avoiding eggs, says a new review published in the Journal of Health Visiting. Data from the latest UK Infant Feeding Study of more than 10,000 mothers also showed that three-quarters of new mums largely avoided eggs and more than one in ten did not feed their babies with boiled eggs. But widespread vaccination of hens against the infection among producers taking part in the British Lion scheme has ‘effectively eliminated’ the bug from their eggs. The British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) says the launch of a strict code of practice 15 years ago has been so successful that 90 per cent of British eggs are now laid by salmonella-vaccinated hens . The British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) says the launch of a strict code of practice 15 years ago has been so successful that 90 per cent of British eggs are now laid by salmonella-vaccinated hens. Each egg is stamped with a lion mark and a best-before date on the shell. Dr Juliet Gray, registered nutritionist and co-author of the review, said mothers may be unwittingly putting their children at greater risk of allergy by an avoidance strategy. She said research suggests delayed introduction of potential food allergens, such as eggs, during weaning may actually be counterproductive. In contrast the introduction of these foods while breastfeeding, between the ages of 4-7 months, could protect against developing allergies to these foods. Dr Gray said two trials are being carried out to test whether the approach works and two government committees are also reviewing the current advice on infant feeding and food allergy. She said ‘Eggs are highly nutritious, containing key nutrients including high quality protein, vitamin D, selenium, choline and omega-3 fatty acids, several of which are not found in many other foods. ‘Our review concluded that mums and their babies can be encouraged to eat eggs, as this could have a positive effect in terms of nutritional intake and may also help immune tolerance of eggs. ‘The BEIC advice that vulnerable groups can go back to runny eggs, if produced under the Lion scheme, should further reassure women that they can enjoy them normally in pregnancy and give them to their babies when weaning from six months.’ A nationwide salmonella scare in 1988 – sparked by Edwina Currie who was health minister at the time – resulted in vulnerable groups such as expectant mums, infants and the elderly being advised not to eat undercooked eggs.","Study has found that soft boiled eggs could be safe for pregnant women .

"A judge has ruled that the BBC was correct to reject a request by a journalist asking about whether each of the Royal Palaces has a television licence . A judge has ruled that the BBC should not release information about whether the Queen buys a TV licence because giving out this type of personal data is 'entirely unwarranted.' The decision was made after an almost two-year battle between Gordon McIntosh, a journalist, and the BBC because the corporation refused to release information to him about whether any of the Royal Palaces - including Balmoral, Clarence House and Windsor Castle - had a television licence. The lengthy wrangle has seen the request referred to appeal, the Information Commissioner and a tribunal, which all found the BBC was correct to withhold the information. This means it will impossible to confirm if the Queen and other members of the Royal Family buy a television licence to watch their favourite programmes. However many would assume they do, as a number of their preferred shows have emerged in recent years. Downton Abbey is understood to be a favourite for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Allen Leech, who plays Tom Branson in the drama, revealed Prince William told him he had become a fan of the show after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince George. The Queen is also widely rumoured to be a fan of gentle comedy Last of the Summer Wine. Television aerials were also a definite fixture at the Tower of London as in 1986 one of the tower's historic ravens was dismissed from service for eating one. Mr McIntosh initially wrote to the BBC in December 2012. He wanted to know whether the £145.50 annual licence fee was paid for televisions at each of the Royal Palaces including Highgrove House and Buckingham Palace, as well as for Westminster. In the request he wrote: 'I would like to know if the Royal Palaces, including Westminster, have licences for all of their televisions, and if you scrutinise and check in the same way as for residential or commercial premises. But the BBC rejected his request - made under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act - insisting the details were 'personal data' and therefore exempt. Judge Dhanji ruled determining whether TV licences are bought for the Royal Palaces including Buckingham Palace (above), Balmoral (bottom left) and Highrove (right) was an 'unwarranted' release of personal data . The argument over whether the TV licence information should be released has continued for two years . Mr McIntosh complained and asked the BBC to review its decision, stating that they should have given a list of all properties - for example all the apartments in Kensington Palace - detailing which have licences. This was rejected and referred to the Information Commissioner, who backed the BBC. The Information Commissioner upheld the BBC's decision saying there was 'a risk individuals could be identified from a full post code', given that there were so few residents in the specified addresses. 'TV Licence holders would have an expectation that the details about their licence held by the BBC would not be disclosed,' the Commissioner found, saying it was hard to see 'how disclosure would meet any specific public interest'. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are reportedly fans of Downton Abbey since Prince George was born . Last of the Summer Wine (left) is said to be a favourite of the Queen while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watch Michelle Dockery play Lady Mary Crawley in ITV drama Downton Abbey (right) since becoming parents . Mr McIntosh argued the decision and said 'a glaringly obvious public interest matter has been, in my opinion, negligently overlooked by the Information Commissioner's Office'. He said 'reliable sources' had told him many staff and non-royal residents in palace accommodation do not pay for TV licences and that, if they were not being prosecuted due to their 'links to the Monarch', the public should know. However, Judge Anisa Dhanji, sitting at the tribunal with fellow panel members Michael Jones and Nigel Watson today , said there was 'no evidence' to substantiate the claims, which were denied by the BBC. She concluded: 'Even if there was a legitimate interest and disclosure was necessary, we consider that disclosure would be unwarranted by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subjects.' The decision means we will not be able to get an answer to whether the Queen buys a TV licence . The judge concluded by dismissing suggestions by Mr McIntosh that the Information Commissioner had a 'vested interest in protecting the royal household'. 'There is also no evidence that the Commissioner has acted with anything other than impartially in this case,' she said. When the BBC earlier asked Mr McIntosh to clarify the addresses he was referring to, he also asked to know how many 'exemption requests' the corporation had received for these premises in the past two years. He wanted to know: 'Are you pro-actively making, and then following up on licensing requests to these premises and how many requests were made in the last two years to how many 'properties' within the palaces/government residences?' The BBC replied, clarifying that it was its 'duty to ensure that everyone in the UK who needs a licence has one' and stating that there had been no requests for exemptions from the specified addresses. Almost 200,000 people are prosecuted a year – one in nine of all lower court cases - and more than 50 people were sent to prison in 2012-2013 for failing to buy a TV licence. TV Licensing last year released some of the worst excuses for failing to pay. These included one person who said: 'Apparently my dog, which is a corgi, is related to the Queen's dog so I didn't think I needed a TV Licence. Another person said they thought they could avoid the charge because they spent a lot of time watching television at a neighbour's house.","BBC rejected request by journalist about TV licences at the Royal Palaces .

"A furious Gordon Brown yesterday attacked David Cameron’s English votes plan and warned he was jeopardising the ‘still fragile’ Union. In an outspoken attack on his successor, the former Prime Minister accused the Tories of playing into the Nationalists’ hands and warned: 'Nations can be lost by accident.' He warned that their income tax proposals were ‘100 per cent wrong’ and risk destroying Scotland’s relationship with the rest of the UK. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called the Tories' income tax proposals '100 per cent wrong' Mr Brown wrestled back the referendum debate after a late surge by the separatists last month and – despite not being nominated by Labour to be part of the Smith Commission on new powers for Scotland – has submitted his own personal views. He believes Scotland should be responsible for raising 54 per cent of the money it spends but rejects Tory proposals to give it complete control of income tax. ‘It just does not make sense to devolve 100 per cent of income tax to the Scottish parliament,’ the Labour MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath said yesterday. ‘The Conservatives have got this wrong. They are 100 per cent wrong. ‘They’ve got to understand that their measures are a gift to the separatists, they would play into the hands of the Nationalist party. ‘They would drive a wedge between Scotland and England and make the constitution unstable. ‘I will be saying that during the course of this week when I put forward my own proposals about how to solve this problem. I think what the Conservatives have to realise is what is at stake here is the future of the UK. It’s still fragile. ‘There are grievances as a result of what Mr Cameron said the day after the referendum. I think he did so in an unstatesmanlike way and he should regret what he did.’ He added: ‘I think the Conservatives have to think again about playing fast and loose with the constitution. Nations can be lost by accident; unions can disintegrate because mistakes were made.’ Just hours after Scots decisively rejected independence, Mr Cameron linked the promise of further powers for Holyrood with English votes for English laws south of the Border. The proposals would limit the role of Scots MPs in English issues that have been devolved – such as health and education. It would cause huge problems for Labour, which has 41 Scots MPs. It could be in power in Westminster but in a minority in England. Mr Brown fears that the full devolution of income tax would further limit the role of Scots MPs and make it easier for the SNP to argue for independence. Mr Brown has accused David Cameron of jeopardising the 'still fragile' Union . In his submission to the commission, he warns: ‘Full devolution of income tax rates and bands does not sit easily with the wish to maintain the Union and to prevent a wedge being driven between Scotland and England. ‘Our Union is based on the pooling and sharing of resources and that is why the UK Government – with its responsibilities for macroeconomic management and redistribution – must play a role in relation to income tax. ‘Leaving Parliament at Westminster with no influence over income tax in Scotland could undermine the political union, by calling into question the legitimacy of tax decisions which today affect the whole UK.’ Nicola Sturgeon has claimed the Smith Commission should deliver everything except foreign affairs and defence – far more than any party set out before the referendum. ‘Their plan adds up to separation by another route,’ Mr Brown said at the weekend. The Scots Tories – who are represented by former leader Annabel Goldie and Professor Adam Tomkins on the commission – have indicated they are prepared to add to their offer by saying it represents ‘a floor, not a ceiling’. A party spokesman said: ‘We think income tax should be devolved with no strings attached and look forward to trying to persuade others – including Mr Brown – of that case. ‘We go into these negotiations open-minded and have made clear that the Strathclyde proposals are very much a basis rather than a limit. These proposals were meticulously considered over the course of more than a year and we are confident they are the best way forward.’ Meanwhile, the SNP believes Mr Brown has backtracked on his rhetoric before the referendum, when he talked of a ‘modern form of Scottish home rule’. Pete Wishart, Nationalist MP for Perth and North Perthshire, described Mr Brown’s contributions to the debate on Scotland’s future as ‘increasingly surreal’ and ‘full of inconsistencies and contradictions’. He said: ‘Before the referendum, Gordon Brown posed as a guarantor of the “vow” – the promise to deliver wide-ranging new powers to Holyrood – but then resorted to asking people to sign a petition to ensure its delivery. ‘He is now calling on other Westminster parties to do more – but his own party’s proposals for more powers are even weaker than the Tories’ or the Liberal Democrats’. ‘Mr Brown attacks plans to give Scotland all control of income tax, even suggesting they are a “Trojan horse” to deliver full fiscal autonomy – but if he was in any way consistent with the pre-referendum vow to the people of Scotland, he would be throwing all his weight behind full fiscal autonomy for Holyrood.’","Gordon Brown says Tories' income tax proposals are '100 per cent wrong'

"A North Korean official has claimed there is nothing wrong with the country's 'dear leader' Kim Jong Un - dispelling any rumours of failing health or gout. Kim Yang-Gon, who heads a ruling party department in charge of South Korea-related affairs, was speaking during an extremely rare visit to South Korea. Following whispers of a debilitating illness or even a coup in Pyongyang, he told South Korea's Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-Jae - 'there is nothing wrong with the health of Secretary Kim'. Scroll down for video . North Korean official Kim Yang-Gon (right) told a South Korean minister there was nothing wrong with their leader Kim Jong Un - he is pictured here with Pyongyang's second most powerful man, Hwang Pyong-So (left) The statement was quoted by the South Korean politician on a television talk show today. North Korean official, Kim Yang-Gon, was visiting the South's western port of Incheon yesterday to attend the closing ceremony of the Asian Games, along with two other high-ranking officials. The delegation, led by Pyongyang's second most powerful man, Hwang Pyong-So, flew back to Pyongyang after a series of meetings with Ryoo and other South Korean officials. The minister said Hwang had asked him to deliver a 'heartfelt greeting' from Kim Jong-Un to South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, but there was no specific message from the leader. The North's leader has not been seen in public for a month, fuelling rumours about his health and even triggering reports of a coup. Kim, 31, who is frequently the centrepiece of the isolated country's propaganda, has not been photographed by state media since September 3, fuelling speculation he is unwell. He has also been seen walking with a limp . Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power (right) after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show . A rare admission from North Korea nine days ago that he was suffering 'discomfort' triggered frenzied speculation and close scrutiny of any mention of the young leader in state media. In recent state TV footage of Kim his weight appears to have ballooned - thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese. He has also been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on Thursday appeared to have difficulty walking. And rumours of an illness multiplied after he failed to attend a meeting of the North's rubber-stamp parliament last week. South Korea's prime minister stands with South and North Korean officials during the closing ceremony of the 17th Asian Games at the Asiad Main Stadium in Incheon, South Korea, yesterday . Kim, 31, took over the reins of power in North Korea following the death of his father Kim Jong-Il in December 2011. Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website, believes that the leader is suffering from gout. He said: 'Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something (due to) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family.' The North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp. Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic. Pyongyang's second most powerful man, Hwang Pyong-So (right) offered Korean prime minister, Jung Hong-won, greetings from their enigmatic 'dear leader' Kim Jong Un . Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror. North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung. He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s. Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. 'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'","Official, Kim Yang-Gon, was visiting South Korea for close of Asian Games .

"It is an embarrassing moment for any diner - going to pay and having your credit card declined. But this is the fate that met President Barack Obama during a recent meal at a New York restaurant.

Instead, Mrs Obama had to pay. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama (pictured speaking at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington today) revealed his credit card was rejected during a recent meal with his wife, Michelle, in New York . 'I went to a restaurant in New York when I was there during the General Assembly, and my credit card was rejected,' Obama told employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington. 'I guess I don't use it enough, so they thought there was some fraud going on. Fortunately, Michelle had hers.

It comes amid growing concern over the security of Americans' financial data, with an estimated 100 million people having been affected by breaches in the past year. In addition, the government will apply the security chips and personal identification numbers (PINs) that replace signatures to all existing and newly issued government credit cards, Obama said. Meanwhile, payment terminals at federal government facilities will be equipped to handle cards with the new technology. Couple: The decline of Obama's credit card meant that his wife had to pay for the meal. Above, the couple . Obama said that for victims of fraud and identity crimes, the experience is infuriating and heartbreaking. He said the problem requires a hands-on approach across the government. The White House says the idea of the government program is to lead by example, to nudge the broader financial industry and retailers toward more secure standards. Obama noted that Home Depot Inc., Target Corp., Walgreen Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plan to install payment terminals  equipped to handle cards with digital security chips and PINs. He also cited a plan by American Express Co. to support small businesses that upgrade their payment terminals with more secure standards.

"'Attack': Johnathan Ball, 26, allegedly bit off a broker's nose in the middle of a crowded nightclub . A City worker bit off a broker’s nose in the middle of a crowded nightclub in the capital after a row over a spilt drink, a court heard today. Johnathan Ball, 26, of Whetstone, north London, is said to have sunk his teeth into Christopher Woolcott on the dancefloor at Babble City. The alleged attack was described as ‘completely unnecessary’ and ‘savage’ at the Old Bailey. Mark Gadsden, prosecuting, said: ‘He got on top of him and using his teeth bit into the other man’s nose with sufficient ferocity that he bit through the cartilage and the flesh of the nose and then using his teeth ripped off the front of the other man’s nose.’ Mr Woolcott, a broker in his 30s, was out celebrating a friend’s birthday when a trivial row started in the early hours of February 24, 2013. Mr Gadsden said: ‘In the crowded nightclub it would seem a drink got spilt over somebody else. An apology wasn’t forthcoming or wasn’t accepted and people involved decided punches should be thrown. 'The bouncers intervened and Mr Ball is pulled to one side and Mr Woolcott is pulled away to the other side and the event should have ended there.’ CCTV footage shows Ball then broke free of the door staff and launched himself at Mr Woolcott, the court heard. ‘At that point he decided he was going to launch a completely unnecessary and savage attack on the other man who was then being restrained by the bouncers,’ said Mr Gadsden. Location: The incident happened on the dancefloor at Babble City on Old Broad Street near Liverpool Street train station in the City of London last year. The club is pictured here in its former guise as The Wall . ‘He broke free of them, lunged across the dancefloor, grabbed hold of the other man’s head and then wrestled him out of the grip of the bouncers, pulled him to the floor and then got on top of him.’ The alleged biting was not captured on CCTV but Mr Woolcott was said to have been left with blood streaming from the wound as Ball left the club on Old Broad Street near Liverpool Street train station. 'An apology wasn't forthcoming or wasn't accepted and people involved decided punches should be thrown' Mark Gadsden, prosecuting . Mr Woolcott has since had to have a skin graft to repair the damage, the court was told. Ball initially told police that the attack was carried out by somebody else but now accepts he was responsible for the injury and claims he acted in self-defence, it was said. Mr Gadsden added: ‘The Crown say that is completely wrong.’  Ball denies inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and the lesser alternative of inflicting grievous bodily harm. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Johnathan Ball 'sank his teeth into Christopher Woolcott at London club'

"New York City firefighters have been banned from using the word 'Ebola' on their radios in because it could trigger panic in the city. A New York Fire Department (FDNY) memo instructs all personnel to use vaguer terms when referring to the deadly virus. Instead, they should use the code letters 'F/T', as in Fever/Travel, over the radio to indicate a 911 caller has a fever and a history of travel to West Africa. New York City firefighters have been forbidden from using the word 'Ebola' as it may cause widespread panic . The secret code is intended to hide any potential cases of Ebola from members of the public or media who are monitoring emergency radio channels. 'Just like you can’t say bomb on an airplane, we can’t say ""Ebola"", a source told the New York Post. 'Back in the ’80s and ’90s, taking universal precautions meant someone has AIDS. And we weren’t allowed to say AIDS either.' President Barack Obama has vowed his administration will be more aggressive in fighting Ebola, which has triggered a major health scare in the United States after one man died from the virus last month and two nurses who treated him have been confirmed as infected. Liberian man Thomas Eric Duncan died in Dallas after returning from Africa, and two nurses who treated him contracted the disease despite taking precautionary measures. Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan and both have been diagnosed with Ebola . It is still unclear how Amber Vinson and the other infected nurse, Nina Pham, contracted the virus. Both wore face shields, hazardous materials suits and protective footwear as they drew blood and dealt with Mr Duncan's body fluids. Health officials are now seeking to trace 132 people who flew on a plane with Ms Vinson the day before she fell ill. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it wanted to interview the passengers on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas, Texas on Monday. Despite the two nurses contracting the virus, officials in New York are confident that first responders can treat potential patients without falling ill. The ambulance carrying Ms Vinson, the second health care worker to be diagnosed with Ebola in Texas, arrived at the Emory University Hospital, in Atlanta, yesterday . Avoid direct contact with sick patients as the virus is spread through contaminated body fluids . Wear goggles to protect eyes . Clothing and clinical waste should be incinerated and any medical equipment that needs to be kept should be decontaminated . People who recover from Ebola should abstain from sex or use condoms for three months . FDNY medics who respond to at-risk patients have been told to wear polyethylene-coated paper gowns, gloves and face masks with plastic eye visors, officials said. Officials were given a memo laying out a 19-step process for putting on and then safely removing and disposing of their protective gowns and gloves. The FDNY also has a dozen elite 'Haztec' workers in each borough designated to deal with potential Ebola patients who are vomiting, bleeding or suffering diarrhea, sources said. They are equipped with $2,000 in special protective gear and would provide transport to a hospital. 'Haztec' workers have been equipped with $2,000 in protective gear and would provide transport to hospitals .

"The identity of the traveler who was filmed as he made homophobic comments at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday before attacking a man has finally been revealed. Airport police reports released on Tuesday show that he is a 27-year-old from Shelbyville, Tennessee, whose name is McCleish Christmas Benham. Video of Benham's attack, which ends with him being tackled to the ground by a group of heroic fellow travelers attempting to help the victim, has been viewed 4 million times on YouTube. Scroll down for video . Meet McCleish: The homophobe who became infamous after a video of him attacking a passenger went viral has been revealed as McCleish Christmas Bunham (above) of Shelbyville, Tenneesse . Assault: Bunham can be seen above as he kicks a man in a pink shirt he believed to be 'queer' According to the complainant in the report, who is the man in the pink shirt Benham can be seen attacking in the video, the whole melee began when Benham got into an argument with an American Airlines gate agent. After insulting the agent, the complainant informed a visibly intoxicated Benham that police were on the way in an attempt to diffuse the situation, and when the agent then asked if Benham had been drinking, the man replied, 'Yes, 100 drinks.' At this point, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Benham punched the complainant in the eye, for no apparent reason, called him a gay slur, and then began berating another traveler. It seems that it was only then that Andrew Kennedy, the man who posted the YouTube video, began filming the incident on his cellphone, actually missing the beginning of the physical altercation. How it all began: The complainant (above in pink shirt) angered Benham (in a green sweatshirt) when he tried to defend a gate agent the man had been berating . Then, as the airport officer arrived on the scene, Benham again starting attacking the complainant, kicking him in the groin and pulling his hair before five nearby passengers tackled him to the ground. When asked why he was attacking the complainant, Benham told one of the men subduing him, 'This is America, that’s why. It’s the same reason you get to live, to breathe, to walk black. You know what I’m talking about?' Benham is being charged with simple assault and public intoxication. The complainant, who wishes to remain unnamed, declined medical attention and had no visible marks or bruises. One positive: One of the men who took down Benham, Ben Kravit (above), was confused for actor Paul Rudd when the video went viral . Double take: Kravit (circled in red) does bear a striking resemblance to Rudd . At least one person is getting something good out of this incident however, as Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old Dallas man who helped take Benham down, caused quite the stir on Monday when many watching the video believed him to be famed actor Paul Rudd. Kravit said of that experience in an email to Jezebel on Tuesday, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.'","The homophobe filmed attacking a man he though was gay at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday is McCleish Christmas Benham .

"A famous Cornwall beauty spot that was stripped of its golden sand beach last winter is ready to welcome holidaymakers again after the sand reappeared following last Wednesday's storms. Poldhu Cove on the Lizard Peninsula took a big hit last February when it was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand a short distance off shore. But more bad weather turned out to be a good thing for the popular family spot because it caused hundreds of tonnes of sand to be dumped back onto the shore. Poldhu Cove beach is pictured before it was stripped of its sand during storms last winter . Holidaymakers were unable to enjoy a sandy beach at Poldhu Cove during the warm summer months . The sandy cove is located on the Lizard Peninsula and is protected by hills . Locals are celebrating the return of the sandy beach, although they admit it will take some time before it returns to its former glory. Ross Hocking, who owns the Poldhu Beach Cafe, said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year after winter erosion stripped it back further than he had ever remembered. He said: 'It is unbelievable how much sand has returned over such a short period of time. 'There is a large stone wall around the entrance of the cove and cafe and it's normally covered by the sand and has not been seen for years. 'Last winter, the entire 7ft wall was uncovered.' The sand reappeared at Poldhu Cove beach after last Wednesday's storms (file photo) The beach was stripped down to pebbles and shingle by storms that dragged the beautiful sand off shore . Ross Hocking, who owns the Poldhu Beach Cafe, said he has never seen the beach change so much in a year . Without its golden sand holidaymakers and locals were unable to fully enjoy the beach over the warm summer, but Mr Hocking believes its return is perfectly timed for the October half-term holidays. 'Although it may take some time for the beach to recover fully, I am sure that in time it will be back to how everyone remembers it - a sandy, safe beautiful cove.' Lead Lizard ranger Justin Whitehouse said the sand's return was good news for the beach, which is managed by the National Trust. 'It's not completely back to normal - that could take years - but from our point of view it shows that it's all a natural process.' Lead Lizard ranger Justin Whitehouse said it could take years for the beach to return to normal . Beaches such as Church Cove, Gunwalloe and Praa Sands suffered the same fate during last winter's storms . He added: 'Poldhu is a closed system, which means the sand has been just off-shore. This isn't sand coming in from deep water. 'It's what we would expect, although I think it will take a few more storms to fully recover. It's so unpredictable.' 'The pool at Poldhu that formed on the beach, which became a bit yucky with algae and the lack of rainfall over the warm summer, has now disappeared. 'The river has taken a new course.'","Sand was dumped back onto Poldhu Cove beach during bad weather .

"George Osborne made sure he had an all-American experience at an American football game by tucking into a hot dog while sitting in the stands. The Chancellor enjoyed the snack as he sat in the Royal Box at Wembley on Sunday night, where he saw the Dallas Cowboys take on the Jacksonville Jaguars. But he was careful to eat the hot dog in bite-sized pieces - avoiding a repeat of Ed Miliband's well-publicised bacon sandwich blunder from earlier this year. Open wide! George Osborne tucked into the hot dog as he watched an American football game at Wembley . Bite-sized: The Chancellor was careful not to repeat Mr Miliband's bacon sandwich PR blunder by chewing . Mr Osborne was joined by his son Luke, an avid fan of the sport, and the pair kept a close eye on the game as they watched the Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17. Mr Osborne, who studied in North Carolina, has said that he is keen to push forward with the idea of bringing the National Football League to England on a permanent basis. Last month he opened talks with American Football authorities and has held discussions over using Wembley as a permanent base. The photographs taken of Mr Osborne echo those taken of Labour leader Ed Miliband as he sat down to a bacon sandwich while on a visit to London in April. A number of photographs showed Mr Miliband pulling a series of contorted faces as he ate the sandwich during a visit to new Covent Garden Market. The incident was well-publicised, with many drawing attention to Mr Miliband's awkward nature.

Speaking to the Evening Standard last month, Mr Osborne said: 'One of London's massive strengths is its sporting prowess, its great football  teams. Avid fan: Mr Osborne was joined by his son Luke, pictured, who he credits with driving his interest in the sport . 'This is primarily a decision for the owners of the clubs and the NFL organisation but I've said to the NFL that anything the Government can do to make this happen we will do, because I think it would be a huge boost to London.'

"Three Democratic lawmakers asked President Barack Obama on Thursday to ban travelers from the West . African countries hit hardest by the Ebola virus from entering the U.S. until the . outbreak of the disease is under control. Democratic Reps. Alan Grayson, Kyrsten Sinema, Dave Loebsack and 23 Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to Obama calling on him to direct the State Department . to impose a travel ban and restrict visas issued to citizens of . Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In the letter, dated Oct. 8, they also asked U.S. health and . border control officials to consider quarantine for anyone who . arrives from the affected nations after being exposed to Ebola . until 21 days have passed, the period in which they would show . signs of the illness. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama arrives at Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park in San Dimas, California, this afternoon to designate 346,177 acres of national forest land in the San Gabriel Mountains as a national monument . Obama took a break from dealing with Ebola crisis and the war against ISIS to travel to California to sign the proclamation and attend a fundraiser . 'We note that Congressman Grayson made this request to your administration in July, and that 27 African countries already have taken such action to protect their on citizens, but the United States inexplicably has not,' the letter states. The lawmakers go on to say Obama should not wait for the World Health Organization to dictate how U.S. authorities should proceed. 'The WHO is an organization of unelected bureaucrats and political appointees of foreign countries,' they wrote. 'It has no duty to protect the lives and well-being of Americans, as you do. 'Furthermore, it has utterly failed to stem this epidemic through its own action,' they added. The letter was released a day after the death of the first . person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, a Liberian man . who traveled from his home country on Sept. 19 and died in an . isolation ward of a Dallas, Texas hospital. The case put authorities and the public on alert for the . deadly virus and the government increased efforts to try and . stop it from spreading outside West Africa. 'Since there is no effective means to identify asymptomatic travelers who harbor the disease, often unknowingly, only a temporary travel ban...can prevent the further spread of Ebola to the United States,'  Grayson, a Democrat from Florida, said in a statement on Thursday. In the same statement Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, a Republican who signed the letter, said the the U.S. 'must do all we can to protect our country from infection while aiding in the effort to combat this deadly disease.' 'Taking necessary action to protect our citizens is paramount and is the sole responsibility of the United States government; not the U.N. or the WHO,' he added. U.S. health authorities on Wednesday announced they would . begin enhanced screening of travelers for fever from the . affected countries at five major airports after resisting earlier demands from federal lawmakers to beef up security measures. The Ebola virus has killed nearly 4,000 people in Sierra . Leone, Liberia and Guinea since March in the largest outbreak on . record. It causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct . contact with body fluids from an infected person. The U.S. Defense Department won permission to shift $750 million in war funds to fight Ebola in West Africa as a Republican senator on Friday lifted his remaining objections to the transfer. The action by Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma will give the Pentagon enough funding for about six months of operations in West Africa, including the deployment of up to 4,000 troops and the establishment some 17 Ebola treatment facilities with 100 beds each. 'After careful consideration, I believe that the outbreak has reached a point that the only organization in the world able to provide the capabilities and speed necessary to respond to this crisis is the U.S. military,' Inhofe said in a statement. The representatives who wrote to Obama on Thursday made it clear that they support 'all efforts to provide humanitarian relief' to West Africa.

"Gordon Greer was surprised to hear Robert Lewandowski complaining about his robust challenge in Scotland's 2-2 draw against Poland last month. The 33-year-old Brighton defender made his competitive debut in the European Championship qualifier in Warsaw and after 10 minutes left the Bayern Munich star in agony with a tackle described afterwards by Lewandowski as 'brutal'. The Pole also claimed that only a hammer could have inflicted similar damage to his shin guard. Gordon Greer challenges Robert Lewandowski last month in the Euro 2016 qualifier in Poland . However, speaking ahead of the Group D game against Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night, Greer said: 'It must have annoyed him to speak about it. 'But I didn't really expect anything to come of it so I was a bit surprised after the game that there was a bit made of it. 'I didn't think there was anything wrong with the tackle and neither did the referee. 'Obviously he was a bit upset by the challenge. It's just one of these things. 'I don't really know what to make of it. It doesn't really bother me to be honest. These things happen in football but I thought the game was played in a good spirit.'

"Britain’s Davis Cup captain Leon Smith has dismissed any suggestion that some of his team’s support for a Yes vote in the Scottish referendum will dilute their commitment to the GB cause next year. America will be the opposition for March’s first round, which will take place in Glasgow’s Emirates Arena, with Andy Murray already confirming that he will be leading Britain as it embarks on its second straight World Group campaign. At least two of Murray, his brother Jamie and Colin Fleming, are likely to be picked in what will be the first tie since their last-gasp tweeting of support for Scottish independence on the day of the vote itself. Leon Smith (left) insists that Andy Murray (right) will still 'work his arse off' for Great Britain . Murray, despite being a proud Scotsman, has always played for Team GB too . Smith, who is also Scottish, insisted that the players will be as passionate as ever about representing the United Kingdom as a whole, despite them being in favour of its break-up. The former Wimbledon champion appears to have made his mind up only on the final day of the debate, and has since said he regrets how he expressed his view, having insisted throughout that he would keep any thoughts to himself. ‘I think you will see him pull the shirt on and work his arse off,’ said Smith. ‘Everyone will see their pride when the national anthem plays. You can feel very Scottish and be proud of Great Britain. He will fight one hundred per cent in the British shirt and tracksuit like he always does.’ The decision to host the tie in Scotland is unconnected to their views, and more down to the availability of the venue at relatively short notice and the fact that previous ties in Glasgow have been very well supported, even when the former Wimbledon champion has not played. Murray ruffled some feathers with his tweet in support of Scottish independence, but later regretted it . Murray (left), along with his brother Jamie, will both play in the Davis Cup for Great Britain . ‘The right to express yourself on something like this is okay. We had the biggest political debate in our history and there was a huge wave of national debate. There was the opportunity to do something different and it didn’t happen. Life goes on and it feels like a lifetime ago, everything is going on as normal.’ Jamie Murray and Fleming – both of whose careers have considerably benefitted from the specialist coaching and support that has come from being part of Great Britain – will be in contention to partner the world number six in the doubles rubber, as will Londoner Dom Inglot. James Ward, another Londoner, is in pole position to play the second singles. Smith said that it is likely that an indoor hard court will be the surface used for the tie from March 6-8. ‘When we have played in Scotland before the atmosphere has been excellent and it’s important that Scotland gets to see world class tennis, there’s a lot of world class tennis down south for people to watch so it’s good that it gets to other places.’ Andy Murray is currently in London preparing for next week’s Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.","Andy Murray was one of a number of Scottish tennis players who tweeted in favour of a 'Yes' vote in the Scottish referendum .

"Last year, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg encouraged all females on planet earth to achieve greatness with her book 'Lean In' - but managed to make most of us feel slightly pathetic in the process with her personal tales of achievement. This year, American life coach Tara Mohr comes to the party with a slightly less daunting variation on the theme. Her newly launched book Playing Big, which has already received high praise Stateside, promises to equip women with the practical tools to 'quiet self-doubt, find their voice and identify their dreams'. It's no small promise but one which women's leadership expert Tara believes is achievable. Playing Big, she says, is about helping women find their voice. Reach for the sky: Playing Big by life coach Tara Mohr encourages women to 'quiet self-doubt, find their voice and identify their dreams' 'Five years ago, I began to see a pattern in my work: women with tremendous talent, ideas and aspiration often didn’t see their own brilliance,' she says. 'Too often, they were sitting on their big ideas rather than sharing them, holding back their most provocative questions rather than asking them.' This isn't only a book for high-flying businesswomen, the ideas are as relevant to stay-at-home mums as they are for CEOs. It includes advice on how to quieten your inner critic, embrace fear and communicate with power. The author also believes we need to unleash our naughty schoolgirl in order to play big and has dedicated a chapter  on how to drop 'good schoolgirl habits', like not showing off. But self-promotion, she points out, is a tricky balancing act for women. 'Research shows that women incur social costs for advocating for themselves too strongly; they are seen as less likable by those around them, especially by other women,' she says. 'Yet studies also show that women who don’t advocate for themselves at all are not seen as competent leaders. There is a tricky middle ground to find.' Playing Big, by Tara Mohr (left), is aimed at stay-at-home mums and CEOs alike . So how do we find this illusive point between allowing ourselves to be overlooked and coming across big-headed? Tara's first piece of advice is to drop the idea of 'self-promotion' and think about the concept of visibility. 'When you shift the frame to visibility, you’ll notice it’s not all about you. Instead, it becomes about making your work and ideas available to those who can utilize them,' says Tara. She also advises telling the whole truth. 'Women tell many little lies - lies of omission - about their accomplishments' she says. 'For many women, it’s helpful to think about “telling the whole truth” rather than about self- promoting, . 'Traditional schooling gives women many important skills, but it doesn’t teach many of those most essential for leadership,' she says. 'As women transition from student mode to career, they must add to their tool kit: the ability to challenge authority, the ability to improvise, the ability to draw on and trust what they already know and the ability to make their work visible to others.' The author has won praise from high-profile women including Maria Shriver, who describes the book as 'inspirational'. Another fan, author of Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert, says of the book: 'I hope it will empower legions of women to step into their greatness. I couldn’t be happier about this publication.' So what are you waiting for?...Greatness awaits.","New book, Playing Big, is written by American life coach  Tara Mohr .

"Former Reading striker Jason Roberts believes promising coaches and managers are being lost to the game simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds. Only 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, a new report has revealed. The figures show that only 3.4 per cent of the coaches employed come from BME backgrounds despite making up 25 per cent of professional players. Jason Roberts arrives for a meeting to discuss racism in football at 10 Downing Street in February 2012 . The report was carried out by the Sports Person's Think Tank, which has called for English football to set an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches to be from BME backgrounds by 2020. Roberts, who is one of the founding members of the think tank, says in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds. 'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country, many with international caps, some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches. Roberts scores for Reading against Southampton during his side's  npower Championship match in April 2012 . 'Talk to these individuals about the realities they faced, the number of jobs they applied for, the number of interviews they had, and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition."" The report highlights that low numbers of coaches from BME backgrounds complete UEFA coaching qualifications, with potential coaches deterred from going into management due to the perceived lack of opportunity. The report, funded by the European anti-discrimination body FARE, also states English football often operates 'insider' networks to recruit coaches based on personal connections rather than qualifications.","Only 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are held by black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches, according to new report .

"The first evidence of sexual intimacy has been discovered in the fossil of ancient fish, who engaged in the act in unusual ways long before originally predicted. Professor John Long has narrowed down the exact time in evolutionary history when sexual intercourse was first developed as a means for reproduction due to a 1cm bone in the male. Professor Long and his team from Flinders University in Adelaide published their findings in the scientific journal Nature today, which detailed that the first organisms to have sex were small armoured Scottish fish. Professor John Long has narrowed down the exact time in evolutionary history when sexual intercourse was first developed as a means for reproduction due to a 1cm bone in the male . The first organisms to have sex were small armoured Scottish fish with L-shaped claspers . Fossils of the ancient creatures, called antiarch placoderms, date from 430 million years ago and show that they were the first to develop differential male and female genitalia, and began engaging in the act in the freshwater lakes in which they lived. The paleontologist said he first came across a lone 1cm L-shaped bone last year in a fossil collection from private and museum sources from Estonia, Britain, Sweden and China, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. 'When you look at the shape of these structures they can't possibly do anything in a missionary position,' said Professor Long. 'We've printed out 3D models of these fish and I can play mating games with them and the only way possible they can do it is sideways, square dance style, with their little arms entangled,' he said. The Estonian fossil collection revealed the most primitive sexual organ ever found, allowing internal sex for the first time. These sexual acts were not performed front on. Instead the fish engaged in intercourse on the side, with the male possessing a pair of claspers designed to lock male genitalia in place for mating. The L-shaped claspers were inserted into the female's mirrored genital holes, aiding the behaviour  and ensuring successful reproduction. Significantly, Professor Long said that this discovery also indicated that the sexual act was not purely for practical measures. 'This is not just about bony structures on these fish, it's about the evolution of behaviour, of when sex first became fun,' he said. 'Why would something develop these big bony clasper things and place them inside a female unless they enjoyed the act.' The paleontologist said that this is one of the first indications of the evolution of sexual intercourse leading up to humans.

'It was hurting me badly and it took me a long time to come to terms with these failures. 'I even contemplated moving away from the sport completely, as it seemed nothing was going my way,' Tendulkar has written in the book which is set to be released on Thursday. Tendulkar retired from the game last year with most major batting records against his name. He amassed a record 15,921 runs with 51 centuries in 200 tests and 18,426 runs with 49 centuries in 463 one-dayers but did not have a good record as captain.

"The All Blacks have taunted England by claiming their Twickenham performance was a backward step and Stuart Lancaster’s men must play a more attacking game to be world beaters. England lost 24-21 to the world champions, making it four successive defeats following last summer’s 3-0 whitewash, and the final scoreline flattered the hosts.

They scored a great try by passing the ball but later on they closed up a bit. They will learn a lot from this game.’ Read’s team-mate, fly half Aaron Cruden, agreed that England — who will consider starting George Ford at No 10 against South Africa on Saturday with Owen Farrell at inside centre — went into their shells in the second half. Danny Care of England is stopped by Aaron Cruden... and the Kiwi had more to say after the game . New Zealand No 8 Kieran Read, the world player of the year, said he saw more from England in June . ‘At the start of the second half we felt we got a bit of dominance and England went away from using the ball a bit,’ Cruden said. ‘They reverted a lot to kicking and trying to put pressure on us that way. In the first half they were chancing their arm a bit. They turned down a shot at goal and kicked to the corner. ‘In the second half they reverted to being forward-orientated and kicking the ball. We were expecting them to use the ball more, but we adapted well.’ England went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive New Zealand team .

"Parts of the country are having their bins collected only once every three weeks. Households in Gwynedd yesterday became the first in Wales to some have some of their bins emptied on a three weekly basis. It comes after Bury Council became the first in Britain to make the controversial move earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Bury Council says since it moved to fortnightly grey bins in 2011, recycling rates up from 27% to 47% (file photo) The Labour-led authority in Greater Manchester said it would save £800,000 a year and boost recycling rates to 60 per cent in the borough. It believes that many will follow its lead. Its grey bin for general household rubbish, green bin for paper and cardboard, and blue bin for glass, plastic bottles and cans are all now collected every three weeks. The brown bin for garden and food waste is still collected every two weeks. In Gwynedd it is just general household rubbish that is being switched to three weekly collection. Food waste and recyclable products will still be collected weekly. Gwynedd council approved the plan in April despite protests from residents. The council said it would save it £350,000 a year as well as reducing landfill waste and encouraging recycling. Bury Council said: ‘It will save a fortune especially in landfill tax fines. Since we moved to fortnightly grey bins in 2011, our recycling rate has shot up from 27% to 47%. Local government minister Kris Hopkins says ‘no case’ for the cuts and backs weekly collections (file photo) ‘We’re spending £10m a year treating and disposing of waste that can’t be recycled.’ But fears have been raised by residents over bad smells and vermin problems, . Local Government Minister Kris Hopkins said there was ‘absolutely no case’ for the cuts and backs weekly collections. Conservative MP Mr Hopkins said: ‘This government is working with councils to support weekly rubbish and recycling collections which protect the local environment and public health.’ He said near-monthly collections would ‘encourage fly-tipping, backyard burning and harm local amenity. ‘Our research has comprehensively shown councils can deliver savings through better procurement, more joint working and adopting new technology.’ Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Eric Pickles has previously said that every English resident should expect weekly bin collections, let alone fortnightly or every three weeks. He said in 2012: ‘I believe it’s a fundamental right for every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected.’ Bury council said: ‘It has been claimed changes would cause flies or maggots but brown bins for food and garden waste will continue to be collected every two weeks.’","Homes in Gwynedd became first in Wales yesterday for new refuse service .

"Refusal: Owen Paterson has refused a Freedom of Information Act request to supply details about talks with the GM industry trade body . Ministers are trying to cover up secret briefings with GM companies hoping to push ‘Frankenfood’ on to dinner tables. Owen Paterson has refused a Freedom of Information Act request to supply details about talks with the GM industry trade body. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary has led the charge to encourage a sceptical public to accept genetically modified crops being grown on UK farms and sold in supermarkets. He has also been lobbying the EU to let Britain grow crops such as GM maize even if they are banned in other countries. It has emerged that these efforts are being carried out in partnership with the Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which is financed by GM companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer CropScience. The revelations come weeks after it was revealed that a group of scientists behind an official government study backing GM all had links to the industry. Now there is evidence of meetings and briefings involving ministers and the ABC and its industry backers. There have been no such meetings with groups worried about the impact of GM on human health and the countryside. The campaign group GeneWatch UK made a Freedom of Information request to find out what was said at the briefings, but Mr Paterson’s department has refused to give details. The group has lodged a formal complaint with the Information Commissioner in the hope that ministers will be forced to admit how GM companies are driving government policy. Action: The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary has led the charge to encourage a sceptical public to accept genetically modified crops being grown on UK farms and sold in supermarkets (file picture) GeneWatch director Dr Helen Wallace said: ‘The evidence strongly suggests the Government is colluding with the GM industry to manipulate the media, undermine access to GM-free-fed meat and dairy products and plot the return of GM crops to Britain. ‘The public have a right to know what is going on behind closed doors.’ Dr Wallace added: ‘Ministers who should be protecting our environment have put Monsanto and Syngenta in the driving seat of policy on GM crops and foods, despite growing evidence that the GM crops... will harm British wildlife such as butterflies.’ Defra has refused to provide details of a telephone conference between the department and the ABC on June 10 last year. Ten days later, Mr Paterson made a speech calling for opposition to be dropped and claiming GM crops and food were ‘probably safer’ than the conventional equivalent. The ministry has also refused to release a ‘message on media suggestions’ sent by the ABC to Defra last April, or details of discussions between Monsanto and Defra two months before. Tesco, Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Sainsbury’s later decided to end bans on using GM feed for chickens. Defra has also refused to provide details of a meeting and emails between former environment minister David Heath and the ABC in January last year. Defra said: ‘We provided as much information as possible  in response to GeneWatch’s request. Any information withheld was within the legislation.’ ABC deputy chairman Dr Tom Lyall said: ‘We have regular dialogue with a range of stakeholders, including policy makers.’","Ministers are trying to cover up secret briefings with GM companies .

"Young Wasps fly-half Alex Lozowski scored 22 points to inspire his team to a 43-22 win over London Irish and give them a chance to progress to the LV= Cup knock-out stages. Lozowski booted five penalties and converted all four of his side's tries as Wasps grabbed a crucial bonus point in their battle for qualification. Prop Simon McIntyre, wing Josh Bassett, number eight Guy Thompson and replacement Elliot Daly went over for the home tries as they replied from three points down at the break to win the second period 27-3. Fly half Alex Lozowski carries forward against London Irish as his 22 points helped Wasps to victory . Irish fly-half Myles Dorrian kept his side in the game during the opening period with four penalties and a conversion of prop Leo Halavatau's try, but could only add one further penalty before the end. The key to the win was the Wasps pack, who were dominant at the set-piece, but their mistakes within kicking distance kept Irish in the game during the first period. Dorrian took advantage of an early error with a penalty and added a second to keep his side in front after Lozowski had opened the hosts' account. But the powerful pack set the trend and were at the forefront of Wasps' opening try when a drive reached the Irish line and McIntyre picked up from a ruck, went left around the fringe and found a gap for a converted touchdown. Wasps' Elliot Daly scores a try in the corner as Alex Lewington (top) and Ross Neal fail to hold him back . Wasps started to stretch out when Lozowski booted his second penalty, but another error saw the clinical Exiles fly-half make it a third successful penalty. And the Exiles chipped away at the Wasps lead again with the half-time whistle approaching and got to within four points as Dorrian struck for a fourth time, this penalty from 38 metres. And the visitors' tenacity paid off as centre Ross Neal, who had come close to scoring earlier in the half, nearly got a try, but was hauled down just short. Yet, from the series of rucks that followed, nobody could stop powerful Tongan Halavatau from going over from two metres. Darren Allinson clears the ball from the ruck as the Exiles fall to Wasps at Adams Park . With Dorrian converting and adding another penalty on the re-start, Irish were set fair with a six-point advantage. But that was as good as it got for Irish, whose hopes of progression are now hanging by a thread. Wasps retook the lead when Bassett finished off a great move which involved his stand-off in the left corner, with the conversion taking his side a point to the good. The home side never lost the lead after that - and did not look likely to either as two more penalties from Lozowski put Wasps further ahead. Wasps and Irish players line up to observe a two-minute silence on Remembrance Sunday . Irish did not help themselves when replacement prop Jamie Hagan found himself in the sin-bin inside the final quarter of the game. And that signalled the end of the Irish challenge. The home fly-half put his forwards five metres from the Exiles line and, with them a man down, a driving line-out saw Thompson easily bundle his way over. The bonus point was sealed when Wasps turned over an Irish attack near the home line for a spectacular 80-metre converted try which was started by Lozowski and finished by flyer Daly.","Wasps have a shot at making LV= Cup knockout phase after victory .

"As our vessel cut through the Pacific waves, the dolphins tucked themselves under the bow, taking it in turns to playfully surf the wake. In any other circumstances, it would have been a beautiful sight. But now I could hardly bear to watch, sick to my stomach at the prospect of what was about to happen. For up above the dolphins, on the deck of the Peruvian fishing boat, stood its captain, brandishing a razor-sharp harpoon. Scroll down for video . Hunter: A Peruvian fisehrman takes aim at a dolphin swimming alongside the boat . He steadied himself, carefully watching the rhythm of the dolphins as they surfaced for air. There was a momentary pause... and then he struck, hurling 30kg of tubular steel into the dolphin’s back as it swam alongside. As the harpoon sliced through the dolphin’s flesh, a cry of excitement went up from the crew as they celebrated their catch. Our cameraman Ale and I watched in horror as the rope attached to the harpoon snaked away from the boat. Fifty yards away, the dolphin’s beak broke the surface as it struggled to escape the line, slowly tiring as it became enveloped in a thick cloud of its own blood. Two crewmen dragged the rope in, the dolphin still desperately thrashing, but there was to be no miracle escape. As the dying animal neared the boat, a shiny steel hook was plunged into its head and it was hauled aboard, intestines pouring out of the wound where the harpoon had gone clean through. The body was still twitching. Fatal shot: The fisherman lets loose his 30kg harpoon after taking careful aim . A crew member sharpened a knife and casually began to slice off the fins, tossing them into the sea.As the thick puddle of bright red blood widened, he began to peel the skin off its back. The hunt was over, the dolphin dead, the fishermen had their bait. With the excitement temporarily at an end, the crew were quickly back into their normal routine. The salsa music went back on the wheelhouse stereo and a cry from the cook announced that lunch was ready. A crew member handed me a bowl of soup but as I crouched on the deck next to the skinless carcass of an animal that only a few moments earlier had been effortlessly racing through the ocean waves, I vomited. I looked at Ale and saw the same look of nauseous horror on his face but we both knew we could say nothing. We were 100km off shore, surrounded by fishermen who regarded what we had just seen as entirely normal: to say anything about the killing or to be seen portraying any negative emotion could be very dangerous. Hauling: The fisherman drag up the dolphin carcass before butchering it on board the ship . But at least we had finally witnessed what we had come to see. We had concrete proof of what, until now, had only been rumour: namely that thousands of dolphins are being killed by Peruvian fishermen who then cut them up and use them as bait for shark fishing. In marine conservation terms, that’s a double catastrophe, with dolphins — many species of which are protected — being killed to catch sharks, many species of which are now endangered. It is thought to be the world’s biggest dolphin slaughter and, as an investigative environmental journalist, I was determined to see it for myself. I secured the bulk of my funding from the Pulitzer Centre for Crisis Reporting, an American organisation, and set about trying to arrange a trip. After months of patient negotiation, I’d found a skipper willing to take us in exchange for a contribution for fuel and the strict promise of anonymity. The Peruvian fishermen call dolphins ‘sea-pigs’. It’s a term that does no justice to their elegant movement through the water but, from the fishermen’s point of view, is perhaps a not unreasonable description of an animal that supplies meat that seems tailor-made for shark fishing. Butchery: The fisherman uses a sharp knife to slice off the dolphins fins, which are then discarded . With its rich blood supply, sharks are instantly attracted to fresh dolphin meat and, best of all, unlike other shark bait it’s absolutely free. So on our third day out of port, my heart sank when I heard the skipper’s excited cry of ‘chenchos!’ - ‘fat pigs’ - and we saw half a dozen dolphins break away from feeding on the anchovy shoals that the nutrient-rich Peruvian waters support in such abundance and race towards the boat to ride our bow-wave. It should have been a moment to gladden the heart but ours were heavy. As the captain stood poised with his harpoon, Ale and I leapt into position to film. It wasn’t enough to see the dolphin killed with our own eyes, we had to have a permanent record that we could take back and show to the world. But there was more killing to come. By dawn the next day, we had arrived at the fishing ground, a thin sliver on the chart where the water temperature was just right for sharks. The decks had been hosed down and, in the corner, the dolphin carcass lay flensed - stripped of skin - a long section of flesh sliced out of it. Two crew members were now chopping it into long slivers, tossing each piece into the bait box alongside the expensive salted mackerel that had been bought for the same purpose. The captain was very honest about the benefits of dolphin bait. ‘Dolphin meat is effective for the blue shark,’ he says. ‘When you cut it, it bleeds a lot. And the blue shark likes fat, and the dolphin is pure fat. Carving: The deck is filled with dolphin blood as the fishermen set to work . ‘I understand that to hunt the dolphin is illegal. But for me, it’s a necessity, I do it to keep my bills down. I can minimise my costs, because the bait for shark is very expensive. The majority of boats that fish shark carry the spear-gun with the spear ready to use.’ He said he would normally kill two to three dolphins per trip and make 12 trips a year but, with 500 shark boats in Peru at the last count, that suggests expert estimates of 10,000 dolphins being killed by Peruvian fishermen every year could be an understatement. The meat of the sharks is sold to dealers waiting at the harbour and is destined for dinner plates across the world. The shark fins are sent to the Far East for soup. In the stern of our 40ft fishing boat, two crew-members crouched, carefully skewering dolphin flesh and mackerel on to hooks on the fishing line. A buoy was dropped in the water and, as the boat chugged slowly away from it, the line was fed out behind it. Two hours later and the hooks — a thousand of them — were spread out in the water. Now all the crew could do was wait and try to get some sleep, knowing they had a busy night ahead of them. As the sun set and the temperature dropped, they donned water-proofs and wellington boots and drank soup enriched with maca, an energy-giving Peruvian root. Harvest: The fishermen use dolphin meat as a cheap sort of shark bait . Then it was time to haul in the catch. Ale and I watched in the darkness, cameras ready, as the fishing line was carefully picked up and coiled by the crew. And then suddenly there was a shout. The engine slowed and a spotlight shone down into the dark waters below. A svelte, silvery-blue shape gradually appeared in the water. It was our first shark. Swimming in its normal underwater habitat, the blue shark is a beautiful sight, its tubular torso and wide eyes endowing it with a gentle elegance. But there was nothing elegant about this one. Hooked and already half-drowned — sharks have to keep swimming to stay alive — it appeared almost drunk, lazily kicking away at the line that now drew it to the boat. Within seconds, it was hauled over the gunwale and slammed on to the decks, thrashing around. And then the crew fell upon it. One sliced off its entire snout, just in front of its soft white eyes. Endgame: The fisherman haul up  shark, caught with the scraps of dolphin meat ruthlessly harvested earlier . Into the gaping hole, a long thin rod was rapidly inserted down the shark’s spinal column and, at last, the thrashing stopped. Its belly was cut open, the insides washed over the side and the shark carcass tossed to the leeward side of the deck. It would be the first of a dozen sharks the boat would catch, kill and butcher that night. An hour in, the engine slowed again amid excited shouts from the deck hands. All four men dropped their work to help haul in the line. Slowly, a vast black shape emerged from the depths. It was a fully-grown thresher shark, a species recently classified as vulnerable to extinction. Several hundred kilos in weight, its characteristically elongated tail fin alone was 6 ft long. For a moment or two longer, it was still a beautiful marine creature and then the knives flashed and it joined the growing pile of meat. But there was worse still to come. Another blue shark was dragged to the surface, still thrashing in the water. When its belly was opened up, dozens of perfectly formed baby sharks slid out, writhing on the deck. This was too much for Ale and me. Having sat back for days, not interfering and saying nothing, we had to do something. We waved at the crew, pleading with them to put the live baby sharks in the sea. They laughed — the idea was comical to them — but they did round up the baby sharks and toss them over the side. The beam of a torch revealed the tiny fishes’ first clumsy movements in the ocean. The odds on them surviving were slim but at least they now had a chance. It was 5am. Exhausted by the killing and no longer able to trust myself, I left a deck covered in blood, writhing sharks and savage hooks and descended to the cabin. In every sense, I’d had - and seen - enough.","Fishermen in Peru hunt and butcher dolphins, even though it's illegal .

"Trainer Colin Tizzard's assertion that Cue Card is in top form for his comeback in Tuesday's Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter gained substance when galloping companion Theatre Guide dead-heated in the Graduation Chase at Kempton. After Theatre Guide had rallied to share the spoils with Emma Lavelle's Fox Appeal, Tizzard revealed his gelding had been slammed 10 lengths by Cue Card in a racecourse gallop at Exeter. Cue Card was third in last season's Haldon Gold Cup but has a 9lb pull for the six lengths he was beaten by Mick Channon's re-opposing 2013 winner Somersby. Cue Card, on parade at Wincanton Racecourse, was last season's Betfair Chase winner . However, Cue Card, last season's Betfair Chase winner, has not run since finishing second to Silviniaco Conti in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day. Since then he has suffered a hairline fracture of the pelvis, which cost him his place in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and undergone an operation to aid a breathing issue which Tizzard felt cost him dear in the King George. In addition, with Tizzard's jockey son Joe is now retired, Cue Card will be ridden by Daryl Jacob, the first time another jockey has ridden him in a race. Colin Tizzard is backing Cue Card to do great things in Tuesday's Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter . Tizzard said: 'Theatre Guide has been working with Cue Card. Trying to keep up with him is probably why he is fit. 'It is the first time we have given Cue Card a racecourse gallop before the start of his season but everyone is doing it now. 'He goes there fitter than last year and is as good as we have ever had him. 'We will see if the breathing operation makes a difference.

"Leicester Tigers produced an astonishing second-half comeback to beat Sale 29-13 at home in the second round of the LV= Cup. Trailing 13-3 at half-time after being bullied for 40 minutes, the Tigers blitzed the Sharks after the interval with 26 unanswered points, including four tries, to earn themselves a bonus point. Leicester’s second win in as many games kept them top of Pool Three on a day when England prop Dan Cole made a successful comeback in the second half after surgery on a neck injury he suffered in last season’s RBS 6 Nations. Miles Benjamin of Leicester Tigers celebrates after scoring a try in the second-half . Winger Miles Benjamin scored twice for the Tigers, with the other tries coming from Harry Thacker and Matt Smith, while Michael Paterson replied for Sale. Freddie Burns also kicked nine points for Leicester, with Nick Macleod booting eight for Sale, while both teams saw players shown yellow cards in Smith and Mike Haley. Leicester have won all four of their Anglo-Welsh matches against Sale, who have now lost on their last eight visits to Welford Road. Sale won the first half 13-3 and would have been disappointed not to lead by a bigger margin considering the stranglehold they had on the game. Their more experienced pack dominated a Tigers eight which had an average age of just over 20, especially in the scrum where they rolled them backwards with ease. Despite their huge amount of possession and territory, the Sharks scored only one try, lock Paterson crossing from a catch and drive in the 26th minute. Benjamin passes the ball to Jake Farnworth as Tigers forced their way back into the game . Leicester: Tries: H. Thacker, Smith, Benjamin 2. Cons: Burns 3. Pens: Burns.

Sin Bin: Haley (62). Macleod, playing his first game at fly-half since the Amlin Cup quarter-final defeat by Northampton in April, kicked the conversion and also slotted two penalties from three. The first came in the fourth minute after the Tigers collapsed a scrum, and although Burns equalised two minutes later, Macleod added another in the 16th minute. He then scuffed a third attempt two minutes later, and while Leicester centre Smith was sent to the sin bin for foul play, Sale stretched their lead to 13-3 with the only try of the half. It came after Leicester had again been penalised at a scrum. Macleod kicked for touch and, from the line-out, Sale drove over the line with Paterson getting the touchdown. Centre Sam James also got over the line in the 39th minute but the try was chalked off because a player was ahead of the kicker during a counter attack down the right wing. The complexion of the game changed completely after the break, though, as Leicester rattled up 14 unanswered points in 13 minutes thanks to tries by hooker Thacker and Smith. Freddie Burns looks on during the dramatic LV= Cup victory at Welford Road . The first stemmed from a scrum which Leicester won, earning themselves a penalty. They kicked to touch and, following a line-out, Burns made a half break and found Thacker on his shoulder to finish it off. Burns kicked the conversion and after Leicester got themselves in another strong position on the Sale line, they introduced Cole for his first game since neck surgery and fellow prop Riccardo Brugnara. Thacker came close to scoring a second after a thrilling counter attack but Leicester kept the pressure on and Smith darted over from close range after winger Miles Benjamin had caught Sale napping with a quick tap penalty. Burns added the conversion to make it 17-13 before missing with a long-range penalty. With Sale full-back Haley in the sin-bin for tackling Tommy Bell in mid air, Leicester turned the screw with their third try straight from a line-out, Benjamin’s power and pace taking him past four defenders. Burns missed the conversion. Benjamin then added a second four minutes later after a simple pass from Smith put him away down the left, with Burns adding the extras to complete the comeback.","Trailing 13-3 at half-time, the Tigers fought back in the LV= Cup clash .

"Six penalties from Aled Thomas condemned London Welsh to their 10th consecutive defeat of the season in a dire LV= Cup game at the Kassam Stadium. The Welsh squandered a great chance to pull off their first win, as despite having the stronger pack, they lacked the control and firepower behind the scrum to secure victory, with three penalties from Will Robinson being the only response. With the 18-9 win, Gloucester maintained their interest in the competition with home games against Harlequins and Ospreys still to come. Tom Isaacs of Gloucester kicks upfield during the LV= Cup match at the Kassam Stadium . Last weekend, the Exiles lost 47-7 at Bath in the opening match in the competition and subsequently made nine changes to their line-up. Fly-half Will Robinson was given his first start of the season whilst Alan Awcock returned after injury at full-back. Six penalties from Aled Thomas condemned London Welsh to their 10th consecutive defeat . Gloucester were also defeated 28-27 by Exeter in their first match and they fielded a young side. Academy products, Luke Cole and James Gibbons made their club debuts in the front row with Tom Hicks and Callum Braley both introduced for the first time this season. Former Scarlet Thomas was selected as captain. Welsh began brightly with Peter Browne storming away on a 40-metre run to take his side into the opposition 22. Gloucester were penalised for Robinson to knock over the penalty. The home side had the better of the opening quarter as Gloucester incurred frequent penalties at the scrum. Robinson had a chance to increase their advantage but was off target with a long range penalty attempt so it remained 3-0 to the hosts at the end of a static first quarter. Referee Rhys Thomas finally lost his patience with the malfunctioning of the scrums and sent opposing props Shane Cahill (Welsh) and Shaun Knight (Gloucester) to the sin-bin. Gloucester finally reached the home 22 for the first time midway through the first half and when Welsh were penalised, Thomas brought the scores level. Minutes later, Thomas was again successful after Welsh lock Dean Schofield picked up a yellow card. The two props returned from the bin in time to see Robinson (two) and Thomas each kick further penalties for a 9-9 half-time score line. Peter Browne of London Welsh claims the line-out ball, but his side faltered in Oxford . After the restart Thomas kicked his fourth penalty before being switched to centre to accommodate Billy Burns coming on at fly-half. The penalty from Thomas was the only score of an error-ridden third quarter, with the referee's whistle preventing any flow to the game. Thomas had a chance to extend his side's lead but his kick from half-way fell just short before Welsh had a chance to draw level, but they declined a kickable penalty in favour of an attacking line-out. However, Welsh lost possession and Gloucester were able to relieve the pressure especially when Seb Stegmann was penalised for not releasing which allowed Thomas his fifth penalty. Welsh were awarded another penalty straight in front of the posts but again they elected for the line-out. They won this one and battered the Gloucester line, but lacked the finesse to make it count and Thomas made the game safe with his final penalty.","Aled Thomas hit six penalties in the LV= Cup in Oxford .

Even more crucially, McNamara himself is acutely familiar with the opposition courtesy of his role as assistant coach at Sydney Roosters, which makes a nonsense of criticism from the Australian media of supposed ignorance of potential new cap Ben Hunt on the part of Huddersfield second-rower Brett Ferres. Graham insists England have all the knowledge they need and that their NRL experience can help them reach their first final Down Under. 'It helps,' Graham said. 'I know what it's like to come up against a (Greg) Inglis or a (Shaun) Johnson. 'Steve McNamara has been in the Australian system for 12 months and that definitely helps when it comes to the preparation side of things. 'We can pass that experience on to the other players.' From his close-up experience, Graham is convinced England have what it takes to make a big impact in the tournament. 'They are great players, don't get me wrong, but they are human after all and they do make mistakes,' he added. New Zealand's 14-12 win over Samoa on Saturday morning means Australia will be unable to reach the November 15 final in Wellington if they lose to McNamara's men on Sunday.","James Graham believes English players will know how to beat Australia and New Zealand .

"Two disabled brothers have allegedly been refused membership to a bowling club because they made other players feel 'uncomfortable'. Mark Kemp, 38, and his brother Dewi, 33, who both have Down's syndrome, went to a taster bowling session at a village club in Elloughton, East Yorks, but allegedly were soon told they were not welcome to join after a number of members threatened to leave. The brothers had bought new bowling shoes and paid £5 to play at the Elloughton Short Mat Bowling Club, which had been arranged by their sister Emma Kemp. She had rang ahead to check the boys would be welcome. Scroll down for video . Mark Kemp, left, and Dewi, right, with their sister Emma who says brothers paid £5 to play at the bowling club . But Mark and Dewi's carer was allegedly pulled to one side at the club on Monday and told the brothers' presence made other members feel uncomfortable. Now Emma, 35, who lives with her brothers in North Cave, East Yorks, has been left furious at the decision. Ms Kemp told the Hull Daily Mail: 'I am disgusted. This kind of discrimination is totally unacceptable. 'I think these individuals need re-educating. 'My brothers shouldn't have just been told to leave, without the members first getting to know them as people. Mark Kemp, left, and Dewi, right, whose sister Emma says members should have got to know her brothers first . 'People cannot prejudice because of their disability. 'If the members didn't like them as people and chose not to play with them, that is different, but a decision like that can't just be made based on their disability.' The boys refer to doting sister Ms Kemp as mum after their mother died, and Ms Kemp tries to organise daily activities for her brothers to keep them stimulated and entertained. She said: 'I couldn't find a disabled bowls group so I called this club and asked if they could come, with their carer, and I was told it wouldn't be a problem. Mark Kemp, left, sits next to Emma's partner Naill Swales with Dewi, pictured far right, sitting next to his sister Emma who says that people shouldn't judge her brothers Mark and Dewi based on just their disability alone . 'They went and loved it and couldn't wait to go back, but the following week staff pulled their carer aside and said: ""Sorry, but some members say having them here makes them feel uncomfortable"".' 'They then offered to get a third mat out so the boys could play on their own, then said actually that wouldn't be possible because there wasn't enough space. 'The club is a social one, and not competitive or in a league, so their actual ability wasn't the issue.' Ms Kemp complained about the brothers' treatment to the organisers, and a meeting was held with members to discuss the issue. She said: 'I was fuming. Hearing they were having a meeting was like a red rag to a bull for me.' And Ms Kemp hasn't been able to tell her brothers the truth about why they can't play, for fear of upsetting them. She said: 'Obviously both boys are quite miffed about the situation but they don't understand the full extent of why they can't play. 'I had to be tactful. They knew there had been a problem and they couldn't bowl but I said there wasn't the room for them. Ms Kemp said: 'I just wanted to arrange something nice for them. If they are left to sit around they get bored and pick up bad habits like rocking. 'The idea is that they can fully function in society with support and should be encouraged to do so.' Ms Kemp first complained on Monday when the incident happened, but did not hear from the club until yesterday afternoon. The club has now told Ms Kemp her brothers would be welcome to join, but she declined the offer and said she will be looking elsewhere for a new club for her brothers. A spokesman from the Elloughton Short Mat Bowls Club, said: 'After taking advice from the East Riding Voluntary Action Services, I spoke to Miss Kemp on Wednesday afternoon, we came to an amicable agreement and I have no further comments to make.' Ms Kemp has now consulted Equality Advisory Support Service for advice.","Mark and Dewi Kemp were told that some members had threatened to leave .

"Emotions boiled over in a Texas NASCAR race on Sunday, as two rival drivers were involved in a brutal fight in the pit lane. As the race reached its conclusion, an irate Jeff Gordon stopped his car on the pit road next to rival Brad Keselowski and confronted him. The pair were earlier involved in an incident during the race, when Gordon spun out from the front after contact with Keselowski. VIDEO Scroll down for Fight after NASCAR race at Texas Motor Speedway . Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski fight in the pit lane at the end of the race . Keselowski holds his face after the fight, in which he received some blows from his opponent . Gordon waits to give an interview, with a cut lip evident on his face . There were punches thrown in the melee, with NASCAR officials in the middle of crew members and others around the No. 2 car. Jimmie Johnson won his third consecutive Texas fall race, while none of the eight Championship contenders were able to clinch one of the four final spots in NASCAR's Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. Gordon was leading on the first green-white-checkered attempt on lap 335, in a race scheduled for 334 laps, when he took the outside lane. When Gordon drifted up a bit, Keselowski pushed through the gap, and made contact that left Gordon's car with a cut tire. 'We were just racing for the win, I didn't wreck him, and just raced him hard. He left a hole. Everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you're supposed to go for it,' said Keselowski, who appeared to be spitting blood after the post-race brawl. 'I don't want to ruin anyone's day. I wanted to win the race and that was the opportunity. It just didn't come together.' Keselowski did not look happy after the post-race fight in Texas . The race itself was won by Jimmie Johnson of Lowe's Red Vest Chevrolet . Johnson celebrates with a burnout at the end of the race . Gordon said he was on older tires when 'out of nowhere I got slammed by the 2.' He then used an expletive in referring to Keselowski. 'The way he races, I don't know how he ever won a championship. This is why everyone is fighting with him,' Gordon said. 'There wasn't any conversation. You can't have a conversation with him. There's big consequences. To me, it's just a bunch of crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head.' It was the second time in the last four races that another driver confronted Keselowski after the checkered flag. Johnson, who beat Chase contender Kevin Harvick by a half-second, described Texas as intense and said he was sure it was 'highly entertaining.' He said he couldn't wait to go back and watch the tape. Johnson, the six-time Cup champion who was eliminated after the second round in the new Chase format, led 191 of the 341 laps. Keselowski finished third. The next-highest Chase contender was Carl Edwards in ninth and Denny Hamlin 10th. Gordon was 29th. Texas was the second consecutive race won by a driver already eliminated from title contention. That means at least three drivers will advance on points to get into the final four in the season finale at Homestead in two weeks. The third round of the Chase wraps up next week in Phoenix, where Harvick won eight months ago in the second race of the season. Kenseth and Hamlin were the only drivers of the Chase contenders to finish outside the top eight in that race.","Jimmie Johnson won his third consecutive Texas fall NASCAR race .

"Six-time World Championship finalist Jimmy White has told of his battle with crack cocaine addiction. The 'Whirlwind', 52, became a huge fans' favourite in the 1980s and 90s, reaching the Crucible final in 1984 and in every year from 1990 to 1994 but losing on each occasion - four of those to Stephen Hendry. White, though, was hiding a drug habit which cost him up to £10,000 a month after moving from cocaine to its stronger form. Jimmy White admitted taking crack cocaine during his illustrious playing career . White believes his £10,000-a-month addiction probably cost him 10 world titles . White (left) revealed he once smoked crack with Kirk Stevens (2nd left) in a hotel at the Irish Masters . White ranks fifth in the all-time rankings of British prize money earned by a snooker player. The 52-year-old has collected £4,673,066 during his career with Stephen Hendry leading the way on £8,722,739. During this time White won 10 professional ranking tournaments listed below: . The Classic (1986, 1991) Grand Prix (1986, 1992) British Open (1987, 1992) Canadian Open (1989) European Open (1992) UK Championship (1992) Players Championship (2004) White, who told The Sun 'I'm lucky to be alive' and admitted drugs 'probably cost me 10 world titles', told of smoking crack with his close friend and fellow player Kirk Stevens in a hotel room at the Irish Masters. He wrote in his new autobiography Second Wind, serialised in the same newspaper: 'Jimmy White... snooker hero... people's champion... crack addict. Sounds far-fetched, doesn't it? But for about three crazy months it was true. 'I think Kirk tried it first but I'm my own man and I don't blame anyone else for making me do something as stupid as smoking crack. The blame for that lies at my door only.' White admitted he had 'frittered away' most of the prize money from his illustrious career, during which he won 23 professional titles including the 1984 Masters, the 1992 UK Championship and two Grand Prix crowns. Recalling the financial cost of his habit, he wrote: 'I had one sneaky account with NatWest. I started dipping into this every now and then to fund my crack habit. 'I did the lot in less than three months. Every penny.' White rose to prominence when he became the 1980 World Amateur Snooker champion - aged 18. The London-born star's achievement made him the youngest-ever winner of the tournament before he turned professional later that year. White's brand of snooker made him a huge fans' favourite during the 1980s and 1990's . White is a six-time World Championship finalist - losing four times to Stephen Hendry between 1990-94 . White celebrates winning the 1991 World Snooker Masters title against Tony Drago . The left-hander's first taste of success on the professional circuit came in 1981 where he won both the Scottish Masters and Northern Ireland classic defeating Cliff Thorburn and Steve Davis in the respective finals. White has since gone on to win 17 other non-ranking tournaments with his last success coming in the 2010 World Seniors Championship. In ranked events, the 52-year-old has won 10 titles but never the World Championship. His last triumph at a ranked event came in the 2004 Players Championship against Paul Hunter - beating him 9-7. A popular player, White's highest ranking was No 2 in the world between 1987-88 - a lofty 53 positions better than his current state. The 'Whirlwind' ranks fifth in the all-time rankings of British prize money earned by a snooker player having collected £4,673,066 during his career. Hendry tops the charts with £8,722,739.

"Federal MP Clive Palmer has revealed his wife will run as a candidate in his party but insists she'll be judged on her own merits. Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election. But the Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said on Friday that she won't be favoured over other candidates and he won't have any say in his wife's political future. Scroll down for video . Anna Palmer is one of three candidates vying for preselection in the Gold Coast seat of Gaven at next year's Queensland election . 'There's an independent committee of three people, of which I'm not a member, who'll decide who the candidate will be,' Mr Palmer told AAP. 'We've got two other candidates who are pretty good - she may be selected or she may not be.' But Mr Palmer could not immediately say who the other contenders were. He said he wouldn't have discussions with the other two candidates, because 'it would be a conflict of interest, as you could appreciate'. Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer says his wife will run as candidate in his party . But he said his wife vying for preselection wasn't a conflict of interest. 'She's entitled to do what she wants to,' he said. He also hit back at Dr Douglas' cronyism claims, saying the Queensland MP's own wife, Susie Douglas, ran for the party as a federal candidate in the seat of McPherson last year. 'Everyone that's a member of my family, who works for our company or is a member of the party is entitled individually to stand for what they want to,' he said. Mr Palmer said his wife decided to nominate for preselection because she had an interest in politics and was keen to see the party regain Gaven at the 2015 poll. The Palmer United Party (PUP) leader said she won't be favoured over other candidates and he won't have any say in his wife's political future . He said he was yet to decide whether PUP would run a candidate in Yeerongpilly against now-independent Carl Judge, who also quit the PUP earlier this month, leaving the party without a presence in state parliament. Mr Palmer said the party would run candidates in most Queensland seats. He said he'd already endorsed Ted Shepherd in Mudgeeraba, Steve Anderson in Maryborough and Jeremy Davies in Kawana. Dr Douglas said on Thursday that he doubted PUP would run any candidates at all. 'I think the opportunity to do so has come and gone,' he said. It is currently held by former PUP state leader Alex Douglas, who quit in August to become an independent, alleging a culture of 'jobs for the boys' within the party.","Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer says his wife will run as candidate .

"A dating expert spent the day posing as a damsel in distress in a bid to find out if men are more likely to approach a woman because of the way she is dressed. Hayley Quinn donned three very different outfits to play the part of a lost tourist outside of a busy London tube station for the social experiment titled 'Does changing the clothes change the woman?' The London-based dating professional tested the relationship between what a woman wears, and whether that alters the likelihood of her being approached by a possible suitor. Scroll down for video . Hayley conducted the social experiment to show how men alter their reaction to women based on appearance . The 27-year-old changed from an everyday outfit of leggings, a low-cut t shirt and leather jacket, into a casual hoody and trainers combo, then a more sexy tight dress. The video shows that Hayley had the most success when she changed into a sexy, tight-fitting bodycon dress, knee length 'stripper heels' and a leather jacket. Hayley played the part of a lost tourist outside of a busy London tube station for the experiment . The least 'sexy' of the outfits was the casual hoody, t-shirt and trainers combination . Hayley noted the speed at which men approached her was much higher in her 'stripper heels' outfit . Hayley, who says she has helped more than 100,000 men find love, said: 'There were a lot of interesting differences between the three outfits. 'I didn't necessarily get approached by more men while I was wearing the sex kitten outfit with the stripper heels. I would say I was helped out just as much . 'But guys definitely checked me out more in that outfit, it was more blatant. 'And one thing that I did notice was that the speed at which I was approached was much higher - a guy nearly killed himself on a bike stopping to help me. The relationship expert points out that men actually approach women fairly infrequently over all . Hayley found that she overall was offered help a similar number of times no matter what she was wearing . The brave dating expert points out that men shouldn't think good looking women are approached 'all the time' 'That was the longest interaction I got during the whole day, and when I wore the hoody and trainers I had the shortest interaction. 'So the length of time guys spend interacting with a woman definitely seems to increase the hotter the girl looks. 'Overall though it seems like men just aren't approaching women. But this just shows that if men are thinking 'she must get approached all the time' - no she doesn't, so if you can be the guy that does that then hallelujah.'","Played  part of a lost tourist outside of a London tube station .

"Manchester United are in talks with former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Manager Louis van Gaal has offered the 32-year-old a chance to complete his rehabilitation from a knee injury and to work his way back to fitness with the club. Valdes, a free agent, will have his recovery supervised by the United medical staff before training with the first team, as he bids to regain full fitness. Victor Valdes is a free agent after he did not renew his contract with Barcelona at the end of last season . Former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes, pictured in 2011, is in talks with Manchester United over a move . Valdes played 535 games for Barcelona over 12 glorious years. Here he is pictured lifting the European Cup after Barcelona's 2009 triumph over Manchester United in the final in Rome . Barcelona (2002- 2014) Appearances:535 . Spain (2010-) Caps: 20 . The free agent had been expected to join fierce rivals Liverpool but Brendan Rodgers this week indicated that deal was off amid suggestions Valdes was not keen on a four day training stint prior to signing. Valdes has been out for six months with knee ligament damage, an injury that scuppered a proposed move to Monaco. However, he is now fit again and looking for a club to suit his ambitions. Valdes was at United's Carrington training HQ yesterday along with his representatives and is keen to discuss all possibilities. For their part United want to see how he has recovered from his injury before committing to a contract and will assess his recovery before offering anything. United are in talks over a new contract for David de Gea but they want improved competition for the 23-year-old Spain international and Valdes certainly fits the bill having won an array of honours during a glittering career. Meanwhile, Michael Carrick will continue his recovery from ankle ligament damage on Friday. The 33-year-old has been out since July but is due to play for United's U21s against West Ham United at Rush Green. The England midfielder was an unused substitute for Monday night's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion and was expected to be part of the squad to face Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. The time for recovery between games means he will likely take his place on the bench once again rather than figure from the start against Jose Mourinho's title chasers. Valdes beats Rooney to the ball during Barca's 3-1 triumph over  United in the 2011 Champions League final . Valdes has more appearances for Barcelona than any other goalkeeper . Valdes is pictured with his wife Yolanda Cardona, left, in 2013, and and earlier this year in Madrid . The Spanish goalkeeper lies on a stretcher after sustaining a serious knee injury in March of this year . United striker Robin van Persie is anticipating an edgy contest between the two rivals. The Dutchman, who has come under criticism for his lacklustre performances of late, said: 'Chelsea have a very good team and we have a good team. But it's always a bit more edgy and I like that. You can sense that as well with the fans because they are a bit more on top of it in games like this. So in every way it's a game to look forward to. 'There's always a bit of a different feeling but it's not that we're less concentrated for other games but there's a bit extra tension in a good way. You don't really know what's going to happen before the game because it can go both ways.'

The little boy, who weighs just 29lb, told his mom and grandmother that he was padlocked in a closet under the stairs at the Texas home. He was given just a piece of bread and a cup of water or milk each day and fed drugs when visitors came to the house to keep him quiet. WARNING: DISTURBING IMAGES BELOW . Biological mother Windy Hall (pictured today) has been reunited with her five-year-old son (left) who was allegedly starved, beaten and locked under the stairs by his father and stepmother . Windy Hall told KHOU today: 'It was the most amazing thing. It was . like giving birth again, it was amazing, he knew who I was.  I tried not . to cry, I have to be strong for him.' She said that her son, who remains in Texas Children's Hospital, has eaten spaghetti and a grilled cheese. However she said that he constantly looks around him when he's eating like someone is going to take the food away. Stepmother Tammie Bleimeyer claims that she knew nothing of the mistreatment of her five-year-old stepson . The little boy's grandmother Jacqueline Hall said he has told her that he was given drugs to keep him quiet and wasn't allowed to eat at the dinner table with his other siblings, who are the children of his stepmother Tammi Bleimeyer. Miss Hall believes that her son was kept in these conditions for about a year. She said that every time she leaves the room, her son looks up in alarm and she has to remind him that she's coming back. A custody hearing will be held on April 21. On Tuesday, the victim's pregnant stepmother claimed to be unaware of his horrific condition because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently. Mother-of-six Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, and her husband Bradley, 24, were charged with felony child endangerment this weekend after allegedly keeping the little boy locked under the stairs. Tammie claims that she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer. Her ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said, but took his five-year-old son to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed for divorce on Tuesday from her husband of two years. Tammie Bleimeyer told KHOU on Tuesday: 'I was shocked.

"Striker Andy Carroll intends to make up for lost time after finally ending his 'annoying' spell on the sidelines with a late cameo in West Ham's goalless draw against Aston Villa. The 25-year-old made his first appearance of the new season on Saturday when introduced as a substitute at the start of four minutes' stoppage time at the Boleyn Ground - and almost snatched victory with a close-range header which was somehow clawed away by inspired Villa keeper Brad Guzan. Carroll, signed by the Irons in a club-record £15million deal from Liverpool in June 2013, admits it was frustrating having to carefully manage his rehabilitation after ankle surgery, and now has regaining a regular starting place firmly in his sights. Andy Carroll's (above) return was the highlight for West Ham in their 0-0 draw at home to Aston Villa . Striker Carroll replaced midfielder Mark Noble at Upton Park in his comeback from torn ankle ligaments . 'It is a great feeling to be back out on the pitch. It took a long time, a lot of hard work and I have to give credit to all of the medical staff for getting me back fit,' he said. 'I had to make sure it was 100 percent before I started doing anything. I had a couple of weeks where I could not do anything, even go to the gym. 'With me being (an) active (person), that was more annoying than anything. '(After I came on) I had a couple of chances and was unlucky with the one when the keeper made a great save. 'Now I am back with my first bit of football, so going forwards I am going to be champing at the bit.' West Ham, who had beaten defending champions Manchester City in their last home game, dominated for long spells, but found a well-organised Villa side, looking to end a six-match losing streak, difficult to break down. Carroll was denied twice late in the game by Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan, as the match finished goalless . When the visitors were opened up, American goalkeeper Guzan was in good form, saving from both Stewart Downing and James Collins during the first half. The usually reliable Senegal striker Diafra Sakho, fit again after a shoulder problem, dropped a header wide before the Irons went more direct during the closing stages, with Carroll causing mayhem in the Villa penalty box, only to be denied by a brilliant reflex stop from Guzan. Even though Villa - without suspended Belgium forward Christian Benteke - were under pressure for long spells, they still provided a threat themselves on the counter. Carroll will look to forge a strike partnership with Diafra Sakho, who was named October's player of the month . Gabriel Agbonlahor and Andreas Weimann both had chances to break the deadlock. Villa boss Paul Lambert praised his side for the way they stood up to the physical challenge and hopes they can use the result as a platform for more positive results. 'We are not the biggest of teams, but they put their bodies on the line,' he said. 'We have had an horrendous run of fixtures, that has made it tough, hopefully now we can pick things up.'","The striker returned on Saturday and almost won the game for West Ham .

"Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has called for calm amid the crisis of form engulfing his struggling side. Dortmund go into Tuesday's Champions League clash at home to Galatasaray second bottom of the Bundesliga after five straight league defeats, the latest a 2-1 reverse at Bayern Munich. It is a remarkably poor run for a team who were Champions League finalists in 2013, made even more so by the fact Klopp's side are flying in Europe.

"Dylan Hartley says Northampton's England contingent will depart for international duty content that Saints are still chasing silverware on three fronts. A 34-6 demolition of previously unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders the Ospreys at Franklin's Gardens on Saturday has kept alive hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions Cup. On the domestic front, the defence of their Aviva Premiership title has begun by claiming first place after six rounds ahead of the break for LV= Cup action. Dylan Hartley believes Northampton's England internationals are departing with the side in a healthy position . Hartley (right) was in action for Northampton as they won 34-6 against London Osprey's on Saturday . Northampton supply seven of England's 33-man squad named for the QBE Series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia, and Hartley reckons they can reflect on a satisfying start to the season. 'We're sitting at the top of the Premiership - which is nice - and our European campaign is still alive. We're in a good place,' Hartley said. 'We've got two weeks of the LV now and we've got some boys champing at the bit, some young players ready for a game.' One of those certain to start against New Zealand at Twickenham in a fortnight is Tom Wood, the blindside flanker who demonstrated his commitment to Saints by opting to play against the Ospreys over attending the birth of his third child. Tom Wood (above) missed the birth of his third child to play for Northampton in the game against Ospreys . 'Tom Wood's nose looks pretty b*****ed after that match!' Hartley said. 'His wife was in hospital expecting a child while the game was on, but he insisted on playing. 'His nose was spread across his face and he then ran to the hospital! 'Other than that, all the boys are in good nick and we're excited - it's a big series coming up and a huge game against the All Blacks to start it with.' Wales wing George North plundered four tries, the last of which was a stunning solo effort, to fire Northampton to an important bonus-point victory a week after they had left Racing Metro empty-handed. Stuart Lancaster (above) selected seven players from Northampton for his England international squad . A draw and then bonus point slipped from their grasp in Paris and Hartley admits the last of North's four-try salvo was vital. 'I was a bit worried towards the end there because, after not picking up something last week, five points was crucial for us against the Ospreys,' Hartley said. 'We had so many chances and the game was fully in our hands for 80 minutes. I was worried, but we got there in the end. George North saved the day.'","Hartley pleased that Northampton are chasing silverware on three fronts .

"Space agencies are gearing up to send humans to Mars by 2030. But this isn't enough for SpaceX chief, Elon Musk. Instead of a small crew, he wants to send a million people to the red planet by the end of the century. The Tesla-founder believes that shuttling humans to Mars will be the only way to save humanity from extinction. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk wants to send a million people to the red planet by the end of the century. The Tesla-founder believes that shuttling humans to Mars will be the only way to save humanity from extinction . 'I think there is a strong humanitarian argument for making life multi-planetary,' Musk said in a recent interview with Ross Andersen at digital magazine Aeon. 'Excluding organic growth, if you could take 100 people at a time, you would need 10,000 trips to get to a million people,' Musk added. 'But you would also need a lot of cargo to support those people. In fact, your cargo to person ratio is going to be quite high.'  However, Musk believes the feat is feasible. 'It would probably be 10 cargo trips for every human trip, so more like 100,000 trips. And we're talking 100,000 trips of a giant spaceship.' Elon Musk (left) told Aeon that the absence of any noticeable life on other planets may suggest that the days of humans populating Earth are numbered. Mars (right),  he believes, could provide a solution to helping mankind survive in a hostile universe . A futuristic design of a protective dome on Mars. Last year at the AllThingsD conference, Musk said that he believes humans need to either colonise other planets or risk going extinct – a fate he describes as 'inevitable' if we stay on Earth . Last month, Nasa evealed that Boeing and SpaceX will build America's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The long awaited $6.8 billion (£4.2 billion) deal will replace the Space Shuttle and end reliance on Russia's Soyuz craft. The companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to Nasa. But last week it emerged that the pair of commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station will be delayed after a losing contender protested the Nasa awards. Sierra Nevada Corp, which lost out with its plans, said there were 'serious questions and inconsistencies in the source selection process'. Last year at the AllThingsD conference, Musk said that he believes humans need to either colonise other planets or risk going extinct – a fate he describes as 'inevitable' if we stay on Earth. His views were recently echoed by Brian Cox who claims 'humanity stupidity' will spell the end for mankind. Cox claims climate change, asteroids and crop disease are our biggest threats. Musk told Aeon that the absence of any noticeable life on other planets may suggest that the days of humans populating Earth are numbered. 'If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilisations, and I mean strange in a bad way,' he added. 'And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilisations.' Mars, he believes, could provide a solution to helping mankind survive in a hostile universe. The first group of settlers, he says, will need to pay their own way. He likens the trip to when people moved to the early American colonies. Earlier this year, Musk announced his SpaceX firm was making 'progress' towards establishing a smaller colony on the red planet by 2020. Elon Musk has previously said he created SpaceX for the sole reason of developing rocket technology to get people to Mars. He expects to sell tickets for $500,000 (£296,900) a trip. The first step for colonising Mars according to Musk would be getting man physically on the Red Planet, a feat he expects within the next 15 to 20 years with a SpaceX Dragon capsule .","Entrepreneur says it is 'inevitable' that humans will go extinct on Earth .

"Anderlecht boss Besnik Hasi has accused Arsenal of underestimating his side in the teams' previous meeting and says his players have nothing to fear in their return Champions League fixture on Tuesday. The Belgian side looked on course for a memorable victory over the Gunners two weeks ago as they led 1-0 with one minute of normal time remaining in Brussels, but goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski sealed a remarkable 2-1 win for Arsenal. The result means Anderlecht have only one point - five fewer than Arsenal - in Group D, but Hasi has challenged his team to deliver a repeat of their excellent performance at the Emirates Stadium.

Anderlecht have travelled to north London for their group stage Champions League encounter at Arsenal . 'I think Arsenal underestimated us in the first game, probably,' Hasi said. 'If you want to beat the top teams in the Champions League, you need to be at your top level and hope they are not at theirs. 'From our game two weeks ago, Arsenal get a mental boost after (what happened in the) the last three minutes. 'They have had a boost in confidence - you can see a few of their players are now playing much better. 'They want to win the game. If they win they can go through with nine points.'

Lukas Podolski is mobbed by team-mate Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winning goal in stoppage time for Arsenal in their Champions League clash at Anderlecht last time out . Arsenal can guarantee their spot in the knock-out stages if they beat Anderlecht and Borussia Dortmund also win at home to Galatasaray. The Gunners will be desperate to finish top of the group to avoid a difficult draw in the last 16, but manager Arsene Wenger said on Monday that Anderlecht can be an even more dangerous opponent on their travels than at home. 'I understand what Wenger is saying,' Hasi said. 'If you are a little team maybe you need to play counter-attacking football, but I don't think we have the qualities to play on the counter-attack. 'We have qualities to play football and I want my young team to really go for it against Arsenal - I want them to play their game and play without fear. 'If Arsenal are better than us, we will congratulate them, but in the first game I don't think we got what we deserved.'

Arsenal will progress to the last 16 if they beat Anderlecht and Borussia Dortmund defeat Galatasaray . The Gunners will be forced to field another makeshift defence with Laurent Koscielny (achilles) and Mathieu Debuchy (ankle) still out. That means Nacho Monreal is likely to take his place at the heart of Arsenal's back four again, but Hasi believes the Gunners have more than enough quality to cope. 'If you look at our competition compared with the Premier League, I think they have all internationals, players at a higher level,' the Anderlecht boss said. 'I know Monreal's normal position is left-back, but he did a very good job in central defence. He is fast, he is strong - maybe against teams in the Premier League they have problems, but I don't think so in this group against us and against Galatasaray. 'You could say it is a handicap for them, but they have a lot of quality all over the pitch.'

"Carlos the Jackal is to go on trial for a grenade attack in the heart of tourist Paris – 40 years after it happened. Anti-terrorist judges in the French capital today ruled that the Venezuelan killer, whose real name is Carlos Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, must face justice for the September 1974 atrocity. Two men died and 34 others, including four children, were seriously injured in the attack on the Publicis Drugstore in the upmarket St-Germain-des-pres area, on the city's Left Bank. Carlos the Jackal, real name Carlos Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, is to face trial for the 1974 grenade attack on a Paris drug store in the upmarket St-Germain-des-pres area . In 2011 Sanchez was found guilty over a series of bombings which killed 11 people and maimed dozens . Sanchez is currently serving two life sentences in a high security French jail for numerous crimes carried out in the 1970s and 80s. At his last trial, in 2011, he was found guilty over a series of bombings which killed 11 people and maimed dozens of others. Judges ruled Sanchez should serve a second life sentence 'with no possibility of parole for 18 years'. Now a legal source close to the case has confirmed that Sanchez would go on trial in the 'coming months' over the grenade attack. A file photo taken of Sanchez in the 1970s . Francoise Rudetzki, founder of a victims' rights group which campaigns for those whose lives have been devastated by terrorist acts, said the news of Sanchz's trial was 'met with great satisfaction' from those who had survived it. Sanchez has always been a suspect in the attack at the drug store on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, but has denied involvement. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility for the murders, which investigators believe Sanchez carried out as a ‘freelance’ terrorist. Sanchez had argued that all of the atrocities he committed were on behalf of 'decent' political causes, including 'Marxist revolution' and 'Palestinian liberation'. But, at his last trial, prosecutor Olivier Bray said Sanchez was in fact a profit-motivated criminal who always aimed to 'kill the maximum number of people with the minimum of risk'. Prosecutors said all of Sanchez's attacks were carried out as part of a campaign to force the authorities to release two of his accomplices, including Magdalena Kopp, whom he went on to marry. The court heard how a letter carrying Sanchez's fingerprints had been received by the then French government threatening 'war' if the pair were not released within 30 days. Sanchez became infamous in 1975 when his commando group took numerous hostages from a meeting of the OPEC oil organisation in Vienna.","Carlos Sanchez will face trial over the 1974 grenade attack on drug store .

I even wondered if we’d been handed the right baby.’ ‘I did note he was pale but thought that was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck when he was born. But a few hours later he was still really white with blue eyes,' said Mrs Howarth . Doctors confirmed that Jonah is not an albino, and his mother added: ‘Everyone on my side of the family going back generations have all been black. But doctors say that I must carry a recessive gene for white skin colouring.’ Top agent Charlotte Evans, who owns the Elisabeth Smith agency, said: ‘Jonah has a lovely shaped face and a beautiful complexion. He’s also very photogenic.’ Proud parents: Richard and Catherine Howarth with their three-month-old son Jonah .","Jonah is white - his mother Catherine Howarth is Nigerian black but has a recessive white gene .

"Carlo Ancelotti has warned Liverpool their problems run deeper than Mario Balotelli as he looks to guide Real Madrid to the Champions League knockout stage. Liverpool arrive here in the Spanish capital on Monday with the unenviable task of trying to halt Real's juggernaut. The reigning Champions League holders have won their last 11 games and extending that sequence to a 12th match would take them through to the last 16. By contrast, Brendan Rodgers’ side have floundered and suffered another confidence-draining defeat at the weekend, losing 1-0 to Newcastle. During their struggles, Balotelli has attracted much scrutiny and Ancelotti was asked for his view at Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex. Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti (centre) believes Liverpool's problems run deeper than Mario Balotelli's scoring drought . Ancelotti also cites the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona as another reason for Liverpool's struggles compared with last year . Balotelli has failed to break his Premier League scoring duck for Liverpool since his £16m summer switch from AC Milan . Madrid, with Toni Kroos (centre) and Co training on Monday, go into Tuesday's clash looking for a 12th straight win in all competitions . The Real Madrid boss believes Liverpool haven't found a system to adapt to Balotelli's skills too . Victory for defender Pepe (2nd right) and his team-mates would see them progress through to the last 16 of the Champions League . The Real squad were put through their paces by Ancelotti during Monday's session at the club's Valdebebas training complex . Ancelotti’s answer was significant. Balotelli might be the focus because he has failed to score a Barclays Premier League goal but Real Madrid’s head coach was quick to point out that is not the only conundrum Brendan Rodgers is trying to work out. He feels criticism of  24-year-old Balotelli is unfair. ‘Balotelli is spoken of a lot, maybe too much,’ said Ancelotti, who expects to unleash Gareth Bale against Liverpool now that the world’s most expensive player has recovered from a thigh injury. ‘He has quality and is at a side where they are not playing well. ‘They have lost Suarez who scored a lot and they need another solution. But I don’t think all of Livepool’s problems are about Balotelli. He needs to do his work for the side, that’s all that can be asked of him. The coach needs to find the right system with the new players.’ Of Bale, Ancelotti added: ‘Gareth Bale is ready to play and is back from injury and I don’t know if he will play from the off or on the bench.’ Real have been bolstered by the return of Gareth Bale (left) from a back injury ahead of Tuesday's match . Ancelotti (right) admitted he is unsure whether or not Bale (left) will start against Liverpool . There is a chance history could be made in Tuesday’s game as Cristiano Ronaldo needs only two goals to usurp another Real legend, Raul, as the all-time Champions League top scorer and, given his staggering form, few would bet against him. The way Ronaldo has been playing, it could be suggested he is worth a one-goal start to Madrid and Ancelotti admitted he is finding it difficult to talk about the Portugal international, as he has bestowed so many compliments upon him. ‘I have to speak about Cristiano a lot,’ said Ancelotti. ‘The last time I said it’s hard to find a new word to describe him. What can I say? He’s a fantastic player and professional and that’s it. He is working hard for himself and the side, just like other players such as (Karim) Benzema and James (Rodriguez). ‘He is a team player. He will pass to players in better positions if they have a better chance to score than him. We have been on a good run and that helps us. I don’t think he’s thinking about the record. He has time, it’s not his last game, he is focused on playing for the team. Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) is expected to start in attack for Real in Tuesday's Champions League clash .

The Portugal international (centre) has been in scintillating form for Real and has left Ancelotti running out of superlatives . Liverpool will face familiar foes in former Premier League stars Bale (left), Luka Modric and Ronaldo (right) on Tuesday . There was, however, an ominous message for Liverpool. ‘We have a serious side,’ said Ancelotti. ‘I don’t think that we will lose.’ Ancelotti, meanwhile, has brushed off talk about his own future. He has a year and a half left on his contract but, even though he has won three trophies since he arrived from Paris St Germain, insists there is no hurry to enter discussions. ‘There’s time to talk about this (new contract). I have 18 months left and there’s no rush,’ said Ancelotti. ‘We will be fine.’ Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas lies back on the ground during Monday's training session .

"Iker Casillas is planning to swap shirts with Mario Balotelli when Liverpool visit the Bernabeu for their Champions League clash, but he'll wait until full time to do so. The Italian forward was roundly criticised for swapping shirts with defender Pepe at half time when Real Madrid visited Anfield for their recent Group B match. Casillas told Sportsmail he was keen to swap shirts with the former Manchester City man at the end of the game, but revealed he didn't really see the problem with doing it half time.

"It seems impossible to talk about Liverpool at the moment without the conversation leaning towards Steven Gerrard. Mario Balotelli, for one, must be pleased. For the last week the talk has been about Gerrard’s long-term future at Anfield. Now it’s his immediate prospects — those of playing in the Bernabeu — that have become pertinent. The bigger picture at Liverpool, though, relates to something Gerrard said not about himself last week but about his team. Steven Gerrard's future has been the subject of much speculation with his contract up next summer . Gerrard has been linked with moves to America and to Manchester City but is expected to stay at Anfield . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers greets his out-of-form striker Mario Balotelli ahead of the Bernabeu clash . 54 Goals scored in all competitions this season. That’s far more than the rest of Europe’s heavyweights: Bayern Munich (39), Chelsea (38), Man City (30), PSG (30), Barcelona (29). Liverpool have scored only 19. 11 Number of different goalscorers in the squad this season. Cristiano Ronaldo leads the way with 22. 76.5% Madrid’s win percentage this season. They have won 13 of their 17 games. 3.2 Madrid average more than three goals a game this season. 11 Real’s 4-0 demolition of Granada at the weekend was their 11th consecutive win in all competitions. 18 The European champions are undefeated in 18 home Champions League ties, winning 16 and drawing two. They have scored 56 goals in those games. 1,287 Days since Madrid’s last Champions League loss at the Bernabeu — a 2-0 defeat by Barcelona in the semi-finals in April 2011. ‘I think by the end of the season there will have been a couple of exciting things [happening] for this team,’ Gerrard told Sportsmail. ‘You have to have that belief and I have. I know we have a winner in charge. He is a winner and he is evolving this team. The new signings will grow and get better.’ It is perhaps this improvement, rather than news of a new Gerrard contract, that followers of Liverpool are waiting for most keenly. Nobody really thinks Gerrard will be allowed to leave Anfield next summer. Whether manager Brendan Rodgers can restore Liverpool to somewhere near last season’s levels, meanwhile, would appear to be in greater doubt. They approach Tuesday's game against the European champions in peculiarly uncertain fettle. Having lost last season’s keystone, Luis Suarez, in the summer, too few of the players recruited in his wake are currently in Rodgers’s first team. Despite the rhetoric — the talk of a ‘positive’ opening — Liverpool were pretty much humbled by Real in losing 3-0 at Anfield two weeks ago. Since then there has been no improvement in the Barclays Premier League and no goals. A stalemate at home to Hull was notable for a rare clean sheet, But Saturday’s defeat at Newcastle came on the back of another dreadful goal and an absence of the high-tempo, pressing football that Rodgers insists must be part of his team’s DNA. Rodgers oversees Liverpool's final training session as they bid to stop Real Madrid completing the double . Raheem Sterling (centre) will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of completing a shock in Madrid . Jordan Henderson limbers up as he ponders the challenge that lies in wait for Liverpool on Tuesday . Something appears to be very wrong at Liverpool and an away fixture at perhaps the most powerfully destructive club side in the world right now would appear to be the last thing they need. ‘We see this is an opportunity rather than a threat,’ countered Rodgers on Monday. ‘It’s a wonderful arena, one of the most iconic football grounds in the world. It’s a challenge but opponents like this should help you return to your best. ‘We aren’t coming here expecting to lose and then see the other games as the chance to qualify. We are here for a result.’ As odd as it sounds, Liverpool could go home on the end of a hiding tonight and still qualify for the knockout stages. An injury-time winner for unfancied Ludogorets against Basle a fortnight ago could yet prove the most important goal of Liverpool’s season, affording them the chance to lose tonight but win their final two group games and go through as a distant second in a rather one-sided group. For Rodgers, though, the bigger picture remains complex. He spent heavily on players such as Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Rickie Lambert during the summer but has so far had almost no return on that. Despite the fuss over Balotelli and now Gerrard, that is the most relevant narrative of Liverpool’s season so far. If Liverpool are to come again this season — if they are to prove they weren’t simply Suarez and 10 others last term — that must change quickly. On Monday, Rodgers didn’t sound as though his team were about to climb that hill any time soon. ‘It will take time unfortunately,’ he said. ‘The [young] age and adaptation time is something we have to think about. We are not at the level we would like to be but we have to find a way to get our energy back into the game. ‘We have spent an awful lot of money on players to come in and give them an opportunity to perform. If at the end of this cycle of games they haven’t performed, they can never say they haven’t been given a chance. ‘Whether it is Real Madrid, Newcastle or Chelsea, I am putting my faith in these players to perform.’ Cristiano Ronaldo is in blistering form ahead of Liverpool's return visit to the Bernabeu . Gareth Bale (right) is expected to play some part in the match having missed the Anfield clash through injury . Ronaldo, Marcelo and Karm Benzema train ahead of Real Madrid's clash with Liverpool . Real Madrid’s form is ominous. Carlo Ancelotti’s team have won their last 11 games and scored 24 times in their last six. That’s 17 more than Liverpool over the same period. It appears a complete mismatch and Liverpool must show enormous improvement from the first leg if they are to compete. It is true that Rodgers’ team began well in the first fixture two weeks ago but they crumbled on the back of Cristiano Ronaldo’s opening goal in the 23rd minute. The reason for that the usually erudite Liverpool manager is yet to articulate.","Liverpool face an unenviable task against Real Madrid .

"Canada’s Milos Raonic celebrated his qualification for this month’s season-end finale in London by defeating Tomas Berdych on Saturday to make the final of Paris Masters. The 23-year-old from Toronto followed up his victory over Roger Federer on Friday by overcoming the Czech 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, thus registering back-to-back wins over a top-five player for the first time in his career. He will need to beat another top player, world No 1 Novak Djokovic, if he is to win the final Masters event of the year ahead of the Barclays World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena that begin a week on Sunday.

The world No 1 is tightening his grip on that position, faced with the challenge from Federer. Late on Friday Nishikori overcame Spain’s David Ferrer in the last quarter-final, and that finally ended all the mathematical calculations that had dominated the week in the French capital. Nishikori reaching the last four meant that he had qualified for the elite eight-man field in London along with Raonic, thus completing the line-up that will play for bumper prize money and points starting this time next week.

"World No 1 Novak Djokovic took a big step towards becoming the first player to retain the Paris Masters title when he saw off Japanese Kei Nishikori 6-2 6-3 on Saturday to set up a final with Milos Raonic. Earlier, seventh-seeded Canadian Raonic qualified for his second Masters Series final by downing Czech Tomas Berdych 6-3 3-6 7-5.

The Serb, who is on a 26-match winning streak indoors, was never threatened by Nishikori, who beat him at the U.S. Open, but he lacked energy after battling for almost three hours late on Friday to dispose of David Ferrer in three sets. Victory for Djokovic also meant he extended his lead over Roger Federer in the battle for the year-end number one spot. He raced into a 4-1 lead and never looked back, effortlessly sending his opponent to every corner of the court. Following an early exchange of breaks, Djokovic stole Nishikori's serve again in the sixth game of the second set and it proved enough.

The big-serving Raonic, runner-up at the Montreal Masters last year, followed up his quarter-final defeat of second seed Federer by beating Berdych, the 2005 Paris champion. After firing down 21 aces against the Swiss, the Canadian had to wait until the fifth game to serve his first on Saturday but by that time he had already broken Berdych for a 3-1 lead.

"Roger Federer is still going strong at 33 but after the pulverising he got from Milos Raonic on Friday he might be thinking fonder thoughts of the time when he can put his feet up. The big Canadian pounded down 22 aces that helped knock Federer out of the Paris Masters 7-6 7-5 and potentially put a severe dent in the great Swiss’ s designs on regaining the world number one spot at the end of the season. Federer was left hoping that Andy Murray would do him a favour by knocking Novak Djokovic out of the quarter final as the old rivals duelled to join Raonic in the semi-finals along with Tomas Berdych. Roger Federer was beaten 7-6 7-5 by Milos Raonic in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters . The big serving Canadian had to too much firepower on one of his best performances against a leading player . Federer shakes hands with his conqueror Raonic after crashing out of the tournament in straight sets . Raonic repeated the form that saw him reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon this year . 1 Novak Djokovic 9190 - qualified . 2 Roger Federer 8700 - qualified . 3 Rafael Nadal* 6835 - withdrew . 4 Stan Wawrinka 4895 - qualified . 5 Andy Murray 4475 - qualified . 6 Tomas Berdych 4465 - qualified . 7 Kei Nishikori 4445 . 8 Milos Raonic 4200 . 9 Marin Cilic 4150 - qualified (as US Open champion) The Czech had earlier guaranteed his place in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals and, if Federer had held true to the formbook and won his match, the whole field would have been automatically decided with Kei Nishikori and David Ferrer completing the eight-man field at the 02 Arena. The only person who could stop them was Raonic, who has slipped down the ‘Race For London’ due to a late season slump that suggested he would be doing nothing more than turning up as the on-site first reserve at the Finals. Yet he made a nonsense of recent results by hitting Federer off the court with an excellent performance which, while rooted in his God-given serving ability, was backed up by more solid groundstroking than usual. The Swiss legend was hoping to reclaim the world No 1 spot before his 14-game winning streak was ended . Federer's wife Mirka watches his game with her face partially covered in Paris . Federer can still mathematically finish No 1 after the ATP Tour Finals but Novak Djokovic is favourite . Federer can still attain the world number one slot regardless of any outcome in Paris, and has to hope that his legs can carry him through to the end of the season. He might have been a little sluggish as, like many others players, weariness is setting in at this stage of the year, but even had he been at his most sprightly he would have struggled against the bombs being delivered by the 6’ 5” slugger from Toronto. Raonic played an outstanding tiebreak and looked safe on serve until 4-5 in the second, when Federer created a set point which was saved by an ace. There are times these days when the Swiss gets over-exasperated when things are not going his way, and he looked mighty displeased by how helpless he was against against his opponent’s golden arm. In the next game the Canadian broke with a piercing backhand pass and then served it out to keep his ambitions of a first appearance at the 02 Arena alive. Federer has the consolation of a weekend off to gather himself for both London and the Davis Cup final against France in Lille that comes the weekend after that, but he wanted to keep the pressure up on Djokovic. Losing is not something he has been familiar with of late, going undefeated since the US Open with a run of fourteen consecutive victories that has carried him to the brink of yet another remarkable career achievement. Raonic will play Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals as he looks to end the year on a high . Federer has won a record 17 grand slam finals in his career - with the last coming at Wimbledon 2012 . Reigning world No 1 is favourite to retain his ranking and plays Andy Murray in the last eight . Berdych became the sixth man to qualify (or seventh if you include the absent Rafael Nadal) and it will be the fifth consecutive time he has finished the season in the world’s top eight. He did so by beating Kevin Anderson 6-7 6-4 6-4, this being the twelfth consecutive time he has beaten the towering South African, who concluded his most successful season on a note of gut-wrenching disappointment. Berdych, with his easy power of both flanks, will consider himself to be among those most unlucky to have been around in the era of the so-called Big Four to which Murray now seeks re-entry. Although his mental power has never matched the physical prowess of his game, had he been born ten years it is very possible that he would have won a Grand Slam by now, rather than just having reached a solitary Wimbledon final.","Milos Raonic defeated Roger Federer 7-6, 7-5 at the BNP Paribas Masters .

"This week marks the 20th anniversary of the iconic striker's debut. Read more here... The New York Cosmos have announced the signing of former Real Madrid striker Raul. The club, which plays in the North American Soccer League beneath Major League Soccer, said the 37-year-old Spaniard had signed a multi-year contract, starting from the 2015 season, and would also serve as a technical advisor for the club's new academy, which is due to open next year. 'Everyone throughout the soccer world knows the Cosmos name and the legacy of the players that played for this team previously,' Raul said on the club's website. 'They helped establish soccer in America and I'm honoured to follow in their footsteps. I believe in this club's vision and I'm excited to be a part of that.' Raul won six league titles, three European Cups and scored the most Champions League goals for Real Madrid . Born: June 27 1977 (age 37) 1994-2010: Real Madrid (741 apps, 323 gls) 2010-2012: Schalke 04 (66, 28) 2012-2014: Al Sadd (39, 11) 1996-2006: Spain (102, 44) The Cosmos made their name in the original version of the North American Soccer League when the likes of Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto signed up to play in the fledgling league. Pele now serves as the honorary president of the current Cosmos, a club reborn in 2010 with the intention of securing a place in Major League Soccer. However, in one of the most recent rounds of MLS expansion they were trumped by the newly formed New York City FC - a team backed by Manchester City and the New York Yankees that is due to begin play next year with another Spanish striker, David Villa, spearheading their attack. Raul, celebrating scoring at the 2006 World Cup, played 102 times for his country over a 10 year spell . Brazil legend Pele spent two seasons at the New York Cosmos before retiring from playing in 1977 . PELE 1975-77 (56 apps, 31 gls) Brazil legend Pele played out the twilight of his career at the Cosmos. Following 18 sublime years at Santos, Pele headed to New York for two seasons, winning the 1977 NASL title. His number 10 jersey has since been retired by the club. FRANZ BECKENBAUER 1977-80 and 1983 (132, 21) Beckenbauer headed to New York Cosmos after a glittering career at Bayern Munich and West Germany. Having accumulated four Bundesliga titles and three European Cups, alongside winning the 1974 World Cup, Beckenbauer enjoyed two successful spells in the NASL with the Cosmos before retiring in 1983. GIORGIO CHINAGLIA 1976-83 (213, 193) The Italian forward actually started his career in Swansea before making his name in Serie A. His goal scoring exploits guided Lazio to the Serie title in 1974 before Chinaglia headed to New York. The striker scored for fun with the Cosmos and fired them to four NASL titles, prompting his number nine shirt to be retired when he left the club in 1983. But that has not dented the ambitions of the Cosmos owners, as the addition of Raul is intended to demonstrate. 'We're obviously thrilled to add a player of his quality to the team,' head coach Giovanni Savarese said. 'Raul's skill and ability is world renowned.

Mahkovic’s Olimpija side were already coasting at 21 points up on their opponents and eventually ran out 87-58 winners.

"Sam Allardyce was told in no uncertain terms in the summer there needed to be a change to his style of play. After West Ham beat Manchester City 2-1 on Saturday, Sportsmail asked Hammers blogger Rugrid if Allardyce is getting the credit he deserves for turning things around. Sam Allardyce has made a bright start to the season at West Ham and has bedded in his summer signings . We are known famously as a very hard bunch to impress, us West Ham fans. Just ask Alan Pardew, or Harry Redknapp. They both helped lift the club to the promised land of Premier League football, yet they both will tell you that if the team starts underperforming, the fans will be straight on your back. Another man who will no doubt echo this view is Sam Allardyce. Big Sam has endured a turbulent relationship with the clubs fans since taking over as boss in 2011, and it wasn’t so long ago that the vast majority of supporters, including myself, were calling for the clubs owners to dispense with Allardyce. We had just witnessed a season in which, yes survival was reached, but achieved in a manner that simply wasn’t deemed acceptable in east London. The negative, fingers-crossed style football which we had come accustomed to under Allardyce had simply run its course – and it had to stop. Sir Alex Ferguson said the West Ham way was a myth but Allardyce is proving that it is very real . Sir Alex Ferguson is wrong, the West Ham way is not a ‘myth’ - It is very real, and we are witnessing first hand this season just how important it is to play the right way, the West Ham way. It is not based on results. Yes, of course we want to see our team win; it’s what they’re on that pitch to do. But it’s how the team go about their business that we West Ham fans are particularly fussy about. It’s about going onto that pitch and putting your body on the line, giving everything for the team, and most importantly attacking the opposition with desire and imagination. Allardyce was told in no uncertain terms over the summer that he had to deliver the West Ham way brand style of football this season – especially when playing at home. Many, like myself, did not believe Big Sam could deliver on this, but I am willing to accept that our manager, so far this season, has proved me wrong. Diafra Sakho is just one of a whole host of signings that has given the supporters plenty to smile about . The signings made by the club this summer have simply transformed the team into one that looks more than capable of holding their own in the Premier League. Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Cheikhou Kouyate, Diego Poyet, Aaron Cresswell, Mauro Zarate and Morgan Amalfitano all signed permanent contracts with the club, while Alex Song and Carl Jenkinson arrived on season-long loan deals. Then behind the scenes, Teddy Sheringham joined Allardyces backroom team as the new attacking coach. These are changes that were made by the owners, and our manager, to make sure that they delivered on what the fans demanded – and I believe now Allardyce deserves credit where it’s due. Enner Valencia scored a fine goal against Hull in the Premier League and has been in impressive form . To be fair to Big Sam he always delivers on what is asked of him – promotion at the first attempt, retaining our Premier League status – and so far is delivering on playing the brand of football that has been asked. The time has come for us fans gave Allardyce our full support – as rare as that is in football these days. There is a real buzz around Upton Park at present, and the last thing we need is our manager turned on by the supporters the moment a match is lost. If Big Sam continues to deliver the way he has so far this season, then who’s to say where it will end? Follow Rugrid on Twitter @mcrugrid .","Sam Allardyce made several summer signings at West Ham .

"Pictured below is the 'bear selfie' craze - a trend so reckless officials have issued a safety warning pleading for it to stop. Increasingly high numbers of visitors to South Lake Tahoe, California, are putting themselves at risk of an attack or mauling in order to get a share-able snap of themselves with a bear in the background.

The U.S. Forest Service at Taylor Creek Visitor Center in South Lake Tahoe say visitors are risking their lives in the hunt for a unique profile picture by approaching the bears. ‘We've had mobs of people that are actually rushing toward the bears trying to get a “selfie” photo,’ Lisa Herron, spokesperson for the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit told Reno Gazette-Journal. ‘We are telling people they need to stay on the trails and they need to stay away from the bears. ‘If a bear has a mind to it can run very fast.’ Although bear attacks are rare, the risk of one taking place unsurprisingly increases if the animals are provoked by the presence of humans. In particular, female bears with cubs will charge if they perceive a threat on their cubs. This woman looks happy to be in a photo with a bear despite its close proximity .

"Louis van Gaal be warned: the Manchester derby is madder than ever. The Dutch boss will enjoy (or perhaps he won't) his first clash with United's city rivals on Sunday. Manuel Pellegrini's out-of-form champions are the hosts, but Van Gaal's boys have hardly been at their best of late either. Manchester City host Manchester United on Sunday - the Citizens won both League matches last season . Nerves will be frayed and tensions high and it certainly promises to be another cracker. And that, you have to say, would be in keeping with the nutty narrative of this fixture in recent seasons. Here, Sportsmail explains why the Madchester derby has become the best of them all… . Robin van Persie celebrates his stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday . Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko look deflated during City's 2-0 defeat by Newcastle on Sunday . Late shows… . If this fixture has proved anything in recent years it is that supporters shouldn't leave their seat until they are sure the contest is over. The 'Michael Owen derby' is a prime example. The former England striker didn't have too many highlights in a United shirt but his last-gasp winner in 2009 was undoubtedly the pick. Craig Bellamy had only just made it 3-3 to seemingly ensure a share of the spoils for City but there was yet another twist in the tale, Owen climaxing a pulsating affair with a predatory prod deep in to injury-time. The Manchester derby has featured many memorable moments, including Michael Owen's late winner in 2009 . Owen's 96th-minute  goal capped off a truly unforgettable afternoon as United claimed a 4-3 victory . Heels overhead… . If Owen's goal was dramatic in its timing, then Wayne Rooney's two years later was even more so in its stunning, jaw-dropping execution. It was during the February 2011 derby at Old Trafford that, with the score at 1-1 and 12 minutes remaining, the United forward vacated the turf to connect with Nani's centre and send the most audacious overhead kick beyond Joe Hart to win it for the hosts. Even Sir Alex Ferguson was stunned and Rooney's goal was deservedly later crowned the best of that season. Wayne Rooney scores one of the Premier League's greatest goals with an overhead kick in February 2011 . Rooney holds his arms out  to celebrate the goal and he later admitted 'it doesn't get any better than this' Why Always Him? Mario Balotelli had been criticised for setting off a firework in his bathroom in the week leading up to the derby in October 2011. But that was nothing compared with the explosion of blue which awaited United at Old Trafford. Typically, it was Balotelli who opened the scoring - revealing the now infamous T-shirt 'Why Always Me?' - and City went on to humiliate their rivals, inflicting a 6-1 drubbing with Balotelli adding the second. The noisy neighbours were certainly making a racket that day. Former City striker Mario Balotelli reveals his infamous 'Why Always Me?' shirt after scoring in the 2011 win .

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila believes John Collins would make a brilliant successor to departing SFA performance director Mark Wotte. But the Norwegian insists that he would hate to lose the right-hand man who has become so crucial to his plans. Deila, reacting to suggestions that former SFA youth coach Collins may be on the list of potential candidates for the post about to be vacated by Wotte, said: ‘I can say that John Collins knows what he’s doing. Ronny Deila (left) hopes John Collins (right) remains as his right-hand man at Celtic . Celtic boss Deila (pictured) praised his assistant Collins saying 'he is too important for me and the club' ‘He’s a fantastic person with a lot of experience and knowledge about what is needed to become a good player. ‘But I want to have him here, so I really don’t hope that is happening. He is too important for me and the club. ‘But I understand that people want him,’ added the Norwegian, whose team host Partick Thistle in the League Cup quarter-finals tomorrow night. ‘He has helped me a lot. The most important thing is we have the same kind of view of football, we want to create and to play. Collins has been linked with a role at SFA as performance director to replace the departing Mark Wotte . ‘We know it takes time but we’re working together every day to do it. We just talked for two hours before we understood that this was going to work for us. We knew at once that we were going to have a good relationship. ‘That feeling has been proven right. Every day we have good discussions. I think we suit each other very well.’","SFA performance director Mark Wotte has stepped down from his role .

"With Scottish football being the sort of buttoned-down world in which any honestly-expressed opinion has the potential to cause offence, an outcry or vows of vengeance, some might have expected Ronny Deila to shy away from John Guidetti’s stated ambition of winning four trophies with Celtic this season. Not a chance. The reason Deila is so keen to make on-loan Manchester City striker Guidetti a permanent part of his plans go beyond the forward’s eye for goal – and include the cocksure confidence that makes him so positive about Celtic’s Europa League chances as well as a domestic Treble. Thanks to the way the young Swede has ‘clicked’ at Parkhead, Deila thinks it puts the Scottish champions in a great position to land him once his City contract expires at the end of the season. And he clearly has enormous affection for a player whose self-belief is so marked that even Pierre van Hooijdonk has nodded his approval. John Guidetti celebrates after scoring Celtic's first goal in the League Cup against Hearts in September . Guidetti has impressed for the Bhoys this season, pictured scoring a free-kick against Kilmarnock . Asked about 22-year-old Guidetti’s targeting of three domestic trophies plus that UEFA prize, the Norwegian said: ‘I believe everything is possible. And you have to believe. ‘That is why I love Guidetti, because he believes. You can see it in his eyes when he goes on the pitch: “I’m here to score, I’m here to win.” And you can see it in the dressing room. ‘That’s why I want to keep him as a player, get his contract permanently here, because he has the values I love. He’s humble, he wants to learn, he wants to improve – and he is a winner. You can see that on the pitch. ‘I want all of our players to believe that we can win the Europa League, of course. If you don’t believe, you don’t get it – you really have to believe it, really have to fight for it. ‘I think people are different. You need different types. You can’t have 25 John Guidettis – that would be tough for a manager! ‘But it’s about the confidence you show on the pitch, the security you give to the team-mates you have. We have to create that together. This group has to commit and have a really, really strong togetherness. ‘I think that has grown over the last three or four weeks. I’ve seen them fighting for each other, developing a team where there are no stars, just hard-working players. Guidetti celebrates at Victoria Park against Ross County - he is said to be loving his time at Celtic . Ronny Deila has already begun his attempts to keep Guidetti at Celtic permanently . ‘When you see the best teams in the world, they have no time for people being lazy or not doing the work. It starts with hard work, then we need skills – and Guidetti has both.’ The concern for Celtic is that Guidetti impresses at home and in the latter stages of the Europa League - assuming progress from the group stages is secured - and then jumps at another offer likely to come the way of any hot striker. However, Deila believes that doing well in Glasgow will only enhance the player’s desire to stay in Scotland, saying: ‘I think John was at Stoke last year, he was at City and he hasn’t played first-team football for two years. ‘It’s like it has clicked between Celtic and John. One thing I know in football is that, when you are at the right club, you have to appreciate what you have. ‘You have to understand that your success is not all down to you, it’s also the environment, the club that suits you and makes the best out of you. ‘So far, we have done that with John, together with him. I think he can develop a lot, he can reach a lot of his goals here. ‘I think it’s vital for John to play. That’s important. Here, he gets the trust he needs – and he produces. He is enjoying every day. Guidetti exchanges words with Manuel Pascali of Kilmarnock on October 26 . Guidetti smiles after netting against St Mirren in September . ‘If we keep getting good results, more people will come to the stadium, he’ll play in bigger games. John Guidetti will be even better. ‘We will do everything we can in our club to make him happy, so he wants to stay. His contract is running out, so there is no issue there.’ Guidetti’s arrival on deadline day was accompanied by plenty of pre-publicity about the young superstar who scored 20 goals in 23 appearances for Feyenoord before a mystery illness left him temporarily paralysed. This was a boy who, backed by an unshakeable belief in his ability and tipped to be the next Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his homeland, has never believed in false modesty. Former Feyenoord and Celtic great van Hooikdonk recalls hearing all about the kid who turned up in Holland with no reputation – but plenty of swagger – back in 2011. ‘Guidetti was an unknown Swedish guy when he arrived at Feyenoord,’ said van Hooijdonk. ‘I’m told, from the first moment when he arrived, everyone was surprised by his behaviour. He entered the dressing-room and … let’s just say he wasn’t shy. He had a confidence and an edge to him. Guidetti, pictured alongside Adam Matthews (left) in training, has scored five goals in seven games this season . Deila described Guidetti as 'a goalscorer', something that is hard to come by . ‘But that was good, exactly what was needed at that time because it was a tough, tough period for Feyenoord. Guidetti then scored important goals and became a hero. He was part of a revival for Feyenoord and they finished second in the league. ‘Now he is at Celtic and I also think he arrived at the right time there. It’s not always been brilliant performances from the team so far, but Guidetti has given a little bit of a spark. His attitude has been positive and he has scored important goals. ‘His behaviour at Celtic has also been a positive, in the same way I spoke about it at Feyenoord. ‘He has the self-belief to cope with the pressure of being a striker for Celtic. I know it can be difficult. But when you start to score goals and the Celtic fans see you are giving your all for the club, then they will take you into their hearts. The Feyenoord supporters and Celtic supporters are very similar in that way. ‘Over the years, many, many top strikers have played for Celtic. Guidetti is heading in the right direction.’ Celtic’s pursuit of four trophies sees them face Partick Thistle at home on League Cup duty tomorrow night, with Deila insisting no-one in the home dressing room will take the match lightly. The manager, who insists he never even looks at the medals he won in his playing and coaching career, said: ‘I would rather think of what I created with others. That’s what drives me, to create and to have moments and experiences together. ‘When you do that well, you get trophies. It’s the same here, we need to create something good. If we do that, over time we will also have trophies. We really want it, I really want it. ‘We want to win everything and the League Cup is the first trophy available. That starts on Wednesday against Partick Thistle.’","John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic from Manchester City .

"Walter Smith will end his self-imposed Ibrox exile on Tuesday night - after admitting that he elected to stay away from Rangers games while the battle raged for control of the troubled club. Smith, who steered the Glasgow giants to nine league titles in a row, revealed that he got fed up of being accused of ‘taking sides’ in the Mike Ashley versus Dave King fight for the future of the financially-stricken outfit. But days after Sports Direct tycoon Ashley prevailed in his bid to take control, Smith will be back cheering on Ally McCoist and his team against St Johnstone on Tuesday evening as they bid to reach the semi finals of the League Cup. Walter Smith won nine league titles in a row when he was in charge at Ibrox . Smith celebrates a Rangers goal during his time in charge of the Glasgow outfit . Smith handed the managerial reins to McCoist in 2011, but returned to the club as chairman in May 2013 only to quit less than three months later following a period of bitter in-fighting. Explaining his non-attendance at matches since quitting as manager and then as chairman, the former Scotland boss said: ‘At first I didn’t go because I didn’t want people thinking I was - not interfering, exactly - but going to watch Alastair (McCoist) and the other boys I’d left there. That was initially my main reason for not going back. ‘But when (former chief executive) Charles Green asked me to go on the board I went back and going to games was another aspect of (the role). ‘But since I left the board, the reason I don’t go back is because is everybody keeps saying to me: ”You are supporting that side; or you are supporting the other side.” I thought: “I’m better off not bothering going.” Ally McCoist (near) was Smith's assistant when he was in charge of Rangers . Smith celebrates Rangers' victory over Celtic in the CIS Cup final in 2011 . ‘So I haven’t been to an awful lot of matches since I left. I watch the TV coverage and I read a lot about the club but I don’t go along to many games. But I do miss going to the games. I’ll go on Tuesday night to see how they do against St Johnstone.’ Smith was speaking as one of his Ibrox idols, Davie Wilson was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame alongside Leeds United legend Peter Lorimer, and former Celtic and Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas. Capped 22 times for Scotland, Wilson - now aged 75 - played 227 games for Rangers as a winger. He scored 98 goals for the Ibrox club before moving to Dundee United and Dumbarton – on each occasion teaming up with Smith who had previously cheered him from the Ibrox terraces as a boy. ‘I went to Ibrox and watched Wee Davie play in the late 1950s and early 1960s Rangers team,’ said Smith. Former Rangers director Dave King in the stands during the club's match against East Fife . Mike Ashley has given Rangers a £2 million bailout, and wants full control of the club . ‘He also worked beside my old man when he was a boy, strangely enough. ‘At that time, Rangers had a fantastic team and it was an enjoyable period to go and watch them. ‘Davie was one of the main players and the number of goals he scored for a winger was fantastic. ‘Nowadays we don’t have wingers of that type. ‘Scotland were lucky back then because we had Peter Lorimer and Bobby Lennox who were similar types. ‘They were direct and they threatened the goal as much as they created opportunities for other players. ‘So Davie was a guy I really enjoyed watching as a boy. ‘He also came to play at Dundee United along with Jimmy Millar when I was a player at Tannadice and they were both fantastic professionals. ‘They could have tailed off at the end of their careers but they had a great attitude and it was great for a young player like myself to see that. ‘It was a big thrill for me. I’d never have imagined I would have played alongside Davie Wilson. He was terrific, so down to earth. ‘Then, later, Davie was assistant manager at Dumbarton when I went there for a year. We had a good young team at that time but unfortunately they all got sold. That stuff happened even back then. ‘Then Davie became a manager and he transferred me back to Dundee United! ‘But it’s great to see him inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. His family was there with him and it was great to see them share in the honour with him.’","Walter Smith has been Rangers manager on two separate occasions .

"European football has been as much a curse as a blessing for Celtic this season yet perhaps this deserved if somewhat fortuitous victory will finally nail the theory that Ronny Deila’s side are incapable of fighting a battle on two fronts. It was by no means the perfect display from the Champions — truthfully we’ve yet to witness that under the Norwegian — yet for the first time in five attempts they at least succeeded in winning a league game immediately following a European match. It would, however, be impossible not to dwell on how different the outcome might have been had Allan Johnston’s side maintained a full quota of players for more than 34 minutes. John Guidetti (above) opens the scoring from a free-kick for Celtic in the first half, his fifth goal in seven . Kilmarnock captain Manuel Pascali conceded the free-kick, and was sent off for the foul as he was last man . Stefan Scepovic (left) scored Celtic's second as they overtook Kilmarnock and move to fourth . Celtic: Gordon, Mathews, Denayer, Van Dijk, Izaguirre, McGregor, Brown, Johansen (Mulgrew 67), Wakaso (Tonev 79), Guidetti, Scepovic (Griffiths 67) Subs (not used): Ambrose Emuobo, Lustig, Zaluska, Kayal . Goals: Guidetti 35, Scepvic 64 . Bookings: Johansen . Kilmarnock: Brennan, Barbour, Connolly, Pascali, Chantli, McKenzie, Clingan, Hamill, Odabeyi, Eremenko (Ashcroft 35), Magennis (Ngoo 70) Subs (not used): Johnston, Slater, Westlake, McKay, Muirhead . Goals: None . Attendance: 42,800 . Manuel Pascali’s ordering off for pulling down the again impressive John Guidetti looked fully deserved, but it effectively ended the highly impressive challenge from the Ayrshiremen in the opening half-hour. To compound the dismissal, not only was the majestic Alexei Eremenko immediately withdrawn but Guidetti scored the consequent free-kick with aplomb. Deila’s men rarely looked back from that point. Celtic’s victory not only capped arguably the best week of Deila’s tenure but may also prove to be the day in which his seemingly slavish devotion to a 4-2-3-1 system ended. With Anthony Stokes and Kris Commons injured, Deila played both Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic in a more orthodox 4-4-2. Not only did both strikers score, those around them looked far more at ease with the shape. In taking his goal tally to five in seven matches, Guidetti is fast becoming the kind of hero Celtic fans have craved for so long. Not that the on-loan Manchester City man was of a mood to pat himself on the back too much. Victory for Ronny Deila (above) and Celtic means they have overtaken Kilmarnock and moved into fourth . Guidetti (above) celebrates with Celtic fans after putting his side into the lead in the first half . ‘I’m happy with the team performance but I feel I should have scored at least one more because I hit the post and the keeper made two good saves,’ said the Swede. ‘You can say I was unlucky but I wanted one more. ‘I want to score as many goals as I can. I have five in seven and three assists, so I’m happy with that. ‘Once they had the player sent off, we knew we would have a lot of the ball. ‘I was looking at the goal difference and, if we win our game in hand, we will be top of the league, which I think these fans deserve.’ Undefeated in five league matches, Kilmarnock arrived in the East End with the possibility of going joint-top of the table and there was a boldness to them from the outset. Eremenko’s beautifully floated ball over the top seemed to hold up perfectly for Tope Obadeyi but he did not appear to have the legs or the stomach for a one-on-one with Craig Gordon. As Celtic struggled to settle, Killie pressed them high up the park, forcing three corners before the hosts had one. Stefan Scepovic celebrates scoring Celtic's second in the second half, securing the three points . When Stefan Johansen was finally tasked with such a delivery, his execution was accurate. Scepovic out-jumped Pascali at the near post but flashed his header into the side-netting. It served to awake Celtic from their slumbers. Playing on the right of a more orthodox middle four, Callum McGregor accelerated to the byeline and hung up a cross for Wakaso Mubarak. Conor Brennan in the Killie goal was not troubled by the header. Eremenko was intent in displaying his full skill set. A rasping 30-yard strike had Gordon at full stretch but Pascali’s folly would render that the Finn’s last meaningful involvement. The Kilmarnock skipper had looked in a foul mood from the outset, nipping away at Guidetti in particular both on and off the ball. Perhaps as a consequence, his concentration levels were not what they should have been when McGregor attempted to laser a pass to Guidetti. Caught the wrong side of his man, Pascali dragged him to the ground on the edge of the box and was already walking by the time Willie Collum dipped into his top pocket. Pascali removes his captain's armband after being shown a first-half re for his last man foul on Scepovic . Kilmarnock manager Allan Johnston (above) will be frustrated that his side were in the game until the red card . Eremenko was immediately replaced with Lee Ashcroft but the punishment for the visitors would be two-fold. Guidetti liked what he saw from the set-piece and went for power as well as placement to rocket the ball around the wall and away from Brennan. What a catastrophic 60 seconds for Johnston’s men. With that, Celtic were truly up and running. Guidetti’s sublime turn on the edge of the box saw him bullet a shot down Brennan’s throat but the keeper parried at the cost of a corner. Before the break, McGregor narrowly missed the target with a flashing strike on the turn then Wakaso drilled the ball a foot wide of the same post from 25 yards. For the visitors, a second half of playing percentages lay in store. A combination of good fortune and Celtic’s profligacy kept Killie in the hunt. Guidetti thumped the upright, then was left cursing Brennan as he dived to thwart him 30 seconds later. McGregor failed to punish a handling error by the keeper by only finding the side-netting then Scepovic miscued his shot after being teed up by Wakaso. Redemption for the Serb was not long in coming, though. Emilio Izaguirre’s dead-weight ball down the left found Wakaso, whose cross at pace could not have been better with Scepovic applying a sumptuous finish to take the game out of Kilmarnock’s grasp.","Sweden striker John Guidetti scored his fifth goal in seven games .

"Ronny Deila has insisted he's got no issue with the critics who've turned their guns on him after four months in the Celtic job. Despite going joint top of their Europa League group with a 2-1 win over FC Astra on Thursday, Celtic's error-strewn display put the Norwegian firmly in the firing line. Former Parkhead player turned TV pundit Chris Sutton led the volley of criticism by describing the performance against the Romanians as 'pathetic'. Ronny Deila makes his point during Celtic's narrow 2-1 Europa League win against FC Astra on Thursday . The Norwegian manager says getting criticism is a part and parcel of such a high-profile job . Such stinging words came on the back of a string of indifferent displays across all competitions with Deila's side currently sitting sixth in the table having only won three successive games once this season. The 39-year-old says he has no beef with anyone taking a verbal swipe at him, however, and insists his only concern is finding a permanent solution to his side's erratic form. 'I haven't seen so much from the critics as I try to avoid anything like that,' he said. 'But I know that at every big club you get this. I'm used to it from Norway as well. 'I can handle the critics no problem - but if I don't see the answer, then my brain is starting to work overtime. 'I've been a big-mouth myself before. Back home, I was talking in big words about how Norwegian football should be. 'I upset a few other managers in Norway with things I said. I had a lot of arguments. But I was young. I understand the rules now - talk about yourself and your club, that's the most important thing. Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton called the Parkhead side's performance against Astra 'pathetic' 'The worst feeling I can have is that I can't solve the problem, if I feel I can't see the next step. I'm using the hours to reflect on things we are doing now.' Despite being roundly criticised for the display in Thursday's 2-1 win, Deila's has presided over five wins from the past six matches. But he readily accepts that the inconsistency his side have shown both game-to-game and within matches is something that has to be eradicated. 'It's hard at the start,' he added. 'There are tough times and good times - we are going up and down all the time right now. But that's part of the job. 'You can take one game here and there and get positives. People were positive after Ross County then negative maybe after Thursday because it didn't happen quickly enough. Stefan Scepovic slides on his knees after scoring for Celtic on Thursday night against Astra . 'On Thursday night it looked like they were a little bit afraid to lose. But when we went 1-0 up, suddenly everything was going smooth and quick. We need to get that freedom into our play. You saw that against Ross County after the first goal as well. We have to focus on that on Sunday against Kilmarnock.' While acknowledging the need to produce more quality performances in the short-term, Deila has asked to be judged by the success or otherwise he brings over the course of the campaign. 'Again I have to say I think I have been very clear in my goals this season – that we want to go through in the Europa League and we want to win the Treble' he stated. 'Winning the league is the main thing. If I don't do that, or we don't do that, I will understand that I have the problem.' The 39-year-old manager's focus now turns to the Scottish Premiership match against Kilmarnock on Sunday . Deila, who met with chief executive Peter Lawwell at Lennoxtown on Friday to discuss scouting, revealed that James Forrest is nearing his return to the first-team squad. However, the winger is unlikely to be involved against Kilmarnock on Saturday. 'He could have played by now but we want to get him fitter so we can hopefully get more consistency in his play. So we are patient with him,' he added. 'He is a top player and we know he can make a difference in the team. It's very important that if he is going to be the player he can be, we do everything we can to manage his situation. He has taken full part in training this week, so that's positive.'","Celtic manager Ronny Deila has been critcised for his team's poor displays .

"After loaning Rangers £2million this week, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has increased his control over the crisis-hit club. But how far does that control extend? What practical effects will it have? And are fans right to be worried? Sportsmail's John McGarry answers the key questions on Ashley's latest power grab. Does Mike Ashley now own Rangers outright? In a word – no. However, to all intents and purposes, he is now the powerbase at the club. Rangers will now take whichever direction he decides. But isn’t his shareholding still fairly minimal? Yes. He only owns 8.92 per cent of the club but it’s the terms of the £2m loan he agreed to give Rangers last week that cements his position. It’s believed Ashley will have two placemen on the board and he is already allies with James Easdale, chairman David Somers and Normal Crighton. So he’ll be calling all the shots. Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley's (left) loan being accepted has led to Graham Wallace's resignation . Ashley's £2million offer will see Rangers into the New Year and there could be future funding to follow that . And who are his men on the board likely to be? Former Newcastle chief executive Derek Llambias is already in Glasgow and seems certain to fill the chair vacated by outgoing CE Graham Wallace this week. Another Ashley man, Stephen Mucklow, is likely to fill the void left by finance chief Philip Nash. The removals of both Wallace and Nash were a condition of the Ashley loan. As the owner of Newcastle too, isn’t there a conflict of interest there? You would have to say, potentially, yes. That’s why, when Ashley initially bought a smaller stake in the club last year, the SFA struck a deal with him not to own more than 10 per cent or have ‘boardroom influence’ in the future – mirroring UEFA’s stance on such matters. Ashley looks likely to choose former Newcastle director of football Derek Llambias (right) to join the board . Philip Nash also resigned from his position as director from the Rangers board on Friday . The governing body has written to Ashley for clarification but it seems highly unlikely they’ll call him out on it. His £2m loan saved the club from going into administration, after all. But what of the potential for Rangers and Newcastle to meet in European competition in the future? Both clubs and UEFA will cross that bridge when they come to it. But bear in mind that Ashley wants out of Newcastle by 2016. That’s the earliest date when Rangers could potentially be back in European competition, so it might never come to it. Did the club have an alternative to Ashley’s proposal? They had two. Former Rangers director Dave King headed a consortium willing to invest an initial £16m in the club. Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy was also in the frame with a finance package. In the end, the board sided with Ashley. Brian Kennedy staged a desperate 11th hour bid on Friday night to thwart Ashley’s move for control at Rangers . How has this gone down with the fans? Most were in favour of King and they now appear to be split down the middle. Some can see no further than a man with a net worth of £3.75 billion and feel this can only be a good thing. Newcastle have turned a profit the past few years, for example. Other are suspicious of the sportswear tycoon’s motives. Kenny Miller scores during a win over Dumbarton as Rangers continued to make strides on the pitch . Ally McCoist's side have won their last four games in a row as they pursue promotion to the top flight . As well as a lucrative merchandising deal – Ashley already takes a 49 per cent cut – he also has naming rights for the stadium which he picked up for £1 from Charles Green. So far he hasn’t activated this. If copyright on the club badge now belongs to Ashley, fans fear his company - as opposed to Rangers – only stands to profit. What about Ally McCoist? Despite suggestions he was under immediate threat, the Rangers boss has been told his job is safe. But like everyone else at the club, he is now working under a cloud of uncertainty. Time will tell. Rangers manager Ally McCoist has been assured of his position but everyone at the club will be uncertain .","Mike Ashley bailed the club out with loan this week .

"Ally McCoist has received assurances about his immediate future from the Rangers hierarchy in the wake of Mike Ashley’s power play. Rumours McCoist could be facing the sack swept Glasgow on the day the new regime began to take shape - with Ashley's former managing director at Newcastle United, Derek Llambias, arriving in the city on Monday night ahead of talks with the Ibrox board. However, PLC chairman David Somers and football board chairman Sandy Easdale both spoke with McCoist to tell him to concentrate on a hectic schedule of fixtures. Rumours surfaced that Ally McCoist's job as manager at Ibrox was going to be under threat . McCoist (left) laughs with assistant manager Kenny McDowall (right) during training at Murray Park . Despite those words of comfort, speculation is likely to persist about his longer-term prospects. McCoist has lost an ally in former chief executive Graham Wallace, whose inevitable departure after opposing Ashley was confirmed yesterday morning. Other influential elements of the Rangers powerbase are believed to have a less favourable view of McCoist but he was given backing ahead of Tuesday's League Cup quarter-final against St Johnstone. ‘I received a couple of phone calls from the chairman and Sandy Easdale this morning, which was great,’ said McCoist. The 52-year-old prepares his squad for their League Cup quarter-final against St Johnstone on Tuesday night . The Rangers manager received a call form PLC Chairman David Somers (left) assuring him about his future . ‘The chairman was great. We had a 15 to 20 minute conversation – the majority of which will remain private – but he was kind enough to explain the board’s views and opinions on taking the Mike Ashley offer. ‘The two gentlemen didn’t need to phone but took the time to do so. ‘Sandy phoned basically to say much the same and to tell me to concentrate my thoughts totally on tomorrow’s game and indeed the upcoming fixtures.' Asked if he had any fears he could be facing the axe when those calls arrived, McCoist said: ‘No. And I don’t say that meaning to be blasé. Every manager knows how precarious the job is. Football board chairman Sandy Easdale (pictured) said the board have not got 'ideas to change the manager' ‘I genuinely thought two board members were phoning to give me an update on what has been happening.’ Easdale, who arrived at Ibrox on Monday to oversee a restructuring programme, added: ‘We have not got any ideas of changing the manager That’s not on the agenda.’ Fears had been expressed over Rangers’ ability to meet next month’s wages without any new finance and McCoist welcomed the £2 million loan from Newcastle United owner Ashley. ‘The news of Mike’s involvement is good news,’ he said. ‘I’ve said all along the club needs investment, so we’ve got it.’ Newcastle owner Mike Ashley (left) celebrates as his side beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday . Llambias is a close ally of Ashley and is expected to replace Wallace as chief executive, although he could initially be employed as a consultant. He was reluctant to answer questions at Glasgow Airport, but did laud the credentials of the Sports Direct billionaire, saying: '“Mike Ashley has got a great track record'. Meanwhile, Ashley's weekend move - which enables him to appoint two directors -has drawn the attention of the SFA. McCoist welcomed Ashley's much-needed investment and his involvement is 'good news' for the club . The governing body are writing to both Ashley and Rangers seeking clarification on the loan deal and how it may impact on the agreement signed back in 2012. That limited Ashley to a stake of no more than 10 per cent — he currently has 8.9 per cent — and imposed certain restrictions on his influence. The SFA will await responses before deciding if there has been any possible breach.","Rumours surfaced that Ally McCoist's position could be under threat .

Easdale said the board 'have not got any ideas of changing the manager .
Mike Ashley has loaned the club £2million as fears were expressed over Rangers' ability to meet next month's wages ."
"Mike Ashley doesn’t know what he’s let himself in for. If the Newcastle United owner — who last week bailed out cash-strapped Rangers with a £2million loan — had taken up a seat in the director’s box at Dumbarton on Saturday, he would have been greeted by a sea of green. With only one grandstand at the Bet Butler Stadium, spectators are treated to the spectacular, craggy Dunbartonshire landscape — punctuated only by the imposing, red-brick shell of a former whisky distillery which looms over the ground. Mike Ashley did not watch Rangers at Dumbarton but was in attendance as Newcastle beat Tottenham . Outside, stewards had the unfamiliar task of turning away ticketless fans, while the hospitality area ploughed ahead with a wedding. With 1,000 noisy fans on either side, it had the feeling of a plum FA Cup third tie, with the traditional footballing giants taking on the plucky non-league minnows. In fact, neither Ashley, nor South African-based businessman Dave King or Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy — the prospective saviours of Ibrox — were in attendance as Rangers laboured to a 3-0 victory over their hosts. Kenny Miller (obscured, second left) scores Rangers' first goal in their 3-0 victory over Dumbarton . If they had been there, the football on show would have been enough to make them change their minds. There is no mistake Ally McCoist’s side were streets ahead of Dumbarton in terms of quality — but only in the way that the Vanarama Conference is superior to the Ryman League. Rangers huffed and puffed, hitting over-hit cross after over-hit cross, long punt after long punt. Only the meagre flashes of brilliance from veteran front-man Kenny Miller and the marauding runs of left-back Lee Wallace came close to anything resembling the top-flight. The rest were mediocre. ‘They’re not Rangers players,’ one supporter told me as the squads warmed up beforehand. ‘They are just filling the gaps until we get back to the Premiership.’ Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley's (left) loan being accepted has led to Graham Wallace's resignation . Part of the problem lies with the management. While McCoist shepherded Rangers to two easy promotions into the Championship, the manager is faltering at the final hurdle with his side seven points behind Hearts at the summit. Several fans think it is time for the Rangers legend to step aside, although shareholder Sandy Easdale confirmed that McCoist’s position is safe. Many also believe that Sports Direct maestro Ashley sees the Glasgow club as a quicker, cheaper route into the Champions League than his team on Tyneside. On this showing, it won’t be happening any time soon — and a manager with greater pedigree might be required to make those next giant leaps. Rangers have struggled for consistency this season, leading some fans to question Ally McCoist's future . Simply getting out of the Championship will be trying. After all — with three of Scotland’s five best-supported teams vying for promotion, the second tier is incredibly competitive. That was clear for all to see on Sunday when Hibernian and Hearts locked horns in the Edinburgh derby — a fixture which, until both clubs’ relegation, graced the Premiership. Easter Road was also awash with a sea of green — albeit 10,000 singing and dancing Hibs fans. It was about as far from Dumbarton as you can get. Close your eyes, and it could easily have been the derbies of North London, Merseyside or Tyne-Wear ringing in your ears. And while the football wasn’t top notch, it was far more lively and enthralling than anything Rangers served up on Saturday. Rangers shareholder and chairman of the football board Sandy Easdale (left) has backed the club's manager . Hibs took the game to their rivals — who are still unbeaten this season —and looked to be holding for a slender 1-0 victory going into injury time. Then came a moment worthy of gracing Europe’s top table. Turkish centre-half Alim Ozturk hit a speculative 35-yard thunderer which sailed in off the crossbar. Hearts have preserved their near-perfect start to the campaign because they resolved their financial difficulties in the summer. While Ibrox has been playing billionaire bingo during the opening months of the season, the Tynecastle club has flourished under fan-ownership and Robbie Neilson’s side look dead-certs for an immediate return to the big time. Hibs, too, have found their feet following relegation under new manager Alan Stubbs and his outfit will prove tricky opponents for Rangers if they met in the play-offs. Today, Easdale heralded a renewed era of stability under Ashley. But they should be warned that restoring Rangers to greatness won’t be a stroll in the Dunbartonshire countryside.","Mike Ashley provided a £2million loan to Rangers .

"On July 13, Andre Schurrle lifted the World Cup. After coming off the bench in the 31st minute, the winger played a crucial part in Germany eventually triumphing over Argentina – setting Mario Gotze up with a pinpoint cross to turn home the extra-time winner. It was a fitting end to his tournament, which cast him as Joachim Low’s secret weapon. He netted the crucial extra-time opener against Algeria in the second round before rubbing salt in Brazil’s semi-final wound by scoring the final two in Germany’s famous 7-1 win. When he returned to show off his new medal to his Chelsea team-mates, fans could be forgiven for thinking they were about to be treated to settled-in Schurrle adding lightning pace and finishing to the Blues attack.

Didier Drogba (second left) celebrates Chelsea's winner at Shrewsbury with Schurrle . What they’ve got instead is Jose Mourinho slamming him after a poor display at League Two Shrewsbury. Schurrle was continually wasteful both in possession and with his frequent long-range shots, with the Chelsea manager admitting his disappointment. It’s not the first time this season. Handed chances to impress against Bolton in the Capital One Cup and Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League, Schurrle turned in similarly frustrating displays. Too often he was trying to make the impossible happen rather than using his undoubted quality to influence the game. Instead of Chelsea’s attacking play going through him, he scuppered many of the Blues' moves forward. The contrast to Willian’s tireless teamwork and ability to play in his fellow attackers makes it easy to see why the Brazilian is preferred in big games.

In the days following the game in Lisbon, Mourinho commented on Schurrle: 'Sometimes phenomenal, sometimes he is so-so. When he is phenomenal, he is phenomenal.' Mourinho isn’t a fan of inconsistency, and his frustration after the Shrewsbury outing will have been at the German’s inability to react to comments like that – no doubt relayed in far more detail behind closed doors. This season has also seen the ‘phenomenal’ Schurrle – the World Cup Schurrle – in fits and starts. He looked to have come on to hand Chelsea a vital three points at Manchester City before Frank Lampard famously returned to haunt his old club. He is currently playing himself into being an impact player – a roll of the dice for 20 minutes when things aren’t going right.

Many a player has made a career out of being a supersub, but it can’t have been the Chelsea niche the 23-year-old had in mind when arriving at the club in the summer of 2013. Unless Schurrle adjusts his mentality when called upon to be a crucial part of the Blues’ attack, the manager will lose patience altogether. Last season saw Mourinho cast off a fans’ favourite in Juan Mata because of a perceived inability to follow direction. Schurrle must shape up if he doesn’t want to go the same way.","Andre Schurrle won the World Cup with Germany at Brazil 2014 .

"Football is rife with a shocking level of 'institutional discrimination', according to a think tank founded by a group of former Premier League players. The Sports People's Think Tank (SPTT) will release a report in parliament on Monday exposing the prejudices faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people looking to take up positions of authority in the game. Figures published by the Professional Footballers' Association earlier this month showed BAME people currently fill just under four per cent of backroom staff positions in the Football League.

Former striker Jason Roberts (pictured) says 'football has failed to complete the promise of true equality' 'Football has failed to complete the promise of true equality,' Jason Roberts, a former Blackburn striker and a founding member of the think tank, told the Observer. 'The numbers point to a problem that any right-minded individual would be shocked at. 'Most disappointing is the game's overall refusal, up to this point, to engage in some dialogue which challenges the decision-makers and leadership of the game, rather than focusing on the victims of these practices - prospective BME coaches and managers.'

"Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice against Holland to pile pressure on Guus Hiddink. Hiddink's second reign as Holland manager has not got off to the best of starts as he has witnessed his side lose three of their first four games. Swansea star Sigurdsson followed up his goal against Latvia by converting a penalty past Jasper Cillessen to open the scoring in the 10th minute. Holland's team were in complete disarray as their players look downcast following Iceland's second goal by Gylfi Sigurdsson (not pictured) Swansea midfielder Sigurdsson (left) stepped up and slotted an early penalty for Iceland past the diving Jasper Cillessen .

Sigurdsson's goal from the spot came after Stefan de Vrij was adjudged to have fouled Birkir Bjarnason inside the area. And the midfielder doubled his side's lead just before the interval when he punished Holland for their slack defending inside the box by blasting the ball past the helpless Cillessen. Hiddink threw on Klaas Jan Huntelaar at half-time - to join the likes of Arjen Roben and Robin van Persie - in hope that he could ignite their attack, however they were unable to find a way back into the game. Holland started the second half with Van Persie hitting over from outside the box. Another fine Daley Blind cross looked set for his Manchester United team-mate to pull a goal back for Holland but the pass was deflected away from the forward's grasp. Jon Dadi Bodvarsson could have made it more comprehensive for the hosts as he broke clear with minutes remaining but failed to hit the target. Iceland now have nine points from nine in Group A and sit alongside the Czech Republic, who also have a 100 per cent record. Holland have just three points, with their first ever loss to Iceland arriving after an opening defeat by the Czechs.

More impressive though is the record of Kolbeinn Sigthorsson. The Ajax striker has scored 16 times in 26 games for his country, and looks certain to beat Gudjohnsen's total of 24.

"Home comforts have helped Luke Shaw finally find his feet at Manchester United. United fans voted Shaw man of the match on Saturday after an energetic and uplifting display in the 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace. The 19-year-old impressed throughout and almost scored his first professional goal after a surging 50-yard run which started from his own half. Luke Shaw impressed for Manchester United against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford . Shaw has endured a rocky start to his career at Old Trafford. He turned up to pre-season training out of shape and many questioned why the club had allowed long-serving left-back Patrice Evra to leave. But four months on, he has found contentment. 'I feel at home now,' the England left-back told Press Association Sport. 'Everyone has been really good with me, not just the players but the staff as well. 'They have made me feel really welcome and now I just want to keep on improving, working hard in training and get the best out of myself.' A key component in Shaw's improvement has, it seems, been the relocation of his parents from Surrey to the north-west. 'It's a new surrounding for me but the best thing is that my family have come up with me,' said Shaw, who lived in digs with his young Southampton team-mates until his transfer. The 19-year-old gets stuck in to a challenge with Palace midfielder James McArthur on Saturday . 'My Mum and Dad are here so I'm not just a 19-year-old living up here by myself. 'I have a good structure at home and good people around me. 'It makes me feel more comfortable. It helped me settle because even at Southampton I never lived with them but it's nice to be with them and to even spend time with my family.' Shaw frankly admitted on United's tour of the United States that he had under-estimated the challenge of playing for a club that claims to be the biggest in the world. That is why he was far from his physical peak when he turned up on his first day at United. But after making several appearances at commercial events - the latest one being for United's global noodle partner Nissin on Saturday evening - he is fully aware of the demands being placed upon him. 'I am used to it now, it's part of my job,' he said. 'You need to get used to it quickly because there is lots of things to do here commercially and on the pitch.' Just a couple of hours before his appearance at the event, Shaw had brought the Old Trafford crowd to their feet with his run and low shot on goal which Julian Speroni just managed to tip wide. Luke Shaw, seen during a frustrating pre-season for Manchester United,  and last season for Southampton . Former United full-back Phil Neville said it reminded him of Gareth Bale. The teenager promises the United support that will not be the last time they see that this season. 'It's something I have in my ability and I think I can do more of it,' Shaw said. 'When chances come for me like that I tend to run forward like that. It was a good save. Hopefully soon a goal will come.' Back in their prime, Evra and Denis Irwin used to raise the volume at Old Trafford with similar runs. Shaw has lofty ambitions to match the achievements of the pair. 'There is Patrice Evra and Denis Irwin that are top quality left backs and I just want to come here and prove to everyone that I can be just as good as them two legends,' he said. Shaw hopes Saturday's win, which came courtesy of Juan Mata's second-half strike, will help United move up the table after their unconvincing start. 'Hopefully that win can kick start our season,' he said. 'We haven't had the best run in the last few games so it was a massive win.'

"The last time England embarked on a World Cup in Brazil, they prepared with three days at Dulwich Hamlet and took a 31-hour flight with four refuelling stops, while their most famous player was sent elsewhere on a goodwill mission. On reflection, it is probably no great surprise that the 1950 campaign has gone down as an object lesson in how not to win the World Cup. The defeat to the USA in Belo Horizonte remains the biggest humiliation amid all the other failed attempts to land the famous  trophy as England stepped into the unknown on their first campaign with staggering complacency. Farewell: England prepare to board the plane ahead of a 31-hour trip to Brazil ahead of the 1950 World Cup . On Sunday they will once again depart for Brazil and these days Roy Hodgson has a vast support staff, hi-tech training facilities and luxury accommodation to assist his plans. But 64 years ago, the first England manager Walter Winterbottom did not even pick the team. Hodgson’s players first met up two weeks ago for a fitness camp in Portugal. They moved on to St George’s Park in Staffordshire for tactical preparation ahead of last night’s farewell game against Peru with all eyes fixed on the opening game against Italy, in Manaus, on June 14. More than 70 strong, the FA party will fly first to Miami for more warm-weather training and two friendlies, then on to Rio de Janeiro next weekend. All smiles: England players including Tom Finney (second left), Stan Mortensen (centre) and Laurie Hughes (right) inspect the contents of a suitcase . Back in 1950, England won friendlies in Portugal and Belgium at the end of a season in which Portsmouth were crowned champions. As all the Football League clubs asked were busy re-seeding their pitches, they reconvened at Dulwich Hamlet’s ground in south London for light training on June 14 with only 11 days to go before the first World Cup group game. ‘We played a couple of seven-a-side games and that was it, off we went,’ said Winterbottom, who noted that the South American clubs had given up their players six months earlier, according to his biographer and son-in-law Graham Morse. Elsewhere: Sir Stanley Matthews flew to Canada to spread FA goodwill . Morse’s book recounts how Winterbottom had told his mother Fanny: ‘There is a lot expected of a grand lot of players and myself. Don’t be too hopeful of us bringing that cup back, but we are all very optimistic and we will do our best.’ The England squad flew in a Panair do Brasil Lockheed Constellation on a flight lasting 31 hours, with refuelling stops in Paris, Lisbon, Dakar and Recife before arriving in Rio. The FA party was 17 players, four referees, two trainers, eight sports writers and the manager. Players were on the FA standard rate of £20 per game. Winterbottom’s salary was £1,000. Stanley Matthews, who was 35 and had not won a cap for more than a year, flew instead to Canada to spread FA goodwill and Manchester United took Jack Aston and Harry Cockburn on a tour to the USA before they were released for World Cup duty. England arrived in Rio with five days to spare. They trained in the morning and evening at Botafogo’s ground in the city  centre and stayed on the Copacabana in the Luxor Hotel, recommended to the FA by Arsenal, after they had toured Brazil. The manager, however, did not seem impressed. ‘It was so hot that the players were exhausted, even in the hotel,’ said Winter- bottom, who banned swimming in the ocean and ruled the beach out of bounds after 10am. ‘It couldn’t have been worse for us. When Arsenal were there it was an end-of-season jolly, more or less a holiday.’ Matthews made it to Brazil on the day before the first game, so he was left out of the 2-0 win against Chile in Rio’s Maracana, which was still swarming with workmen. Winterbottom said it ‘resembled a building site’. Some things don’t change and it was not the only parallel to be drawn. England’s best centre half was in exile as Neil Franklin had been banned after  moving to the newly-formed Colombian league, outside FIFA. Humiliation: England goalkeeper Bert Williams (left) looks on as Joe Gaetjens scores to give USA a 1-0 win over England in Group 2 . Other things have changed. ‘The food was terrible,’ said Matthews. ‘We were just  eating bananas mostly.’ Oxygen was on tap for the players at half-time. Captain Billy Wright said: ‘We gave it a test but found it of little use. Perhaps it was the difficulty to breathe which was directly responsible for my feeling leg-weary in the second half.’ Matthews was available but the sole team selector Arthur Drewry decided not to make any changes for the second game against the USA. Hodgson’s team will return to Belo  Horizonte to face Costa Rica and can only hope the outcome is less embarrassing. England flew north from Rio and stayed nearby in the mining village of Morro Velho as guests of a British gold mining company. They limbered up with a friendly game of cricket against the Press. Ready: The England team, including Alf Ramsey (top row, second left), pose ahead of the defeat to Spain . At the stadium, changing facilities were . so poor that Winterbottom took his players off to change at the nearby . Minas Athletic Club before walking back to the ground. Inside, the pitch . was small and dry and bumpy and England lost 1-0. The only . goal was a header by Joe Gaetjens, a Haitian who would return to his . native island in the Caribbean, where he was later executed by the . Francois ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier regime after disappearing in 1964. Winterbottom . grumbled about the referee who seemed to have missed a header by Stan . Mortensen crossing the line before it was scooped out by a hand - not . one belonging to the goalkeeper - but this was 60 years before Frank . Lampard in Bloemfontein and the incident which hastened goal-line . technology. Besides, . it was not the only issue. England realised they had come up short and . that the World Cup was unlike anything they had experienced. They would . lose their final group game to Spain and the plane taking them home to .

"The Spanish ambassador to the UK has been summoned by the Foreign Office after one of the country’s research vessels entered British territory off the coast of Gibraltar. Foreign Office minister David Lidington said the actions of the research ship, which was accompanied by a Spanish Civil Guard vessel, were 'unlawful'. Mr Lidington urged the Spanish government to take action on the recent increase in vessels in British waters off Gibraltar and said he 'strongly condemned this provocative incursion.' Critique: Foreign Office minister David Lidington, pictured in 2010, said  he strongly condemned the actions of a Spanish research vessel that entered waters off Gibraltar . ‘According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British territorial waters, under United Kingdom sovereignty, in which only the United Kingdom has the right to exercise jurisdiction,’ Mr Lidington told the Telegraph. ‘Her Majesty's Government takes a grave view of any attempt by Spain to exert authority or control within British Gibraltar territorial waters and considers such incursions as a violation of our sovereignty,' Earlier this year a Spanish warship had to be escorted off British territory by Gibraltar Squadron's patrol boat, HMS Sabre, after it entered the waters near Gibraltar. The boat allegedly used a fake name and call sign, and refused to leave by its own accord at it claimed it was in Spanish waters, local media said. The vessel approached as UK Special Forces personnel from the Royal Navy's Submarine Parachute Assistance Group were carrying out training jumps into the sea. Earlier this year, a British forces parachute training exercise had to be suspended while Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Sabre (pictured) escorted the Spanish warship out of Gibraltar . Tensions over the disputed territory . have been rising since the construction of an artificial reef by the . Gibraltar government last year which the Spanish said interfered with . their fishermen. Madrid responded by imposing tighter border controls, leading to long delays at the frontier, while the Gibraltar Chief Minister has warned that Spanish vessels entering British territory may come under fire as they are not identified as being from ‘a friendly nation'. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November last year, Fabian Picardo warned that Spanish boats ‘may find themselves shot at’ if they continue to disregard Gibraltar’s marine borders. Warning . that the Spanish ships could be seen as ‘terrorists’ he accused the . country of ‘needling away at the United Kingdom and Gibraltar by taking . such action’. A . Foreign Office spokesman said at the time: 'There was an incursion into British . waters near Gibraltar by the Spanish Navy on 18 February, during a Royal . Navy exercise. The exercise went ahead irrespective of this incursion. 'We are raising this at a high level with the Spanish government and will be issuing a formal protest. 'Neither this incident nor other incursions change the fact of UK sovereignty over British Gibraltar Territorial Waters.' Tensions have been high in the region since the summer when Spain imposed border checks on every car causing up to six hours of delays . The . long-standing dispute between Britain and Spain has flared up over the . past years. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has blocked the . Spanish-Gibraltarian border and staged numerous incursions into . Gibraltarian waters. In November, a research vessel belonging to the Spanish . state, the RV Ramon Margalef, undertook significant surveying activity . in Gibraltar’s territorial waters. The . boat withdrew only after Spanish ambassador Federico Trillo was . summoned by Matthew Rycroft, Acting Permanent Under Secretary at the . Foreign Office 20 hours later– the third time he has been summoned over Gibraltar . since the current Spanish government took office in December 2011. In . the same month, a British diplomatic bag was opened and searched by . Spanish Guardia Civil officers on the border with Gibraltar - an . incident the Foreign Office described as a 'serious infringement' of . international diplomatic protocols. At the time Europe Minister David Lidington said Spain has increased the number of its incursions into . British territorial waters from around five per month to around 40 per . month.","UK military exercise was on hold after Spanish ship enter Gibraltar's waters .

"With its space-age design, it would not look out of place in a theme park but its creator claims it will revolutionise the training of racehorses. Planning permission has already been approved for the construction of the mile-long monorail system just outside the Berkshire training centre of Lambourn with work expected to being before the end of the year after the recent appointment of a Project Manager. Ultimately running along the track will be a computer controlled unit housing between six and 12 horses as they exercise with controlled weights on their backs rather than riders. By this time next year, it should be completed and Turkish industrialist Mehmet Kurt, who has poured $20million (£12.4million) into development and will spend a further £10m on his system’s construction at Kingwood Stud, is convinced the horse welfare benefits will win over any sceptic minds in racing. Horses travel along a one-mile monorail covered system exercising on an artificial racing surface . Turkish owner Mehmet Kurt is convinced the horse welfare benefits will win over any sceptic minds . Kurt this week outlined his plans to a Jockey Club delegation headed by chief executive Simon Bazalgette but he already has a prototype operating near Istanbul. He was inspired develop Kurtsystems after becoming frustrated by the level of injury to his young horses when they went into training. He is convinced that, more often than not, riders tugging at the reins of embryonic racehorses do more damage than good. Kurt says results in his homeland endorse his methods. He claims horses which undergo a conditioning programme of ‘controlled exercise’ develop stronger bones, cartilages, muscles and tendons, making them more resilient to the rigours of full training. Units housing between six to 10 horses travel along a one-mile monorail covered system exercising on an artificial racing surface. Loose connecting reins allow each horse freedom of movement to make exercise as natural as possible. System can be shut down by an operator travelling in control car behind the horses. Automatic shutdown also checks in via sensors on the tethers if a horse stumbles or falls. System designed to run at speeds of up to 35mph and horses would work for up to an hour a day . Weights gradually increased on each horses back, starting at 20 kilos and peaking at 60 kilos. Respiratory and heart rate monitors on each compartment . Kurt, a former president of Adanaspor football club who studied the movement of wild horses in Arizona before designing his prototype, claims his system can also play a significant role in the rehabilitation of injured horses. The man, who has won the Turkish Derby twice with The Best (1993) and Batrobel (1999), said: ‘When I had young horses which were exciting and expected to become champions were injured too often, I felt I had to find a solution or leave the sport. ‘Breakdowns and muscle injuries arise when horses are pushed beyond their capabilities at a very young age. ‘This is about making a horse ready for training. The idea is to make it as natural as possible with no restriction on movement.’ Kurt has had horse in training with Richard Hannon this summer and intends to increase his British string. He will intend this week’s next session of the Tattersalls Sales in Newmarket this week with bloodstock agent Anthony Stroud. Kurt’s intention is to practise what he preaches and pre-train his young stock on his system. He insists he can win over the traditionally conservative racing community to join him. ‘I know people have old habits but when they see horses going from the Kurtsystems to be winners they will change to new habits,’ he said. He already has one convert, renowned US Horse Whisperer Monty Roberts, who said: ’I see potential in it, amazing potential.’","Planning permission approved for training system at Kingwood Stud .

Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg was back in action on Wednesday night, just 24 hours after it emerged he broke protocol to attend an Ed Sheeran concert.

The PGMOL do not want a situation between manager and referee which might escalate to being one version of a conversation against the other. It is understood Palace manager Warnock had wanted to discuss with Clattenburg two incidents during the 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns, Wilfried Zaha being denied a penalty and a challenge by Craig Dawson on Julian Speroni that led to a goal and the injured keeper being substituted. After the game Warnock said: ‘It’s just like an assault. How come one of the four officials doesn’t see that? Dawson goes for about five yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face. 'I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann,' added Warnock, referring to how Manchester City's keeper famously suffered a broken neck in a challenge with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy in the 1956 FA Cup final.

Siem celebrates with his caddie Guy Tilson after winning on the first hole of the play-off at the BMW Masters . Rounds of 65, 66 and 63 had seemingly put the in-form Frenchman in total command, taking the 24-year-old to a collective 40 under par for his last five stroke play rounds following his recent win in the Portugal Masters. However, with a strong wind making scoring conditions difficult, Levy could only manage a closing 78 to finish alongside playing partner Siem, who shot 73, and Fisher on 16 under par. Fisher had set the clubhouse target after a superb 67 and then saw Levy and Siem both bogey the 18th, Siem missing from six feet for the title with Levy already certain to drop a shot after almost pulling his approach into the water.

"Schoolgirl Mia Lindsay, 15, with her mother Zora . Tony Blair’s former boarding school has been accused of ignoring the plight of a pupil whose parents can no longer afford the fees. Mia Lindsay, 15, a day pupil at Fettes College for five years, is unable to return to complete her vital GCSE year. Sean and Zora Lindsay say that after splashing out more than £100,000, they believed the Edinburgh school would support them when they fell on hard times. Mrs Lindsay, 46, was diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago. She was forced to leave her job as the operations manager of a casino, leaving the family unable to meet the £23,190-a-year fees. The school waived the fees for six months while Mrs Lindsay underwent treatment. However, this financial assistance ended at Easter and Mia was told she must leave. She remained for the summer term and the family must now pay back £10,000. In January 2013, Fettes was warned by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator that the school’s charitable status could be stripped unless it greatly increased access for poorer students. Mr Lindsay, 49, a former pupil, said: ‘We are stunned at the cruel way we’ve been treated. Mia has been at Fettes for five years and she loves it. ‘We cannot believe this extraordinary decision at the start of such a crucial year just as she is about to sit the most important exams of her life. ‘We have already paid out over £100,000 in fees over the past years and it’s through no fault of our own we find ourselves in this position. ‘All we were asking is for Fettes to show some compassion during this time of hardship and allow Mia to finish her GCSEs with them.’ Scroll down for video . The family’s difficulties began last September when Mrs Lindsay was diagnosed with breast cancer. She says: ‘As a contractor I didn’t qualify for company sick pay and with no income coming in, the school agreed to waive the fees for six months.’ However, after six months doctors said Mrs Lindsay was still too ill to return to work. The teenager has attended Fettes College in Edinburgh, where former Prime Minister Tony Blair went to school, for the last five years but has now been forced to move to a  state school after her parents could no longer pay . Peter Worlledge, bursar at Fettes College (pictured), said: ‘We have every sympathy with the Lindsay family but with finite funds available, Fettes College is simply unable to support every request for financial support' She said: ‘To see her (Mia) forced to leave in her final year has added huge stress. With the worry of my cancer, it’s been deeply distressing.’ Mr Lindsay, a house husband, says in an effort to overturn the school’s decision, they managed to secure £500 a term from a local charity which helps with student grants. However the school has said the family must pay the full fees of £7,730-a-term and clear the arrears. Mr Lindsay said: ‘I am astounded Fettes can claim charitable status when this is how they treat loyal parents. ‘I also can’t believe the school doesn’t have a fund to help parents like us who through no fault of their own, find themselves unable to pay the fees.’ Mia has now started at a local state school, but her parents still hope she can finish her studies at Fettes. Peter Worlledge, bursar at Fettes College said: ‘We have every sympathy with the Lindsay family but with finite funds available, Fettes College is simply unable to support every request for financial support.’ Fettes College was founded in 1870 after Sir William Fettes bequeathed £166,000 for the education of poor children and orphans. As well as Mr Blair, who attended in the 1970s, other alumni include David Ogilvy, one of the biggest names in advertising, and General John de Chastelain, who oversaw IRA arms decommissioning.","Mia Lindsay has been a pupil at Fettes College in Edinburgh for five years .

"Sergio Garcia is just one shot off the lead heading into the final round of the CIMB Classic in Malaysia, but Ryder Cup team-mate Lee Westwood fell well off the pace on Saturday. Garcia held the outright lead when he followed a flawless front nine of 32 with his fifth birdie of the day on the 10th, but dropped his only shot of the day on the next and did well to salvage a par on the 14th after trying to drive the green and coming up short in the water. A third round of 68 left the Spaniard on 11 under par, one behind defending champion Ryan Moore and fellow American Kevin Na, who both shot 67 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. Sergio Garcia goes into the final round of the CIMB Classic in Kuala Lumpur just one shot off the lead . The Spaniard, who is the highest ranked player in the tournament, shot a third round four under par 68 . Lee Westwood shot a disappointing third round 74 after sinking a hole-in-one on the 11th on day two . 'It's unfortunate I didn't feel quite as sharp as the first two days,' Garcia said. 'It got to be a long day with the weather delay but the good thing is we got done and I am looking forward to tomorrow. 'On 14 I just missed it a little bit and the wind switched on me but I made a great four which kept the round going.' Moore, who beat compatriot Gary Woodland in a play-off 12 months ago, said: 'It's great deja vu because I am in a similar position to last year. I played good, solid golf the last two days. The former world No 1 ended the day seven shots off the lead going into the final day on five under par . Ryan Moore (pictured) shot an impressive third round five under par to share the lead going into the final round . Kevin Na (pictured) also shot five under 67 to tie with Moore on 12 under heading into the final round . 'It (the course) challenges every aspect of your game. You have to put it in position off the tee and hit a lot of different shots off hanging lies. It makes you hit golf shots, you can't just go out there and make golf swings.' Westwood, who fired a hole-in-one on the 11th in a second round of 65, was looking to complete a unique double by winning on the PGA Tour and European Tour on the same course in the same season following his Malaysian Open victory in April. However, after three birdies in the first five holes on Saturday the former world No 1 bogeyed the sixth and then struggled home in 40 to card a disappointing 74. At five under par, the 41-year-old had drifted seven shots off the pace.","Sergio Garcia shot four under par in the third round in Kuala Lumpur .

"Read Charles Sale's story about Mark Clattenburg being axed for this week's Premier League games after breaking protcol to see an Ed Sheeran concert . The match officials travel rules Mark Clattenburg flouted last weekend were brought in because me and my heavily pregnant wife were threatened and abused by two thugs after a game at Middlesbrough. One of them even made gesture as if to shoot me. Back then we used to drive ourselves to games, park in the club car park and walk to the ground. Unfortunately after Boro played Arsenal in 1995, two supporters approached me in a very aggressive manner. Mark Clattenburg will not officiate next weekend's games after breaking strict protocol on travelling to games . Clattenburg drove alone to West Brom v Crystal Palace at the weekend so he could see Ed Sheeran perform . Warnock wanted to discuss the incident that saw Julian Speroni (centre)  injured in a clash with Craig Dawson . The procedure for match-day officials is: . 1. Match officials must meet at the designated hotel which is relatively close to the ground four hours before the advertised kick-off of the game they are due to officiate . 2. They have a meeting room for their use and have full refreshments available to them . 3. All four officials must attend and generally they will discuss the upcoming match, any previous history and individual knowledge that will be useful in the management of the match . 4. Their cars are left at this hotel for safety and security. There is a people carrier laid on for transport to the ground which drops the officials off at the players' entrance . 5. The same is done in reverse for the journey home . I was only able to escape physical harm due to the quick thinking of one of my guests. There are a number of historic incidents of referees' cars being vandalised - this wasn’t helped by the fact that some referees choose to have personalised number plates. But after this Boro incident it was clear our safety was in question and something had to change. Arsenal won that game 3-2 and I had sent off Alan Moore late on. After the game, I had a drink in the lounge which was standard practice before heading to my guest's car, with my wife in tow. It was dark and just as we got to the car, two supporters started shouting obscenities at me and calling me biased because I was a southerner. One went inside his pockets and made a gun motion to my head. At this moment, my guest opened the car and got my wife in. I used my kit-bag to protect myself from an incoming punch, threw the bag in the car and then drove away. On the Monday after I filed a report to my superiors and at the next meeting of referees - we met every fortnight - the issue of safety was raised. I wasn't the only referee to suffer trouble - I remember another ref had his car attacked after he got stuck in traffic on Tottenham High Road. Graham Poll (right) sends off Middlesbrough's Alan Moore at the Riverside against Arsenal in 1995 . It is also alleged that Clattenburg had a telephone conversation with Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock in his car and this was facilitated by him not using the people carrier back to the hotel after the game. The reason these conversation should not be taking place on a one-to-one basis is that there are no witnesses to protect the referee over allegations of what he is supposed to have said or not said. Clattenburg should be well aware of this after two previous cases of his, the John Mikel Obi incident at Chelsea and the Adam Lallana row at Southampton. It quickly became apparent that we had to change our rules and adopt the system in place from UEFA for European games, where British refs obviously didn't have their cars and were escorted to and from the ground along with their officials. The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the governing body of Premier League referees, therefore changed their rules for the start of 1996-97 season and set the new protocols for a very good reason. Clattenburg knows this and should adhere to that protocol. Last weekend, after officiating West Brom’s game with Crystal Palace, he chose to ignore a very straightforward system designed for his personal safety and his integrity - and that of his colleagues. The procedures mean: . For West Brom matches, the hotel used to be just one mile away from The Hawthorns. However, this has been changed to a city centre hotel in Birmingham that is still only four miles from the ground. So there was really no need for Clattenburg not to take the people carrier – even if he was keen to get up to Tyneside for a pop concert. Clattenburg was cleared of allegedly making inappropriate comments to John Mikel Obi in 2012 . Read Jonathan McEvoy's profile of Mark Clattenburg's controversial career . The vast majority of officials adhere to the official protocol. However, there were odd occasions when I did something similar due to personal commitments. I remember leaving Loftus Road and getting on the Tube into central London to go to a concert with my wife which, in hindsight, wasn’t wise. On another occasion I did feel it was right for me to break the protocol after a Premier League match at Chelsea in 1996 because I had to get to Heathrow airport to fly to Europe for a UEFA tournament. I was given permission to take my own car to Stamford Bridge and follow a police car immediately after the game to get me to Heathrow in time for my flight. It is very difficult planning a life outside of your refereeing duties when you only find out at 3pm on Monday which game you have the following weekend – so I do have some sympathy for Clattenburg.

The Point Piper home is the sixth house in the suburb to be sold for $30 million or more in the past five months . The Edwardian-era home boasts six bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, and was built around 1913 . But a source told Domain that it was sold for $30 million after it was believed another offer of $28 million was rejected in late July. This is the sixth property in the Point Piper area to have sold at $30 million or more this year, which means - after Friday's sale - about $200 million worth of real estate has been offloaded in the beachside suburb in the past five months.

"WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW . This is the moment a woman is shown pictures of her dead brother after she hired a hitman to have him murdered. But what Larisa Kazakova didn't know is the images were faked. The hitman she had hired for the equivalent of £1,500 was actually an undercover police officer. She was caught after a hidden camera caught her nodding her head in approval before handing the money over. Kazakova, 32, is now facing eight-and-a-half years in prison for attempted murder.

But she complained that although she worked in several places as a cleaner, her brother had not got a job and was just living off her hard work. She then decided to try and find a hitman to get rid of him. She claimed that he was violent when she had tried to move away from him and that because both of them were in the country illegally, she was unable to go to police.

"Between 1955 and 1965, Hollywood's favorite male stars all had a penchant for a distinctly preppy style that came to be known as the Ivy look. A new Evergreen Edition of best-seller Hollywood and the Ivy Look, by Graham Marsh and Tony Nourmand, published by Reel Art Press, features photos from that era, showing just how much the A-list set were influenced by the attitude and style of America's East Coast elite. 'From the button-down hip of Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Anthony Perkins to the preppy sensibilities of Woody Allen and Dustin Hoffman, the understated but carefully selected components of the Ivy look didn't shout ""look at me"" but instead gave off an image of approachable correctness and laid back confidence,' write the authors. The origin of preppy: A new edition of  Hollywood and the Ivy Look features photos from the Fifties and Sixties, showing just how much the A-list set were influenced by the style of America's Ivy League elite. Pictured: Steve McQueen looking typically suave in a navy button-down shirt and sharp plaid jacket, his hair in a neat cut . Modern casual: A photo taken circa 1960 shows Clint Eastwood giving his signature squinting smolder as he poses under a tree in a Lacoste collared shirt, a pinstriped sweater casually slung over his shoulder . In a never before published photo in the book, Steve McQueen looks typically suave in a navy button-down shirt and sharp plaid jacket, his hair in a neat cut. 'An interesting thing to note is that there was a spell in the early 1960s when button-holes were removed from the lapels of Ivy jackets,' reads a description from the book. 'This reflected the sleek, sharp and minimal look that surfaced in this period.' Another sartorial element of the era is the white T-shirt just barely visible under his collar. Clint Eastwood gives his signature squinting smoulder in a photo taken around 1960 as he poses under a tree in a Lacoste collared shirt, a pinstriped sweater casually slung over his shoulder. Spot on: In a 1967 photo of Robert Redford taken during his Barefoot in the Park, he perfectly nails the look of the era in his diagonal striped tie, blue button-down shirt, grey tweed blazer and neatly styled hair . Debonair: Though he championed the style a few years before it became mainstream, Cary Grant is also included in the pictorial celebration. (Pictured: The legendary performer in 1955's To Catch a Thief) With his sleek style and immaculately coiffed hair, he, too, embodied the look that came to be associated with masculine confidence. Another star featured in the book is Robert Redford. A photo of the star taken around the same time as 1967's Barefoot in the Park depicts him perfectly nailing the look of the era in his diagonal striped tie, blue button-down shirt, grey tweed blazer and neatly styled hair. Put-together: James Caan, famous for playing Sonny in The Godfather, is pictured off-screen with a close cut haircut and oversized check button-down that are 'pure Ivy League' Tennis whites: Robert Culp gets to grips with a game of tennis in a 1966 episode of I Spy . Memorable moment: This still of Steve McQueen 1968 film Bullitt is 'probably the most influential set of Ivy threads in movie history,' according to the book's authors . Though he championed the Ivy Look a few years before it became mainstream, Cary Grant is also included in the pictorial celebration. A photo of the legendary performer sees him strolling the streets in a scene from 1955's To Catch a Thief with just the middle of his three jacket buttons fastened. Tab Hunter, who launched into fame in 1955's Battle Cry, embodies the Ivy Look in a shot from the mid-Fifties in which he poses on the beach, with his khaki slacks and the sleeves of his white button-down shirt rolled up, a cigarette in hand.

"The best friend of the Colorado man who went missing for five days from a Denver Broncos match says he ‘doesn’t like crowds’ and thinks the crowded 76,000 seater stadium caused him to have ‘a nervous breakdown’. Paul Kitterman was found on Tuesday in Pueblo, Colorado - 112 miles away from the Sports Authority Field at Mile High stadium -  after disappearing at half time from Thursday’s match, leaving his stepson, Jarod Tonneson, and two friends bewildered. His disappearance sparked a major search and then grave fears for Kitterman's safety. Bryan Case, who was known Kitterman for 35 years, says he was very surprised the 53-year-old even agreed to go to the stadium, to attend his first-ever NFL match. Hospitalized: Friends of Paul Kitterman say he is now undergoing treatment in hospital after seeimingly having 'some kind of breakdown' and disappearing from a Denver Broncos match for five days . Long way from home: The above map shows the distance between Broncos Stadium, where Kitterman went missing on Thursday, and Pueblo, Colorado where he was found unharmed five days later . He exclusively told MailOnline: ‘He’s like me, he doesn’t like crowds, he’s never been to a football match and I haven’t either. ‘Something just happened, he snapped. He likes the country, I was surprised he was even at the football. ‘Horse ranching and hunting - that’s what we do, that’s just how we are. We don’t even really know how to use cellphones. ‘He didn’t know who he was. He’d never let nobody down and never do this [knowingly]. I don’t want anybody to think he just wandered off.’ Kitterman’s family released a statement today saying he ‘had some sort of breakdown’ but despite statements he was resting at home, he has actually been hospitalized. Case added: ‘Right now they are doing CAT scans on him. He’s kind of a little different right now, but he’s started to remember something. ‘He’s doing better, he looked like hell. I think he’s had a breakdown. A nervous breakdown, I don’t know, but he’s not himself. Safe: Grave concerns were held for the safety of Paul Kitterman after he failed to turn up after Thursday's game. He told police he was looking for a 'warm place' following the match . ‘Jarrod is with him and he’s surrounded by friends and family and he’s starting to remember more. ‘I’m just glad he’s alive and getting better. He’s alive and that’s all that matters to me.’ Jarod, Kitterman’s employer at a horse ranch near his home in Kremmling, Colorado, Jay Yust, and his girlfriend, Tia Bakke, had accompanied him to the match and led the frantic search around Denver in the hours after he disappeared. Once located by police after a tip-off from a local who recognised him, Kitterman said 'he'd had his fill of football' and had been seeking ‘a warm place’. In his rush to go to the game through a last minute invite he had forgotten to take his credit cards or mobile phone and had only around $50 on him. Case – who shared a house with Kitterman for six years in Phoenix, Arizona - says his friend’s behavior is incredibly out of character, and he has been on great support to him while he has faced problems over the past year. A real country man: Friends say Kitterman had never been to an NFL game before and barely knows how to use his cellphone. He spends most of his time outdoors and always has . He said: ‘I see him regularly even though he lives three hours away. I lost my son three months ago and he’s been down here or on the phone almost every day since, speaking to me - he’s really helped me. Through that. Its been a rough year for me too and he’s been the one person I called and cried to.’ ‘He’s had a few financial problems and other little things over the years and he’s always come to me, but this time no. ‘You have to know the guy to realise that this is not something he’d just do.’ Denver Police Department have said no foul play is suspected in Kitterman’s disappearance, no charges will not be brought against him and they are glad he is now home and safe.","Paul Kitterman, 53, went missing from a Denver Broncos game last week but was found five days later more than 110 miles away in Pueblo .

"A woman who lost control of her weight following a divorce slimmed down five dress sizes after the sight of her reflection in a changing room mirror made her 'recoil in horror'. Yvonne Asare, 31, from Wallington in Surrey, reached size 18 amid the breakdown of her marriage in 2010. After an embarrassing incident in a shop changing room, in which she was confronted with her overweight frame, she became determined to slim down and eventually dropped down to the 9st 5lb, size eight she is today. Scroll down for video . Yvonne pictured during unhappy times before she lost weight (l) and recently, five stone lighter (r) She said: 'I found myself in a changing room with all-round mirrors, and there was no getting away from seeing how far I'd let myself go. 'I didn't have a full-length mirror at home so it was rare to see all of me at the same time. I was completely horrified. I went straight to my brother, who was a gym freak, and asked for his help.' Yvonne, a legal secretary, found herself reaching for comfort foods as her seven-year-long marriage came to an end in 2010. She said: 'Towards the end of the relationship I was very unhappy and I put on so much weight. 'My favourite comfort food was stuffed-crust pepperoni pizza. I also didn't realise how many calories were in sugary drinks. I loved hot chocolate, but a mug can easily be 300 calories - the equivalent of a small meal. 'It was easy going for snacks and indulging in pizza to lift my mood, even though it was doing me no favours at all in the long-run.' Yvonne pictured before she lost weight, back in 2010 when her unhappy relationship was ending . Yvonne lost control of her weight following a divorce, but has slimmed down five dress sizes . Breakfast: Large hot chocolate and cream cheese bagel with bacon . Lunch: Takeaway burger with chips and a coke . Dinner: Steak and ale pie with chips . Snacks: KitKats throughout the day . Breakfast: Protein shake . Lunch: Grilled pork with green leafy salad . Dinner: Grilled chicken with broccoli and salad . Snacks: Lower-fat crisps and fruit . Shortly after her divorce Yvonne visited the Dorothy Perkins store in Chancery Lane in London for some retail therapy. She said: 'I had been buying larger and larger clothes, without giving it much thought. 'But when I saw myself in the mirror, from every angle, I thought ""oh my goodness"". It was like a bolt from the blue.' Yvonne immediately sought the advice of her brother Jonathan, 26, who advised her to overhaul her diet and hit the gym. She said: 'Jonathan was brilliant - he told me exactly what to do. I gradually made the gym into my own personal getaway. I made friends there and fell into the habit of going five times a week. 'It was hugely motivating to see the weight come off.' Before beginning her weight loss challenge she weighed 14st 2lb and wore size 18 clothing. Yvonne typically had a large hot chocolate followed by a cream cheese bagel with bacon for breakfast. For lunch she ate a takeaway burger with chips and a coke, and her evening meal would be a steak and ale pie with chips, or pizza. She would snack on chocolate bars, like KitKats, during the day. She now has a protein shake for breakfast,  grilled pork salad for lunch, and chicken and broccoli for dinner . She started the gym routine in September 2010, and it took her six months to lose two stone. She spent a further two years to shed the remaining three. Yvonne did lots of cardio, spending much of her gym time on the treadmill, as well as strength training. Today, weighing 9st 5lb and wearing size eight clothing, she has a protein shake for breakfast, followed by grilled pork with green leafy salad for lunch, and grilled chicken with broccoli and salad for her evening meal. Snacks, when she has them, consist of lower-fat crisps and fruit. She said: 'I'm so grateful to Jonathan for giving me the push I needed. I was in a unhappy place around the time of my divorce, now I feel incredibly lucky and happy to have got to where I am today. 'I've got no fears about going into changing rooms any more. In fact, I love shopping more than ever. 'Sometimes I catch a glimpse of myself in shop windows as I'm going around town, and I'm very glad with what I see.'","Yvonne Asare, 31, from Wallington in Surrey, slimmed from size 18 to size 8 .

Cyclone Hudhud, one of two storms to hit Asia this weekend, was travelling at 120mph when it made landfall after sweeping through the Bay of Bengal.

One person died in Visakhapatnam, one of the largest cities in southern India and a major naval base, when a wall collapsed. The other was killed when a tree toppled over in Srikakulam. The cyclone's wind speed dipped to about 100mph, but was expected to pick up later on Sunday, according to Rear Admiral S.K. Grewal from India's Eastern Naval Command. Experts said the storm was likely to cause widespread devastation along nearly 300 kilometers 185 miles of India's east coast. Television footage from Visakhapatnam showed downed electrical poles, uprooted trees and massive debris strewn in the streets. Electricity lines were disconnected in parts of Andhra Pradesh to avoid electrocutions, said Arvind Kumar, a relief and rescue official. Four districts in Andhra Pradesh that are home to more than 14 million people - Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari - were expected to be worst hit, including about 350 coastal villages. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu, said that while the early evacuations had saved lives, the cyclone caused 'huge damage' to buildings and crops in the coastal districts.
