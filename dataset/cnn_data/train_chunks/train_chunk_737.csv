The wife of the 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh called a local radio station to give her two cents on the topic of the day: What kind of wife would let her husband wear the same terrible outfit - a tucked-in black sweatshirt and pleated khakis belted high on the waist - every Sunday? Sarah Harbaugh told 997Now's Fernando and Greg that she has spent years trying to talk her husband out of his signature Walmart khakis, even throwing them in the bin, to no avail. 'I've told him so many times: That outfit reflects on me!' she said. Uniform: Jim Harbaugh can be seen in a variation of this outfit on the sidelines of every game his team, the 49ers, plays - much to the chagrin of his wife . Married to his style: Sarah Harbaugh (right) told the radio station that she has tried to change her husband's ways, even throwing out the offending pants, but 'he just doesn't care' Fernando and Greg were using Jim Harbaugh's sartorial setbacks as a launching pad for listeners to call in with their own significant other's clothing conundrums. 'Is this really Sarah Harbaugh?' asks one of the presenters. 'Yes it is. And not many things make me want to call in to a radio station,' she says laughing. 'But my friend called me this morning... I will NOT. I will not take the blame for his outfits.' Mrs Harbaugh explains that she has tried to influence her husbands fashion choices, but 'he just doesn't care.' 'He's got a flattering body,' she adds, saying that she wants him in flat-front pants. Bargain hunter: According to his wife, Jim Harbaugh spends just $8 per pair on the pleated-front khakis he is so fond of . Jim Harbaugh was pictured buying new khakis at a Walmart in Indianapolis . Such is his attachment to the pleated pants that after she disposed of one pair, he stopped on his way to the NFL Scouting Combine to pick up a new pair. 'It's not just any store,' she told the radio jocks. 'You have to find them at a Walmart. Eight dollars. Eight dollars!' she laments. She says she told her husband that he was aging himself and that he 'looks like Rain Man,' to the amusement of Greg and Fernando. Stopping just short of calling her husband superstitious, she says that at this point in the season she knows he can't change his outfit. But Mrs Harbaugh said she'd spoken to her husband and asked him if after the final he would let her - or someone else - dress him, and he had agreed. According to SF Gate, Harbaugh is aware of the morning radio discussion. 'I heard they were making quite a bit of sport of me,' he said. 'Happy wife, happy life.' He reportedly stocked up on some new pants Wednesday, but isn't quite ready to trade in his tucked-in sweatshirt. 'If I'm the last person who tucks in his shirt, that will be great,' he said. 'I'll feel like an innovator.' He was snapped by a fan in Walmart - where else - buying several pairs of flat-front Dickies, for which he paid '$23 a pair, on sale.'","Sarah Harbaugh, wife of 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, called a local radio station yesterday morning .

Convicted: Albrecht Muth, 49, has been found guilty of strangling his socialite wife, 91, in 2011 . An eccentric German man who pretended to be an Iraqi army general was today found guilty of choking his 91-year-old socialite wife to death. A jury deliberated for half a day before finding Albrecht Muth, 49, guilty of first-degree murder in the August 2011 beating and strangulation death of his wife, Viola Drath. The German journalist was found dead in their row home in Washington D.C. Muth did not attend the trial in D.C. Superior Court after . doctors said his intermittent bouts of self-imposed starvation made him too weak to . appear. Instead, he participated by video link but did not testify. Muth, who prosecutors say was motivated by inheritance money, faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced in March. He had claimed that his elderly wife died from a fall in the bathroom, but authorities said her injuries were not consistent with someone who had fallen. The killing captivated Washington . because of Drath's longtime connections to the city's diplomatic and . social circuits, and due to revelations in the couple's unconventional . relationship. Jurors heard about how he masqueraded as a brigadier general in the Iraqi army, strolling around his neighborhood in a uniform he purchased. He also displayed a store-bought military certificate in his home even though he didn't actually have a military background. Muth's lawyers argued that no physical evidence connected him to the killing and said the case against their client was circumstantial. Muth denied guilt, blaming her death on an Iranian hit job. Victim: German journalist and socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled in the couple's D.C. home. Prosecutors said that her much-younger husband had sought inheritance money . Prosecutors cited a pattern of verbal and physical abuse toward his wife, including a conviction for assaulting her in 1992. hey said Muth, who lived on a $2,000 monthly allowance from Drath that had recently been reduced by $200, was motivated by money and made a bogus claim to a portion of her estate. Drath was a playwright and columnist who wrote often on German affairs for publications including The Washington Times and Handelsblatt, a German newspaper. In 1990, following the death of her first husband, she married Muth, who was nearly a half-century younger. The couple lived together in a row home in Georgetown, where they routinely organized dinner parties for dignitaries and other guests. Muth also became romantically entangled for several years with a man who eventually sought a restraining order against him in 2004. On the morning of August 12, 2011, following a night of heavy drinking, Muth called police to report finding his wife dead inside a third-floor bathroom of their home. Disinherited: Drath, pictured, had written her much younger husband out of her will . Crime scene: The investigation began after Muth reported finding Drath's body in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington. He claimed she had fallen but police later ruled it a homicide . He said she had fallen, and investigators initially treated the death as one of natural causes. But the medical examiner's office concluded within days that it was a homicide. At trial, prosecutors presented graphic . crime scene photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom floor . with what one expert described as a large, bloody gash on her neck and . another wound on the back of her neck. Detectives settled on Muth as the suspect after finding no signs of forced entry. They determined only Muth and his wife were home at the time of her death. They also said he presented Drath's daughter with a phony amendment to her will, even though Drath specifically left him out of it. A forensic investigator said Muth appeared anxious and . fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take . photographs and inspect the body. She said he seemed especially curious . to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could . explain it. After killing Drath, prosecutors said Muth searched the Internet for information about extradition arrangements with Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border. One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had pressured her mother for money and insisted he be able to keep furniture upon her death.","Albrecht Muth beat and strangled Viola Drath in their bathroom in August 2011 but told police that she must have fallen .

A Danish tourist was gang-raped near a popular shopping area in New Delhi after she stopped to ask for directions in the latest case to draw attention to the scourge of violence against women in India, police said today. The 51-year-old woman was also robbed and beaten in the attack, which happened yesterday afternoon or early evening near Connaught Place, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. The woman had lost her way and was trying to get back to her hotel, he said. She approached a group of men for directions, but they lured her to a secluded area where they raped her at knife-point over a three-hour period, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Indian policemen sit inside the police station which is investigating the gang-rape of a Danish tourist in Delhi . Investigation: An Indian policeman stands outside the police station. Officers are questioning several suspects but no arrests have been made . The woman managed to reach her hotel Tuesday evening and the owner called police. Police have arrested two men and detained two others in connection with the alleged attack - and revealed that one of the attackers swapped clothes with the victim. He put on her tracksuit bottoms and gave her his jeans to wear, which will provide vital DNA evidence, police said. The victim has now flown back to Denmark but was in such a state of exhaustion that she collapsed at the airport. 'When . she came, it was miserable,' said Amit Bahl, owner of the Amax Hotel in . the Paharganj area, which is popular with backpackers. The woman was crying and 'not in good shape,' he said. 'I am really ashamed that this happened,' said Bahl, who sounded shaken. The Danish Embassy had no comment. Enough is enough: Indian activists during a protest earlier this month against the gang rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in West Bengal days before a Danish tourist was allegedly gang-raped yesterday in Delhi . The problem of sexual violence in . India has gained widespread attention since the horrific gang rape and . murder of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in December 2012. Public . fury over the case has led to more stringent laws that doubled prison . terms for rape to 20 years and criminalized voyeurism and stalking. But . for many women, particularly the poor, daily indignities and abuse . continue unabated and the new laws have not made the streets any safer. Ranjana . Kumari, Director of India's Center for Social Research, said India's . conservative, patriarchal traditions lead men to use rape as a tool to . instill fear in women. 'This mindset is not changing,' she said. 'It's a huge challenge.' Uproar: The rape and murder of a woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012 sparked protests across the country with thousands of Indian women carrying placards calling for tougher rape laws . Experts say the rapid growth of India's cities and the yawning gulf between rich and poor are exacerbating the problem of sexual violence, with young men struggling to prove their traditional dominance in a changing world. Cultural stigmas, police apathy and judicial incompetence have long made it difficult for women to even report rapes. Still, there has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported recently, suggesting women are emboldened to speak up. Between January and October last year, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared with 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures. Foreigners also have been targets, including a Swiss woman who was cycling with her husband in central India when she was gang-raped. The cases threaten India's lucrative tourism industry. Last year, the Tourism Ministry launched an 'I Respect Women' campaign to reassure travelers. Tourism accounted for 6.6 per cent of India's GDP in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available. Fighting back: Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom has launched an app giving tips on how to fend off a sex attacker after she was forced to defend an assault from a rickshaw driver . The fear of sexual attack for women in India has become so prevalent it has inspired the country's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims. And the techniques are known to work... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker. Years before becoming a champion boxer, Mary Kom, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics representing her native India, had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver. Recalling her escape, she said: 'I remember I went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress. I was 18 years old and looked very ladylike. 'The rikshaw driver wanted to do bad things. We were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted.' But, re-enacting the powerful punches that left her attacker with a broken nose, Kom added: 'Boom, boom, boom... he was on the ground - finished.' Standing just 5ft 2in, Kom is a far from intimidating figure. But her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of India as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women. In partnership with mobile phone providers Vodafone, she has developed an app that will launch later this year, offering basic self-defence tips for women as well as advice and support. The app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker, with techniques that are simple for anyone to use: From punches and kicks, to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes. But the aim is not just to prepare women physically. Help at hand: Kom's app will demonstrate basic techniques from punches and kicks to scratching with nails . What Kom hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves, even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street. 'The app teaches basic things for people who have not done [boxing] before. If it is to hard for them, it will not interest them. 'Hopefully, if they are interested, they will continue to learn.' The techniques taught are basic. But they could mean the difference between life or death.Part of the problem is that India's women are continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens. It is a social prejudice Kom has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural Kangathei. 'When I was a little girl I was always playing fighting games. I was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me. 'People try to discourage what women do. I began my sports career to help my father financially but people say ""you are a girl, you can't do this"" or ""you are a woman you must do this"". I want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it, they can do it. 'I was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but I would not let it get to me.' The app is just part of Kom's attempts to help women through boxing, having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of Manipur. The club is funded by Vodafone and its new 'Firsts' programme, which supports and encourages first time experiences.

Sanah Younis could be scarred for life after suffering a severe reaction to a £10 temporary black henna tattoo . A mother fears her young daughter could be scarred for life after she suffered a severe reaction to a henna tatto while on holiday in Egypt. Sanah Younis, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, had the £10 temporary black henna tattoo on her forearm during a family break to Sharm El-Shikh over Christmas and New Year. Her mother Rehana Younis said she was told the tattoo was 'child-friendly' by the man selling it, but within days Sanah started to feel pain and her arm became inflamed. Doctors have told Mrs Younis her daughter's wounds may take years to heal. Mrs Younis, 31, said: 'When we were still on holiday it looked like Sanah just had sunburn on her arm but when we got home after the holiday it got more blistered. 'A few days later she went upstairs for a wash and I heard her screaming. I ran upstairs and she was in a lot of pain and crying. 'I rang the doctors and they said to take her to A&E. We went to hospital and the doctor knew what the reaction was straight away because she’d seen it before. 'The doctor has given us ointment which we are still putting on her arm but as far as I can see it’s not making any difference. The scar is still blistered and the pattern is still clear. Doctors have told Sanah's mother the wounds may take years to heal . 'They’ve told us to wait another week with the ointment and then to go to a specialist if there’s no change.' The mother-of-three is now warning other parents of the dangers. Henna is a natural plant extract which is often used without any ill effects to create temporary tattoos which are painted on to the body and fade away in under two weeks. But when henna, which is naturally red in colour, is mixed with black dye it can cause skin burns. It contains a chemical known as PPD which is known to cause severe allergic reactions. Some children are known to have been hospitalised after receiving the temporary tattoos and, in the most severe cases, sufferers can require plastic surgery. She said: 'The tattoos are offered everywhere and if you’ve got kids they keep asking. 'They’re offered on the beach, in hotels, everywhere. The man selling the tattoos told me it was child-friendly.' Black henna contains a chemical known as PPD which is known to cause severe allergic reactions. Sanah may also now have a lifelong sensitivity to hair dye. Mrs Younis said: 'We know now that these black henna tattoos contain the PPD chemical and people need to know they’re not safe and shouldn’t be used on children. 'She’s never had any allergies before but it was the PPD that did it.' She said Sanah was too ashamed to remove her cardigan in school fearing what the other children will say about the scars.

Mrs Bunyan, a widow, was said to be boarding a flight from her home in Spain last night. Friends have said the sixth-form sweethearts are believed to have been enjoying a five-star break on the island and there are fears  they could be at risk if they flaunt their wealth. But local police in Puerto Plata admitted yesterday they had no leads on the couple’s whereabouts and they could be ‘anywhere’. Officers said they were only alerted by the British Embassy yesterday morning and had not been contacted by police in the UK. They have contacted the major resorts in the area but have been unable to locate the young lovers. Staff at the £30,000-a-year Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, realised they were missing only when they failed to turn up for school register . Colonel Andres Perez Martinez said: ‘We are going to check the entire area in Puerto Plata. But if we can’t find them here we are going to expand the search across the country. 'We will not stop until we find them. All countries have bad areas and they have to be careful if they are wearing expensive jewellery or watches which might put them at risk from robbers. ‘But they should be safe as long as they are sensible. It is not especially dangerous here.’ The teenagers began their three-day adventure by fleeing their school at 3am on Monday morning before catching a taxi to Manchester Airport.

Police in India are hunting a man-eating tiger that is believed to have killed seven villagers in two weeks after escaping from an animal reserve. The tiger's latest victim was an unidentified woman who was found in a forest Tuesday in Uttar Pradesh, India yesterday. The female tiger is believed to be prowling over an area covering around 80 miles and is considered to be far more dangerous than others in the area due to a lack of hunting experience that forces the desperate cat to move closer to human occupation. Man-eater: Police in India are hunting a tiger which is believed to have killed seven people over two weeks . Rupak De, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in Uttar Pradesh, said of the latest attack: 'A hunt has been launched to kill the tigress that has turned into a man-eater... It must still be hungry as it has been running without rest and adequate food.' The tiger is believed to have strayed from the nearby Jim Corbett National Park . which covers an area of over 200 square miles and is is home to an . estimated 200 tigers. Forest officials have recruited two elephants in their efforts to track down the tiger which they hope to drive back towards the national park. Salim Luqmaan, a government official in Moradabad, a forested area dotted with villages where most the killings have happened, said: 'People are terrifiedâ€¦ They have been asked not to go near forest areas alone. Three hunters have been hired to kill the tigress.' Angry villagers have accused authorities of not acting quickly enough to capture the animal after the first death was reported at the end of last month. Anger: Residents of towns and villages all over Uttar Pradesh (pictured) have accused authorities of not acting quickly enough to capture the animal after the first death was reported at the end of last month . Moves are underway to have the animal categorised as a 'man-eater' meaning it can be legally killed. Wildlife activist and member of Parliament Meneka Gandhi has appealed to Uttar Pradesh's government not to shoot the tiger, however. In a letter to forest officials, she said the animal was only attacking people because it is hungry and would spare humans once it returns to its natural habitat. She said the Uttar Pradesh government should capture the tiger and release it in the neighboring state of Uttarakhand. India is home to some 1,700 tigers - half of the world's rapidly shrinking wild tiger population - but has been struggling to halt the big cat's decline in the face of poachers, international smuggling networks and loss of habitat. The country has seen its tiger population plummet from an estimated 40 000 upon independence in 1947.","Woman's body was found in a forest in Uttar Pradesh, India yesterday .

Cannons from a British warship which sank while on its way to put down an Irish rebellion have been uncovered by the recent storms after two centuries buried in sand. The two heavy iron guns have were hidden under the South Wales beach after a Navy troop ship was wrecked in a gale. However, the recent storms have removed around two feet of sand revealing the weapons for the first time since the days of Napoleon. Cannon find: The gun from a warship thought to have sunk off the Welsh coast in 1798 is held by Porthcawl museum chairman Paul Joseph . Find: The two cannons were discovered on the beach by dog walkers after storms removed two feet of sand at around the turn of the year . Spot: The cannons which had gone undiscovered for 200 years were found at Porthcawl, South Wales, shortly after the turn of the year . Two dog walkers spotted the tip of one of the cannons poking above the beach at the popular seaside resort of Porthcawl. Marine historians were called in and believe they were from a ship on its way to put down an Irish rebellion. Porthcawl museum chairman Paul Joseph said: 'It's an amazing find and but for the exceptional storms could have lain hidden there for another two centuries. 'We loaded the smallest three-foot long cannon onto a wheelbarrow to carry it to the local museum in the town centre. 'But it took 12 local lifeguards to lift the four-and-a-half foot cannon onto a trailer pulled by a quad bike.' Spotted: The cannons were found by dog walkers before they were passed over to the local museum . Restoration work: The cannons, being worked on here by archeologist Martin Little, are being kept in saltwater, then rainwater for several weeks before they will be treated with special chemicals to preserve them . Mr Joseph said the cannons could have come from a British vessel taking troops to Ireland in 1798 during a severe storm in the Bristol Channel. The British government sent thousands of troops to Ireland to crush a major uprising against them led by the United Irishmen Republican group. The French sent reinforcements to help the rebels - but never landed in Ireland after Atlantic storms forced them to retreat. The two cannons are being kept in saltwater, then rainwater for several weeks before they will be treated with special chemicals to preserve them. Mr Joseph added: 'The guns will be given pride of place in the museum and I'm sure will be a big attraction for visitors.'

The recent storms pummelled other beaches along the Welsh coastline uncovering a treasure trove of discoveries. They included the remnants of a 10,000-year-old forest at Newgale, Pembrokeshire, and an an 1810 bathhouse at Aberystwyth. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park heritage manager Phil Bennett said: 'The storms and high seas have scoured the sand exposing the remains of this woodland. 'We have been able to identify some recognisable timbers from the Mesolithic period about 11,600 years ago. 'This woodland area would have been visited by hunter gatherer bands from time to time. 'They would be looking for game and collecting edible plants, nuts and berries as they became available during the year.'","Two dog walkers spotted the tip of one of the cannons on the beach .

A report has found that of the 1.8m single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. Posed by models . Britain has more single parents than almost any country in Europe, and almost one in three of them are unemployed. A report has found that of the 1.8million single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work. This has led to a situation where the average single parent household in the UK claims twice as much in benefit support as the average two-parent household. The proportion of lone parent households in the UK is the fourth highest in the EU - behind only Estonia, Latvia and Ireland - with 24 per cent of of children being brought up by just one adult. The think tank Policy Exchange, which compiled the study, said the figures showed that if George Osborne wants to slash the welfare bill, he needs to target support at helping young, single parents find work. Author Matthew Tinsley said: ‘Raising a child is a huge responsibility regardless of your living arrangements. All parents - especially young single mothers - need support. ‘It is right that the government extended free childcare. However, it is also right to ask more from people to find a job. Simply relying on benefits when you are physically and mentally able to work is not fair. ‘Policymakers must do more to help the two thirds of a million unemployed single parents find a job. Such action would significantly boost the UK economy and help find further savings in the welfare budget.’ The report found that the level of unemployment among single partners can partly be attributed to when they had children. More than half (52 per cent) of lone mothers who had their first child as a teenager are not in work or looking for work, compared to 40 per cent who had their first aged 20 to 23. More than half (52 per cent) of lone mothers who had their first child as a teenager are not in work or looking for work, compared to 40 per cent who had their first aged 20 to 23.  Posed by models . Among those who have their first child in their early thirties, the unemployment rate is 19 per cent. However, there has been an increase in the number of single parents in work compared to the 1990s, partly due to employment support and stronger job search requirements introduced by the previous government, and the increase in part-time work. The most common age single parents had their first child is 20 compared to couples who are together who most often had their first child at 30. While the number of teenage pregnancies has fallen by a third between 1998 and 2011, the UK still has one of the highest rates in the developing world.","Of the 1.8million single parent households in Britain, 650,000 of them are not in any sort of work .

Taking it on the chin: Volker Beckers (pictured), 49, faces questions over his role as a director of Scaris Limited. The Maltese-based firm was used to funnel money between npower and its German owner RWE . A top businessman who helped the German owners of Npower avoid paying millions of pounds of tax is now advising HM Revenue and Customs, it has emerged. Volker Beckers, the former boss of the energy giant, oversaw the transfer of money through a Maltese company which saved RWE from paying corporation tax in the UK. The loophole has since been closed, but questions have been raised over the suitability of Mr Beckers to sit on the HMRC given his role in helping RWE with tax avoidance at a time when energy bills have been soaring. Official figures released last year showed that the amount of tax lost through non-payment and avoidance increased in 2012 to £35bn. Between 2008 and 2012, Mr Beckers, 49, was a director of Scaris Limited, which was run on a tiny budget out of an office in Malta and was used to divert billions of pounds from RWE, Npower's German owner, to the UK company. This meant that Scaris, which only had one employee earning less than £10,000 a year, made £885 million over four years on which it would only be required to pay as little as 5 per cent in the tax haven. Although the scheme was legal, it is estimated that it saved RWE from paying millions of pounds of tax and has led to criticism of Mr Becker's role advising HMRC. He was appointed as a Government adviser at the start of last year, weeks after resigning as the chief executive of npower with an £850,000 payoff. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committe, told the Mirror: 'If Mr Beckers has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, there is no way he should be advising the organisation whose job it is to maximise the tax collected.' Raising questions: Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP, said 'there is no way' Volker Beckers should be advising the HMRC if he has been involved in 'aggressive tax avoidance' Richard Murphy of Tax Research echoed Mrs Hodge's comments. 'He is a German national who has been a director of a company that has clearly been involved with tax avoidance. 'How this qualifies him to supervise our national tax authority is hard to explain.' A spokesman for RWE npower argued that the reason they paid 'little or no UK corporation tax' was because of the investment RWE had made in the UK. 'It is Government policy to use tax reliefs to incentivise investment and it is saddening to be criticised for investing in secure and lower carbon energy that is desperately needed in this country,' he said. 'RWE npower does not engage in tax avoidance – borrowing money to fund investment in vital assets in the UK is not tax avoidance. 'The fact that we borrowed from Malta made no difference to our UK corporation tax.' A spokesman for HMRC said that 'rigorous vetting' would have been carried out before Mr Beckers was appointed and that any conflicts of interest would have been checked. 'Non-Executive Directors bring valuable external and commercial experience to HMRC,' he said. 'However, they are not responsible for the day-to-day management of HMRC, nor are they responsible for tax policy or for handling confidential individual or corporate taxpayer issues.'","Volker Beckers, ex-boss of npower, was director of Scaris Limited between 2008 and 2012 .

Rio Smedley was brutally murdered in April 2012 by his mother's partner Daniel Rigby . Social workers 'missed opportunities' to help a two-year-old boy who was beaten to death by his mother's partner, a serious case review has found. Rio Smedley was brutally murdered in April 2012 by Daniel Rigby, who had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting the child's pregnant mother Kirsty Smedley just a few weeks earlier - a case which was later dropped. A trial at Manchester Crown Court heard how Rio had 91 separate injuries on his body and died from a ruptured liver. The report said the child, who was known to social services, had lived in a home which lacked basic food, warmth, safety and material goods, but child protection workers had never fully resolved concerns over his mother’s ability to care for him. A fire had also previously broken out at the family home while Rio was in the care of ‘unacceptably young’ babysitters. Meanwhile the police dropped the assault case against Rigby after Smedley said she did not wish to press charges, meaning he was free to resume contact with the family. The serious case review found social workers, who had repeated contact with the family over a number of years, kept closing their case files ‘prematurely’ because Rio’s mother showed little interest in engaging with them. The report, which ultimately found that Rio's death was not 'predictable or preventable' has now issued 26 recommendations to agencies including Bolton council, the NHS and the police, mostly around their handling of domestic abuse cases. Rigby, of Tyldesley, Wigan, was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 17 years in November 2012 for the horrific attack, carried out while Smedley was out buying him cannabis. Daniel Rigby (right) was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 17 years for the horrific attack, while Kirsty Smedley (left) was jailed for four years for causing or allowing the death of a child . Smedley claimed Rio had fallen down the stairs at their home on in Breighmet, Bolton, but a trial heard his injuries - enough to ‘split his liver in two’ - could not have been caused by a fall. Smedley was jailed for four years for causing or allowing the death of a child. A court heard she had become pregnant a total of seven times by a number of different men and was said to have 'an irresponsible view of obligations of a mother'. When Rio was six months old a fire broke out at the house after he was left in the care of very young babysitters. The family house was also regularly the subject of complaints of anti-social behaviour. Tragedy struck after Smedley had a fling with Rigby during which he headbutted her across the face and called a 'fat s***' . He was arrested and banned from contacting Smedley, but she later dropped the charges against him. The report said Rio, who was known to social services, had lived in a home which lacked basic food, warmth, safety and material goods, but child protection workers had never fully resolved concerns over his mother's ability to care for him . Two days later Rio was taken to hospital following a 999 call falsely claiming he had fallen down the stairs. The youngster died shortly afterwards with doctors concluding he had been viciously beaten. Bolton Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review which concluded there were 'missed opportunities' in the case but Rio’s death could not have been prevented. Smedley claimed Rio had fallen down the stairs at their home, but a trial heard his injuries - enough to 'split his liver in two' - could not have been caused by a fall . The review found social workers should look more closely at family history when considering cases and review how they handle those in which domestic abuse could be a factor. Mike Tarver, chair of Bolton safeguarding children board, said it ‘welcomed’ the recommendations and said the board had developed an action plan. Margaret Asquith, director of adult and children’s services at Bolton council, added: 'We wish first of all to send our sincere sympathies to the family involved in this case. 'The serious case review found that the death could not have been predicted or prevented, but made recommendations to further improve practice and develop services. We have already taken steps to implement the recommendations to improve where we can, safeguarding of children in Bolton.' A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission is due to be published shortly. Chief Superintendent Vanessa Jardine, head of Greater Manchester Police’s Public Protection Division, said: 'This young child's death was a tragedy and the family has suffered and continues to suffer immeasurably. Our thoughts and sympathies remain with them. 'We have fully supported the Bolton Child Safeguarding Board's Serious Case Review, which has comprehensively examined the involvement of all agencies in this case. 'The review concluded that the tragic death of this young child could not have been predicted or prevented, but did make a number of recommendations about enhancements to current GMP working practices surrounding dealing with domestic abuse cases. We have noted these findings and the recommendations made are now being implemented. 'In 2012 the Force introduced a new Public Protection Division, providing teams of highly skilled and experienced officers who are dedicated to investigating crimes against vulnerable people, targeting offenders and supporting victims. 'The aim of this new division is to improve the way we deal with the most vulnerable members of our community, as well as providing improved support to our staff and liaising more closely with other agencies to deal with these cases effectively.' Rio Smedley was murdered in April 2012 by his mother's partner Daniel Rigby after she left him in his care at her home in Bolton. The fatal blow was delivered to the youngster's stomach and split his liver in two after his mother Kirsty Smedley left to get cash to buy cannabis for her boyfriend. Rigby was sentenced to life in November 2012 and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years after he was found guilty of the murder on April 22. Smedley was jailed for four years in December 2012 after she was convicted the previous month of allowing his death. The court heard she knew her son had received two nasty injuries to his backside and head the day before when Rigby was looking after him. The injuries were inflicted in the space of three hours and included significant bruising to both his feet caused by stamping. Smedley who has already been pregnant seven times was castigated by the judge for having 'an irresponsible view of obligations of a mother' after he heard how she put her love life first. Sentencing her, Mr Justice MacKay said the jury’s verdict meant they were sure she knew or ought to have known there was a significant risk of serious harm to her son. Rigby had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting Rio’s pregnant mum Kirsty Smedley just a few weeks earlier - but the case was dropped. Today Bolton Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review which concluded social workers 'missed opportunities' in the case but Rio’s death could not have been prevented. The review has issued 26 recommendations to agencies including Bolton council, the NHS and the police, mostly around their handling of domestic abuse cases. It found social workers, who had repeated contact with the family over a number of years, kept closing their case files ‘prematurely’ because Rio’s mother showed little interest in engaging with them. It says Rio’s home lacked basic food, warmth, safety and material goods, but child protection workers had never fully resolved concerns over his mum’s ability to care for him.","Rio Smedley was brutally murdered by his mother's partner Daniel Rigby .

A junior doctor was laughed at by a senior colleague when she suggested a consultant should examine a four-year-old girl who died hours later, an inquest has heard. Freya Wells died after she was administered antibiotics orally to treat a severe infection, the hearing was told. But when junior doctor Hilary Towse repeatedly raised her concerns about the treatment she claims she was made to feel 'ridiculous' and 'laughed' at by a senior doctor. Junior doctor Hilary Towse (right) repeatedly raised concerns about the treatment given to Freya Wells (left) Freya Wells, 4, died at Kingston Hospital in Surrey (pictured) from a severe infection after doctors failed to give her antibiotics by the correct method, a hearing was told . Freya had been vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea for around three days when she was admitted to Kingston hospital in south west London after her condition did not improve following a visit to a GP, the inquest heard. When she arrived at the hospital on November 21st, 2012, she had an infection and was also suffering from breathing difficulties. She was quickly transferred to the paediatric Sunshine Ward. West London Coroner’s Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment. Fatal mistake: The inquest heard that other medics felt the antibiotics should have been administered intravenously not orally . Doctor Towse told the inquest that she thought the four-year-old should have been receiving intravenous antibiotics. She said that around 1am the following morning when she saw Dr Ibrahim she again expressed her concerns. Dr Towse said: 'I specifically said that she needed to have a bolus [fluids straight into the blood]. 'I specifically said that she needed to have IV antibiotics, and I specifically said that I thought she needed intensive care.' However, she added: 'She (Dr Ibrahim) seemed to be able at each point to give a reason.' Breaking down in tears, Dr Towse added: 'She thought that what I was saying was ridiculous - I recall that she laughed.' The court heard that the response Dr Towse received led her to believe that perhaps she was 'over-reacting' but also that her senior was 'under-reacting'. Dr Towse continued: 'I felt I was repeatedly raising my concerns about what I thought was going on and she, to me, would acknowledge it and take it on board, but didn’t agree.' When Freya’s condition deteriorated later that night and Dr Towse could not initially reach Dr Ibrahim, she considered contacting a consultant, but was eventually able to get through to the doctor. Dr Towse was asked by Shaheen Raham, . representing Dr Ibrahim, why she had not called for a consultant herself . if she was so worried. She . replied: 'It will always be something I regret for the rest of my life - . it would never normally be the role of the SHO [senior house officer] . to do that. 'But . I had some experience where I had been entirely appropriate to speak to . consultants, but they had not listened to me because I was an SHO.' The . inquest heard that after Freya’s vomit became 'coffee coloured' Dr . Towse took it upon herself to deliver intravenous antibiotics, but was . part-way through the procedure when Dr Ibrahim returned from a crash . call elsewhere in the hospital and inserted the line herself. The inquest heard that Freya died the following morning at 5.45am after suffering from septic shock. Assistant . coroner Dr Sean Cummings told Dr Ibrahim that many clinicians have . given evidence that they asked her about the antibiotics. West London Coroner's Court heard that in A&E, Registrar Rosita Ibrahim prescribed Freya oral antibiotics, but that her junior colleague and nurses did not agree with that course of treatment . 'There seems to have been a great concern that Freya should have been given IV antibiotics,' he said. 'Everybody seems to be clear that you decided that wasn't going to be the case.' Dr Ibrahim, who first saw the girl at 10pm the previous evening, told the court that, despite Freya's high heart and respiratory rates, she followed guidelines which stated that children suffering from severe pneumonia should be given oral antibiotics to reduce their discomfort. But she said it was planned for the next dose of antibiotics - due at 7am - to be given by IV. 'I realise now it should not have been the case,' she said. 'She should have received intravenous antibiotics right after her vomit in A&E.' Dr Ibrahim accepted Mr Baker's assertion that it should have taken 'a matter of minutes' to see that Freya was seriously ill. 'I just simply did not appreciate how unwell Freya was,' she added. Dr Ibrahim insisted that she had 'no recollection' of laughing 'at anything' on that night, and told the inquest that, from her memory, the only staff member who came to her with concern was Dr Towse. 'I have been over that evening so many times in my head and I cannot recollect multiple people coming up to me and telling me how concerned they are,' she said. 'It is my normal practice to listen to nurses. They are very experienced. If they are concerned then I take it on board.' She added: 'Had I known that the nurses were very worried about her I would have just called the consultant straight away.' The inquest was adjourned until 10am tomorrow, when the final evidence is expected to be heard.","Tragic Freya Wells died at Kingston Hospital from a severe infection .

Twenty years of bungled dentistry have left a man with crowns held in place by superglue, rotting teeth and a lifelong fear of having his mouth touched by medics. Botched: Jonathan Anderson was left with a mouth of infected teeth and shoddy implants . So bad was the damage, a dentist who examined marketing manager Jonathan Anderson's mouth described it as looking as if 'a bomb had gone off.' Mr Anderson, 38, from Dorset, first had surgery at the age of 18 to remove his wisdom teeth but was left with infected gums after a dentist snapped his teeth off at the root instead of extracting them. Five years later, his front teeth were knocked out after a windsurfing accident but surgeons botched the repairs leaving him with 'tombstone-like' front teeth in a different shade from his remaining molars. Mr Anderson, a marketing manager, chose to have his operations done privately in an attempt to ensure a perfect result but was left horrified by the damage. 'When you go to someone who's a professional dentist, private, and they're charging an awful lot of money for it, you don't doubt them,' he confessed. 'I looked in the mirror [after the operation], expecting you . wouldn't be able to tell it was implanted teeth, and I was like: ""you . got the colour completely wrong!""' But Mr Anderson's problems didn't end . there. Thanks to the infection caused by the botched wisdom tooth . operation, more teeth were rotting and dentists told him that the only . way to repair the damage was by giving him crowns. Miserable: Despite paying £8,000, he was given crowns so shoddy he had to use glue to keep them in . Infection: An operation to remove wisdom teeth left him with infected molars and gums . Once again the procedure was bungled and his crowns fell out less than 24 hours after they were inserted. Shockingly, when he complained to the dentist, Mr Anderson was told to stick them back in himself using superglue. Thanks to years of shoddy treatments, the marketing manager was left low on confidence and embarrassed by his gappy smile. Even his wedding day in 2012 was marred by his lack of teeth with Mr Anderson forced to keep his mouth closed all day in case one of the crowns fell out. Fearful: Thanks to his experiences, Mr Anderson has been left terrified of visiting the dentist . Improved: Mr Anderson has since had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants . 'I had the tooth super-glued in for the wedding but it meant I could only manage a close-mouthed smile,' he reveals. Wife Leanne adds: 'When I first met him, he had a bright, . beaming smile, but now, even when he is happy, he doesn't show it. 'In . his mind, he feels he's grotesque, and I'd like him to be back how he was . when he first met him.' But restoring his old smile means facing up to the prospect of 12 hours in the dentists' chair - not something Mr Anderson is entirely comfortable with. During an appearance on Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, he said: 'It's a scary thought having more dental . work done but it's a worse thought to have teeth like this and suppressing my smile for the rest of my life.' Since then, Mr Anderson has faced his fears and had all of his teeth removed and replaced with correctly fitted implants, but says he remains angry that despite spending £8,000 on dentistry, he was left disfigured. He is, however, relieved and happy to finally have his smile back. 'The confidence is back,' he reveals. 'Leanne loves how much I can now smile at her. It's awesome, absolutely awesome!'

'We are trying to win and if we can win with more goals, it is better, but it is very important to do a very balanced game.’ Asked about the problems caused by set-pieces in his side’s defeat at Cardiff at the start of the season, Pellegrini said: ‘We always prepare for set-pieces. In every match, not only in our match, it is very important every week for all the teams. We will try tomorrow to concentrate a lot and not allow them to have an advantage at set-pieces. ‘It is great that Alvaro Negredo, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero are all in a great moment. Of course, it is better for the manager to have different choices to select.

When we lost against Cardiff and after when we lost against Aston Villa, we were playing in the right way and we will continue playing exactly the same because you can lose the match but I think we didn’t play bad those games.

On Carmen Hesketh’s big day, she wanted to be walked down the aisle by her best friend – her dog Ruby. And so the Jack Russell terrier accompanied the 29-year-old and her father as he gave her away, before leading the bride and groom out of the church. But now Miss Hesketh has been left heartbroken after her much-loved pet ran off during a walk and has been missing for ten days. She fears the six-year-old terrier, with her since she was an eight-week-old pup, and the pet’s daughter Robyn, two, which is also missing, may have been snatched by thieves. ‘My dogs come everywhere with me and I am heartbroken they are gone,’ said Miss Hesketh, from Elmdon, Essex. ‘Ruby has been my loyal best friend for the past six years. ‘When I got married in the summer, Ruby, along with my dad, walked me down the aisle. ‘She was brilliant on our wedding day, you would have thought she had trained for months for the part.

Claims: The Labour leader insisted people's expectations of well-paid jobs, decent pensions and home ownership had been 'undermined' Ed Miliband’s claim that he would be the champion of the middle classes if he won power was yesterday dismissed by critics who warned his plans would squeeze struggling families still further. Mr Miliband said the ‘promise of Britain’ would be restored by a Labour government that would boost the aspirations of a social class who had been let down for years. He insisted people’s expectations of well-paid jobs, decent pensions and home ownership had been ‘undermined’. His remarks were seen as an attempt to broaden Labour’s narrow focus on the cost of living, and address the perception that the party is chiefly concerned about the prospects of low-income households. But last night there were few indications of how Mr Miliband intends to fulfil his claim – or any acknowledgement that the last Labour government squeezed the  middle class with more than 150  stealth tax rises. Critics said his support for higher  property taxes and environmental levies would hit many families further. Mr Miliband, in an article for the Daily Telegraph, said he would produce specific policies to deliver higher living standards, with some expected in a speech on the economy later this week. ‘Under David Cameron, life is getting tougher still,’ he wrote. ‘Our country cannot succeed and become collectively better off unless Britain has a strong and vibrant middle class. Indeed, the greatest challenge for our generation is how to tackle a crisis in living standards that has now become a crisis of confidence for middle-class families.’ On welfare, Mr Miliband said he wanted to ensure that ‘the social security system rewards work and contribution’ – which suggests Labour is still examining proposals to make benefits more generous for those who have paid taxes for a longer period. Response: Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said the only way to ensure a financial stable future is 'to stick to David Cameron's long-term economic plan' Tories said this would add billions to . the welfare bill. A Treasury source said: ‘They oppose every single . welfare cut and their new idea seems to be to spend more on welfare. The . alternative would  be to cut benefits elsewhere in the system, which . their party wouldn’t support.’ Future: Treasury Minister David Gauke said the important thing was having plans in place for long-term growth . Shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said Labour could not put a figure on how many people were ‘in the middle’, but added: ‘You’re talking about millions of families who are feeling deeply insecure now, who perhaps historically felt fairly secure.’ He said measures would include  making banks lend more to small businesses and families. But Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, said: ‘The only way to ensure a better and more financially secure future for hard-working people and for their children is to stick to David Cameron’s long-term economic plan. ‘But Ed Miliband has no plan. He has opposed every difficult decision we have taken to start turning our economy around. All he offers is more of the same old Labour policy that got us into a mess in the first place – more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.’ Treasury minister David Gauke said: ‘The important thing is that we have the conditions for long-term growth. That means making sure that we’ve got a competitive economy, good infrastructure, a competitive tax system and so on.’ Adam Memon, of the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, said: ‘Taxes and inflation are two of the key issues facing the middle class. Proclaiming himself the saviour of the middle classes, he mentions jobs, housing, pensions and university education – in fact, anything but the two key issues affecting the middle class in the past five years.’ Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK considers the assertions made by  Ed Miliband in the Daily Telegraph. Cost of Living . CLAIM: The middle class is being squeezed by a cost-of-living crisis as never before. REALITY: The timing of Mr Miliband’s intervention was unfortunate. Yesterday inflation fell to two per cent, hitting the Bank of England’s target for the first time in four years. Wages are predicted to grow 2.5 per cent this year, meaning the cost of living should now begin to fall. Anxiety of the middle classes . CLAIM: So many families feel a gnawing anxiety about what the future holds. Millions never dreamt that life would be such a struggle. REALITY: While he correctly identifies with concerns, Mr Miliband’s timing was again poor. Yesterday a poll in the Guardian found 52 per cent of voters are now confident about their financial position and ‘ability to keep up with the cost of living’ – the highest since October 2010. Impact: Critics said Mr Miliband's support for higher property taxes and environmental levies would hit many families further . University students . CLAIM: University tuition fees have trebled but even graduates often cannot find decent jobs. REALITY: On Monday, a survey of 100 big employers found there will be a 9 per cent rise in graduate recruitment this year – about 1,400 extra jobs. A grim retirement . CLAIM: Middle-income earners in their thirties and forties already know their pension entitlements are set to be less than those of the previous generation. REALITY: Indisputably true, but what Mr Miliband fails to mention is that Labour is to blame. In 1997, Gordon Brown abolished the Dividend Tax Credit paid to pension funds and companies. It has been estimated this cost pension funds up to £150billion. Home ownership . CLAIM: The dream of home ownership seems more distant than at any time since the war: it now takes 22 years for an average earner to save a deposit for a first home, compared with just three years at the end of the last century. REALITY: Under Labour, average prices rocketed from £68,085 in 1997 to £167,207 in 2010. The Coalition says its Help to Buy scheme has already enabled 26,000 families to purchase homes. Low-paid jobs . CLAIM: In the past three years, half of new jobs have been in low-pay industries and the average worker is now £1,600 worse off than before the election. REALITY: Mr Miliband ignores the fact that wages are now rising at their fastest rate for six years, according to figures. Where the blame lies . CLAIM: Our programme is rooted in an understanding that this crisis began before the Tory-led government came to power. REALITY: This is the only time in the 900-word article when he even hints Labour might be to blame for the economic crisis. But he avoids directly mentioning the ruinous levels of spending and debt under the last government. And what he didn’t say... The Labour government clobbered the middle classes like never before with repeated stealth taxes. Council Tax doubled; the rate of fuel duty was raised 12 times; National Insurance rose by £572 per family in real terms; and between 1997 and 2010, an extra 900,000 people were dragged into paying the top rate of tax (a trend that has continued under the Coalition).","Opposition leader said the 'promise of Britain' would be restored .

Official guidelines from 1999 state that the fines should not be aimed at those using pavements out of ‘fear of traffic’, provided they show consideration for pedestrians. Cyclists should not be fined for mounting the pavement to avoid dangerous stretches of road, minister for cycling Robert Goodwill has said (stock picture) It also states that discretion is needed because ‘children and young people’ are often scared to cycle on roads. Mr Goodwill’s warning came after complaints from cycling campaigners that £50 fines were being made over-zealously by police. Donnachadh McCarthy, of Stop Killing Cyclists, said some officers had told him they had been advised to ignore guidance and issue fines ever time cyclists were spotted on the pavement. Mr Goodwill's warning came after complaints from cycling campaigners that £50 fines were being made over-zealously by police . In a letter to Mr McCarthy, the minister said: ‘Thank you for bringing the issue of cycling on the pavement around dangerous junctions such as Vauxhall Cross to my attention. 'I agree that the police should be using discretion in enforcing this law and would support Paul Boateng’s original guidance.’ Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, the national policing spokesman for cycling, said: ‘The ministerial guidance supports the importance of police discretion in taking a reasonable and proportionate approach with safety being a guiding principle.’","Robert Goodwill urged police to allow cyclists on to pavement on dangerous stretches of road .

A Coronation Street actress who is seen in the soap taking a cocktail of drugs to kill herself after being diagnosed with a terminal illness has said that assisted suicide should be legalised. Julie Hesmondhalgh, 43, plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from incurable pancreatic cancer and decides to end her life to stop the pain. Viewers will see her drink a cocktail of drugs before dying in the arms of her weeping husband Roy, who did not want her to give up her fight against the illness. Scroll down for video . Actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, seen here playing Hayley Cropper alongside her husband, Roy, in Coronation Street, has spoken out in favour of legalising assisted suicide . Hayley, who has been in the programme since 1998, will use a cocktail of drugs to kill herself . The controversial episode will be aired on ITV next week after a series of high-profile so called right to die cases have gone before the courts. Locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson asked the courts for permission to end his own life with a doctor's help. The 58-year-old was left paralysed from the neck down and unable to speak after having a major stroke. Unlike Julie Hesmondhalgh's on-screen character, he was unable to commit suicide unassisted because of his disabilities. He died from ill health last year after the High Court ruled doctors could not help him kill himself - although his case will still go before the Supreme Court so they can rule on the issue. Mrs Hesmondhalgh – a member of the Humanist . Association, which supports assisted suicides – said she could not . imagine how anyone dealing with such an illness in either themselves or a . family member could be against the right to die. Emotional scenes: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, silently looks out of the flat window holding her husband Roy Cropper's hand before she takes her own life in a controversial episode of Coronation Street to be aired next week . She said: ‘I would like to see it . legalised, very much so. But I have to put the caveat that it has to be . properly done; you have to make sure that people don’t go around killing . elderly people, say, just for the inheritance. ‘But I can’t imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson case and see his suffering and be against it,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It’s quite a simple thing for me – and I understand it isn’t for everybody – but we need to look at this issue seriously.' Official guidance was published which said people who help loved ones end their lives may escape prosecution even if they benefit financially from the death. Cancer battle: Viewers have seen Hayley Cropper (right) struggling to get out of bed as she battles with pancreatic cancer . The rules, set out by the Director for Public Prosecutions, make clear that anyone acting out of 'compassion' is unlikely to face court action. Mrs Hesmondhalgh said there was an ‘almost holy atmosphere’ as she filmed her controversial last scene. The star, who joined Coronation Street in 1998 to play the soap’s first transsexual, won the hearts of viewers with her on-screen romance with cafe owner Roy. Away from the screen, she is married to writer and actor Ian Kershaw, taking time off in 2001 to give birth to her daughter Martha Mo. She has now decided to leave for good to concentrate on theatre roles. Right to die: Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, is seen ending her own life in the controversial episode of Coronation Street which is due to air next week . The star's character, who is suffering from incurable cancer, will kill herself in Monday's episode . She told Radio Times that the scenes were not ‘beautiful’ and were ‘necessarily agonising, because of her steely determination to end her own life’. But she added that the storyline was ‘timely and appropriate’ and that ‘there are no easy answers’. ‘This is a conversation that needs to be had,’ she said. The . actress also said she had no problem being written out in such dramatic . fashion. ‘It would have been more convenient for me as an actor if I . could have come back later on if work wasn’t working out for me, but it . would have been a complete betrayal of everything that we’ve done . because they [Hayley and Roy] are the most steadfast and loyal and . loving couple... they just would not have separated for any other reason . apart from death.’ Keiran . Roberts, Coronation Street’s executive producer, said: ‘We’re not an . issue-based show but sometimes a story will highlight an issue and this . is such a case. ‘Pancreatic cancer is an illness . that people may not know a lot about and the right-to-die issue will . spark a debate, I’m sure, and that’s right and proper.’ The . storyline will reflect the split in opinion in the right-to-die debate . with Roy and Hayley’s friend Fiz Stape struggling to deal with Hayley’s . decision. The actress said: 'I can't imagine how anyone can look at the Tony Nicklinson (right) case [the paralysed stroke victim who lost a case in 2012 to end his life by assisted suicide] and see his  suffering and be against it' Coronation Street producer Stuart Blackburn said: ‘This is a very sensitive issue and we will be exploring the effects of her decision on husband Roy who has a huge emotional and moral dilemma over her choice to die this way. ‘Not everyone will feel Hayley’s decision is the right one and we fully respect this. ‘For that reason we will be exploring both sides of the debate on screen.’ The Samaritans have warned that the storyline could create copycat suicides among vulnerable viewers. The on-screen controversy comes as a YouGov survey found almost three quarters of those questioned supported a change to existing laws regarding assisted suicide.","Julie Hesmondhalgh plays Hayley Cropper who is suffering from cancer .

The allegation was made by the estranged husband of Fabregas's partner Daniella Semaan at a High Court hearing in London. A lawyer representing Elie Taktouk said police were investigating the sale of a property in London, where Mr Taktouk used to live with Ms Semaan. A High Court judge today said an allegation made by Elie Taktouk (right) that a company controlled by Spanish soccer star Cesc Fabregas (left, with Daniella Semaan) might be involved in a property fraud was a 'long shot' But Mr Justice Coleridge said Mr Taktouk had a history of 'lacking credibility', said he had heard evidence from estate agents about the property and added: 'It seems to me as if it is a long shot.' The judge was analysing the latest stage of a dispute over money between Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court. Mr Taktouk had been ordered to pay Ms Semaan a £1.4 million lump sum following the break-down of their marriage, said the judge. Ms Semaan is complaining that she is still owed nearly £1 million. The dispute is due to be fully aired at a hearing later this year. Mr Taktouk could be jailed if the judge rules against him.

A Manhattan cocktail party to celebrate SeaWorld's 50-year anniversary was cancelled tonight after animal rights activists threatened to protest the event that promised to include two live penguins. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) obtained an invitation to the Meatpacking District party which said 'animal ambassadors' Pete and Penny Penguin would be in attendance at eatery Bagatelle. PETA Senior Vice President Dan Mathews contacted the restaurant on Sunday to cancel the event. On Tuesday, the restaurant took a financial hit and cancelled the event altogether. Scroll down for video . Party animals: SeaWorld's Pete and Penny penguin were expected to make an appearance at a Manhattan cocktail party tonight to celebrate 50 years of SeaWorld. But after threats of protest from PETA, the event was cancelled . In his email to the restaurant, Mr Mathews wrote: 'Loud DJs and flashing cameras may be alluring to your usual clientele, but they are terrifying to these arctic animals unaccustomed to being around humans, much less to being forced to attend a desperate, raucous publicity stunt.' The restaurant's co-owner Remi Laba responded that they were 'very disturbed' to learn that SeaWorld planned to bring live animals to the event. They contacted SeaWorld's reps and informed them that the live penguins would not be allowed in the establishment and SeaWorld agreed. However, Mr Mathews said that they would continue to protest the event, since they were against any promotion of SeaWorld following the explosive documentary Blackfish which revealed controversial treatment of orca whales. Mr Laba went one step forward on Tuesday, cancelling the event altogether and doing 'what was right in our hearts'. He said the event was booked by a third party organization and they didn't know who the client was, let alone their plans to bring live animals. 'PETA is hanging up our protest placards and popping the champagne corks today in recognition of Bagatelle's savvy business decision to put kindness ahead of profits,' Mr Mathews said in a press release. 'Once compassionate people and businesses learn that orcas and other animals suffer at SeaWorld, they want nothing to do with this cruel and disgusting place.' Bagatelle is known for its wild weekend brunches, where patrons 'can be found dancing on tables, throwing back tequila shots and racking up four- and five-figure tabs well before the sky turns dark,' according to a 2009  New York Times article .

SeaWorld has been the focus of more criticism lately following the release of documentary Blackfish, which gives a damning account of the treatment of orcas at the parks. Dark side: SeaWorld drew criticism this year after the release of documentary Blackfish which detailed their treatment of orcas. Despite the film, the company is set to have its most profitable year ever . Since the documentary's release, nine musicals acts including Trace Adkins, Willie Nelson, Trisha Yearwood, Cheap Trick and the Bearnaked Ladies have cancelled performances at the parks.

Police in Philadelphia suspect that the pungent trail left by the Swiss cheese pervert has led them to the door of a man arrested twice in the past for exhibiting the same unusual fromage fetish. Sources at the Philadelphia Police Departmentâ€™s Special Victims Unit have indicated that Chris Pagano is the 'subject' of their investigation and added that is was 'possible' an arrest would be made after several women came forward to give statements believed to be about the Norristown resident. This comes as unearthed court documents and a mugshot from 2009 reveal that Pagano, 41, was arrested after he allegedly 'removed a large block of cheese from his pocket' and asked a woman on the street if it would be alright to give her '$20 to rub the Swiss cheese on his penis.' However, Pagano has denied that he is the man who has been driving around the Mayfair area of Philadelphia in recent weeks propositioning women to pleasure him with slices of cheese. Double arrest: This is Chris Pagano - who was arrested in 2006 (left) and 2009 (right) for allegedly propositioning women on the street to pleasure him with blocks of Swiss cheese. Pagano has been linked to Philadelphia's Swiss Cheese Pervert . At the time of his 2009 arrest, Pagano pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct but a solicitation charge against him was dismissed. A reporter from The Philadelphia Magazine traveled to Pagano's home on Wednesday morning to ask him if he was indeed the now infamous Swiss cheese pervert who has been terrorizing the Mayfair suburb of the city in recent weeks. Pictured by at least two victims, the fetishist has been described as an overweight man in his 40s who drives around in his car approaching women with his genitals exposed. According to his victims, he then dangles a large slice of Swiss cheese over his penis and offers to pay the women to perform sexual acts on him using the snack. Pagano, who is believed to be married, flatly denied being the Swiss cheese pervert, saying, 'I don't know what you're talking about. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sometimes people confuse me with somebody else.' However, the picture used by Pagano on his Facebook - which has now been set to private - and the pictured attached to an OkCupid profile message sent to a woman asking her to indulge his cheese craving are the same. More-so, mugshots have emerged of Pagano from arrests in 2006 and 2009 after separate incidents both involving cheese according to law enforcement sources who spoke to Philadelphia Magazine. Cheesy: The Mayfair Town Watch warned women of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert,' pictured, on its Facebook page Saturday . An affidavit of probable cause given to the Norristown Police Department outlines a report of attempted sexual assault. A woman - who is not being identified - said that she was approached by a man approximately just after midnight and asked if she would have sex with him. 'The male removed a large block of cheese from his pocket and told [Ms. Doe] that he would pay her $20 to rub the swiss cheese on his penis. '[Ms. Doe] became alarmed and fled on foot toward her residence. The male offered [Ms. Doe] more money as she fled the area.' In the affidavit the woman 'identified Christopher Pagano as the person that asked her to place cheese on his penis.' Going back three years to 2006, Pagano was again arrested and charged with solicitation and disorderly conduct according to the Philadelphia Magazine. The Norristown Police Department was unable to confirm that cheese was involved in this incident, however detective James Angelucci, who worked the 2006 and 2009 case said that he thought it was. 'I was working the 2006 detail as well,' said Angelucci. 'And I believe cheese was on the menu, but Iâ€™m not completely sure. If my memory serves me, it was Swiss.' The Mayfair Town Watch warned local ladies of the lurking man on its Facebook page Saturday, and Philadelphia Police Department has confirmed the Special Victims Unit is investigating the curious case after several women filed reports describing a man with a 'major sexual cheese fetish.' 'I understand that people may think this is funny, but this is no laughing matter,' Milt Martelack, the town watch's senior adviser, told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'We've had a couple individuals reach out to us. We're taking this matter very seriously, and we're working vigorously with police to get this guy off the streets.' The 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' is heavyset and white and drives a silver or black sedan. Victim: A woman tweeted this picture of the 'Swiss Cheese Pervert' with the comment 'I met this dude a few weeks ago' #creep . The bizarre case shocked many residents but Gabby Chest, from nearby Bridesburg, recognized the fetish straight away and made her own report to police. In July 2012, when she was just 19, she set up a profile on dating site OkCupid and within days had an inbox from a 'really strange guy' with a very specific request. 'He said he was looking for someone to perform masturbation on him with cheese,' Ms Chest told the Daily News. 'He kept saying how strong his urges were and how desperate he was to find someone to help him with them.' She added: 'There's no doubt it was him; it looked exactly like the picture on his profile. I was scared and shocked. I never thought the guys you see on those sites would be so close to me.' In the message, the man called 'Chris' explained he developed the fetish after struggling to find women and start relationships as a young man because he was overweight and always judged on his looks. 'So I developed this fetish to help me deal with my sexual urges,' he wrote. 'I found that women tend to like dairy products, and settled on cheese to represent the girl. thus I started having sex with cheese.' Another woman, commenting on a Phillymag.com story, shared an OKCupid message her sister received from 'Chris' some four years ago, which was even more shocking. 'I love the way Swiss cheese feels against my penis. Either as slices of Swiss cheese being wrapped around my penis or a chunk of Swiss cheese being rubbed against my penis,' he wrote. Swiss is best: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best,' 'Chris' wrote in an OKCupid message to a 19-year-old girl (stock photo) 'I love even more when a woman uses the Swiss cheese to pleasure me. Or simply wraps Swiss cheese slices around my penis and allows me to hang out with her as I wear the cheese.' He explained that he prefers having sex with cheese over traditional sex and jokes 'I am lucky I never became a rapist,' suggesting this was an alternative to his fromage infatuation. Chis went on: 'I tried many different kinds of cheese, like American, Provolone, chez whiz, jack, and cheddar, but settled on Swiss as the best. First and foremost, if ever a picture of cheese is used, most of the time they use a representation of Swiss cheese. But also because of it's eye patterns, texture, and the way it feels against my penis.' While he didn't offer Ms Chest cash in exchange for the sexual favor, so as not to suggest she was a prostitute, he did offer this young woman $50 if she'd pleasure him using his preferred method. He described in the expansive letter, however, that when he was younger he had far more stamina for cheese sex. 'I was able to wrap and wear a good 1 Â½ pounds of Swiss cheese against my penis, and wear the Swiss cheese for hours at a time, before I would climax from just having the Swiss cheese on my penis,' Chris wrote. But in a strange twist, he insists he doesn't like Swiss cheese, only mozzarella, and would never consumer the cheese he has used on himself. 'One last note, I do not like cheese, except for mozzarella, and that is the one cheese I have never used on myself,' he explained. 'So no I do not eat the cheese after I am done using it for pleasure, it is discarded. I am always asked that question.'","Police sources in Philadelphia have said that 41-year-old Chris Pagano is a 'subject' in their investigation of the city's now notorious 'Swiss Cheese Pervert'

Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who is leading the investigation, said he didn't find Christie's denials credible when so many of his close aides appeared to be involved. Christie, who was widely tipped to run for president in 2016, has denied any prior knowledge of an apparent plan to use lane closures on the bridge as payback against a mayor who failed to endorse his re-election.

Chris Christie, pictured on Thursday, denied he had any prior knowledge of the bridge plan . Mr Wisniewski  told NBC he found it hard to accept Christie knew nothing until the morning of the press conference he held on Thursday, when he said he had been 'stunned by the abject stupidity' of the plan. 'These people travel with him, these . people discuss things with him every single day.

Governor Christie is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a Democratic mayor . Mr Wisniewski says he plans to use that power to subpoena official and private emails, text messages and other documents from current and former aides, before calling them in 'one by one' to testify. Assembly speaker-elect Vincent Prieto, who will head the session on Thursday, told CNN the revelations 'clearly show the need for a continued thorough investigation'. 'Many questions remain unanswered about this threat to public safety and abuse of power,' he added. Christie's press secretary, Mike Drewniak, did not respond to NBC requests for comment. The Republican governor is still expected to visit Florida next week to help with Governor Rick Scott's re-election campaign. New Jersey residents also think Christie is lying about Bridgegate, and think he should quit a poll found. The poll, conducted on 800 likely voters after Christie’s press conference. by Rasmussen Reports, found that 54 per cent of the Garden State’s residents think he knew what was going on. Christie, left, with ex-Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly, right, who is believed to be involved in the scandal. She was fired by the Governor on Thursday . And 56 per cent said he should resign if it is proven that he approved of the tactic to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse Christie’s re-election, according to the poll released by the New York Post. Only 36 per cent believe Christie’s claim that he was unaware that a top aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington Bridge access lanes, the survey showed. The . survey also found that 71 per cent suspect that other political figures . who failed to back Christie had been targeted by the governor’s staff, according to the poll published by the New York Post.

Back to jail: Derryn Hinch will serve 50 days in jail for revealing the criminal history of Jill Meagher's killer . Outspoken broadcaster Derryn Hinch was today arrested and could face 50 days in jail after breaking a court order to publish details about Jill Meagher’s killer. The 69-year-old, known as the Human Headline, was found guilty of contempt of court in October and told he had 90 days to pay a $100,000 fine or be locked up. In an article published on his website today, Hinch wrote that he was opting to go to prison to send a message about the legal system. 'I am not paying the $100,000 fine on principle. Not because I cannot afford it… I am electing to go to jail for 50 days to protest against a court system which sees rapists and murderers let out on parole to rape and kill again,' he wrote. The veteran broadcaster, who will turn 70 while he is behind bars, was arrested at home in St Kilda, Victoria, this morning. Hinch revealed that Adrian Ernest Bayley was on parole at the time of Ms Meagher’s murder while his trial was taking place last April. Jill Meagher, a 29-year-old Irish woman, was raped and murdered while walking home from a pub in Brunswick, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, in September 2012. In the week following her disappearance, Adrian Ernest Bayley was arrested and led police to where he had buried Ms Meagher's body. He pleaded guilty to her rape and murder in April 2013. At Bayley's trial it was revealed that he has an extensive history of sexual violence and had been on parole at the time he murdered Ms Meagher. While sentencing Hinch last October, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Kaye said that publishing material that reflected adversely on Bayley’s character was a ‘serious infraction’. He added that it had interfered with the administration of justice by encouraging a 'trial by media.' Hinch has been convicted for contempt of court or related offences six times. He has spent his entire career campaigning against what he views as an overly lenient judiciary and the public’s right to know sensitive information about defendants. Hinch was convicted for publishing the criminal history of Adrian Ernest Bayley (right) while he was still on trial for the murder of Jill Meagher (left) He served 12 days in jail in 1987 for naming Michael Glennon as a paedophile priest while Glennon was awaiting trial. In 2011 he was sentenced to five months’ home detention for breaching court orders and naming two sex offenders at a public rally. In that case, Hinch avoided a prison sentence because he had received a liver transplant just two weeks before the sentence was handed down. Hinch says this is not a decision that he has taken lightly. 'It’s scary,' Hinch told the Herald Sun. 'For anyone going inside, it’s scary. Twelve days was scary. Fifty is going to be tough.' When he was fined in October, Justice Kaye said Hinch’s media campaigns could make him unpopular with some inmates. The broadcaster, who is worth $1.18million and earns $212,000 a year, wants to be put in maximum security prison, which he believes will be safer. 'If I get maximum security I’ll do 23 hours a day in isolation and one hour out in the exercise yard,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Right now, I feel good. I know I am doing the right thing. I am not scared for my safety,' he wrote on his website today. 'Although when a senior homicide squad member reassured me [that he would be safe in maximum security prison], I mentioned two words. One was ‘Carl’ and the other was ‘Williams’. He was in maximum security, under police protection and CCTV observation 24/7. And it didn’t save him.' Gangland boss Carl Williams was beaten to death by another inmate with the seat pole from an exercise bike in April 2010. Hinch, a former newspaper editor, quipped in his farewell article, 'I guess I’ll stay away from the exercise bikes.'","The 'Human Headline' arrested for breaching court suppression order .

Flying under the influence: Flight attendant Nancy Bray, 58, was arrested Tuesday trying to board a plane for work with three times the legal amount of alcohol in her system . A 58-year-old Delta flight attendant had three times the legal amount of alcohol in her system when she tried to board a flight this week for work. Nancy Bray was scheduled to work a flight from Blue Grass Airport to Detroit Tuesday when medics were called to help her after she got sick, according to court papers. Police arrested her when she registered a .258 blood alcohol level and they found prescription drugs on her not in their 'original container'. Bray's arrest delayed the flight by two hours. According to Kentucky state law, the maximum blood alcohol level is 0.04 per cent and crew members are not allowed to consume alcohol eight hours before a flight. They are not allowed to fly under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Following Bray's arrest, Delta issued a statement on the incident, saying they would cooperate with law enforcement's investigation. 'Delta expects consummate professionalism from all parties who are entrusted with the care of transport of our customers,' the company said. Passengers at the airport on Wednesday were shocked to hear about the flight attendant's arrest.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:17 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:17 EST, 16 January 2014 . Around 63 million £50 banknotes showing the first governor of the Bank of England, Sir John Houblon, are to be withdrawn from circulation . From April 30, the only legal £50 note will be that celebrating the business partnership of entrepreneur Matthew Boulton and engineer James Watt, who together helped forge the Industrial Revolution. The withdrawal of the Houblon note is part of a regular review to combat fraud. Historic: The note was introduced in 1994 and featured his house on the current site of the Bank of England . Businesses may choose to no longer accept the note, but it can still be exchanged at the central bank . The Boulton and Watt note, introduced in November 2011, is more secure because it features a new ‘motion thread’ – five windows showing the pound symbol and the number 50, which appear to move up and down when the note is tilted. The old-style notes are due to be withdrawn from circulation in 15 weeks. In total, about 224 million £50 notes worth £11.2 billion are in circulation, of which the Bank estimates 63 million with a total value of £3.2 billion are Houblon notes. From May onwards, retailers are unlikely to accept the Houblon notes as payment, but most banks and building societies will still allow customers to deposit them into their accounts. However, agreeing to exchange the notes after April 30 will be at the discretion of individual institutions. Momentous: Sir John was the founder of the Bank of England and lived in a house on the site in Threadneedle Street, City of London, where it now stands . Barclays, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Ulster Bank and the Post Office have agreed to exchange the older-style £50 notes for both customers and non-customers up to the value of £200 until October 30. In a video placed on YouTube, Victoria Cleland, head of notes division at the Bank, advises people: 'If you have any Houblon £50 notes, it's best to spend, deposit or exchange them before April 30.' If people do not pay in or exchange the Houblon £50 notes by the withdrawal deadline, this does not mean that the notes then become worthless. Composer: A £20 note bearing the image of Sir Edward Elgar, pictured, has already been withdrawn . All notes that have been issued by the Bank whose legal tender status has been withdrawn are covered by its 'promise to pay'. This phrase dates back to times when notes could be swapped for gold. It means that people can, at any time, obtain the face value of a note that has been withdrawn by exchanging it at the Bank of England in London. There is no fee for the service and banknotes of this type can be exchanged by post or in person. Legally the Bank of England is only required to give one month's notice of an intention to withdraw legal tender status. It gave a similar three-month notice period to its latest announcement when a £20 note featuring composer Edward Elgar was withdrawn in 2010. Sir John Houblon was appointed as the Bank's first governor in 1694 and the £50 banknote celebrating him was first issued in 1994, to coincide with the Bank's 300th anniversary. The design on the back of the note includes an image of Sir John's house in Threadneedle Street on the site of the Bank's present building. In December, the Bank announced that it plans to issue plastic banknotes for the first time from 2016, when a new £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill appears. A £10 note featuring Jane Austen to follow around a year later will also be made from polymer rather than the cotton paper currently used. The announcement at the end of last year followed a three-year research programme that concluded plastic notes stay cleaner for longer, are more difficult to counterfeit and are at least 2.5 times longer-lasting. Old-series notes previously issued by the Bank can be exchanged by posting them, at the sender's risk, to Dept NEX, Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, London EC2R 8AH.","1994 note showing Bank of England founder phased out to combat fraud .

Jeremy Middleton died after the van he was driving collided with the horsebox at Besthorpe, near Attleborough, Norfolk . A van driver who died after he crashed into a horsebox at speeds of up to 85mph had been texting moments before the smash, an inquest heard. Jeremy Middleton died after the van he was driving collided with the horsebox at Besthorpe, near Attleborough, Norfolk. A police road safety expert last night said he had committed two of the 'fatal four' sins that caused accidents - excessive speed and distraction. Mr Middleton, of Horsham St Faith, Norfolk, was driving a Citroen van on the Norwich-bound carriageway of the busy A11 when the crash happened at about 3.35pm on Sunday, June 30 last year. The 7.5-tonne Renault horsebox, which was driven by Scott Adcock and had two horses inside, was about 70m along the dual carriageway in the inside lane when the crash happened. PC Paul Cant, collision investigator, said the smash occurred near Attleborough Services petrol station, which Mr Adcock had just left. He said Mr Middleton sent a text from his mobile at 3.36pm, which was 'at or immediately prior' to the accident. PC Cant estimated the married man's speed at 80-85mph when he collided. He said: 'Mr Middleton was not braking at impact. The van was almost certainly out of Mr Adcock's view when he pulled out from the service area. 'Mr Adcock accelerated away in a safe manner. The horsebox was there to be seen by the van driver, who had the time and distance to avoid it. 'Why Mr Middleton failed to avoid it is unknown. The possible explanation is that his attention was on his mobile phone.' Witness Ian Shann, who was driving from Thetford to Norwich, said: 'There was a huge impact and debris flew everywhere. 'The van driver did not brake. He could have moved to the outside lane which was clear.' Mr Middleton was driving a Citroen van on the Norwich-bound carriageway of the busy A11 when the crash happened on Sunday, June 30, last year . Mr Adcock was returning to his home in Martham from a farm in Larling after entering his horses in a showjumping competition. His wife was beside him and two friends were in the back of the vehicle. Mr Adcock told the inquest: 'There is no slip road from that garage onto the A11.You are on a slope and I was going very slowly, as if something was coming. 'It is so sad and tragic that his life has been snatched away far too soon. He had so much more he wanted to give, do and see' - Jeremy Middleton's wife Steph . 'As I pulled out I straightened up and saw an MR2 car overtake me, then just a bang. I was hit with horrendous force from behind. I was accelerating away at about 30mph.' The assistant coroner for Norfolk, Yvonne Blake, concluded that Mr Middleton died after he suffered multiple injuries sustained in a road traffic collision. After the inquest, Insp Chris Brooks, of Norfolk and Suffolk's road policing and firearms operations unit, said: 'The fatal four behaviours are excessive speed, no seatbelt use, excess alcohol (drink driving) and distraction (using a mobile phone). 'The crash at Besthorpe featured two of the fatal four as the driver was travelling at excessive speed and using his phone while driving. 'We would urge all drivers to adhere to the speed limits and ignore the phone while driving.' Following the accident, Mr Middleton's family said he was an 'inspirational man' who was 'much admired and trusted by all those whose lives he touched'. He had trained thousands of people to enjoy the great outdoors through his Adventure Safety Training busines. His wife Steph, who he met in 2001 and married in 2006, said: 'I met Jez when we were both working for Norfolk Youth and Community Services and we had 12 wonderful years together. 'It is so sad and tragic that his life has been snatched away far too soon. He had so much more he wanted to give, do and see.' Mr Middleton loved taking part in activities like canoeing, kayaking, sailing, abseiling, hill walking and archery. He volunteered in his spare time, taking part in teaching and going on field trips with Norwich-based Eagle Canoe Club and 8th Sea Scouts. Mr Middleton, also an active member of the Lowland Search and Rescue Team, started teaching people in outdoor activities in 1998 while at Waveney Valley Canoe Club, where he was coach. He also worked for Norfolk Youth and Community Service at the Water Activities centre where he taught kayaking and canoeing.","Jeremy Middleton died following crash in Norfolk in June last year .

A Texas man faces felony charges after authorities say he routinely beat his 2-year-old step-daughter, and in one case last month beat her so badly that it caused the little girl to go blind. Additionally, the girl's mother, Nancy . Esmeralda Colomo-Gonzalez, also faces charges for allowing her husband to beat the girl and not reporting the alleged abuse to authorities. Authorities first learned of the alleged abuse on December 12, when Colomo-Gonzalez rushed her daughter, Yenitze Reyes, to the hospital with head injuries. Busted: Angel Martinez admitted to police that he routinely beat his 2-year-old step-daughter . During an examination of the girl, doctors discovered that she had suffered a skull fracture, hemorrhaging, non-accidental traumatic brain injury and had gone blind as a result of her injuries. Doctors also noticed that the girl had a broken arm that was beginning to heal, which indicated to those treating the girl that she had been abused in the past. Investigators began questioning the girl's step-father, 26-year-old Angel Martinez, who eventually admitted that he'd rocked 'the baby too hard' when he was trying to get her to fall asleep, according to court documents first obtained by Houston's KTRK. As the interview with investigators continued, Martinez admitted that he had shaken the baby in the past, including once in September, which caused the toddler to go into seizures and vomiting. Blind eye: Authorities say Nancy Colomo-Gonzalez knew her husband abused her daughter but did nothing to stop it . According to Martinez, Colomo-Gonzalez took the girl to the hospital but lied to doctors about what had happened. In another instance, Martinez told authorities that in October he grabbed the girl by her arm and swung her away from him, causing her arm to become swollen and red. Despite the apparent injury, nobody took the little girl to the hospital. As for the December 12 incident, Martinez told authorities that he wasn't sure how he'd injured the girl, but told investigators that he threw the girl into the air and didn't catch her on the way down. He says the girl then hit her head on a wooden chair causing swelling and a large lump on the back of her head. Martinez says he then panicked and tried to 'push the bump back into her head.' When that didn't work, the girl's mother drove her to the hospital. That's Martinez's version of events, anyway. Doctors say the girl's injuries aren't consistent with Martinez's story. According to the physicians who treated the girl, her injuries suggest that the girl had been slammed onto a hard surface. They also say that it appears as though someone must have pushed down on the girl's fractured skull, pushing bone fragments into her brain. Martinez has been charged with felony injury to a child.

Long shot: Semaan is involved in a financial dispute with her estranged husband Elie Taktouk (right) Main man: Barcelona star Cesc Fabregas was not at the hearing in London on Thursday . But Mr Justice Coleridge said Mr Taktouk had a history of 'lacking credibility', said he had heard evidence from estate agents about the property and added: 'It seems to me as if it is a long shot.' The judge was analysing the latest stage of a dispute over money between Mr Taktouk and Ms Semaan at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court. Mr Taktouk had been ordered to pay Ms Semaan a £1.4million lump sum following the break-down of their marriage, said the judge. Ms Semaan is complaining that she is still owed nearly £1m. The dispute is due to be fully aired at a hearing later this year. Mr Taktouk could be jailed if the judge rules against him.

Nidia Alvarado went willingly with police and according to an arrest affidavit told them she 'strangled the baby and watched him die' shortly after giving birth at a hospital under an assumed name. When asked why she killed the child, whose body was found on a recycling plant conveyer belt, Alvarado answered in Spanish: 'Threats.' That's according to Chron.com, though no further details of the ominous remark had yet emerged Wednesday night. Alvarado was taken into custody at her home and charged with capital murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty in Texas. Alvarado told detectives that several weeks before the birth she had tried to find somebody who would teach her how to perform a self-induced abortion. She ended up giving birth, however. Police say she used an assumed name at an area hospital. She also told investigators that after killing the baby, she threw the body into a dumpster at her apartment building inside a duffel bag provided to her by the hospital. When employees of the Waste Management center on San Antonio's east side found the body, believed to have been no older than 10 days when he died, they immediately ceased all operations. Scroll down for video... Disgusting: Alvarado was arrested late Tuesday when she admitted to police that she tossed her baby in a dumpster . The baby, no older than 10 days, eventually ended up at this San Antonio Waste Management plant . A Waste Management spokeswoman said the company provided police with records of the locations where its trucks had picked up the load of recyclables in which the body was found. Police Sergeant Javier Salazar told reporters it was through 'good detective work' and eyewitness tips that police were able to track down Alvarado. He also revealed that Alvarado was found living with other children at the time of her arrest. 'There were other children involved in the case that resided in the same place where the suspect resides,' he said. Ominous: When asked why she killed her baby, Alvarado reportedly responded 'threats' Capital murder: The 25-year-old faces a capital murder charge and potential death penalty . It remained unclear Wednesday evening if those children belonged to Alvarado. The children have been handed over to Child Protective Services while police try to find out if Alvarado is their mother. Under Texas law, a child under 60 days can be left in the care of an official employee at designated safe places, such as hospitals, fire houses or police stations. A person who drops off an unharmed infant will not be prosecuted for neglect or abandonment under the 'Baby Moses Law,' named for the biblical figure. The law is aimed at providing desperate parents with a responsible alternative and protects them from criminal prosecution.","Asked by police why she killed her son, Nidia Alvarado responded in Spanish, 'threats' after her arrest in San Antonio late Tuesday .

"By . Jamie Carragher . PUBLISHED: . 18:14 EST, 10 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:34 EST, 10 January 2014 . It has been the week from hell for David Moyes, the lowest point of a season in which his dream job became a nightmare. But the support for him to turn things around for Manchester United should not be limited to those within Old Trafford. Every British coach and manager should be firmly behind Moyes, hoping he is successful. Why? If Moyes fails, it will be a long time before a British coach is considered for one of the top jobs. Harsh though it may sound, it is the truth. Foreign owners won’t be prepared to take a plunge on those who have been ‘homegrown’. Pear shaped: David Moyes has endured a torrid start to his Manchester United reign . Sequence: United's defeat at Sunderland in the Capital One Cup was their third on the bounce . Moyes is at the forefront of a crucial period for our coaches. It has not been a common theme in the modern era that, as now, the three biggest jobs in British football — United, Liverpool and England —have simultaneously been held by managers from these shores. You have to go back to mid-1998, when Alex Ferguson was joined by Roy Evans and Glenn Hoddle, so it will be intriguing to watch how Moyes, Brendan Rodgers and Roy Hodgson go about achieving their aims. Make no mistake, they are all under pressure to deliver. Rodgers has made excellent progress in his first 18 months at Anfield but where Liverpool go between now and the end of next year will determine whether he gets the chance to keep building. Local: Brendan Rodgers has made big stride at Liverpool while Roy Hodgson led England to the World Cup . Looking abroad: Foreign owners such as Roman Abramovich have been reluctant to appoint British managers . Similarly, Hodgson needs England to give a bold account at the World Cup this summer. He has done a good job since replacing Fabio Capello but the demands and expectation are relentless. He will know what is required for him to stay in charge for Euro 2016 qualifying. We need them to hit their targets to buck the trend of what has happened when British men have been elevated to the top. Mark Hughes had an opportunity at Manchester City but their owners didn’t believe him to be the man to secure Champions League football. They were criticised for appointing Roberto Mancini but he won the FA Cup and the Premier League in consecutive years. Hughes is not a lone case. Sam Allardyce didn’t last long at Newcastle when his reputation was at its strongest; Hodgson got 191 days at Liverpool. Brief: Sam Allardyce lasted less than a year at Newcastle after being appointed in 2007 . Harsh: Mark Hughes was sacked by Manchester City even though they were in top four contention . Champions: Manchester City won the Premier League and FA Cup under Roberto Mancini . Critics have questioned why a British manager has never been given a platform at Chelsea but they have won 11 major trophies in the Roman Abramovich era, which shows it has worked for them. And look at the biggest job of all. The FA made a positive step for British coaches when appointing Steve McClaren in 2006 but within 18 months, he was sacked after failing to qualify for the European Championship. Sven Goran Eriksson and Capello took criticism but both qualified for every tournament they could and if Hodgson happens to have a bad time in Brazil this summer, the clamour will be for the FA to appoint another foreign coach. I wouldn’t want that. The England team should be managed by one of our own but if they aren’t succeeding at club level, you can understand why the FA would be tempted to look abroad. It is alarming that only four of the 20 clubs in the Premier League are managed by Englishmen. In recent years, only Harry Redknapp has enjoyed success in a big role, reviving Tottenham — a club with a long history of looking abroad — and building their most stylish team in 30 years. You can see why clubs have a preference to look abroad, as many managers who come into our game boast impressive CVs. Whether it is Jose Mourinho or Carlo Ancelotti, Arsene Wenger, Gerard Houllier or Rafa Benitez, they all have a pedigree of success and that commands respect straight away. There is also a mystique about working with foreign managers. I know from experience what it was like with Houllier and Benitez. There would be times in training when they would say something that I didn’t think sounded right but I would never fail to go along with them. Houllier arrived at Anfield having helped orchestrate France’s victory in the 1998 World Cup; Benitez had won La Liga twice with Valencia and a UEFA Cup. Those achievements would run through your mind if you ever thought what you were being asked to do was wrong. Is that something which is working against Moyes? For all his good work with Everton — stabilising a club that used to be threatened by relegation and turning them into regulars in the top six — he was appointed manager of the league champions after reaching one FA Cup final. Disaster: England failed to qualify for Euro 2008 under Steve McClaren (left), but foreign managers like Sven Goran-Eriksson (right) and Fabio Capello always led the national team to major tournaments . Expressive: Rafa Benitez arrived at Liverpool having won two La Liga titles and the UEFA Cup with Valencia . Compare that with Ferguson. United were languishing towards the foot of the old First Division in 1986 but Ferguson came to Old Trafford having led Aberdeen to eight domestic honours, as well as the European Cup-Winners’ Cup and European Super Cup. That is the problem now. In the past, British coaches had a packed CV because they filled all the top jobs, but the influx of foreign coaches has changed that. Wenger, Mourinho and Benitez have raised the bar and it is up to their British counterparts to meet the challenge. I love having Mourinho and Wenger in the Premier League; I enjoyed it when Ancelotti was here and it would be great to one day see Pep Guardiola working his magic, but I am also passionate about  seeing British managers succeed. We are quick to shout for their promotion but recent history shows it hasn’t worked. The onus, then, is on Moyes, Rodgers and Hodgson to lead the charge and show Britain has the talent for the top positions. Even City should be glad Messi's back . I had a chance during a break over Christmas to read an excellent biography on Lionel Messi and, by coincidence, finished it the day he made a goalscoring return to action. Football fans around the world would have been delighted to see him score two goals in Barcelona’s Copa del Rey victory over Getafe and the fact that he is back in action should be celebrated, particularly with the World Cup looming. He will be going to Brazil fresh and fit. Even Manchester City players should be happy the Argentine is back. Back with a bang: Lionel Messi returned to the Barcelona team and was straight in the goals against Getafe . Test: Messi will lead Barcelona into their massive Champions League tie against Manchester City . If I was in the position of Vincent Kompany or any other City defender, I’d relish the chance to test myself against Messi in the Champions League. Playing against the best players and competing in the finest arenas — how you do in those games can define your career. While I was away, I bumped into Pep Guardiola. He said that with a fit Lionel Messi, Barcelona remain the team to beat in the Champions League. They have played together for so long and Messi gives them the  X-factor. Maybe Guardiola was trying to take some of the pressure off his own Bayern Munich team, as they attempt to become the first club to retain the Champions League, but it put into context what we have to look forward to when the competition resumes. Bayern against Arsenal and City v Barcelona is what top-level football is all about. They are games to be savoured. Theo Walcott has suffered terrible luck and will be heartbroken to miss another World Cup, this time through injury. But he is not the first Englishman to feel cursed when it comes to football’s biggest tournament, as this week’s list shows. 1. Kevin Keegan —  A two-time winner of the Ballon d’Or yet his World Cup experience lasted just 26 minutes in 1982. England failed to qualify when he was at his best and, to make matters worse, he missed a chance to score against Spain that could have put England into the semi-finals. 2. Jimmy Greaves —  No England striker has a better goals-to-games ratio than Greaves (below). But he scored only one in four matches in Chile in 1962 and injury cost him his place in the 1966 final. He didn’t get his winners’ medal until 2009 after the FA campaigned to FIFA for all Sir Alf Ramsey’s squad to be recognised. 3. Bryan Robson —  His first World Cup appearance couldn’t have started better. He scored twice against France in 1982 — one came after 27 seconds — but after that ‘Captain Marvel’ suffered immense frustration as injuries in Mexico (1986) and Italy (1990) cut his tournaments short. 4. Frank Lampard —  Few have given England better service in the modern era but luck has deserted him at the World Cup. He is yet to score in the finals, was ludicrously denied a goal against Germany in 2010 and, like me, missed a penalty in the quarter-final shootout against Portugal in 2006. 5. Robbie Fowler —  My old team-mate was at his peak in the build-up to France 1998 but he suffered a serious knee injury that ruled him out of the tournament. Flower (below) was selected to go to Japan four years later but his only involvement came as a substitute against Denmark.","If Moyes fails, it will be a long time before a Brit is considered for a top job .

Free: Duncan Drye, 64, has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work after admitting breaching health and safety regulations . A fairground worker whose runaway horse and carriage crushed to death a blind grandmother has walked free from court. Carole Bullett, 57, was thrown 6ft in the air by the 'spooked' animal in front of her horrified daughter and seven-year-old grandson at a country fair in June 2011. The horse then trampled on Mrs Bullett, before crushing her chest under the wheels of the cart it was pulling. Now, owner Duncan Drye, 64, has been ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work after admitting breaching health and safety regulations. Eight other people were injured in the incident at Nowton Park Country Fair in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Ipswich Crown Court heard. The four-year-old horse, called Lucas, suddenly went out of control and ran straight into a crowd of spectactors - leaving scenes of carnage in its wake. Witness Darryl Whitpen told an inquest in 2012 that there were 'a few seconds of total carnage with people scrabbling to get out of the way' of the horse. Another bystander Jean Cramer said . she watched helplessly as the animal charged towards Mrs Bullet, who was . put on the blind register in 1992. A . statement by Elisabeth Haslam was also read to the jury, which . described the crowds of people 'screaming' before the grandmother was . 'catapulted' into the air. It read: 'The horse was running at full speed with the cart bouncing around behind it. Tragic: Carole Bullett, 57, was thrown 6ft in the air by a runaway horse and carriage at Nowton Park Country Fair in June 2011. Above, spectators try to calm the animal down moments after it killed the blind grandmother . Treatment: A man is tended to by paramedics after the 'spooked' horse ran straight into a crowd of spectators . 'Everyone was screaming, they were all trying to dive for cover.' Mrs Bullet, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge following the incident, where she sadly died a day later. During the inquest, pathologist Dr Dada said Mrs Bullett had received a number of fractures to her ribs and that blunt force trauma to the chest had been the cause of death. However, the former dinner lady's death was ruled to be 'accidental'. Vets found 'no evidence of any clinical reason' for Lucas to have exhibited 'abnormal  behaviour', but the horse was put down in January this year after suffering from a worm infestation. Chaos: Witnesses described the crowds of people 'screaming' before Mrs Bullett was 'catapulted' into the air . Yesterday, Drye admitted failing as an employer to ensure that visitors to the fair were not exposed to health and safety risks. Sentencing Drye, Judge David Goodin described what had happened at the fair as a 'tragedy'. He said there was no evidence Drye had committed the offence through greed, gross negligence or for financial gain. However, . he ruled the owner had been careless after failing to make sure the . rides were separated from members of public at the fair. Death: Mrs Bullet, who was registered blind, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge following the incident, where she sadly died a day later. An inquest in 2012 found her death was accidental . He added that Drye had also allowed an inexperienced groom to do some of the carriage driving on the day of the incident. 'These are culpable failings, but not failings that warrant custody,' he said. St Edmundsbury Borough Council, which organised the fair, was found not guilty of the same offence in November last year.","Carole Bullett, 57, was flung 6ft into the air after horse became 'spooked'

The aunt of a 13-year-old girl critically injured in the Roswell middle school shooting has hit out at members of the community for basking in the media attention the gun attack has brought to their city. Police yesterday identified 13-year-old Kendal Sanders as one of two victims of the attack on Berrendo Middle School. The innocent teen was blasted in the shoulder when the shooter, named in local reports as 12-year-old Mason Campbell, opened fire on the school gymnasium at 7.30am on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Victim: Kendal Sanders, 13, was one of two students shot at Berrendo Middle School . Happy teen: Kendal looks like an happy 13-year-old teenager on Facebook. She was shot in the shoulder and has had to undergo emergency surgery . Close family: Kendal regularly post pictures with her father Bert and mother Betty online. Her aunt Lisa described how her father broke down on hearing the news and remains at his daughter's bedside . Kendal's devastated family have since taken to social media to ask for prayers and to detail what happened. One aunt, Lisa Sanders, also took the opportunity to hit out at members of the community boasting about the fact they've appeared in one of the many broadcasts from the school beamed around the country - and the world. In an angry post on Facebook on Tuesday night, she called on people to remember the families of the two victims in the shooting. 'I hope everyone who is ""happy"" to be on TV understands exactly what is going on!' she wrote just hours after joining Kendal's parents Bert and Betty at the Lubbock hospital where Kendal is being treated. 'As the little girl's aunt who was shot today and to watch her mother and father go through every parents nightmare! I also want you to know when you see a grown man cry for his son and daughter, keep that on you mind when you are all happy about talking to reporters! From the aunt of our baby girl!'

Saving lives: Hero social studies teacher John Masterson talked the Roswell school shooter down after he left a 13-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy in critical condition . Community in mourning: Heartbreaking images emerged from a prayer vigil in Roswell last night as the young students of Berrendo Middle School gathered with their families . Devastated: Troy Tucker held his two daughters Emily, 10, and Hannah, 12, close at the vigil. Police say more students could have been shot if a hero teacher hadn't stepped in . Shocked: Kimberly Macias cries alongside her school friends, pictured, the teens were trying to come to terms with the devastating shooting today . She also detailed the horror injuries suffered by Kendal in the attack. Responding to well-wishers she said the teen would be in hospital for at least a week and had to undergo emergency surgery following the shooting 'cutting her from chest to waist'. The 13-year-old's condition has improved overnight from critical to serious though. On her own Facebook profile Kendal looks like any other 13-year-old girl posting about One Direction and popular TV shows. She is also clearly close to her parents posting pictures with both her mom and dad happily posing for the camera. Police are still seeking a motive for the shooting. Campbell's other victim, an unnamed 11-year-old boy, is in critical condition. He reportedly told nurses he believed he was the intended target of the attack. It has also emerged that the preteen shooter warned his friends to stay away from school. Police revealed in a press conference on Tuesday night that some were told to stay away, it is not clear if any of these students raised the alarm. 'We have preliminary information that possibly some of the students were warned by the individual prior to the shooting not to go to school,' said New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas. Many more children could have been hurt in the shooting if it wasn't for the actions of a selfless social studies teacher who threw himself in front of the gunman and convinced him to put down his 20-gauge, sawed-off shotgun. Tears: Students are reunited with family following a shooting at Berrendo Middle School, Tuesday, January 14, 2014 . Security: Students surrounded by officials are escorted from Berrendo Middle School after the shooting, which injured two teens . 'Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ...who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,' New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez said at a vigil Tuesday evening, according to CNN, 'and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt.' Mr Masterson has been a teacher for ten years and also coaches soccer at the school. He told the Albuquerque Journal he has been warned not to speak at length about the shooting. 'It was a harrowing experience. All I can say was the staff there did a great job,' he said. Another teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene. Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody. At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30am. '(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said. Witnesses said the 11-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this. Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground. He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials. 'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said. Too much: A parent falls to their knees as they hear more about the early morning shooting . Police: Police were on hand at the chaotic parking lot as frightened parents waited for their children . Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone. Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all. 'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.' Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area. Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot. 'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said. Relief: Kathy Sigala cries as she hugs 11-year-old Zippy and 12-year-old Jade. 'I just want to take them home and love the,' she said . Shooter: No information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been released . She said the security guard ran to help the injured student, and school officials ordered all the students to their classrooms. It was earlier reported that there were . at least four victims, but the injured kids appeared to have been counted twice.

A patient has been left in a vegetative state after his doctor walked out in the middle of his open-heart surgery to attend a lunch, a lawsuit has claimed. Silvino Perez, 72, suffered complications after his cardiologist, Dr Pervaiz Chaudhry, left a physician's assistant to close his chest in 2012 - even though he wasn't qualified to do so, according to relatives. Perez's wife, Maria Arteaga Alvarez, and his stepson, Cristobal Arteaga, have now filed a lawsuit against the doctor and Fresno Community Regional Medical Center in California. Arteaga says they only learned that the doctor had left the room when they received an anonymous phone call in October from a nurse who had been in the room at the time, ABC News reported. Changed: Silvino Perez, pictured left before his 2012 surgery and right after the surgery, suffered brain damage after his cardiologist left open-heart surgery while his chest was still open, according to a lawsuit . He revealed that when Perez was undergoing surgery, Dr Chaudhry left to attend a lunch at least 20 minutes away, Arteaga said. When the doctor received a call to say that Perez's heart had stopped, he returned - but the patient's brain had already suffered extensive damage. Arteaga said the man on the phone told him that this was why Perez was in a vegetative state. 'I cant put it into words,' Arteaga said. 'What kind of monster is that? That would just walk out? You trust this individual with your life.' The man said that a state health department report had detailed the incident, but had not named the patient or doctor. But Arteaga said the caller told him the report was about Chaudhry and Perez. An investigation had been launched into the surgery a week afterwards following an anonymous call from a staff member, according to the California Department of Public Health's website. Arteaga's lawyer, Jeffrey Mitchell, said the details of the report matched Perez's case - but neither the California Department of Public Health nor the hospital would confirm he was the subject. Accused: Dr. Pervaiz Chaudhry left the room to attend a lunch at least 20 minutes away, according to the lawsuit. When his assistant struggled to close the patient's chest, he rushed back - but it was too late . Before the surgery, Perez 'was the hardest-working man you'd ever meet', Arteaga told the Fresno Bee. He had been a field worker and had also been taking care of his wife, who is disabled and uses a wheelchair, for three years. Cristobal Arteaga, patient's stepson . He underwent surgery on April 2, 2012 after suffering chest pains and learning that he had a heart defect that required surgery. During the surgery, Arteaga and his mother waited in a private waiting room and that, after two hours, Dr Chaudhry arrived to tell them the surgery had been a success, ABC News reported. Their attorney says this is likely when the doctor left. But minutes later, a phone in the room rang and they learned Perez was suffering from complications. The physician's assistant had closed the patient but another staff member noticed he was still bleeding, according to the health department. They called Chaudhry, who gave them instructions, but they struggled to make Perez stable. Heartbroken: Perez's distraught stepson, Cristobal Arteaga, said the family only learned of the alleged mistake after receiving an anonymous call from a member of hospital staff last October . 'It was somewhat of a whirlwind,' Arteaga said. 'At one point in time, they told us to round up the whole family, because they didn't think he was going to pull through.' About 45 minutes after the patient 'coded', the doctor returned to the hospital and successfully restarted his heart, although he continued to bleed. That night, he was transferred to the cardiovascular intensive care unit. Arteaga said his stepfather's chest was left open for days - covered with just a clear tape - in case something else went wrong. Perez has never regained consciousness and has never moved, his stepson said. He is now in an acute care facility. The doctor was given a 14-day suspension and his surgeries were monitored for two months, according to the health department's report. Heading to court: The family has also sued Fresno Community Regional Medical Center in California . The family is asking for unspecified damages in their lawsuit. Valley Cardiac Surgery Medical Group, which has been named in the suit and which counts Chaudhry as a memeber, said they have not yet received the suit. But Bruce Eliason said in a statement that the claim that Chaudhry left the operating room before the patient's chest was closed 'is unequivocally false, and it will be proven so'. Mary Lisa Russell, spokeswoman for Community Regional Medical Center, said in an email: 'While we can't comment on any ongoing litigation, we have instituted improved safeguards with action plans that have been approved by the state.'

When they tested these images on a group of volunteers, they found that the algorithm succeeded in making the faces more or less memorable in around 75 per cent of cases. The first time we see a face, we tend to ‘tag’ it with attributes based on appearance, such as intelligence, kindness, or coldness. ‘If we tag a person with familiarity, because we think this is a face we have seen before, we have a tendency to like it more, and for instance to think the person is more trustworthy,’ Ms Oliva said. The team are now investigating how to add other attributes to their model, so that it could modify faces to be both more memorable and to appear more intelligent or trustworthy.","MIT scientists claim memorable faces tend to be more interesting and it helps when they look kind, trustworthy, slightly distinct and already familiar .

Aides to Chris Christie knew traffic closures they spitefully ordered on the George Washington Bridge were putting lives at risk after just a few hours – but carried on snarling traffic for another four days, it was revealed Friday. A huge dump of documents showed the Republican-orchestrated political revenge stunt that threatens the White House ambitions of the New Jersey governor continued for an entire work week with little regard for public safety. Before noon on the first day the traffic pattern was changed, September 9, bringing the streets of Fort Lee, N.J. to a standstill, Port Authority community relations director Tina Lado emailed deputy executive director Bill Baroni and interstate capital projects director David Wildstein – a boyhood friend of Gov. Christie – to warn them that public safety was at risk. 'Peggy Thomas, [Fort Lee] Borough Administrator, called me regarding the increased volume and congestion of AM rush traffic throughout the Borough as a result of the GWB toll lanes adjustment that occurred,' Lado wrote. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a Democratic mayor . A port authority employee warned  the bridge lane closures created safety risks, but they continued for four days . Contempt: David Wildstein, a long-time political ally and friend of Christie, orchestrated the traffic closures. He was said to be 'Christie's man' at the Port Authority . 'She . mentioned that there were 2 incidents that Ft Lee PD and EMS had . difficulty responding to: a missing child (later found) and a cardiac . arrest. She stated additionally that the Borough and PD had no advance . notice of the planned change.' The new details came from emails included in a trove of documents released Friday by a New Jersey legislative . committee. Florence Genova, a 91-year-old Fort . Lee woman died that day when first-responders needed twice the typical . amount of time to reach her home. Her daughter later said the woman's . death didn't result from the traffic jam. But a fuming Fort Lee, N.J. Mayor Mark . Sokolich told Baroni in writing that his town's emergency services were . 'experiencing tremendous response time delays ... Unquestionably, this . decision has negatively impacted public safety here in Fort Lee.' Ordinary commuters, too, were incensed. New Jersey physician Richard Fried called the Port Authority on Sept. 9 after 'not moving an inch' in traffic for an hour, he told MailOnline. His frustration rose up the chain of command, judging from his mention in one of the emails released Friday. Dr. Fried said he didn't vote for Gov. Christie but finds his style 'refreshing' and 'likes aspects of his character.' Still, he now hopes everyone responsible in the political prank will face charges. 'I think there should be heavy penalties,' he said. 'This is such an abuse of power. This is criminal. Nobody thought a step or two ahead about what was going to happen when they closed these lanes.' The George Washington Bridge links Fort Lee, N.J. with New York City's Manhattan borough . It wasn't until four days later that Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye issued an . agency-wide cease-and-desist order, putting the traffic patterns back to . normal and releasing Fort Lee from its all-day gridlock. Foye . emailed his senior staff on the morning of Friday, Sept. 13, . complaining about a 'hasty and ill-advised decision' that 'resulted in . delays to emergency vehicles. I pray that no life has been lost or trip . of a hospital- or hospice-bound patient delayed.' In . Foye's angry, defensive screed, he vowed to 'get to the bottom of this . abusive decision which violates everything this agency stands for' and, . he said, also violated state and federal laws. Baroni, his deputy, responded with caution about leaks to the press: 'Pat we need to discuss prior to any comments.' 'Bill, . we are going to fix this fiasco,' Foye replied. 'I am on my way to . office to discuss.' And in a . closing line that may come to indicate the beginning of a political . cover-up, Foye added: 'There can be no public discourse.' 'Playing God with people's jobs': One woman was angry that the political stunt might cost her husband a rare chance at gainful employment . Baroni forwarded the message to David . Samson, the Port Authority's chairman and a fellow Christie appointee. 'General, can I call you on this now?' he asked, . Like Gov. Christie, Samson has denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the traffic lane closures. Foye's email followed an early morning phone call on Sept. 13 with George Washington Bridge manager Robert Durando. 'He asked about the test,' Durando wrote Wildstein at 6:47 that morning. 'He asked why he wasn't told.' Wildstein wasn't happy about Foye's intervention, wrote that he was 'going nuts' his scheme had been canceled, and promised 'retaliation.' In another email from Durando, he shared with Port Authority staff 'a flavor of the complaints' officials had received from New Jerseyans about their lengthened morning commutes into New York City. One patron, according to the email, . 'says that the Port Authority ""doesn't care about their customers and . they are playing God with people's jobs.""' 'Her . husband was 40 minutes late to a job that he just got after being out . of work for over a year,' a public relations representative relayed from . an irate taxpayer.. 'She said a lot of other thigns, but I will spare . you her rant!' Grim: Christie's staff listen sullenly to his press conference hours after he fired a trusted co-worker. Only time will tell whether Christie's insistence that he knew nothing holds true . Wildstein and Baroni both resigned in December as pressure mounted for explanations of the traffic foul-up. Gov. Christie apologized publicly Thursday for the actions of his . underlings, and fired two more of them: deputy chief of staff Bridget . Kelly and long-time campaign manager Bill Stepien. He cited their callous indifference to the welfare of taxpayers – and their dishonesty – in dismissing them. His state's top Democrats are investigating the Republican Christie administration for . allegedly retaliating against Sokolich, a Democrat, after he . declined to endorse the governor's re-election bid. 'Try . as we may to understand ... we are reaching the conclusion that there . are punitive overtones associated with this initiative,' Sokolich told . Baroni in his Sept. 12 letter. 'What other conclusion could we possibly reach?' The documents released Friday provide . no direct evidence that Christie was aware of any plot to exact revenge . through the traffic closures. His administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge . into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study . supervised by Wildstein. Patrick Foye, the executive director of the New York / New Jersey Port Authority, angrily ordered the traffic lane closures reversed, but not until public safety risks persisted for nearly a full work week . In a lengthy press briefing on Thursday, . the defiant governor forcefully denied any involvement. But his spokesman Michael Drewniak, however, did not respond to MailOnline's request Friday for information about any health- or safety-related complaints about bridge traffic that the governor's office received during the four days the lanes from Fort Lee were affected. Kelly, whom Christie said lied to him repeatedly about her involvement in the traffic-closure episode, had her own view of Foye's management style. On Oct. 3, Wildstein forwarded her a news account about his boss's angry email ordering an end to what he would later claim was a formal test of toll lanes. 'Still pissing me off,' Wildstein told Kelly. 'No doubt.' she emailed back. 'Foye is a bad guy.' But it was Kelly who, with . Wildstein and others, reveled in the calculated effort to retaliate . against . Sokolich through his commuting constituents. 'Time . for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the . event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive payback. 'Got . it,' responded Wildstein, later asking, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling', when he saw a message that read: 'I feel sorry for the kids' who were stuck in school buses that morning. Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on January 21.","Port Authority in New Jersey heard almost immediately that 'traffic test' was creating serious health and safety problems .

Instead, her fiance, Walter Shaw, was killed on the Somme on the very day she wrote her touchingly hopeful letter. The poignant story of Miss Gawthorp, her childhood sweetheart and her last letter to him is one of many heartbreaking stories that emerge from a new collection of wartime correspondence - much of it between lovers and families who would never be reunited. Poignant: The new book includes letters written by both soldiers and their sweethearts at home . Writing home: British soldiers weren't the only ones to write - this is a German postcard, dated 1916 . Although most were written by British soldiers, not every epistle was destined for these shores. Among the missives unearthed by editor Mandy Kirkby are loving words penned by the spouse of Indian trooper, Prayag Singh, and a love letter written by Austrian Lieutenant Erwin von Freiherr Pflanzer-Baltin to his English sweetheart. Tragically, like so many of the correspondents, Lieutenant Pflanzer-Baltin was killed just 10 days after writing his letter while fighting in Belorussia on the Eastern Front. While most of the letters come from ordinary sweethearts, the collection also includes the words of famous names, among them Winston Churchill, whose final goodbye was happily never sent. Words penned by writer Vera Britten, who immortalised her fiance, Roland Leighton, in Testament of Youth after he was killed in 1915, also appear as does an early letter written by Ernest Hemmingway. Although Britten and Hemmingway's letters are well-known, the words of the ordinary men and women torn apart by the war are not - but are just as poignant. Particularly heartbreaking is the goodbye letter written by Gunner Frank Bracey to his sweetheart Win, written while on leave in May 1916, three months before his death. Tragic: Gunner Frank Bracey's final letter to his sweetheart, Win, is splotched and blurred with tearstains . The note, which is marked by tearstained splotches, is oddly prescient and begins: 'I am writing just a line Win in case of accidents. Just to let you know I have always loved you Dear. 'You are the best little girl on God's Earth have I told you before [sic]. But I am writing this because I have a feeling that I shall not come back again.' Another letter, written by Sergeant Francis Gautier to his young daughter Marie as he was dying of his wounds in an Essex hospital, expresses some of the bitter grief felt by the soldier fathers who never got to see their children grow up. In it, Sergeant Gautier writes that he had 'wished to spend many happy years with you' and, poignantly, concludes: 'I am writing because I want you to know in after years how dearly I loved you.' You can only hope that, unlike so many letters, this was one of the missives that made it through.

At 23st 9lbs, Gillian Close was so mortified by her size that she refused to take her children up to the school gates for fear of being judged by the other parents. Her shame made her hide from the other mothers, bidding goodbye to her three children round the block from the entrance to their Catholic comprehensive school - but also spurred her on to finally lose the weight that was making her life a misery. The obese mother-of-three, 39, has now lost a incredible 13 stone. Nowadays, she proudly drops her children off at school, chats to the parents and teachers - and goes for a six-mile jog afterwards. Gillian lost an incredible 13 stone in weight dropping from 23st 9lbs and size 26 to 10st 4lbs and size 12 . Gillian used to be so ashamed of her weight that she wouldn'­t take her children to school, but now, Gillian proudly drops them at the gates and even goes for a six-mile jog afterwards .

She has now managed to lose 13 stone 5lbs, weighing in at a trim 10 stone 4lbs and has lost 7 dress sizes to drop to a svelte 12. Gillian, a civil servant from Peterlee, County Durham said: 'No-one wants to be the fat mum at the school gates and I knew some of my children’s classmates had made jibes about me being fat. 'So I wouldn’t drop my kids all the way to school. I convinced myself I was doing it to give them space but really, it was because I was too embarrassed to be seen by the other parents and kids. 'But now, I walk with them to the entrance and talk to all the teachers and mums at the gates. The kids love that I pick them up from school.' Gillian totally changed her diet to drop the weight, cutting out snacking on unhealthy treats like crisps and chocolate . Gillian decided to lose weight after being too embarrassed to attend any Christmas parties in 2011 . Following her amazing weight loss, Gillian has become an avid runner. She is often spotted in her jogging gear at the school gates. Gillian says: 'I go running up to four times a week. So the other parents usually see me drop my kids off and then head straight out for a jog. In fact, a lot of the mums have taken up running since!' Gillian piled on the pounds after having three children - Matthew, 15, Jamie, 12, and Aaron, 10 - in five years. She explains: 'I had been overweight on and off for most of my life and then I had kids in quick succession which didn’t help.

I didn’t like the way I looked or the way people perceived me. I wanted to be invisible.' Gillian decided to ditch the weight for good in January 2012, after avoiding social functions during the festive period because she was too humiliated about her appearance to attend. 'I rejected all the invites to Christmas parties. I just didn’t want to go out and have my picture taken. But when the New Year came along, I decided enough was enough and that I was going to make a fresh start.' BREAKFAST: Two slices of white toast with full-fat butter and jam .

A seven-year-old girl has captured the hearts of people around the globe after an adorable letter she wrote to scientists asking them to 'make her a dragon' was published on the internet. Sophie Lester, from Queensland, Australia, wrote to her country's national science agency (CSIRO) before Christmas with her delightful request. She wrote: 'Hello lovely scientist... Would it be possible if you can make a dragon for me? I would like it if you could but if you can't that's fine. Scroll down for video . Childhood wish: Sophie Lester asked scientists if they could make her a dragon . Instructions: With her letter, she drew a picture asking if the dragon could have a black face . 'I would call it Toothless if it was a girl and if it is a boy I would name it Stuart. I would keep it in my special green grass area where there are lots of space. I would feed it raw fish and I would put a collar on it. 'If it got hurt I would bandage it if it hurt himself. I would play with it every weekend when there is no school.' The little girl included a drawing of how she imagined the dragon would look, pointing out that 'the face should be black'. The science agency revealed the letter on their website where they included the response they sent back to the school girl, apologising that: 'Over the past 87 odd years we have not been able to create a dragon or dragon eggs.' They added: 'We have sighted an eastern bearded dragon at one of our telescopes, observed dragonflies and even measured body temperatures of the mallee dragon. But our work has never ventured into dragons of the mythical, fire breathing variety. And for this Australia, we are sorry.' Cute: The little girl's letter addressed to 'lovely scientist' Next best thing: The agency made her a 3D model of a dragon instead . But after Sophie's letter went viral, prompting responses from countries around the world, the scientists decided to try a bit harder to make Sophie's dream come true. While they couldn't create her a real dragon, they did the next best thing, making a her a 3D model out of titanium that will be able to fly. Chad Henry, CSIRO additive manufacturing operations manager, wrote: . 'Toothless came into the world at Lab 22, our additive manufacturing . facility in Melbourne.

'Being that electron beams were used to 3D print her, we are certainly glad she didn't come out breathing themâ€¦ instead of fire. Titanium is super strong and lightweight, so Toothless will be a very capable flyer.' They added that they hope Sophie will maintain her interest in science when she grows up. Sophie's mother, Melissah, told the Canberra Times that her daughter was delighted with the agency's response and now she and all her friends 'want to be a scientist'.

Arbitrator Fredric Horowitz handed down the 162-game . suspension Saturday in a historic decision that A-Rod announced shortly after . he intended to fight in federal court. It includes the postseason, should the . Yankees qualify. The season-long ban is a reduction from the 211-game . suspension initially imposed by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, . but is a win for the league since it was clear from the beginning it wanted him gone for all of 2014. Yer outta there!: Alex Rodirguez will not be able to step foot on a baseball field again until he is almost 40-years-old . Judge and jury: Arbitrator Fredric Horowitz, who handed down the 162-game suspension, pictured in 2009 . The arbitrator’s decision is another chapter in what has . been a dramatic five months for the steroid-tainted slugger that saw him spend . the majority of the season rehabbing from injury only to be hit with the . historic suspension. He was one of a dozen players suspended as part of the . Biogenesis investigation. All but one of the other players suspended received . 50-game bans, Milwaukee Brewers left fielder received a 65-game suspension that . he accepted. They all accepted their bans, but he immediately appealed. The next week saw a series of terse press conferences as the . game’s highest paid player grinded through a rehab assignment at AA Trenton and . followed each game with three-ring-circus press conferences accusing the . Yankees of trying to keep him off the field. An all-time great: Mr Rodriguez has 654 career home runs, good for fifth-most in baseball history . Unprecedented: A-Rod ban is the longest PED-related suspension in baseball history . The one-time World Series champion made it on to the field . for the final month of the season and vowed to take his fight against the . suspension as far as he had to get it overturned. ‘The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck . has been stacked against me from day one,’ he said in a statement. ‘This is one . man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not . involve me having failed a single drug test.’ The 14-time all-star and his legal team said the suspension . ‘is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug . Agreement and the Basic Agreement.’ ‘[It] relies on testimony and documents that would never . have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and . wholly unreliable,’ the statement continued. Another long road back: The fading slugger spent almost the entire 2013 season rehabbing his injured hip, he will now not be allow back on a baseball field for one full year . ‘I have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing . substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic . Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I . will take this fight to federal court.’ Mr Rodriguez has long argued that accusations stemming from . the Biogenesis performance enhancing drug investigation lacks credibility, and . that evidence against him was obtained illegally. He even famously once walked out of an arbitration hearing . late last year in protest over Mr Selig not being forced to testify – he said . he was being treated unfairly. The player’s union stood by the player in a statement of . their own. ‘The MLBPA strongly disagrees with the award issued today in . the grievance of Alex Rodriguez, even despite the arbitration panel's decision . to reduce the duration of Mr. Rodriguez's unprecedented 211-game suspension.’ The ballplayer’s legal team tried to argue that Biogenesis founder . Anthony Bosch was a consultant, but MLB reportedly produced mountains of . evidence to the contrary, and was able to portray a close relationship between . the two men. Mr Bosch also testified to the contrary during the arbitration hearing. Mr Rodriguez arrives Oct 1 at the offices of Major League Baseball in New York for an arbitration hearing . Evidence linking Mr Bosch to Major Leaguers was first . published last January in the Miami New Times, a spokesperson for Mr Rodiguez . denied at the time he had any ties to the clinic. Naming A-Rod and a host other ballplayers to investigate, . and once investigators dug the paper trail led to the man whose 654 career home . runs rank fifth all-time. The three-time MVP stands to lose at least $25million for . missing the 2014 season, per the widely reported terms of his record-setting . contract. He was also set to earn a $6million bonus if he hit a mere six home . runs during the season to tie Willie Mays with 660 all-time. Mr Rodriguez will still earn a $3million bonus Jan 15 . despite the suspension since he agreed to defer his signing bonus. The 38-year-old is signed through the end of the 2017 . season, and the team still owes him at least $84million through those seasons. Since he will be almost 40 by the time he is allowed back on the . field, he may have already played his final games.","Alex Rodriguez has been banned for all 162 regular season games and the playoffs for the upcoming season .

But their outrageous comments on social media, including one in which they call India a 'zoo,' have only just come to light. In one shocking musing, Mrs May wrote that Indian vegetarians were responsible for a wave of sexual assaults. 'It's the vegetarians that are doing the raping, not the meat eaters. This place is just so bizarre,' she wrote. Then she added: 'Applies only to Indians, not westerners!' Racist: United States diplomat Wayne May, pictured right, and his wife Alicia Muller May, left, have been kicked out of India after posting offensive comments about their host country on Facebook . Vegetarians: In one shocking musing, Mrs May wrote that Indian vegetarians were responsible for a wave of sexual assaults . Oops: She later clarified that it was only Indian vegetarians doing the raping not Western ones . May, who worked as a U.S. community liaison officer in New Delhi, put up a picture of a cow, regarded by Hindus as sacred, in a separate post and labeled it 'stupid cow.' Someone responded to her, 'You just insulted their god.' 'Not the first time, not the last!' she replied seemingly with pride. The Indian media is abuzz with the story after it revealed the Mays' Facebook comments, which criticized the country's air, water, traffic, health conditions and even the Indian diet. 'My pet dog Pago looks bigger and in better health' than the Mays' gardener, Wayne May wrote. He added that the dog got 'more protein in his diet than the gardener did.' In another, Mrs May exclaims 'what a zoo!' describing the country. After The Times of India blasted the remarks as 'astonishingly offensive' the Obama administration distanced itself from the postings. Abuzz: Indian media, which is abuzz with the story, revealed the Mays' Facebook comments, including this one, in which they criticized India's air, water, traffic, health conditions and even the Indian diet . Offensive: 'Paco definitely weighs more than (the gardener). A bit more protein in Paco's diet,' Mrs May wrote . 'I would underscore that these do not in any way represent the US government position,' a State Department spokeswoman said. Wayne May, who was in the US embassy's security department, and his wife were identified by Indian media as the American couple who were expelled in retaliation for the expulsion of Khobragade, after her arrest last month on charges she kept her Indian domestic worker in virtual servitude. Khobragade, 39, a women's-rights champion who served as deputy consul general for political, economic, commercial and women's affairs at the Indian consulate in New York, was indicted for lying on official documents that claimed she was paying her female housekeeper $4,500 a month. In reality, the feds say, Khobragade forced Indian national Sangeeta Richard to work 100 or more hours a week, with no days off, for just $573 a month. She was granted diplomatic immunity and on Tuesday filed papers in Manhattan federal court to get the indictment tossed so she can come back to the U.S. to be with her husband, Aakash Singh Rathore, who teaches philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and their two young daughters. Distance: The State Department was quick to distance itself from the horrid comments . India asked the United States on Friday to withdraw Wayne May from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, the latest retaliation in a smoldering diplomatic dispute touched off by the arrest and strip search of an Indian diplomat in New York. The case has caused a serious rift between the United States and India, where officials have described the treatment of Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, as barbaric. Khobragade, a 39-year-old mother of two, is accused of exploiting her Indian-born housekeeper and nanny, allegedly having her work more than 100 hours a week for low pay and lying about it on a visa form. Khobragade has maintained her innocence. Friday's demand by India's Foreign Ministry came just hours after the two sides appeared to have struck a compromise of sorts: Khobragade was indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury in Manhattan, but also granted immunity that allowed her to leave the country. She was on a flight to India on Friday, and many believed that would be enough to give both countries a way to save face. Given their strategic bilateral partnership and more than $100 billion in trade, any further escalation in the case would not be in the interest of either country, analysts said. But on Friday evening, the Foreign Ministry said an unidentified American diplomat of the same rank as Khobragade was somehow involved in the case and should leave the country, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. Requesting the recall of a diplomat is a serious, and fairly unusual, move that sends a message to Washington that India's government doesn't accept the legitimacy of the court action in New York. Much of the outrage over the case in India stems from the circumstances of Khobragade's arrest, which were seen as unnecessarily humiliating. Khobragade was picked up mid December and then strip-searched while in custody, which the U.S. Marshals say is common practice.","Wayne May and his wife Alicia Muller May were effectively deported last week by Indian authorities .

The Mayor of London plans to build a 'Crossrail for the bike' as part of an ambitious £900m plan to build a huge cycle path through the capital. The segregated route will run for more than 15 miles from the western suburbs through the heart of London to Canary Wharf and Barking. It will use new Dutch-style segregated cycle tracks along, among other places, the Victoria Embankment and the Westway flyover. Scroll down for video . Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Chris Boardman (left) arrive to launch 'Crossrail for the Bike' - which will see a huge cycle highway run through London London . It is believed to be the longest substantially-segregated cycle route of any city in Europe, as Boris Johnson said he wanted to encourage novice cyclists to 'get in the saddle'. He said he wanted to overhaul the image that cycling is just for Lycra-clad enthusiasts, and wanted bikes to reclaim the city's streets. Yesterday the Mayor announced that the main cross-London physical legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games will be a proper network of cycle routes across the city. Over the next four years London will open a range of high-quality new cycle routes parallel to, and named after, Tube lines and bus routes, so everyone knows where they go. The red line shows the new cycle route that would travel through London and transform the way people get around the city . The Mayor added: 'I want to de-Lycrafy cycling. I want to make it normal, something for everyone, something you feel comfortable doing in your ordinary clothes. 'Our new routes will give people the confidence to get in the saddle. ' I do not promise perfection, or that London will become Amsterdam any time soon.' The Mayor said that cycling would reduce traffic, make the city a greener, more pleasant place and save lives. 'The reason I am spending almost £1 billion on this is my belief that helping cycling will not just help cyclists. It will create better places for everyone. 'It means less traffic, more trees, more places to sit and eat a sandwich. 'It means more seats on the Tube, less competition for a parking place and fewer cars in front of yours at the lights. The cycling 'Crossrail' would run past the Victoria Embankment and travel from east to west through the capital .

The number of people using cycle lanes in central London has risen by 155 per cent, the London Assembly said . Boris wants novices to take to the street s on bike . 'Above all, it will fulfill my aim of making London’s air cleaner. If just 14 per cent of journeys in central London were cycled, emissions there of the greatest vehicle pollutant, NOx, would fall by almost a third and over the years literally thousands of lives could be saved.' Despite the Mayor's grand plans, there are concerns that there might be inadequate funding. The London Assembly's Transport Committee warned that without adequate funding targets would not be reached and the plan could fall woefully short of its expectations. The Committee called on the Mayor to double Transport for London's budget for cycling, to tackle the recent rise in cycling injuries, which have seen a 50 per cent increase in London since 2006. TfL confirmed £913 million will be spent in the capital over a decade, but the Committee claimed that this is insufficient and, per year, only matches the budget provided for cycling in 2010. London experienced a 155 per cent increase in people cycling to work over the past decade, so the Transport Committee welcomed the Mayor's vision for cycling. Caroline Pidgeon AM, Chair of the London Assembly’s Transport Committee, said: 'Far from seeing evidence of a serious commitment to a ""cycling revolution"", the Mayor’s vision lacks ambition for his pledges to make London safer and more inviting for cycling. 'While £913 million may seem an impressive figure, its impact will be diluted over ten years and is not a significant advancement on current funding levels. To have real impact, we’re calling for the investment in cycling to be doubled.' The plan includes major and substantial improvements to the worst junctions, making them safer and less threatening for cyclists with measures such as segregation and cycle-only paths or phases. Junctions to be tackled in the next three years include Blackfriars, Vauxhall, Tower, Swiss Cottage, and Elephant & Castle. The budget for TfL’s safer junction review has been more than quintupled, from £19 million to £100 million, and the money will be focused on fewer sites. Other elements in the 'Mayor's Vision for Cycling' include: . The overall budget for cycling will rise to £913 million, two and a half times more than previously planned, with almost £400 million spent in the next three years alone. Cycle spending will rise to £145 million in 2015, or around £18 per head, up with the best in Germany and almost on a par with the Netherlands. TfL is conducting off-site trials of new, cyclist-friendly innovations, such as 'Dutch-style' roundabouts and eye-level traffic lights for cyclists. If these trials are successful, and the Department for Transport allows, they will be rolled out on the road network.","Mayor promises millions of pounds for scheme to get novices cycling .

Hollywood may have the cult hit Snakes on a Plane, but a Brisbane animal welfare group is gaining attention with its snake in a bag video: a short clip showing a very deadly, and very agitated, brown snake trying to evade capture from a very calm female reptile wrangler. The minute-long clip features footage of an Eastern Brown Snake – the second most venomous land snake in the world – continuously raising itself from the floor in a defensive pose after it was found slithering around the lounge room of a home in Sinnamon Park, suburban Brisbane. Feeling cornered and intimidated, the snake hides under a side table and tries to slip out the balcony door looking for an escape route, all the while continuously rearing up at the camera. Deadly: An Eastern Brown snake gets cornered in a Brisbane home. In steps snake-wrangler Steph Robinson, who calmly uses her bare hands to grab the snake, prod it with a snake hook and then place it safely into a big black bag. Ms Robinson’s husband Bryan from Snake Advice and Relocation uploaded the video of his wife’s impressive battle with the ‘brownie’ onto the Snake Catchers Brisbane Facebook page as a way to educate people and ‘give a little perspective from the snake’s point of view.’ ‘Remember this snake is on a slippery tile surface where it is not afforded its normal movement with some big human hanging over the top of it,’ Mr Robinson wrote. ‘To put yourself in the snake’s position, it’s like you being in the water whilst a shark circles around.’ Trying to escape: The brown snake slithers across the tiled floor. Moving in: Steph Robinson tries to herd the snake out into the open so she can capture it . Defensive: The agitated snake continuously raised itself up from the floor . Mr Robinson told the Courier Mail that when snakes are inside a confined locality, ‘they just get really nervous’, and despite their aggressive demeanour they do not want to attack. ‘They'll actually push towards you to get you back away, and then try and find themselves some space,’ he told the paper. ‘They’re not looking to bite – they don’t want confrontation.

Walkers stretching their legs on a Welsh footpath stumbled across a dead giant boa constrictor, dumped out in the cold. The 9ft snake was discovered on the walkway in Erddig Park, Wrexham on Saturday evening, prompting shocked passers by to share photographs via social networking sites. The pictures went viral, grabbing the attention of zoologist Chris Wright. The special care school teacher, who trained in zoology at Aberystwyth University, said he rushed straight to the scene to establish if the reptile was dead or alive, fearing it could pose a threat to small dogs and other wildlife in the area. Mr Wright, said: 'On Saturday night I had a phone call saying a large snake had been found and I saw the pictures on Twitter. 'Now usually when people talk about a big snake they just mean a large grass snake, but this is a 9ft long boa constrictor. 'I quickly needed to establish if it was still alive as it could still pose a risk to life for wildlife and small dogs although it would not have been any threat to humans. 'So I went out there at 9pm and found the snake, but it was dead.' Kevin Harvey from Wrexham, was walking down the country lane with his neighbour David Edwards when they stumbled across the snake. The 54-year-old said: 'It was incredibly long. It was easily as thick as my leg, and so, so heavy. 'We were so surprised to stumble across it and we poked it with a stick to see if it was alive.' Mr Wright, who is a specialist in reptiles and rescues tortoises, said the snake had died as a result of the col weather. Zoologist Chris Wright was alerted to the discovery after spotting pictures on Twitter. He said he rushed straight to the scene to ascertain whether the reptile was dead or alive, fearing it could pose a threat to small dogs and other wildlife . The snake is believed to have been dumped and died because of the cold weather. Mr Wright said: 'It is such a shame. She had either escaped, or more than likely had been cruelly dumped by someone' He said: 'The snake was a female and was an absolute beauty. I have no indication of age but she was quite well fed. 'It is such a shame. She had either escaped, or more than likely had been cruelly dumped by someone. 'It happens quite often unfortunately. It is most likely someone has dumped it and unfortunately it has been killed.' He said the snake has now been buried. Boa constrictors can reach up to 13ft in length and kill by crushing their victims . The boa constrictor is a species of large, non-poisonous snake. It is a member of the Boidae family and is found in the wild in North, Central and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. They live for between 20 and 30 years, reach up to 13ft in length and can weigh up to 60lbs or 27kgs. Like their cousins, Anacondas, Boas are excellent swimmers but prefer to stay on dry land. In the wild they tend to live in hollow logs and mammals burrows. Their jaws are lined with small hooked teeth, for grabbing and holding their prey, while wrapping their muscular bodies around their victim, squeezing it until it suffocates. Boas will eat almost anything they can catch, including birds, monkeys and wild pigs. Their jaws can stretch to allow them to swallow their prey whole. Female boas incubate their eggs outside their bodies and can give birth to up to 60 babies during their lives. Some boa constrictors are hunted for their fine, ornate skin and as such, many of the species are endangered.","Pictures of giant snake found dead on popular Wrexham pathway go viral .

Bubonic plague is sweeping through Madagascar and could lead to a full-blown epidemic, aid charities have warned. Fears are growing that the deadly disease could spread through the prisons of the island nation, which are frequently infested with rats. Last year, 60 people in Madagascar died from bubonic plague, more than in any other country in the world. Disease: Bubonic plague, carried by fleas like this one, is sweeping through Madagascar . While the disease has been almost entirely eradicated from Europe, there were 256 cases of bubonic plague recorded in Madagascar last year. October is the start of the danger period for the disease as fleas which spread the plague thrive in the humid weather. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Pasteur Institute are now working in the country to prevent bubonic plague from becoming even more common, according to the BBC. Experts are particularly concerned about the prospect of an epidemic started in Madagascar's crowded and filthy prisons and then spreading when inmates are released or receive visitors. Rats living in the prisons often carry fleas which transmit bubonic plague to humans by biting them. The disease can then escape to the outside world via staff, visitors, freed inmates or the rats themselves. Idyllic: But Madagascar, pictured, is now the plague capital of the world with 256 cases last year . 'If the plague gets into prisons there could be a sort of atomic explosion of plague within the town,' Christophe Rogier of the Pasteur Institute told the BBC. 'The prison walls will never prevent the plague from getting out and invading the rest of the town.' The ICRC is working to eradicate the disease, but this is particularly difficult as it is necessary not only to kill the rats themselves but also to destroy the fleas living on them. Although the disease can be cured by antibiotics, rural residents often do not have access to even basic healthcare and can be ashamed to seek treatment. One farmer told the BBC he had not been allowed to bury his daughter after she died of plague, as officials took her body into quarantine and buried it themselves. Devastation: The Black Death saw bodies piled up on carts dragged through the streets of Europe . Bubonic plague is one of the most . devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people . in the 'Black Death' which hit Europe in the 14th century. It . is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea . as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

Britain will be the best performing major economy in the developed world for the next two years, experts predicted yesterday. Output in the UK is forecast to grow by 3 per cent in 2014 and again in 2015 – making it the ‘leader of the pack’ among the leading Group of 7 nations. The recovery will trigger a rise in interest rates towards the end of next year, according to the report by research group Capital Economics. Money: Britain will be the best performing major economy in the developed world for the next two years, predicted experts from a conservative-leaning economic think tank yesterday . ‘The UK economy has leapt towards the top of the international growth table and there are good reasons to think it can stay there,’ it said. ‘The conditions for a sustained period of solid growth would appear to be in place for the first time in six years.’ Capital Economics has for a long time been pessimistic about the outlook in the UK and as recently as last June was expecting growth of just 0.2 per cent for 2013 and 1.5 per cent for 2014. Robust growth between now and next year’s general election would be a major boost for David Cameron and George Osborne following years of  economic disappointment. Capital Economics forecast growth of 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent in the United States over the next two years and just 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in the eurozone. Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said: ‘The UK is now the fastest-growing advanced economy in the world. The improvement in growth has been phenomenal.’ But while an interest rate hike would be welcome for Britain’s army of savers, it would be a blow to millions of borrowers relying on low mortgage costs to make ends meet. The Bank of England yesterday set rates at an all-time low of 0.5 per cent for a 59th month in a row but speculation is mounting that a rise is on the way. Gross domestic product in the UK – the total output of the economy – is thought to have grown by nearly 2 per cent last year. That would mark the best year for the economy since 2007 when output rose by 3.4 per cent before crashing in 2008 and 2009 under Labour in the biggest boom and bust in British history. The economy is still around 2 per cent smaller than it was before the crash but experts believe output will finally pass its pre-recession peak later this year. Old lady of Threadneedle Street: The Bank of England yesterday set rates at an all-time low of 0.5 per cent for a 59th month in a row but speculation is mounting that a rise is on the way, which could devastate borrowers . Rob Wood, a former Bank of England economist now at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘The recovery is snowballing. Business confidence is booming, strong growth is back, unemployment is falling and inflation is down.’ It is feared, however, that the recovery is being driven by the housing market and consumer spending rather than manufacturing, exports and investment by private businesses. Figures from the Office for National Statistics yesterday showed exports of British-made goods rose 2 per cent in November as trade with China hit a record high. The trade deficit with the rest of the world – exports minus imports – fell slightly from £9.7billion in October to a still stubbornly high £9.4billion in November. David Kern, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Boosting exports must be a national economic priority.’","Recovery will trigger interest rate rise near end of next year, says think tank .

It is a scene that was all too familiar at the height of the recent storms. The trouble is, this fallen tree is still there three weeks after it was felled by 60mph winds...while neighbours continue to argue over who is responsible for its costly removal. The 50ft leylandii, planted in a back garden, was already causing problems by overshadowing a next door flat in Walderslade, Kent. Then, on Christmas Eve, matters came to a head when it crashed down on the roof and rear wall of the neighbouring property – cutting  off all the light from several  windows and rendering its garden virtually impassable. Now Heidi Brett, who lives in the stricken flat, has been told that either she or her landlord, and not the owner of the garden in which the tree is still partly rooted, must pay £2,500 to have it removed. In the meantime, the giant leylandii has been left lying at a 40 degree angle against her block. The 35-year-old support worker was in her kitchen when she heard an enormous crash at the back door as the tree toppled. She said her landlord’s insurance firm had suggested he could pay the bill, which could then be claimed back from the leylandii owner’s insurance company. However, her landlord has refused to pay on the grounds that it is not his tree – leaving her saddled with the damage. ‘It’s a nightmare,’ Miss Brett said yesterday. ‘Bits of bricks are falling off and landing in my garden and the branches are getting droopy and  falling off. ‘There is water running down inside the loft space too. ‘It’s getting more dangerous the longer it is left there. The owner says as it is now on my land, it is my responsibility to get it moved. ‘But surely if you own something and it breaks or damages someone else’s property it’s the owner’s responsibility to fix it?’ She added: ‘My landlord’s insurance company has said that he will foot the bill and they will try to reclaim it from the tree owner’s insurance firm. ‘But that means he must first pay up out of his own pocket, and that’s where the problem lies. I think the tree owner should be responsible for removing it. ‘I’m in a stalemate now because my landlord is refusing to pay for it because it’s not his tree, which I understand. Stalemate: Ms Brett will not now how much damage the tree has caused to her home until it is removed . ‘It shouldn’t be down to the innocent party to clear up someone else’s mess.’ Miss Brett said that she will not know how much damage has been done to her home until the tree is taken away. Sheila Stenning, 61, who owns the garden where the leylandii once stood upright, said: ‘It is not our responsibility because it is in their property. ‘I have spoken to our insurance company multiple times about it. ‘Their insurance company has to get it removed and then they can recover the costs. ‘I don’t want this dragging on and I appreciate Heidi’s point of view.’","The 50ft tree crashed down on neighbour's flat on Christmas Eve .

"By . Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 18:43 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:38 EST, 5 August 2013 . David Cameron’s election strategist came under fire last night  after it emerged that he was  plotting a campaign to discredit UKIP councillors. Lynton Crosby was reported to have discussed mounting a ‘below-the-radar’ campaign to target members  of UKIP. In a meeting with a lobbying firm, he is said to have suggested monitoring the party’s 139 councillors and trying to catch them making embarrassing comments in council meetings – which would then be leaked to the press by third parties. Attack: Nigel Farage, left, has criticised Conservative campaign guru Lynton Crosy after accusations he planned to discredit UKIP councillors by filming them making embarrassing comments . The revelations sparked an angry response from UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who said the Conservative party ‘quite clearly does not trust its own membership’. He suggested that Tory activists ‘have enormous sympathy’ for what his party is trying to do. Mr Crosby is also said to have criticised the controversial Home Office scheme in which adverts on vans tell illegal immigrants to ‘go home’ or face arrest. He says it played into Mr Farage’s hands by giving him publicity. The UKIP leader said the vans, which sparked accusations of racism, were ‘nasty’. Mr Crosby told executives at Westbourne, a London-based lobbying firm, the initiative had backfired by becoming a row about ‘tactics’. He said an opportunity to attract voters who would actually support such a crackdown had been missed. A senior Tory denied this was the view of Mr Crosby – who is on a £200,000 contract to run the party’s campaign for the 2015 election. He also denied there were plans to monitor UKIP councillors. Controversial: The Home Office vans that target illegal immigrants: Tory sources have denied that Mr Crosby was behind the vans scheme . Any suggestion that the Tories are rattled by UKIP will pile pressure on Mr Cameron ahead of next year’s European elections in which the Eurosceptic party are set to achieve their best result.  Tory MPs with small majorities fear they may lose their seats if they are targeted by UKIP in 2015 and it splits the Right-wing vote. Last night Mr Farage said: ‘What is most revealing about Mr Crosby’s line of attack is that he wants to bring in outside consultants to keep a watch on the hundreds of UKIP councillors, rather than trusting the Conservatives’ own elected councillors. Of course if they listened to their own activists they would find, just as the Labour Party would, that their own activists have enormous sympathy for what UKIP are trying to do –  to wrest power from the political elite and put it back where it belongs, in the hands of the men and women of this country.’ Despite speculation from MPs that Mr Crosby was behind the vans idea, Tory sources insisted the £10,000 campaign to target illegal immigrants was the idea of the Home Office, saying Mr Crosby does not get involved in policy. The advert states: ‘In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest. Text HOME to 78070 for free advice, and help with travel documents. We can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention.’ It has already been publicly condemned by the Lib Dems, while Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The breathtaking stupidity of the people in charge of our immigration system knows no bounds … the fact is there is absolutely zero effort made by law-enforcement agencies to get people out when they have come in to the country unlawfully.’ Two vans will be driven around the London boroughs of Hounslow, Barking & Dagenham, Ealing, Barnet, Brent and Redbridge, displaying figures on how many illegal migrants have been arrested recently in each area. Mr Crosby said: ‘I will confirm that I was approached by Westbourne Communications to have a meeting to discuss a range of political issues. They raised a number of issues, it was a private meeting. Somebody is being deliberately mischievous.’ James Bethell, director of Westbourne, said: ‘People in politics chit-chat about strategy, moan about their opponents and bounce ideas around all the time. It would be a grave mistake to read too much into a matey midsummer chinwag.’ A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times this weekend puts the Conservatives on 32 per cent, six points behind Labour, while UKIP is on 13 per cent, three points ahead of the Liberal Democrats.","Lynton Crosby also said the vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home' played into UKIP leader's hands .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:26 EST, 24 September 2013 . Police are combing Welsh farmland in a hunt for a body they believe was buried in secret by a suspected slave gang. Officers have drafted in forensic archaeologists to search a plot in Marshfield, near Newport, South Wales after gaining new intelligence on the activities of a suspected slave gang. In total more than 100 policemen are investigating the gang, believed to be run by travellers who force their captives to work 12-hour days with no rest and no pay. Hunt: Police officers are pictured here on Monday as part of the operation . Large-scale: The investigation - called Operation Imperial - involves more than 150 officers . The search began after police made dawn raids on a series of properties around Newport in which four people were arrested. Three addresses were targeted by police as part of a long--running operation on workers kept in ‘slave conditions’. A 66-year-old man and a woman, 42, both from Marshfield, a Cardiff man, 36, and a woman, 42, from Penhow were taken into custody. An east European man was also taken from the Marshfield address to hospital for assessment of his physical and mental condition. The . investigation into the suspected slavery gang began after police found a . man who said he escaped from the gang after being enslaved for 13 . years. Darrell Simester, 43, . from Worcestershire was reunited with his family after he was found . living in a filthy caravan in South Wales with no running water. Specialists: The hunt was launched after new intelligence on activities linked to slavery was found . Police presence: Four people were arrested on Monday in a dawn raid. Three more people have now been arrested. He was starving, wearing dirty, torn clothes and had teeth missing. Darrell claimed he had been treated like a slave by his masters - who lured him in by offering him a job. He said he was forced to work 12 hours a day and was never given a day off or allowed to visit a doctor, but he was so scared of punishment that he didn't try to escape.

'We are already taking action on a number of fronts. We are working with front line professionals to help them better identify and support potential victims.

The U.S. has made a rare public condemnation towards Israel after Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon reportedly criticized Secretary of State John Kerry's peace plans for Palestine. Israel's most widely-read newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, published comments today Yaaloon made in private before one of Kerry's trips to the region. 'Secretary of State John Kerry - who has come to us determined and is acting out of an incomprehensible obsession and a messianic feeling - cannot teach me a single thing about the conflict with the Palestinians,' Yaalon reportedly said. 'The only thing that can save us is if Kerry wins the Nobel prize and leaves us alone.' Yaalon added. Scroll Down for Video . 'Obsessive' and 'messianic': Secretary of State John Kerry (left) meets with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon. The U.S. shot back at the Israelis today after their widest-read newspaper published negative comments Yaalon made about Kerry . Following the story, U.S. officials called out the statements. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said if the statements were true they were 'offensive and inappropriate, especially given all that the United States is doing to support Israel's security needs'. Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to address the statements in Parliament today, reaffirming loyalty to the U.S. 'our greatest ally'. 'Even when we have disagreements with the United States, they always pertain to the matter at hand, and are not personal,' Netanyahu said. Yaalon himself responded to the comments in a written statement - issuing much the same message as Netanyahu but without denying that he said the statements. 'When there are disagreements, we work through them inside the room - including with Secretary of State Kerry, with whom I hold many conversations about Israel's future,' Yaalon said. Yaalon has been critical in the past about any future peace with Palestine. Mediator: Sec Kerry helped restart peace talks between Israel and Palestine last July . Before serving as defense minister, Yaalon was military chief but left that position before the 2005 Gaza pullout which he was against. He's become more outspoken lately with the recent resumption of peace talks with Palestine after a three-year stop. 'There are no actual negotiations with the Palestinians,' Yaalon said. 'The Americans are holding negotiations with us and in parallel with the Palestinians. So far, we are the only side to have given anything â€“ the release of murderers â€“ and the Palestinians have given nothing.' In order to start negotiations, the Israelis agreed to free 104 of the longest-serving Palestinians. The controversial report appeared one day after the funeral of Ariel Sharon, Israel's former prime minister, which was attended by Vice President Joe Biden.","Israel's most widely-read newspaper published explosive comments allegedly made by Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon about U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry .

'Repaid with betrayal': Sergeant Michael Anderson with his wife Jolene, who yesterday slammed the MoD for its 'devious' decision to axe him . A soldier will miss out on almost £175,000 after his job was axed by defence bosses just 72 hours before he qualified for a full service pension. Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, was within three days of claiming a lifetime pension deal worth £261,278 for 18 years’ service. He will now have to wait until he is 60 before receiving a package worth less than £90,000. The case has fuelled suspicions that . the Army, which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost-cutting exercise, . is targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime . payments. Critics have accused the Government of breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation’s duty of care to troops. Sgt Anderson serves with the Royal . Dragoon Guards and has completed tours of duty in Northern Ireland and . Iraq. He now faces the prospect of losing his job, home and financial . security. His wife Jolene, 32, a mental health care manager, said her husband had been ‘repaid with betrayal’. ‘He is crushed,’ she said. ‘It is . disgraceful that he has been discarded just three days short of . qualifying for his immediate pension. 'My husband has been building a . secure foundation for a future for our family and now we are going to be . potentially homeless. ‘He has been expected to live by and uphold the Army’s values of respect, integrity, loyalty and commitment. ‘Yet what respect, integrity and loyalty has he been shown by the MoD? Absolutely none. ‘We fully understand that cuts in . personnel have to be made throughout the Armed Forces and across the . public sector. But to wrench his pension away from him so close to . qualifying is devious and completely undermines the values on which the . Army is supposed to pride itself.’ Sgt Anderson, a father of two, lives in service housing in Catterick, North Yorkshire. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or injured troops. He was told last month he had been selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer with a 12-month notice period. Soldiers must serve 18 years to earn . an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army. Sgt . Anderson was stunned to find out his redundancy starts on June 18 next . year – after 17 years and 362 days. Veteran: Sgt Anderson serves with the Royal Dragoon Guards and has completed tours of duty in Northern Ireland and Iraq. He now faces the prospect of losing his job, home and financial security . The axe also fell just two weeks before he was presented with a medal for long service and good conduct. He now receives a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reaches 60. Had he reached 18 years he would have been given £261,278 – a £51,926 lump sum plus £8,723 a year until the age of 60. The difference between the two deals is £173,861. Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister, said the Government had left soldiers on the ‘financial scrapheap’. ‘This is no way to treat someone who has given their life to the defence of their country,’ he said. Soldiers must serve 18 years to earn an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army. Sgt Anderson was stunned to find out his redundancy starts on June 18 next year ¿ after 17 years and 362 days . Jayne Bullock, of campaign group Pensions Justice For Troops, said the MoD was saving £40million by axing about 100 servicemen with less than a year to go before reaching their full pension payouts. ‘It is an absolutely appalling way to treat soldiers who have seen more active service than any group since World War Two,’ she said. ‘The Government is treating them as economic collateral damage. It is morally wrong and it stinks.’ The MoD said it had to ‘draw the line somewhere’ and claimed the 1.2 per cent of personnel close to their immediate pension point will get a larger tax-free lump sum. ‘This is in addition to their resettlement grant and in some cases could total over £100,000,’ said a spokesman.","Sergeant Michael Anderson loses out on £261,000 retirement package .

BBC presenter Susanna Reid turned up the heat on her breakfast show yesterday by flirting with a rock star 15 years her junior during an interview. The 42-year-old star raised eyebrows during her chat with Arctic Monkeys band member Alex Turner, which led to her telling him: ‘I bet you look good on the dance floor.’ After watching Miss Reid playing with her hair during the exchange with the singer and guitarist, viewers immediately took to Twitter to express their astonishment about her ‘flirtatious’ behaviour.

Miss Reid, who has three sons with her long-term boyfriend Dominic Cotton, is taking part in the current series of Strictly Come Dancing. She was interviewing Turner, who is dating glamorous American actress Arielle Vandenberg, about the band’s album, AM, on BBC Breakfast yesterday. At the end of the five-minute clip, she urged him to join Strictly Come Dancing, referencing the band’s 2005 hit, I Bet You Look Good on the Dance Floor. She said: ‘When I said I was interviewing you, people did say, “would he do Strictly?” because they bet that you look good on the dance floor.’ Turner, 27, replied: ‘Of course... I should have been the one that said you look good on the dance floor.’ Happy in her work: Reid flirted her way through the interview . Reid's co-presenter Bill Turnbull looked bemused and said 'that was very laidback' Reaction: Viewers took to Twitter in their droves to comment on the flirty interview . Miss Reid then replied: ‘Except that I’m not sure that would be accurate. I look a bit of a mess on the dance floor’, before Turner flashed a smile and said: ‘I doubt that.’ As the interview ended and the camera cut back to the studio, Bill Turnbull, Miss Reid’s co-presenter, jokingly embarrassed her by saying: ‘Oh, you get such a rapport with him, don’t you? 'People never said to you ""go on, ask him about Strictly"".' An embarrassed Miss Reid laughed and replied: 'Don't deny it now, ""ask him about Strictly"" you said.' Mr Turnbull quickly moved on to the show's next item but went on to refer to Miss Reid's interview with Turner as an 'exhilarating encounter'.

William Hague promised to stand by Gibraltar last night as he urged Spain to avoid further actions which could ramp up tensions. After talks with Gibraltar’s leader Fabian Picardo, the Foreign Secretary said: ‘The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with the people of Gibraltar at this time of increasing Spanish pressure and rhetoric. ‘We will respect Gibraltar’s 2006 constitution and the commitments the UK has repeatedly made not to compromise on British sovereignty over Gibraltar.’ Alarm: David Cameron is demanding an explanation over threats from Spain to impose border charges on Gibraltar . And he added: ‘I call upon Spain to respect the agreements over the Rock and to avoid actions which could increase tension further.’ Mr Picardo claimed ‘hell will freeze over’ before Gibraltarian authorities remove an artificial reef Spain believes is harming its fisherman and which has been at the centre of escalating tensions. Accusing Madrid of ‘sabre-rattling’, he said: ‘The things that have been said are more reminiscent of the type of statement you’d hear from North Korea than from an EU partner. ‘We’ve seen it before during Franco’s time but I think all of us hoped that those politics were never going to come back.’ Row: Gibraltar minister Fabian Picardo (left) hit out at the aggressive stance of Spain's foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo who threatened to charge thousands of workers £85 a day to cross the border . Spanish officials have continued to delay vehicles at the border, with moped and motorbike riders facing queues of two hours in 90-degree heat to cross over from Gibraltar. Spain claims sovereignty over the Rock, which has been a British Overseas Territory since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Last week Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo threatened to levy tolls on border crossings and shut Spanish airspace to flights bound for Gibraltar. But the UK Government has made it clear that there will be no negotiation over sovereignty as long as Gibraltar’s people want to remain British. David Cameron has now flown home from his holiday and will take charge of the crisis. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘Clearly, we remain seriously concerned by the events at the Spain-Gibraltar border. ‘The Spanish have not raised the prospect of introducing border fees with us. We are seeking an explanation from them regarding reports that they might target Gibraltar with further measures.’ Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work . Queues: A woman gets out of a car as she waits in line to enter to the British territory of Gibraltar at its border with Spain . Senior MPs and government officials have accused Madrid of ramping up the dispute to divert attention from the dire state of the Spanish economy. Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘The Spanish are in deep trouble. Their economy is in grave difficulties. They raise the issue of Gibraltar to generate domestic support. ‘Frankly, it’s shameful for a country like Spain, who is meant to be an ally to the United Kingdom, to treat Gibraltar in this way. It’s time they grew up and behaved like a democracy instead of bullying a small territory which has been British longer than it was Spanish.’ Lib Dem Sir Menzies Campbell warned that Spain’s tactics were unlikely to succeed. ‘It’s a gross miscalculation to believe that the people of Gibraltar, or the British Government, are likely to succumb to pressure of the kind that’s being proposed,’ he said. ‘If anything, it will simply stiffen resolve both in Whitehall and Gibraltar.’ And UKIP’s MEP for Gibraltar, William Dartmouth, even suggested that Britain send a gunboat to the Rock. He said: ‘It is time the British Government pulled its finger out and stopped mouthing diplomatic niceties to Madrid. ‘The British Government must show some backbone to support the people of Gibraltar. ‘By sending a frigate to Gib, the message will ring out loud and clear: Gibraltar is British.’ The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltar from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own . affairs, although defence and foreign relations are still the . responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres.","Fabian Picardo hits back at Spanish aggression over borders and air space .

According to sources, Mrs Berry could quit Bake Off if Hollywood is axed for tarnishing the BBC2 show’s wholesome image. News that he left his wife of 14 years Alexandra, 49, amid reports of a growing closeness with Marcela Valladolid has angered many viewers. BBC bosses are said to have held high-level talks over Hollywood’s future with the show. Mrs Berry, 78, is said to be adamant that he remain, and is seen by many as his ‘saviour’. It has even been suggested that she could walk away herself, rather than continue without Hollywood, with whom she has appeared on the BBC2 series since it began in 2010. The pair have helped turn The Great British Bake Off into a major success for the BBC, attracting almost seven million viewers in the last series. Earlier this month the show also won a Bafta. Asked if Hollywood’s private life was causing concern among show bosses, a source said: ‘That is an understatement – it’s a complete nightmare. 'Needless to say the public reaction hasn’t been good. Bake Off is such a wholesome show it really doesn’t help us. ‘The team is split about 60-40 saying that he should stay, although it’s all dependent on public opinion.

Close: The chefs have been firm friends since meeting eight years ago . He refused to comment when approached by the Daily Mail. He and Mrs Berry first met eight years ago on a Food Channel series. Off-screen they share a strong bond and Hollywood affectionately refers to Mrs Berry as ‘Bezza’. Hollywood and Miss Valladolid, 34, are said to have ‘hit it off from day one’ of filming in the US. Hollywood has since moved out of his marital home in Kent to a studio flat, while last week it emerged Miss Valladolid had split from her husband.

One of the Coalition’s flagship free schools submitted false invoices and wrongly claimed tens of thousands of pounds of public money. Kings Science Academy in Bradford was given £86,335 in funding that had ‘not been used for its intended purpose’. It charged for first class travel, parties, buying furniture for staff and submitted ‘fabricated invoices’ to the Department for Education for rent it did not actually pay. Praise: Prime Minister David Cameron visits the flagship Kings Science Academy in Bradford last year . The revelation, broadcast in a BBC2 . Newsnight investigation last night, is a major embarrassment for the . Government and follows a series of controversies about free schools. Last week, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as ‘dysfunctional’. Free schools can be set up by charities, parents and teachers and are independent of local authority control. Kings Science Academy was one of the . first free schools to open in September 2011 and was praised by David . Cameron on a visit last year. An inquiry was launched following . allegations raised by a whistleblower about the way the school was being . governed. Concerns raised by accountants hired . by the school led to a ‘forensic’ investigation by the Education Funding . Agency. Last week, the Al-Madinah free school in Derby was threatened with closure after Ofsted criticised it as 'dysfunctional' Its final report published yesterday, found that of a £182,933 . grant made to the school before it opened, £86,335 had not been used for . its intended purposes. Invoices worth £59,560 were not supported by any evidence of payments being made. This included ‘fabricated’ invoices to the sum of £10,800 to cover rent for office accommodation. A total of £26,775 had been overpaid . against legitimate payments. The report revealed how more than £600 was . spent on parties or meals, £169 went to a teacher to buy new clothes, . payments were made to cover staff rent and furniture purchases and the . former vice chairman of governors was allowed to travel first class. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, described the financial irregularities as a 'disgrace' The former chairman of governors was . paid £2,400 for holding three meetings in a way that appeared to be . ‘contrary to the funding agreement’ of the school. The Department for Education . yesterday insisted a plan has been put in place to recover funds and the . school has been asked to address concerns urgently. The school was issued with a warning . notice in May and has since implemented a plan to restructure its . governing body and appoint an experienced finance director. Christine Blower, of the National Union of Teachers, said: ‘It is now apparent that the DfE has been sitting on the report detailing financial irregularities at the Kings Science Academy since May and only released it once it became clear that the NUT had released to the press its own document outlining financial irregularities at the school. ‘The catalogue of irregularities and what frankly points to fraud in the management of the school’s finances acknowledged in the DfE’s investigation report is a disgrace. ‘Problems around good governance, financial probity and standards of education are emerging in increasing numbers of free schools.

School summer holidays have not yet ended, but one British town has already begun the countdown to Christmas. Tenterden in Kent has put up and turned on their Christmas lights 115 days before December 25. The Christmas lights switch-on was announced online by town councillor Sue Ferguson, who posted a photo of the lights and said: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights going up!!’ A bit early, perhaps? Christmas lights are already blazing in Tenterden, Kent, four months before the big day . Eager: Sue Ferguson and Jonathan Medes, from Tenterden Chamber of Commerce, with the contractors who put the Christmas lights up . Residents took to Twitter to express their surprise at the decorations appearing before summer had finished. Andy Nicholason tweeted: ‘Apparently Tenterden have got some Christmas lights up already in the High Street.’ Another, Simon Abbott, 43, said: ‘It’s still more than 100 days until Christmas and the sun is still blazing away. ‘Nobody wants to think about the cold winter coming up - we want to enjoy the sun while it lasts not start thinking about presents, turkey and snow.’ The switch-on is part of an experiment by the council to look into how to keep the cost of celebrating Christmas low, after £15,000 worth of lights were stolen last year. The Tenterden Chamber of Commerce rigged up the lights as a trial and plan to add lights and decorations to nine other trees in the coming weeks. A tweet from Tenterden Town added: ‘Tenterden Christmas lights coming along, are we the first town in the country?’ Jonathan Medes, the Chamber of Commerce’s events officer, said: ‘It looks pretty good. With the money we have, we will be able to light some of the big trees this year, so Tenterden will not be in the dark.’ ‘The lights are timed to come on at 9.15pm and go off at 11.30pm. ‘We think we will be able to get lights in ten trees, in addition to the small trees and lights above the shops. At least there will be some impact. ‘Whatever happens, there will be lights this year. We are doing something.’ It was a similar story in Cardiff, as shoppers were shocked to big red stockings and reindeer toys on sale at The Mamas & Papas store in Cardiff this August. The children's chain also has table full of Christmas presents and gift ideas - even though pupils haven't yet gone back to school after the summer holidays. A spokesman for the retailer said the displays will be going up in their other shops across the UK in the next fortnight. Deck the halls, already: Mamas&Papas in Cardiff are selling festive products . Father-of-two Barry Evans, 36, said: 'People talk about Christmas coming early but this is ridiculous. 'I had to rub my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things - August isn't even out yet and they're trying to make us feel all festive. 'Shops seem to start their big Christmas push earlier each year, I think it spoils what's so special about it. 'I don't know how people can think about getting Christmas presents when the children haven't even finished their summer holidays yet.' The Christmas products were spotted at the Mamas & Papas store at the St David's shopping centre in Cardiff. Christmas comes early: Shoppers were stunned to see the festive display before children have even gone back to school . The display features teddies, nativity kits and cuddly elves holding candy canes. Pregnant Caroline Brown, 41, who already has two young boys and has a third on the way, said she was 'appalled' by the festive display. She said: 'I felt like it was exploiting my children. I walked in to get a push chair and now all my boys have been talking about is Christmas. 'They keep asking how many sleeps is it to go, when Santa is going to come and if they've been good this year.' Only 116 days to go! A spokesman for the retailer said they wanted to give customers plenty of time to stock up for Christmas . Mamas & Papas, who have more than 60 stores across the UK, specialise in prams, pushchairs, car seats, cots, highchairs, nursery furniture, bedding and toys. A spokeswoman for the retailer said: 'With us being a parenting store we consider planning a very important thing. We want to give our customers plenty of time to make their choices and budget for what can be a very busy time. 'We are in the process of rolling this out across the UK over the next fortnight.' But Mamas & Papas aren't the only ones who are feeling the Christmas spirit already.","Tree in town of Tenterden adorned with blazing bulbs .

Mariella Frostrup, pictured, will present Channel 4's new show Sex Box on Monday . They were too embarrassed to tell family and friends. And when they made their debut performance – having sex in front of a television audience – they were terrified they would be too nervous to go through with it. Now Lynette Ellis and her partner Des Lashimba will doubtless face a public outcry when they appear on Channel 4’s provocative programme Sex Box, in which they have sex shrouded from view in a box in a television studio. The programme – from the channel which in the past faced a furore over screening a live autopsy and aired uncensored footage of penetrative sex in the movie The Idiots – is the latest offering from the broadcaster that seems determined to offend. ‘Des was terrified he wouldn’t be able to do what was needed,’ Lynette confessed. ‘But I wore some sexy underwear and that seemed to do the trick.’ Lynette, 39, insisted she and Des, 41, are not exhibitionists. ‘We have sex as part of a normal, healthy and loving relationship,’ she said. ‘I hope people will look at the programme in a positive light.’ But while Channel 4 claims Sex Box is ‘pushing the boundaries of British television’ and will prompt intelligent debate at a time when an alarming 30 per cent of online traffic is to porn sites, critics have branded the show a cheap entertainment stunt. Many have taken to Twitter to suggest the programme is even worse than soft porn because it masquerades as a public service. Scores have branded the notion of sex on television disgusting. Mary Beadnell wrote: ‘What the hell have we become as human beings?’ while Miranda said: ‘So there’s a new show called Sex Box where people have sex on TV . . . sounds like porn to me.’ Others accused the broadcaster of cynically trying to boost ratings after it was outperformed by Channel 5 for the first time in its history in July. Presented by Mariella Frostrup, the show features three couples – one of them gay – who each enter a box, and have sex for 35 minutes before emerging to talk about their experiences with psychotherapist Phillip Hodson, sex therapist Tracey Cox and relationship expert Dan Savage. Couple Des and Lynette will have sex in the box, pictured left, on the show and then talk about the experience with experts. Neither of the pair have told their parents that they are involved in the show . Miss Frostrup said she initially had ‘great trepidation’ about the show but now thinks ‘it is a really mature look at a subject we’ve allowed to proliferate in its worst manifestations and refuse to confront’. The programme is based on the work of sex therapists who encourage couples to have sex then talk about it immediately afterwards while their feelings are vivid. Lynette and Des admitted there was no romantic ‘warm-up’ before they walked into the opaque, sound-proofed box, where they had 35 minutes to have sex before emerging to talk about it with the sex experts. ‘Usually we’d take a lot more than half an hour from start to finish so it was a bit stressful,’ says Lynette. The couple said they were more used to spicing up their sex life with romantic weekends. But there were no rose petals scattered on the bed in the box. ‘It looked like a basic room in a budget hotel,’ said Lynette, a mother of three. ‘It had a double bed, side tables with a lamp, a mini-disc player and a sink. It wasn’t quite what we’d expected.’ There is little that can be seen through the box, and only when the lights on the outside turn from red to amber do the audience get the hint that the interlude is almost over. Lynette said she had been more nervous coming out of the room than going in. ‘We don’t usually talk about sex after we’ve done it and I was concerned what the experts were going to ask,’ she says. ‘Sex can be stress relieving, it is the ultimate anti-depressant. Sex is important to us within our relationship but not the most important thing in the world.’ Three sets of couples will take part in the show which also features experts Phillip Hodson, left, Tracey Cox, centre, and Dan Savage . The Mail on Sunday was given exclusive access to the programme which discusses issues including multiple partners, myths about gay sex and uses several sexual words that justify its 10pm slot. Producers adopt a light-hearted talk-show tone throughout. When Lynette and Des were approached by researchers to take part in the show, they had no idea it would involve having sex in a box. ‘We just thought it was going to be talking about sex,’ said Lynette. ‘When they mentioned having sex, Des had reservations. We are private people and had the feelings of the children to take into account. ‘I know they might get a bit of teasing but they didn’t object to it. We felt confident the programme wasn’t going to show sex in a dirty or degrading way and I don’t feel we have done anything to be ashamed of.’ The couple have not yet seen the show. They say they will watch it before allowing their children to see it. The biggest surprise is likely to be for Lynette’s mum, who thought the couple had gone for a romantic weekend in London. Des’s dad has also not been told. ‘It might be a bit of a shock for them,’ Lynette said.

Dubbed the Crazy Luxor bar, the sculptural piece is shaped like a stiletto and is finished in a high shine black lacquer with, it stands to reason, a red trim to echo the designer's signature red sole (always worked in Pantone's 186c, fact fans). Christian Louboutin has designed a bar which will be auctioned off at the Goose Winter Ball to benefit the Elton John AIDS Foundation later this month . The ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics on the facade of the bar are in honour of Louboutin's love of Egypt - he owns properties in the country and visits twice a year to gather inspiration for his lines.The bar will go on auction at the Architecture of Taste-themed ball, to be held on 29 October in Battersea Park, London. As part of the prize, the winner will also be given a cocktail party on the date of their choice to be held at their home, with cocktails served by a mixologist from their brand new Louboutin bar. Oh, and they'll get a pair of Louboutin shoes thrown in for good measure. Previous names who have been behind the design of the bar include Jean Paul Gaultier, Elizabeth Hurley and Lily Allen, whose Lil Box of Tracks bar (the bar opened up to reveal DJ turntables and leather seating) fetched a record Â£100,000 at the 2009 auction. The bar is lacquered in a glossy black with a red trim to echo the designer's signature red soles .

Rare odds: The gamblers won on a game of mini-baccarat after the deck of cards produced 41 winning hands in a row . A casino is suing a group of gamblers who won $1.5million in a game of mini-baccarat after a deck of unshuffled cards landed 41 winning hands in a row. The Golden Nugget Atlantic City is refusing to pay the players their winnings even though they broke no rules. It claims the game was illegal because the cards were unshuffled, despite a promise from their manufacturer that they would be pre-shuffled and ready to use. The fiasco took place during a low-stakes version of the popular card game where players are dealt hands while trying to predict if they will beat the banker. But when the 14 players kept seeing the same sequence of cards dealt, over and over and over again, their eyes grew wide and their bets grew bigger, growing from $10 a hand to $5,000. They became surrounded by casino security guards and management who were convinced they had cheated but unable to prove how. The April 30 incident was the latest instance of unshuffled cards causing big headaches for an Atlantic City casino. In December, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort used unshuffled mini-baccarat cards for 3 1/2 hours before realizing something was wrong. That episode led to a $91,000 fine against the casino, which fired nine people it said were involved. But in the case of the Golden Nugget, the gamblers did nothing wrong, and deserve to be paid the nearly $1 million they still have coming to them, according to their lawyer, Benjamin Dash. 'The Golden Nugget appealed to gamblers to come in and play games licensed and sanctioned by the state of New Jersey,' he said. 'My clients did exactly that, and then were denied their winnings. Gambling mecca: The game took place at eh Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey . 'There is absolutely no law in New Jersey that would permit the Golden Nugget to declare the game illegal because it failed to provide shuffled cards.' But in a lawsuit filed against the 14 . gamblers in July, that is exactly what the casino seeks, citing state . gambling regulations requiring all casino games to offer fair odds - to . both sides. The . casino's lawsuit asserts the gamblers and the casino both began the game . believing it was legal and proper - until the players kept winning over . and over again. The Golden . Nugget said it flooded the area with floor persons, managers, . supervisors, surveillance and security officers, believing they were . watching 'a sophisticated swindling and cheating scheme' in progress. Under the boardwalk: Atlantic City is named 'Gambling Capital of the East Coast', second only to Las Vegas in number of casinos, yearly gaming revenue, and number of rooms . 'From the beginning to the end of play, however, plaintiff could not identify any particular act of those players that actually constituted swindling and cheating,' the casino wrote in its lawsuit. Accordingly, it let nine of the players cash out $558,900 worth of chips. The other players still have $977,800 in chips that they have not yet cashed in. The game is built on a simple premise: Who will end up with a better hand, the player or the banker? Gamblers . are dealt two cards and predict whether they will beat the banker, . typically a position that rotates among the players at the table. Smaller . tables, known as midi-baccarat, start at $100 limits and look more like . large blackjack tables, skipping the rotating banker and leaving that . role to the dealer. Even smaller-limit tables are called mini-baccarat. The Golden Nugget also asserted in its lawsuit that Gemaco, Inc., a Missouri playing card manufacturer, acknowledged it had provided a defective shipment of cards that were not pre-shuffled. A message left at the company's administrative offices was not immediately returned Monday. Three of the Golden Nugget gamblers have filed a counter-suit against the casino, alleging the gambling house discriminated against them based on their Chinese heritage. The three are from Atlantic City, Queens and Brooklyn, N.Y. One of them, Hua Shi of Brooklyn claims he was sleeping in his room at the casino when someone knocked on the door. When he answered, he was rushed by four Golden Nugget employees who pinned him against the wall and searched him and his belongings, according to his lawsuit. He said casino personnel held him in a room without food, water or an interpreter for eight hours. After a second search of his room, he was released, his lawsuit asserts. The casino called the allegations in the gamblers' lawsuit 'completely false.' 'The Golden Nugget values all of its customers and would never discriminate against anyone, including the Asian community,' it said in a statement. 'In fact, the Golden Nugget designed and built an Asian gaming area and restaurant to specifically attract Asian guests to the casino. 'The countersuit has no merit and is nothing more than a ploy by the gamblers and their lawyers to tarnish the Golden Nugget's reputation in order to gain an economic advantage in the lawsuit. We will not let this happen.' Since the December incident with the mini-baccarat cards, the Trump Taj Mahal has installed a $2.2 million digital recording system which it says has greatly improved its surveillance capabilities, and the surveillance department has added eight officers.","The Golden Nugget Atlantic City claims the game was illegal because the cards were unshuffled .

Pearl Cantrell, 105, said eating bacon is the secret to her long life . The grandmother eats plates of rashers and is so passionate about bacon she wants others to eat more . Mrs Cantrell told local TV station KRBC: 'I love bacon, I could eat it for every meal - and I do. 'I want other people to eat bacon. I tell them too. My kids all eat it.' A local producer, who shares her love of processed meat, organised a treat in the food van, dubbed the 'Wienermobile', followed by a gift of even more bacon. Abraham Luna, who works for Oscar Mayer's company, told the TV station: 'We have seen a lot of thing on the road but not quite like this one. 'We know she is an inspiration for the community and friends and family so we had to make a special stop here for her.' Mrs Cantrell seems not to want to eat anything but bacon and will happily have a plate of fried rashers by themselves.

'And I think this today, will keep her going, she will talk about this for months.' Unfortunately, Pearl's diet claims are not backed up by scientists. In March this year, a Europe-wide study of almost half a million men and women linked processed meat to deaths from cancer and heart disease. The research found that eating more than 20g a day of processed meat - equal to one rasher of cheap bacon - could be to blame for about one in 30 deaths.","Pearl Cantrell, from Richland Springs, Texas, eats bacon every day .

The Home Secretary announces will announce plans to deport thousands of foreign criminals under tough new rules - many before they have been prosecuted . A quarter of Britain's organised gangs are operated by foreign criminals, it has today been revealed. An official study of Britain's criminal world - to be released tomorrow - is expected to say that there are more than 5,500 organised criminal gangs operating in the country - with 25 per cent run by international syndicates. Security sources say the greatest . threat to the UK comes from Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, . Poland, Lithuania and Vietnam. Albania and Turkey are also causing concern. It comes as the Home Secretary announces plans to deport thousands of foreign criminals under tough new rules - many before they have been prosecuted. Of the 37,000 gang members 'targeting Britain' according to the Home Office - 7,400 are classed as 'high harm' foreign criminals, the Sunday Times reports. The Home Office said new measures to be outlined by Theresa May on Monday  aim to  identify, disrupt and eject foreign criminals operating within our shores while also stepping up protective measures to stop them reaching Britain in the first place. She will tomorrow launch the £450mn National Crime Agency (NCA) - dubbed Britain's FBI - as she reveals that organised crime is costing the UK £34bn a year, with cybercrime costing a further £2bn. New measures will see immigration officers based in police stations, who will identify overseas criminals and whether they are here illegally. They will immediately run background checks for previous convictions and to see if they are wanted abroad. If there is enough evidence, they will be prosecuted here then deported. But if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute them in Britain, and they are found to be here illegally, or to already have a conviction abroad, they will be deported. Anyone deported will be banned from the country for a decade. A pilot scheme in London - codenamed operation Nexus - has seen 1,000 foreign criminals were kicked out in just 18 months. As the scheme expands across the country, officers will join forces with European police to tackle cross-continental gang syndicates. The Sunday Times reports that many of the organised crime groups commit economic crime, with foreign gangsters - operating from Spain and the Canary Islands -  targeting the pensions of hard working people with 'pension liberation funds'. They typically use false websites and advertising to coax people to cash in their pensions by transferring them to a fake early access scheme. A Home Office spokesman said:  'Operation Nexus, the joint Border Force-Met Police information sharing programme, has seen more than 1,000 foreign criminals kicked out of the country in the 18 months it has been in operation. 'It tackles individuals who may not have been convicted but where intelligence exists that shows a pattern of arrests or association with serious criminality. It has already been exported to West Midlands Police and will now be expanded to the rest of the country as part of the Organised Crime Strategy. 'The strategy will also expand the traditional anti-gang targets of gun and gun crime to include the emerging threats of human trafficking, child sexual exploitation and cyber crime. 'And it will seek to strengthen UK law enforcement work overseas, which last year saw the seizure of over 60 tonnes of cocaine and nearly 5 tonnes of heroin and the arrest of 1,500 people.' Planning for the NCA, which will be accountable to Home Secretary Theresa May, has been under way for the past three years. The new body will take on the roles of the old Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), parts of the Border Agency, National Police Improvement Agency, and the police’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. It represents the culmination of an effort that began in the 1970s, with the first attempts to make the UK’s 45 police forces work more closely together – and then to the creation of  forerunners such as SOCA and the now defunct National Criminal Intelligence Service. Supporters are determined to avoid the pitfalls which beset earlier efforts. SOCA, which was chaired for three years by former MI5 boss Sir Stephen Lander, was widely criticised for pursuing too few cases.","Greatest .

Hackers have shut down Al Qaeda's communication network, crippling the group's ability to send messages and videos around the world using the internet. After terrorising US and UK government and intelligence networks in recent weeks, the computer activists finally appear to have switched tactics, now targeting the major enemy of the West. 'Al Qaeda's online communications have been temporarily crippled, and it . does not have a single trusted distribution channel available on the . Internet,' Evan Kohlmann, of Flashpoint Global Partners, which . monitors the group's communications, announced. Crippled: Not only has Al Qaeda lost former leader Osama Bin Laden, its means of communication has now also been struck . The attack on Al Qaeda's network was carried out in the last few days and was 'well . coordinated and involved the use of an unusual cocktail of relatively . sophisticated techniques,' Kohlmann told MSNBC. 'My guess is that it will take them at least several days more to repair . the damage and get their network up and functioning again.' This is the second time the group has been subject to large scale online infiltration in just over a year. The UK government hacked into an Al Qaeda website last year, replacing bomb-making instructions with recipes for making cupcakes. Meanwhile, the FBI has raided the home of a woman in Iowa as it continues its investigation into hacking group LulzSec. At least eight agents turned up on Laurelai Bailey's doorstep and spent five hours interviewing her about her connections with the hackers, who have attacked high-profile targets including Sony, the FBI and the CIA. Miss Bailey was not arrested, but her admission to having spent time with the hackers online was enough to get her fired from her job at a tech support company in Davenport. Closing in: The homepage of disbanded hacking group LolzSec. The FBI is stepping up its investigation after members wreaked havoc across the internet . The raid is a sign the FBI are trying to close in on LulzSec, a splinter group of elite hackers from the more benign network, Anonymous. LulzSec announced they were disbanding on Saturday after 50 days in which they wreaked havoc across the internet. All six alleged members had been identified by rival hackers, and last week one of them, British 19-year-old Ryan Cleary, was charged with allegedly hacking into Soca, the UK's equivalent of the FBI. But one member used Skype to tell the Associated Press: 'We're not quitting because we're afraid of law enforcement. The press are getting bored of us, and we're getting bored of us.' The FBI has now stepped up its attempts to track them down, and is believed to be speaking to anyone who has ever associated with the group online. Miss Bailey, 29, told Gawker she opened her door at 11am last Thursday to find eight FBI agents on her doorstep, holding a search warrant. Publicity: LulzSec revelled in their newfound fame, and used Twitter to promote their cyber-attacks up until they disbanded last weekend . In January, Miss Bailey was in a chatroom talking to members of LulzSec as they carried out a cyberattack on security firm HBGary. She claims she was reporting on the attack for Crowdleaks, a site similar to Wikileaks, and insists she was never a member of LulzSec. Miss Bailey told Gawker the agents were particularly interested in a LulzSec hacker called 'Kayla', who is believed to be a woman, and even asked her to infiltrate the group. She said: 'They wanted to know if I could get close to them. I told them these people hate me.' According to Miss Bailey, the group hold a grudge against her after she released the chat logs from the HBGary attack. After the interview, the agents confiscated her hard drives, camera and other computer equipment. Accused: British teenager Ryan Cleary is led away from court in London after being charged with hacking into website of Soca, the UK's FBI equivalent . She lost her job soon afterwards when she told an online friend about the raid, and they published her real name and contact details online, portraying her as a Lulzsec 'snitch'. She told Gawker: 'They fired me... because I was apparently making the company look bad.' Meanwhile police in Arizona are continuing their investigation after the . elite band of hackers gained access to the state's Department of Public . Safety email servers. Unlike the larger group, Anonymous, LulzSec seemed to revel in their new-found fame, gaining more than 280,000 Twitter followers and being publicised in mainstream and tech media alike. While Anonymous usually attacks political targets, like Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe, LulzSec seemed to create mayhem just because they could. Over the 50-day period, the group claimed hacks on major . entertainment companies, FBI partner organisations, the CIA, the US . Senate and a pornography website. They also hacked Fox.com and published dozens of logs from British ATMs.","Terror group left 'without a single trusted distribution channel'

Internet retailer Amazon employs hundreds of staff on controversial zero-hour contracts subjecting them to harsh working conditions where they wear tags so they can be tracked by bosses, it has been revealed. Employees working under the contracts are not guaranteed any income but are still subjected to an employment regime that sees them walking up to 15 miles during a shift, while their toilet breaks are monitored and timed. It is also claimed they can be sacked and re-hired. Amazon has already been criticised by MPs for its tax avoidance practices and could come under further pressure after the strict regime was exposed. Terms: Employees working under the contracts are subjected to an employment regime that sees them walking up to 15 miles during a shift. A file photo of the company's Swansea distribution centre is pictured . Use of zero-hour contracts has thrived despite calls for them to be banned, with the Office for National Statistics saying that 250,000 British workers were employed in this way at the end of last year by a range of firms, including Sports Direct and even Buckingham Palace. Former staff at Amazon’s warehouse in Rugeley, Staffordshire, said they were hired for 12 weeks before being sacked and re-employed so that the company did not have to give them the same rights as full-time employees. Martin Parton, who says he was employed on three different occasions, said: ‘I think they had it all mapped out. They just got rid of you when they felt like it.’ An investigation by Channel 4 News found that employees are tracked using GPS tags while inside the warehouse. If staff are found to breach any of the company’s rules, such as talking to colleagues or leaving work early, they can be dismissed on a ‘three strikes and you are out’ basis. Internet giant: Former Amazon staff said they were hired for 12 weeks before being sacked and re-employed so that the company did not have to give them the same rights as full-time employees . Employees also described having to pack . boxes for the internet delivery company over a ten-hour shift with just a . 30-minute break, in which they often had to walk the length of the . factory – the size of nine football pitches – to reach its canteen. 'I think they had it all mapped out. They just got rid of you when they felt like it' Martin Parton, Former Amazon employee . Many of the former staff who worked inside the factory were employed by Randstad, an employment agency that until February was used to bring in workers and manage them on behalf of Amazon. A whistleblower from the agency told Channel 4 News he was instructed to be ‘very careful’ about sacking temporary employees in case the information was leaked to the media. Andrew Kingsley, a former Randstad representative, also said Amazon bosses tried to save money by encouraging the agency to deceive staff by not offering holiday pay. ‘The agency reps were instructed not to tell them,’ he said. Speaking about the use of tracking equipment on staff, he said: ‘They were monitored every minute on the performance console. Working conditions: Use of zero-hour contracts has thrived despite calls for them to be banned, with 250,000 British workers employed in this way at the end of last year by a range of firms, including Sports Direct . ‘You could log on at any time and see what people were picking, packing, and what their rates were. If their rates weren’t up to scratch you’d have to go and give them a bit of a boost or release them.’ One former zero-hour contract employee said: ‘You could turn in for work at seven in the morning and be sent home at eight.’ 'You could log on at any time and see what people were picking, packing, and what their rates were' Andrew Kingsley, former Randstad representative . An Amazon spokesman said: ‘In Rugeley, we have 401 permanent associates, 345 of whom started on temporary assignments. 'We expect to hire an additional 250 permanent associates in Rugeley in the next year. All our agencies are contractually obliged to pay holiday pay and that is accounted for in the amounts we pay to agencies. ‘We continue to listen to feedback from associates, as well as customers, in order to learn, innovate and improve.’ Amazon added that it employs more than 4,500 permanent employees in the UK.","Employees at internet giant have to walk up to 15 miles during a shift .

Mohammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three . times and stamped on in the senseless attack as he returned from . evening prayers three months ago. As police quizzed a Ukrainian over the . killing, counter terrorist detectives launched a separate inquiry to . discover whether the suspect – along with a potential accomplice – were . ‘lone wolves’ who have links to far-right terrorist groups.

Now the 25-year-old has also been . arrested in connection with the investigation into the murder of Mr . Saleem as part of the on-going counter terrorism operation into the . blasts. Yesterday Mr Saleem’s daughter, Shazia . Khan, 45, said: ‘It was an act of terrorism because he was killed for . his faith and that is exactly what the police have arrested this man . for, on terrorism grounds. ‘We feel relieved that we are getting . somewhere because things were going very quiet and we were getting . worried that there was no progress being made and there were no clues.’ Mr Saleem’s widow Said, 69, who was married to him for 50 years, fought back tears to say what happened to him was ‘so wrong’. The two suspects were on placements at . software company Delcam on an industrial estate in Small Heath, . Birmingham, one-and-a-half miles from Mr Saleem’s home. The firm has a training centre in . Lutsk, Ukraine, and close links with universities in the country – a . known hotbed of anti-Islamic hatred.

A nail bomb . then exploded outside a mosque in Tipton on July 12 in a terror attack . apparently timed to coincide with the funeral of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who . was murdered in Woolwich in May. Evidence of the third bombing, on a . roundabout near Wolverhampton Central Mosque, was uncovered by police . ‘following intelligence’ after the men’s arrest on Thursday. That case was believed to date back to . June 28 when officers were sent to the scene following reports of an . explosion but nothing was found. The attacks all occurred on a Friday – a . day when mosques would usually be busy. But nobody was injured in any . of the explosions. Caution: A police cordon was erected around Wolverhampton Mosque  as police investigated reports that a device had been activated . The two Ukrainians were initially . arrested in Small Heath on Thursday on suspicion of being involved in . the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism. Delcam chief executive Clive Martell said at the time one of the men had been at the company for four months, the other for two. ‘The two men were on work placements . with us, but were not employees,’ he said. ‘They were around halfway . through the course and we understand they met each other whilst on the . placement.’ Counter terrorism officers were on Saturday granted an extra . seven days to question the Ukrainian nationals in connection with the . explosions.

A disabled grandmother was killed in a freak accident when she got her head trapped in her stair lift an inquest has heard. Shirley Perkins, 55, toppled backwards down the stairs and got her head wedged between the metal rung of the electric seat and the wall. Her lifeless body was discovered by her daughter Claire who arrived at the home in Berryhill, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., to collect her mother for a shopping trip on June 27. Freak accident: Shirley Perkins, 55, died after toppling backwards down the stairs and getting her head wedged between her stairlfit and the wall (file picture) An inquest heard the former pottery worker had a stair lift fitted after she suffered breathing difficulties but occasionally had the strength to walk up them unaided. On the night of her death the grandmother-of-one, who was said to have a history of alcohol abuse, had got drunk on wine before going to bed. But as she stumbled up the one flight of stairs she tripped and fell backwards with her head jammed between the wall. Shirley’s daughter, Claire told North Staffordshire Coroners Court: 'Her health was neither good nor bad, but she was well enough to look after my son. 'She had fallen down the stairs about five years ago and we still don’t know how that happened, but she was in a coma for four months. 'After the fall, she wasn’t very good. It was more her breathing than anything else but she could still do her shopping. North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard how the 55-year-old grandmother had got drunk on the night of her death although her daughter denied she was an alcoholic . 'She used to tell me if she used her stair lift she would lose the use of her legs, so she didn’t go on it very often. 'Mum wasn’t an alcoholic but she did have three or four bottles of wine a week. 'I would go round in the day and thought she had had a drink, but when I asked her she said she hadn’t. 'With her falling down the stairs, I assumed she had been drinking, but there was not a lot of drink in the house at the time when she died.' A post-mortem found Shirley’s blood-alcohol content was 360ml per decilitre - four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit. PC Alan Rossi, of Staffordshire Police, was the first officer to attend the scene after he daughter dialled 999. He told the hearing: 'There was a stair lift and the lady was positioned between the back of it and the wall, with her neck resting on the seat. 'She was wedged in and I think anyone would struggle to get out of that position. 'There was nothing on the stairs and there was nothing out of place, it just seemed as if she had fallen. 'There was an unopened bottle of wine in the living room but there were no glasses.' North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith confirmed that Shirley died from asphyxia as a result of the fall and acute alcohol intoxication. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Smith told the hearing on Monday: 'The deceased had a history of alcohol abuse and was last seen alive around 6.30pm on June 26. 'It is very difficult to say when she died but I think everyone excepts it was a fall. 'She would have been very intoxicated and my verdict is one of accidental death. 'It was an accident in terms of a fall or a trip but I have no doubt alcohol has played some part in what happened to her.'","Shirley Perkins, 55, fell and got her head wedged between the seat and the wall .

A Royal Marine who rescued two men from a yacht stranded in stormy seas at night has been awarded the George Medal. Sergeant Anthony Russell had to dive into the turbulent sea in the dark after the lifeboat holding one of the men flipped over. As a winchman on a Royal Navy Sea King rescue helicopter based at Culdrose, Cornwall, the 42-year-old from Bath in Somerset, carried out the daring rescue in July 2011. Brave: Royal Marine Aircrew man Sergeant Anthony Russell gallantly went to the rescue when a yacht became stranded out at sea in the dark and far out from shore . To the rescue: The Royal Marine helicopter, seen here on another mission, arrived to save two endangered fishermen who were battling heavy seas 110 miles offshore . Sergeant Russell was part of a four-man team that rescued two crew from the Swedish yacht Andriette, in 2011. He is among 118 members of the British Armed Forces recognised in the latest Operational Honours for his bravery. The team was scrambled to help a yacht which was floundering in heavy seas, 110 nautical miles offshore, at night, in extreme weather conditions. 'It was pretty much the worst weather I have ever seen,' said Sergeant Russell. 'Forty foot waves, gale force winds, sheet rain.' The yacht was being thrown 60 degrees either way, he said. 'When we opened the door it was silence because we looked at it and thought, ‘what do we do?’', he said. Preparing to jump: Sergeant Russell was winched down from the Royal Navy Sea King helicopter to save the fisherman whose yacht had no working engine . Heavy seas: Royal Marine Sergeant Russell, pictured here with fellow crew member Commander Ford, weighed up the hazards with before deciding to be winched down in extreme weather conditions . 'It was unlike anything you could prepare yourself for in training.' With limited options, father-of-two Russell volunteered to conduct a conventional winch rescue, which meant being lowered towards the mountainous waves in the pitch black. 'I had been at the end of the wire for about five seconds and this wave engulfed me,' he said. 'I just thought, ‘so it’s going to be like that is it?’ I thought it was over.' His voice communications were disabled, but he managed to swim to the life raft and haul himself inside. Desperate: The Royal Marine Aircrew were brought in to save the men after other rescue crews were unable to help them because the weather conditions were so dangerous . He took the older of the two men, raising him up to the helicopter. 'As we came away I saw the life-raft get picked up by the waves and get thrown upside down. 'At that point my heart sank, I thought they were father and son. I couldn’t let this guy realise that what I thought was his son was possibly drowning.' He strapped the man into the Sea King then went straight back down. With the lifeboat upside down, Sergeant Russell dived underneath to find the man. Into the fray: Anthony Russell volunteered to try a conventional winch rescue, which involved being lowered down into the mountainous waves and gale force winds . He found himself stuck, unable to get out, but having not seen him for a minute, his crew raised the winch wire, flipping the life raft back over. 'I couldn’t move either way, something was holding me back. It almost felt like a death grip,' Sergeant Russell said. 'At that point I thought that was me, I thought I was dead. I just have a quick word with myself.' When the boat flipped over, he realised he was tangled in wires, so cut himself free and managed to rescue the second survivor. Happy ending: Royal Marine Aircrew man Sergeant Russell with Commander Ford seen here rescuing another man from a fishing boat . Mission accomplished: Sergeant Russell and his crew often fight through extreme weather conditions to rescue those stranded at sea .

A thrill-seeking photographer drowned after he was sucked into a deadly whirlpool he was trying to film, an inquest heard. Jacob Cockle, 28, often diced with death in the water and uploaded extreme footage to video-sharing sites, where his efforts racked up millions of views. However, on May 28 last year as a friend looked on, he was dragged under by a whirlpool in Carnsew Pool in the estuary of the River Hayle in Cornwall. Mr Cockle was wearing a plastic horse's head at the time - a comedy prop he had wanted to include in the footage. Daredevil: Jacob Cockle, 28, films himself swimming in front of a whirlpool, similar to the one which led to his death in May 2013 . Danger: Mr Cockle, shown here inches away from a dangerous whirlpool, uploaded popular videos of his underwater exploits. He died last May, wearing a plastic horse's head, after being dragged under by a similar whirlpool in a river estuary in Cornwall . An inquest in Truro, Cornwall, heard that traces of the tranquilliser drug ketamine were found in his body after it was dragged out of the water. The coroner also heard that Mr Cockle had severe dyslexia, which affected his judgement. Mr Cockle had set out to make another video of the dangerous whirlpool, a phenomenon caused by Victorian tunnels designed to funnel sand out of a harbour. No fear: Mr Cockle was described as a 'free spirit' by his step-father . A friend, 70-year-old David Raine, was filming the incident from the banks but was unable to intervene until Mr Cockle emerged at the other end of the pool. Recording a verdict of accident death, coroner Andrew Cox, said: 'Jacob went down to the harbour with an expressed intention of recording the whirlpools there. 'I have seen the footage of him being sucked around the whirlpool while wearing the horse's head. There is no doubt that Jacob was a competent waterman. 'There is also no doubt that he was a risk taker. I accept however that those risks were not spontaneous or impulsive but were considered. 'He was an admirable young man who died doing what he loved.' Mr Raine told the inquest: 'I went down around 7:30pm and he was standing above the pool sort of beckoning to me - he was excited.' He said Mr Cockle had asked him to pass him a smaller camera which was attached to the end of an 8ft pole. Mr Raine said: 'He asked me to pass that down because he wanted to do some underwater shots. 'He had a plastic horse's head that he wanted to put on. He wanted to put it on in the whirlpool and for me to film it from above. 'He disappeared and then came up on the other side of the vortex just momentarily, then went down again.' Ready to go: Mr Cockle films himself immediately before jumping into rough waters in a whirlpool video which was viewed more than 2million times online . Dicing with death: Mr Cockle, circled, was almost smashed against a harbour wall in Newlyn, Cornwall, by a freak wave . There was a sign warning people not to swim, but it did not deter Mr Cockle, whom the inquest heard was a strong swimmer. He had previously posted advice on his Youtube channel explaining how to deal with rough and difficult waters. After his body was sucked into the 15t tunnel, Mr Cockle emerged at the other end of the pool where Mr Raine was able to drag him to the side while a fisherman dialled 999. He and a passer-by attempted to revive him before RNLI lifeboat crews arrived and took over. Deadly: Mr Cockle was dragged through a tunnel by a powerful pool, similar to the one pictured, before he died . Tragedy: Mr Cockle, 28, drowned in Carnsew Pool, near Hayle, Cornwall . Mr Cockle was airlifted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, where he was later pronounced dead. Later tests confirmed he had drowned. His mother Carolyn Sheard, 60, also addressed the inquest. She said: 'He was severely dyslexic. He had no concept of time but always did what he wanted to do. He never had any fear of danger.' Mr Cockle's step-father Andrew Sheard told the inquest that he would regularly purchase props from charity shops to use while he filmed in the whirlpools. He was highly regarded for his films and photos, including stunning 2011 images of two surfers being swept off a sea wall by 30ft waves and hurled into the sea. He nearly died in December 2008 when he became trapped between a stone pier and a freak 30ft wave while surfing near Penzance, Cornwall. In a statement after the inquest, Mrs Sheard said: 'In his short lifetime Jacob lived life to its fullest. He achieved more than most people can only dream about. 'He saw no danger in either people or situations. Jacob was a free spirit.'","Jacob Cockle, 28, gained fame uploading videos of underwater exploits .

A 33-year-old man who held a sign up on a Texas road warning of a police speed trap has been defending his actions in court. Ron Martin was arrested in October after an officer spotted him in the median of Eldorado Parkway in Frisco, with a sign that read: 'Police ahead'. The officers were alerted to Martin's presence when drivers started to wave at them as they drove past the speed trap. In court on Wednesday, Martin said he held up the sign because he was worried for the safety of the traffic police. Martin said he had filed several complaints about what he believed were unsafe practices of the traffic officers on the busy stretch of highway. 'They hide behind signs and they use . their motorcycles sitting in the road, sun going down, without lights or . anything,' Martin, a sign painter, told Fox News.

A pair of sisters who posed as murdered millionaire Carole Waugh to take out a loan on her flat and enjoy luxury shopping sprees at Selfridges were spared jail today. Elaine Perkins, 52, and Debra Burke, 49, were given a suspended jail sentence and community service respectively, after being found guilty of impersonating Ms Waugh after her death. Burke and Perkins, both from Essex, were hired by convicted killer Rakesh Bhayani to take out loans and cash cheques on Ms Waugh's account. Fraudsters: Elaine Perkins, 52, and Debra Burke, 49, both from Essex, pretended to be murdered millionaire Carole Waugh (pictured( to defraud banks and shops . Perkins even altered her appearance with coloured contact lenses in order to trick solicitors into approving a £200,000 loan on Ms Waugh's Marylebone apartment. A court heard that the sisters did not know that Ms Waugh, 49, had been brutally murdered by Bhayani, 41, in a calculated plan to raid her bank accounts to clear his gambling debts. While the pair went shopping with Ms Waugh’s credit cards, the millionairess’ body was locked up in a car boot for three months before Bhayani and his accomplice, Nicholas Kutner, were caught. Bhayani was jailed for 27 years for murder, fraud and perverting the course of justice. Kutner was sentenced to 13 years for perverting the course of justice by helping to cover up the killing and fraud. Killer and right-hand man: Rakesh Bhayani, 41, was found guilty of killing Carole Waugh and sentenced to 27 years in jail, while his accomplice Nicholas Kutner was jailed for 13 years . The two women were convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey, but Recorder Martyn Levett said he believed they had both been taken in by the charms of Bhayani and Kutner. He said Perkins had been 'blinded' by a wishful-thinking mantra she had read in a book, while Burke accepted Bhayani's lies because she was desperate for friendship. 'You had no knowledge of Carole Waugh's untimely death, and no doubt had either of you had that knowledge, you may not have become involved in this particular fraud', he said. 'The fact being revealed to you was the greatest shock of all, you were tied up and dragged into something like this. 'Being dragged into it makes this case unusual if not exceptional - it shows Rakesh Bhayani and Nicholas Kutner were involved in a cruel plan to defraud Carole Waugh's entire finances.' Bhayani killed Ms Waugh at her £600,000 flat in April 2012, before setting into motion a complex fraud while her body lay undiscovered in the south London lock-up. With the help of Kutner, 48, he recruited Perkins and Burke to pose as Ms Waugh to fool shop assistants, bank clerks, and solicitors. 'They [Kutner and Bhayani] are both expert conmen, very good at lying, and gambling addicts', said Patrick Gibbs QC, prosecuting. 'They are life-long fraudsters with a terrible lengthy list of serious criminal convictions for defrauding people. 'The Crown certainly agrees that they were heartless, calculating, and plausible, and could be, when they chose to be, extremely charming.' Killed: Carole Waugh, 49, was murdered in her £600,000 flat in Marylebone, after which her body was locked in a car boot for three months before Bhayani and Kutner were caught . Perkins was the most heavily involved in the fraud efforts, and was recorded on a phone call to a bank being prompted by Bhayani as to the correct security questions. She fraudulently organised a £200,000 bridging loan from Cheval Finance with Ms Waugh's flat as collateral in early May, and also set up an account at the Money Shop for cashing cheques. In June, she made an application to Tesco Personal Finance for a fixed sum loan, then set up a bank account with First Direct. She also tried to sell Ms Waugh's British Aerospace shares, and applied for bank transfers from a Halifax account in the heiress' name. Burke, aided by her sister, went shopping on June 27 as Ms Waugh to Selfridges where she registered for a store card. They went shopping again on July 13, to Westfield Shopping Centre, where Burke bought two bottles of perfume using Ms Waugh's card and also tried to purchase products from the Apple store. Addressing Perkins, the judge said he had little idea why the two women had agreed to be involved the fraud, but there had been hints during the trial . 'I suspect you were selected because of you biography on a website stated your interest in meeting other people and you had an acute housing need at the time', he said. 'I strongly suspect you were blinded by the content of a book you had read about wishful mantra, that if you pray for something long enough it might actually come along and come true. 'You were fooled by his apparent genuineness, and like all things that seem too good to be true, it was.' Perkins was given a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service. Burke was given a three year community order, including supervision sessions and 100 hours community service. Perkins, of Ilford, Essex, and Burke, of Hainault, Essex, both denied guilt of any crime.","Millionairess Carole Waugh was murdered in her Marylebone flat in 2012 .

A British schoolboy is today expected to become the youngest person to trek to the South Pole. Sixteen-year-old Lewis Clarke  should arrive at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station at around 3pm GMT after a 700-mile trek from the coast. Lewis, from Bristol, has spent 46 days in temperatures as low as -40C and winds of up to 60mph. He has skied an average eight hours and 18 miles a day, in aid of The Prince’s Trust. Tough journey: Lewis Clarke, 16, will become the youngest person to reach to South Pole when he completes his mission on Saturday . Lewis, accompanied by experience polar guide Carl Alvey, has pulled his own supplies for the last 700 miles. By reaching the South Pole he will beat the record for the youngest person to get there by two years. The tough lad has spent the last 45 days braving temperatures as low as minus 40 C, and facing 120mph blizzards. GCSE student Lewis, who spent Christmas with only Carl for company, has averaged around 80 miles a day in sub-zero conditions, in his bid to break three records. Lewis began his epic journey on December 2, and is raising money for The Prince's Trust charity. Big trek: Lewis has spent 46 days in temperatures as low as -40C and winds of up to 60mph accompanied by experience polar guide Carl Alvey . Lewis has been planning the expedition for three years and began a tough training regime a year ago, beginning with a two week polar training course in Norway. Speaking during the Pole expedition, he said: ‘I used to love snow, hate hot places and hot weather, and wear shorts in the middle of winter. Now I'm not too sure. ‘I've been through the entire list of Polar problems. I knew it would be hard, but it's harder than I ever thought it would be. ‘I've suffered from blisters, a high-altitude cough, frost nip and I even managed to break a ski they told me was unbreakable. ‘I think sometimes about how few people have done this. Only 300 in 100 years. That's pretty cool.’ Winning man: Lewis has been on the move since December 2 and is raising money for The Prince's Trust . Proud dad Steven Clarke said: ‘He's doing something amazing, and I'm incredibly proud of him. ‘Each day is a nail biter. How far have they got? Has anything gone wrong? Will they make it? I'm ready for him to come home now. ‘Coming home will be a bit weird for him, But it'll be a few days off, a party, and onto GCSE revision.’ Lewis will beat three world records if he makes it to the South Pole today. He will become the youngest to ski the full 700 miles, coast to pole, (Hercules Inlet route), beating Sarah Landry, of Canada, aged 18 in 2004. He will also be the youngest to ski partial journey to the pole, 112 miles (flown to start), beating Amelia Hemplemann Adams, aged 16 in 2011, and the youngest man to ski short route (314 miles) from coast to pole, beating Parker Liataud, 19, in 2013 .","Lewis Clarke, 16, will break world records when he reaches South Pole .

Relief: Rosie-Ann Stone (left) leaves Hull Crown Court after being cleared of death by careless driving . A woman was cleared of blame yesterday over her sister’s tragic death in a car crash as the Crown Prosecution Service was criticised for heartlessly pursuing the case. Rosie-Ann Stone, 21, was overtaking a lorry when she collided with her elder sibling Jennie’s car, which was carrying out the same manoeuvre – sending it crashing into a tree. Months earlier, the women had lost their brother Gregg, a 20-year-old soldier who was shot dead while serving in Afghanistan. Their father Robert Stone, 56, arrived at the scene of the accident and cried: ‘Not again, no, not another child.’ Prosecutors insisted on charging Rosie-Ann with causing death by careless driving, despite the family’s suffering and doubt as to who was to blame. The decision enraged the family and was even questioned by the judge at  the five-day trial, which cost an estimated £100,000. Speaking before the hearing, at which jurors took less than three hours to clear Rosie-Ann, Mr Stone said: ‘We begged the Crown Prosecution Service not to bring this charge, but they seem to have their own agenda. 'We wondered if they are human. I know Jennie is up there now and she would not have wanted Rosie-Ann to be prosecuted.’ There were emotional scenes at Hull Crown Court as the jury foreman delivered the verdict. The defendant and her parents wept as other family members shouted ‘yes’. Moments later, Rosie-Ann was released from the dock and embraced her three brothers, before being led away without commenting. Mr Stone said: ‘As the verdict came in my heart was pumping. I thought it was going to burst.’ Judge Simon Jack distanced himself from the controversial decision to take the matter to court by telling the jury: ‘Before the start of the case I expressed concern with the Crown Prosecution Service that it was not in the public interest to have a trial. ‘The CPS was consistently saying that it was. It was their decision not mine.’ Rosie-Ann was charged because she failed to look over her shoulder before pulling out to overtake a slow-moving lorry last February. She said she had checked in her mirror and indicated before the accident on the A165 near Bridlington, East Yorkshire. Court case: Rosie-Ann Stone (pictured) was in her own car and had pulled out to overtake a slow-moving lorry when she felt the car collide with another vehicle driven by Jennie Stone, which 'skimmed' her Vauxhall Astra . The court heard she had spent the day . with Jennie, 28 – the mother of a 10-year-old boy – and did not realise . she was in her Peugeot three cars back in the same queue. Jennie . tried to overtake the line of vehicles at the same time – driving at up . to 70mph, according to one witness – and  colliding with her younger . sister in the process. Rosie-Ann, . a manager at  a bookmaker’s, told the court of the moment she realised . her sister’s blue car was next to hers. ‘I saw blue to the right and I . saw Jennie driving. I saw her blonde hair. I twigged almost instantly. ‘Jennie did not turn and look at me. Not at all. Jennie’s car was moving faster than mine. The two cars . struck. Jennie’s car instantly shot across the road. I thought the truck . was going to hit her. I saw Jennie’s car go on to the grass and strike . the tree.’ Rosie-Ann . stopped her car and screamed: ‘Jennie, Jennie what have you done it for? I didn’t see you! What have you done it for?’ She . said: ‘I wanted to get to Jennie. I saw her in the car. I was . screaming. I tried to go near her. I wanted to be with Jennie. Nobody . was with her, she was on her own.’ Crash victim: Rosie-Ann Stone felt her car collide with another vehicle driven by sister Jennie Stone (pictured) Siblings: Rosie-Ann (left, red hair) and Jennie Stone (left, blonde hair). The fatal accident happened months after their brother Gregg (right) had been killed in Afghanistan . The . defendant said her sister, a student, was a ‘fast driver’ and she had . witnessed a previous accident when Jennie was at fault. Rosie-Ann . told police: ‘In my opinion she was a very quick driver and did take a . lot of risks. I never felt comfortable with it. I refused to let her . drive my car.’ Their mother Angie Stone, 56, confirmed that Jennie drove . ‘fast and erratically’ while Rosie-Ann was a ‘safe and careful driver.’ After the case Paul Genney, a senior barrister based in Hull, said: ‘I think the decision to prosecute was indefensible. ‘What . could you possibly do to her on top of what she has had to suffer? To . kill your own sister – there is nothing worse in the world. ‘What is the point of spending five days of public money on a prosecution at taxpayers’ expense?’ Jonathan . Sharp, the senior CPS advocate in the region, said all the evidence was . ‘carefully considered’ and it was ‘a very difficult decision’ to . prosecute.","Rosie-Ann Stone, 20, cleared of causing death of her sister Jennie, 28 .

Elizabeth Truss, an education minister, has called for an end to 'segregation in toy departments' Toy makers risk damaging girls’ chances at maths and science by marketing certain toys only at boys, an education minister warned last night. Elizabeth Truss called for an end to ‘segregation in toy departments’ that results in some products being marketed only at one sex. Miss Truss, minister for education and childcare, said she backed the calls by campaign group Let Toys be Toys, which is pressing manufacturers and retailers to promote toys in a gender-neutral way. She gave the example of chemistry sets marketed at boys, which she said was the ‘antithesis’ of Government efforts to persuade more girls to study science. In an interview with The House magazine, she said: ‘I think toys are toys. Let Toys be Toys are running a fantastic campaign about abolishing the segregation in toy departments. ‘The idea that a chemistry set should be for boys is the antithesis of what we want to promote. 'But at the same time we need to make clear that science and maths aren’t just about engineering cars, they’re also about developing (social media site) LinkedIn, developing cosmetics, marketing. ‘All sorts of jobs require science and maths, whether it’s fashion or farming, whatever you might aspire to, these subjects are useful. So we need a bit of balance I think.’ Miss Truss, who has two daughters, acknowledged that she had brought toys from the controversial pink and purple coloured Lego Friends range, which has been condemned by some feminists. But, asked about the range, she admitted misgivings, saying: ‘You’ve happened on a complete dilemma we face in promoting maths and science. I don’t know if you remember that dreadful EU campaign where they had “go into science so you can help design lipstick”, or something like that. ‘I’ve brought both sorts of Lego. I’ve got two daughters and I’ve bought traditional Lego and Lego Friends. To some extent you’ve got to engage children in what they’re interested in. You can’t just present something that’s totally different. Otherwise the child will just go off and spend their pocket money on what they want.’ She warned that toy makers' marketing risks damaging girls' chances of succeeding in maths and science . The campaign for gender neutral toys has enjoyed growing influence in recent months. In December, Marks & Spencer announced that all of its toys would be marketed in a gender-neutral way by the spring of this year. The move followed an internet campaign highlighting the way the retailer sold technology and science themed toys as ‘boys stuff’, while marketing craft toys only at girls. In a wide-ranging interview, Miss Truss also said ministers were keen to make changes to the ‘Victorian’ school day. She said there was a ‘double benefit’ to encouraging schools to open from 8am to 6pm, with children from poor backgrounds having access to better facilities to do their homework, and working parents benefiting from the extended hours. Miss Truss said ministers wanted to ‘encourage schools to respond to what parents want and to offer those hours’.","Elizabeth Truss has called for an end to 'segregation in toy departments'

Sixth formers’ practical skills will still be assessed, although marks will appear separately from the final grade.The CBI fears this will lead to laboratory skills being neglected by schools. Crucial: The Confederation of British Industry says axing coursework for science students will harm skills . Practical work is vital to help teenagers progress into higher education or employment, it added, and the proposed change would lead to lab skills becoming ‘neglected or de-prioritised’. ‘While there are obvious challenges in the design and assessment of these skills, their importance means that the removal of marks from the final grade would be a significant step backwards and could undermine employer confidence in the qualification,’ it said. ‘Rather than remove these contributory marks, the focus should be on addressing the challenges outlined in the consultation document such as the issue of potential marking inconsistencies.’ Neil Carberry, The CBI's head of employment and skills, said the proposal could undermine employer confidence in the qualification and Ofqual should instead by focusing on tackling ‘marking inconsistencies’. ‘We want practical assessment in science because, frankly, science is a practical subject,’ he said at an education conference in Nottingham. Help: Ofqual said there was evidence of teachers helping pupils with coursework, which is marked internally . ‘The proposal that the curriculum will no longer contain contributory marks for practical skills is one we viscerally oppose. ‘For us, functional English, functional maths at GCSE and A-level are absolutely essential and we want them in the curriculum.

A father desperately tried to save his toddler from dying after he found him face down in a paddling pool, an inquest heard. Harvey Dale was discovered lying in the makeshift pond, made from a paddling pool, in his back garden when he did not respond to his mother's calls for dinner. His mother Charlotte asked her husband Shane to check on their boy, and when he discovered Harvey, he jumped into the pond to pull his body out of the water. Mr Dale then performed CPR on his 23-month-old son before paramedics arrived and took him to hospital. Doctors at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital kept the toddler alive in its intensive care unit for two days before he died of a hypoxic brain injury. The inquest in Oxford was told the tragedy unfolded in the back garden of a home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on September 4 last year. Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter read statements from Harvey’s parents which described the awful moment their boy was discovered. Charlotte’s read: 'The kids asked to play in the garden. It was a nice sunny evening and I said okay. I called them all for their dinner. All the kids were going in and out. 'I called Harvey at the door and he didn’t come. I told Shane to run and check out the back for him. I saw Shane out the window jumping into the water.' The 33ins deep former paddling pool had been filled with water and was 24ins deep when the tragedy happened. Mrs Dale said: 'There was a step on the edge of the pond where he would sit quite often. He liked being in the garden, he used to climb everything.' Doctors at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital kept the toddler alive in its intensive care unit for two days before he died . Detective Constable Andrew Ryan, of Thames Valley Police, told the inquest: 'When I asked the parents about what he was like as a child they said he was always climbing into things.' Recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Mr Salter said: 'It is an extremely sad case. 'It seems that Harvey was only out of sight for a short period of time.' 'Clearly it seems to be a tragic accident that occurred in the garden of the home address on September 4 in the late afternoon.'","Harvey Dale was discovered lying in a paddling pool in back garden .

Juliet Aubrey, 47, thought her ordeal was over after she managed to dial 999 and heard officers shouting ‘armed police’.

Miss . Aubrey, who won a Bafta for her role as Dorothea in a BBC production of . Middlemarch, and starred in The White Queen, required months of . treatment for her injuries, including the wound that cut to the bone.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 17 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 17 January 2014 . A record 1,004 rhinos were poached for their horns in South Africa in 2013 – an increase of over 50 per cent from 2012, it emerged yesterday. The horn is worth £40,000 a kilo in Asia, where it is prized as a key  ingredient in traditional medicines, making it more valuable than  platinum, gold or cocaine. Last year’s toll was a massive increase on 2012, when 668 were killed illegally, following the 448 in 2011. The news will fuel concern for the future of rhinos in South Africa, which has 20,000 – most of the world’s population. Illegal: More than 1,000 rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2013, up by 50 per cent on 2012 . Top safari destination Kruger National Park, which borders Mozambique, bore the brunt of the poaching, with 606 rhino deaths. Some 37 rhinos have already been killed this year, 34 of them killed in Kruger. South African officials said the number of rhino poachers arrested during 2013 has also increased, with 343 being arrested, 133 of them in Kruger National Park, up from 267 alleged poachers arrested in 2012. Six poachers have been arrested so far this year. The increase in poaching brings South Africa's white rhino population ever closer to the 'tipping point' where deaths will outnumber births and the population will go into serious decline, conservation experts warned. The number of rhinos poached in South Africa has increased year on year in recent years to meet rising demand for rhino horn in China and particularly Vietnam, where it is used as a status symbol and health tonic for disease and even hangovers. Experts warn there are links between criminal gangs responsible for smuggling the rhino horns out of Africa and to Asia and other forms of organised crime including people trafficking, drug smuggling and illegal arms trade. Threatened: Top safari destination Kruger National Park, which borders Mozambique, bore the brunt of the poaching, with 606 rhino deaths . Mozambique is a transit point for rhino smuggling activities and a base for poachers who cross the border to kill rhinos, wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic said. Tom Milliken, Traffic's rhino expert, said: 'South Africa and Mozambique must decisively up their game if they hope to stop this blatant robbery of South Africa's natural heritage. '2014 must mark the turning point where the world, collectively, says ""enough is enough"" and brings these criminal networks down. 'Rhino horn trafficking and consumption are not simply environmental issues, they represent threats to the very fabric of society.' Dr Jo Shaw, rhino programme manager for WWF-South Africa said: 'These criminal networks are threatening our national security and damaging our economy by frightening away tourists.' She said agreements between South Africa and Vietnam and China on tackling wildlife trafficking had to translate into action on the ground. And she said: 'It would be encouraging to see more significant arrests higher up the trade chain, and to see current arrests resulting in convictions with strong sentences which will effectively deter this criminal activity. 'More significant action to root out corruption would also be welcome.' Next month a summit in London, convened by the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister David Cameron, will seek commitments from governments to combat the growing global threat posed by the illegal wildlife trade.","More than 1,000 rhinos were killed in South Africa in 2013 .

She was handed a nine month jail term suspended for 12 months after pleading guilty to growing the 21 seedlings when she appeared in court.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:45 EST, 16 January 2014 . Chancellor George Osborne hinted the minimum wage could rise to £7-an-hour . The minimum wage could rise to as much as £7 an hour next year – adding a potential £1,225 a year to the pay packets of millions of workers, George Osborne signalled last night. The Chancellor backed a dramatic 11 per cent increase in the current rate of £6.31 an hour, delighting Conservative MPs but alarming business leaders, who insisted it should not be increased by more than inflation. His surprise intervention provoked an immediate backlash from business groups. The Federation of Small Businesses said the rate should not go up by more than inflation – currently just 2 per cent – while the Institute of Directors said it should be offset by a reduction in employers’ National Insurance contributions. The CBI said an unaffordable rise ‘would end up costing jobs’. But Mr Osborne insisted low-paid workers should ‘enjoy the fruits’ of the economic recovery, suggesting that a rise would be carefully calibrated on the advice of the independent Low Pay Commission to avoid it affecting jobs or hurting employers. His move is designed to counter Labour’s charge that the Government is overseeing a recovery for the few,  demonstrating that the proceeds of growth will be shared by all. It also appeared deliberately timed to eclipse a speech on living standards by Ed Miliband today. The Low Pay Commission, which makes recommendations on the rate of the minimum wage, has been asked to look at restoring its value – undermined in real terms since the financial crash of 2008 and 2009. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and Treasury minister Sajid Javid are among those who have backed a significant increase, the first part of which is expected to take effect in October. It has been suggested that an increase could also save the Treasury significant sums in lower benefit claims and increased tax receipts. Critics claim that the change will be . difficult for many cash-strapped businesses to manage, and could lead to . lay-offs or send some firms to the wall. However businesses may be . offered more tax relief to compensate for an increased minimum wage. Government . sources said that further cuts to corporation tax or an increase to a . new National Insurance relief might be used to help firms contend with a . new minimum pay rate. Mr . Osborne said: ‘I think Britain can afford a higher minimum wage. I think . we have worked hard to get to this point and we can start to enjoy the . fruits of all that hard work. ‘I believe Britain can afford an above-inflation increase in the minimum wage so we can restore its real value for people.’ Since 2005 the minimum wage has risen by just a few pence, despite soaring inflation leaving workers worse off in real terms . The minimum wage rate stands at £6.31 for over-21s, but has fallen in value in real terms since the financial crash . He insisted that the exact figure . would be set by the Low Pay Commission, adding: ‘If the minimum wage had . kept in line with inflation it would be £7. ‘Just as we were all in this together in the crisis, I want to make sure we’re all in this together in the recovery. Goldman Sachs has made the second highest amount from its investment banking division in its 145-year history. Last year’s figures were beaten only by  those in 2007 – the year before the financial crisis struck. The bank’s $6billion (£3.6billion) revenue bonanza helped fuel an average staff payout of £234,000. The average full-time salary in the UK is £27,000. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has unveiled a proposal to get round the cap on bonuses being limited to double bankers’ salaries – boosting their base salaries with a new payment called ‘role based pay’. By inflating bankers’ salaries, they can continue to pay massive bonuses while still claiming that they are no more than  double basic pay. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ‘While millions suffer, Goldman Sachs is brazenly showing who the main beneficiaries of the recovery are with another bumper year for their investment bankers. ‘The very people who caused the crash are now hogging the fruits of recovery for themselves, and governments are letting them get away with it.’ ‘Because . we’re fixing the economy, because we’re working through our plan, I . believe Britain can afford above-inflation increases in the minimum wage . and make sure we have a recovery for all and that work pays.’ He . added: ‘We are only in a position where we can contemplate an . above-inflation increase in the minimum wage because we have taken . difficult decisions to fix the British economy. The work is not yet half . done.’ Last week he claimed . any increase would be carefully thought through, saying: ‘I think . everyone wants to see an increase in the minimum wage. I . would like to see an increase in the minimum wage. But it has to be . done in a way that doesn’t cost jobs. We have a Low Pay Commission as a . body that exists to make exactly that judgment. ‘We . have got to get the balance right between supporting business, growing . our economy and making sure it is a recovery for all, and that is what . our long-term plan is all about.’ Yesterday . Mr Duncan Smith welcomed the ‘bold move’, saying: ‘At the heart of all . our reforms this Government is concerned to improve the quality of life . for the poorest in society.’ Business . minister Matthew Hancock, the first member of the Government to call . for a significant minimum wage hike, said: ‘Modern Conservatives are . passionate backers of the minimum wage, as part of a plan to make work . pay and ensure everyone can benefit from the recovery.’ And . David Skelton, founder of Renewal – a campaign group dedicated to ‘blue . collar Conservatism’ – said: ‘For a party that once opposed the minimum . wage this is momentous. It shows the Conservatives can become the real . workers’ party, standing up for the low paid.’ However . John Longworth, from the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘Although . there is an increased disparity between the highest and lowest earners, . arbitrarily raising the floor isn’t necessarily the solution and could . make the UK economy uncompetitive in the long term.’","Chancellor sets out sharp rise worth £1,220-a-year to full-time workers .

They recently gave a candid interview to People magazine where they denied reports they had been 'damaged' by the family reality show and described themselves as 'better than ever.' But Kate Gosselin's twins Mady and Cara were strangely tongue tied during a live interview on The Today Show on Thursday. While being quizzed by host Savannah Guthrie on whether they had anything to say about 'how your family are doing', the 13-year-old girls awkwardly looked at each other and their mother and failed to say a single word. Scroll down for video... Awkward moment: Kate Gosselin and her twins Cara (left) and Mady (right) refused to answer questions when they were asked how they were doing on The Today Show on Thursday . Kate was left awkwardly sitting in between them, as the silence extended, causing an extremely cringe-worthy moment. 'It's your chance... spit it out,' Kate demanded, clearly hoping her daughters would back up the comments they made in People. 'This is their chance and this is the most wordless I've heard them all morning,' she said, by way of explanation. The twins, whose father is Jon Gosselin, didn't take the bait which clearly annoyed their mother. 'I don't want to speak for them but Mady . go ahead - sort of the things that you said in the magazine,' declared Kate. 'That years . later - they're good, they're fine. Go for it.' 'No, you just said it,' Maddy said stubbornly. Tongue tied: Kate tried to smile through the awkward moment as Mady clammed up . I don't want to speak for them: Gosselin had to step in to give her twins thoughts on the situation . 'I said it,' Kate said, smiling through gritted teeth. 'They get really frustrated that people assume certain things in our . house and they always say, ""But that’s not how it is, mommy. Why do they . say that about us?"" Guthrie tried a different tack, asking the twins if people have the 'wrong impression' of their family. 'I . wouldn't say the wrong impression but not like the full story,' said . Mady, who shot to fame along with her twin and Kate's nine-year-old . sextuplets Aaden, Collin, Joel, Leah, Alexis, and Hannah in TLC reality show Jon & Kate Plus 8, which first aired on Discovery in 2007. 'A lot of people think that filming our show has damaged us, but it’s only really helped.' Speechless: Cara didn't speak once during the awkward live television interview . No spotlight for me: Mady seemed reluctant to address rumours about their family . Thursday's interview appears to be part of Kate's campaign to address what she sees as 'inaccurate reporting' about the family and recent comments made by her ex husband Jon. Back in the day: Kate and Jon Gosselin in happier times back in 2009 . 'They're more aware of what is out there, the inaccuracies, things that are said by the general public, their father, whoever, because their friends talk about it at school,' she told Guthrie. 'So, I sort of am forced to kind of inform them. We talk about it a lot.' She refuted Guthrie's suggestion that . bringing the girls on national TV could 'put them on the spot' and . 'continue the injury to them.' 'There is no injury to begin with,' said Kate. 'I can't get them to . do anything they don't want to do as with any parent. It's not like I . force them to do it. This was like ""Hey, The Today Show asked us if we wanted to do this, and how did we feel . about it"". 'And they agreed to it, as with my nine year olds. It's a . family decision so I think it's really frustrating when there's so much . out there that's not true.' In an attempt to try to explain the . twins' silence was nothing to do with any 'damage', Kate attempted to . get them to weigh in to the debate. 'I'm getting to the point where I'm . extremely frustrated and I don't spend time worrying about it because . I'm busy raising my kids,' she said. 'And we know the truth and that's why they're . here even though they're tongue tied this morning, to say hey we're okay . and doing well. Would that be accurate girls to say?' Cara and Mady muttered an unenthusiastic 'yes' to . their mother's question but perked up when Guthrie quizzed them on . whether they had enjoyed being a part of the reality TV show. Back to reality? The twins lit up when asked if they would like to return to reality TV . 'Go for it - yes or no,' urged Kate, 38. 'Yes - It was really fun and I really do miss it,' said a smiling Mady. 'And you do, too, Cara. Cara does, she's just not gonna say it.' 'There's . a lot of fun opportunities,' added Kate. 'If it happens it does and if . it doesn't, it doesn't and it's a family made decision.' Meanwhile more information has emerged on Kate's demeanour behind the camera with a source telling Radar that the former reality star demanded to know what happened after Cara failed to speak one word during the interview. '[Cara] simply shrugged her shoulders,' the production insider said. 'This seemed to . make Kate even angrier and she rolled her eyes to onlookers nearby.' The source added: 'We all . genuinely felt for the girls. Kate is a tough cookie to please, it’s . obvious that she expects a lot from Mady and Cara.' Speaking out: Kate tried hard to get her point across but seemed highly embarrassed by her daughters' silence . More candid: Kate, Cara and Mady gave an interview to People magazine earlier this month . The website reports that the girls seemed fine, if a little sleepy, when they arrived at the Today Show's studio in New York and 'chatted to producers' before filming their segment. 'As soon as the girls got on the set, their mood immediately changed. It was obvious to anyone watching they simply froze on camera,' the source said. Their father Jon was equally unhappy about the situation, and called up TMZ to tell them he had been watching the awkward interview with his girlfriend. 'I felt upset. I was laying there with Liz [Jannetta] and we were like, ""Say something girls. Come on! Just say something. Anything."" And they didn't say anything and we were like, ""Ugh, this is horrible,""' he said. 'Then I felt really bad. I mean, I didn't care too much for Kate or whatever, but I felt really bad for Mady and Cara because I love them and they're just put in this situation. It was like deer in the headlights.' The 36-year-old added: 'It just kind of proves my point of Kate bringing the kids out instead of her just sort of doing it herself. It all blew up in everyone's face and I feel horrible for my children because now they're going to have to deal with the public. 'By body language they were probably like, ""What's the moral thing to do and what does my mom want me to do?"" They were torn and they just shutdown. It was just a classic case of being silent. You get to a point where you are like, ""I don't know who to please. Do I please myself or do I please my parents - or my mother?""' When asked if he felt like Kate manipulated them, Jon said: 'In my heart that's what I believe, that's how I feel. Can I prove it? I can't prove it, but you can't take my feelings away from me. I feel that way.' He added: 'I just texted Mady and Cara today and said, ""You guys looked great and I love you and have a good day in New York."" I didn't really talk about it. I'm just here to offer them support and be their father.' Damage control: Kate tweeted that her girls were quiet due to their appearance being their first live TV interview . Kate later tried to make light of the . awkward interview, tweeting: 'Thanks to @TODAYshow for having Cara, Mady . and me on the show today! 1st live interview can render even the . gabbiest girls speechless :)' Her comments came after her ex-husband Jon told InTouch earlier this month. '[Kate] uses [his kids] like props... it's so unfair to . them. It's a problem for her that she can't afford our old lifestyle . anymore.' The former reality . star who now works as a maître d' in Pennsylvania also said, 'I think . she wants a show with the kids again. I consider that exploitation.' People magazine noted that Jon will be . appearing on the reality show VH1's Couples Therapy with new girlfriend . Liz Janetta, a divorced mother of three, later this month.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:28 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:01 EST, 26 September 2013 . A glitch in the Apple Maps app on newer iPhones and iPads guides people up to a runway at a major Alaska airport instead of sending them on the proper route to the terminal, an airport official said Wednesday. The map actually stops at the tarmac, but twice this month, wayward drivers have continued across an active runway. ""It doesn't actually tell you to cross, but the problem is, people see the terminal then at that point, because they are right there, and they just continue across,"" said Fairbanks International Airport spokeswoman Angie Spear. Lost: Apple Maps is sending people driving onto an active runway at Fairbanks International Airport . There were no injuries in either the Sept. 6 incident or the second one Friday, mainly because they both happened early in the morning, between flights. ""Obviously, it could have been a very, very, very dangerous situation had they come during a flight departure or arrival,"" Spear said. That entrance to the taxiway has now been barricaded from traffic. The first incident involved an out-of-state visitor trying to return a rental car before a flight, and the second was an Alaska resident trying to get to the airport. Once the control tower and airport personnel noticed the cars, the people were safely escorted away. ""Both parties that did it said they were following the directions on their iPhone,"" Spear said. Danger!: The barricaded entrance to a taxiway, at Float Pond Road blocking access to Taxiway B in Fairbanks, Alaska . In July, state Rep. Les Gara, D-Anchorage, had a close call of his own when he was trying to make a flight after a meeting. He was in an unfamiliar part of Fairbanks and decided to use his iPhone map app to take the shortest route to the airport. Gara said the app took him to some weird places in Fairbanks, and then to the small plane airport near the international airport. Yet another problem: This glitch is the latest in a series of problems that have plagued Apple Maps . ""Eventually, it told me to make a . right onto the small plane runway, which in fact was the shortest way to . get to the big airport,"" he said. ""I give the iPhone app credit for . that.""

One of 'the great masterpieces of British art' has been saved for the nation in a deal that will see it go on show across the country. Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows by John Constable has been bought for £23.1 million in a deal arranged by the Tate. The deal, with the family of the late Lord Ashton of Hyde, includes tax concessions that make it equivalent to an open market sale of £40 million. Best of British: The Tate have announced that they bought John Constable's Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows . Moving: The iconic painting is put in place at the Tate Britain today . Tate director Nicholas Serota said: 'Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is one of the great masterpieces of British art. 'I am extremely grateful to the owners who have worked with us while we have raised the funds to ensure the painting remains in the UK.' A grant of £15.8 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund was central to the sale of the landscape work. The acquisition is part of a partnership . between the Tate and four other galleries - the National Museum of . Wales, the National Galleries of Scotland, Colchester and Ipswich . Museums and the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum. New generation: A group of children admire the painting displayed at Tate Britain . All four museums will have the chance to exhibit the work, ensuring that it stays in the UK. Jenny Abramsky, who chairs the fund, . said the 'substantial' investment was a recognition of the painting's . status as a 'precious and quintessentially British heritage icon'. She said: 'It is unimaginable that this particular painting might have ended up anywhere other than a UK public collection'. The . 1831 painting, one of the artist's large scale works known as . 'six-footers', shows the cathedral under a dark sky illuminated by a . rainbow. It is often . interpreted as a metaphor for the pressure felt by the Church of England . over its loss of political power in the period. Influential: Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is one of the most important paintings of the period . Then and now: The stunning Salisbury Cathedral was the inspiration for the painting . it was painted one year after the death of Constable's wife, Maria. The stormy weather has also been seen to represent Constable's fragile and turbulent state of mind at the time. But, the rainbow could represent hope at the end of a stormy period. the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1831. Mr Serota said there was no 'direct threat' of the work being taken out of the country, but said it was of 'such supreme importance' that 'undoubtedly there would have been institutions abroad who wanted to bring it into their collections'. The painting will go on show in Wales next year before travelling to the other galleries. Artist: Constable was not recognised for his work for most of his life . Salisbury cathedral from the Meadows was painted in 1831, one year after John Constable's wife Maria’s death. It features nine lines from ‘The Seasons’ by poet James Thomson, revealing the painting’s meaning. The rainbow is a symbol of hope, coming after a storm. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy the same year, but Constable continued to work on it until 1834. It has been seen to represent his turbulent frame of mind following the death of Maria. Born in Suffolk in 1776, John Constable is considered one of the foremost British artists. He is most known for his landscape paintings in Dedham Vale, the area in which he grew up. His most famous painting, The Hay Wain, is now exhibited at the National Gallery. Constable was not financially successful, and was not elected into the Royal Academy until the age of 52. He died in march 1837 of apparent heart failure, and was buried with his wife. His children John and Charles are also buried in the tomb.","Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows by John Constable was bought for £23.1million .

In an all-too familiar echo of Tony Blair’s ‘dodgy dossiers’, the Government had yesterday published an intelligence report to support David Cameron’s case for strikes against the Syrian regime. It concluded it was ‘highly likely’ that President Assad was responsible for launching chemical attacks against his own people. But like the ‘dodgy dossiers’, which claimed in 2002 that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, Mr Cameron’s report contained the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee. Looking back: The Government's intelligence report to support David Cameron's case for strikes against the Syrian regime had an all-too familiar echo of the 'dodgy dossiers' from Tony Blair (pictured) In an attempt to convince MPs and the public that attacks were imperative, Mr Cameron had released a two-page letter from the JIC, along with its one-page assessment. But the report did not detail how spy chiefs reached their conclusions. It stated that to the ‘highest possible level of certainty’ the Syrian regime had used chemical weapons on ‘14 occasions from 2012’. Without providing any obvious evidence, they had concluded this showed a ‘clear pattern of regime use’ of chemical weapons. The JIC, which includes the heads of MI6, GCHQ and MI5, had found there was ‘no credible evidence’ that opposition fighters had deployed nerve agents which killed at least 350 civilians. Comparison: Like the 'dodgy dossiers', which claimed that Saddam Hussein (pictured) had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, Mr Cameron's report contained the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee . But it had failed to answer a string . of questions such as why chemical weapons were used when UN inspectors . were in Syria, and who gave the order to deploy poison gas. Persuasion: Prime Minister David Cameron had released a two-page letter from the JIC, along with its one-page assessment . It . even admitted: ‘The JIC had high confidence in all its assessments . except in relation to the regime’s precise motivation for carrying out . an attack of this scale at this time – though intelligence may increase . our confidence in the future.’ Acknowledging the disquiet lingering ten . years on from the ‘dodgy dossiers’, Mr Cameron told the Commons: ‘I am . of course deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts and in . particular the deep concerns in the country caused by what went wrong . with the Iraq conflict in 2003.’ At the time Mr Blair justified dragging the UK into the bloody conflict by publishing two dossiers claiming Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But it emerged that the evidence was limited, misleading and patchy, with chunks of intelligence ‘spun’ or fabricated. However, yesterday’s report was markedly different from the Blair dossiers, as its language reflects probabilities rather than certainties that Assad’s regime carried out the chemical attack. The Government had also claimed that military action against Syria would be legal even if Britain failed to get a fresh UN resolution. In a highly unusual move, David Cameron ordered the release of a brief summary of the Government’s ‘legal position’ for launching retaliatory strikes against Assad. The 660-word document was effectively a summary of the advice drawn up for the Cabinet by Attorney General Dominic Grieve. The Prime Minister had told MPs the ‘excellent’ advice made it clear that intervention on humanitarian grounds would be legal even without a UN resolution.","Report concludes it's 'highly likely' that Assad was responsible for attacks .

My ten-year-old is watching me from the door, looking bemused. I'm sitting at the end of my bed gently tapping parts of my body in a sequence I repeat ten times. The only thing that makes this scene slightly less embarrassing for her is that I'm doing it in private rather than on the bench outside her school. 'Interesting,' she says, like David Attenborough describing a rare encounter with a strange endangered species. I hold up a book for her to look at as I tap and watch her roll her eyes. She doesn't care that I am waving around a book that guarantees it will change my life. A book that claims it can alleviate stress, cure pain, banish addictions, fight phobias and relieve exhaustion. It describes itself as so 'revolutionary' that it holds the key to 'emotional freedom' and a life of fearless happiness. I want some of that, obviously. And this book even comes close to claiming its techniques can help cure cancer or, at the very least, enable sufferers to live longer. Now those are serious promises. The author, Nick Ortner, says he has been using his tapping methods to help those affected by the Sandy Hook tragedy. He is helping to heal the community of Newtown, Connecticut after the mass murder of 20 schoolchildren and six teachers last December. Indeed, The Tapping Solution is already on the New York Times bestseller list just a week after publication. So it deserves to be tested properly. But I'm a cynic. At the glossy magazine I edit, we're sent books which promise to have 'the answer' for a stressed-out generation battling with recession, family woes and all manner of health issues on a daily basis. Books such as Awaken The Giant Within or Master Your Panic And Take Back Your Life. I haven't even mentioned the diet ones, the career ones or anything by Oprah. I don't think any of those books gave us anything we couldn't work out ourselves. Want to lose weight? Eat less and move more. Got depression? See a GP. The secret to being successful? Work harder. But (oh, the irony) even a sceptic like me still holds out hope for the book that really does deliver on the stress-free living promise. 'Scratch any cynic,' as the quote goes, 'and you will find a disappointed idealist'. I have four children aged two to ten, a diabetic dog that could pop its clogs at any minute, ailing relatives to care for and a full-time job with 33 staff to manage. Sometimes at night when my enormous to-do list stops me sleeping and I'm battling my fourth cold that week, my chest starts to feel so tight I think my heart may burst out of it. The ringing in my ears gets worse, my head aches and my eyes twitch. I fear the morning because my day starts when the toddler rises at 5am, yet I still struggle to fit everything in by school drop-off. Being able to multi-task is a curse. I'd love to be able to handle life more calmly - without feeling a failure or relying on three coffees before the dawn chorus. The Tapping Solution says it can help. But can I, the world's biggest disbeliever, embrace a book with such a ridiculous title? Can I trust a book that explains at great length why tapping repeatedly on acupuncture points will cure anything from post-traumatic stress to disastrous weight gain? Actually, after a week of tapping away, I think the answer is yes. Let me explain how you do it. Before you tap, you need to work out your MPI (Most Pressing Issue). So I settle for: 'I don't have enough time. I feel overwhelmed and drained.' An MPI could be anything from 'I can't stop smoking' to 'my back is so painful it's stopping me sleeping'. Basically, it's the thing ruining your life right now - but the book devotes eight chapters to different potential MPIs, from losing weight to making money, and how to deal with them. Then you rate the issue on a scale of one to ten in terms of how it is affecting you. Anything  over five deserves  'tapping out'. For the next five minutes, you tap on eight acupuncture points in the  following order: eyebrow, temple, cheek, nose,  chin, collarbone, underarm and head. As you do this you repeat a sentence, which tackles your 'limiting beliefs'. You say: 'I feel overwhelmed and drained but I deeply and completely accept myself.' Nick Ortner, says he has been using his tapping methods to help those affected by the Sandy Hook tragedy . I felt silly saying this because as I tapped away I wanted to say: 'Get a grip', but here's the clever bit. As you tap you start to think through the situation - it is almost enforced meditation. As the days pass you tap with a more positive sentence 'I choose not to feel like this' or 'I choose to believe that if I don't get it all done I am not a failure and a rubbish mother.' Self-confessed cynic Lorraine Candy says she's a tapping convert . Tapping helps change your language, so you say 'could' rather than 'should' for example. The author believes this sets off a physiological change and sends out chemical signals which train your brain to be more positive. After two days tapping, I felt significantly calmer. Most of my tapping was done in the loo as I didn't want the children to YouTube me or send off a home video to You've Been Framed to win Â£250. I also tapped watching Peppa Pig at 6am beside a bemused two-year-old. I kept the blinds drawn so the commuters walking past the kitchen window wouldn't see my odd ritual and call an ambulance. I thought about tapping in my office at work but the fear of discovery was too great. At first the tapping made me angry. It irritated me to say things out loud, and I found it tough to focus. My mind would wander to the pile of washing that needed doing. What became clear is the more you repeat something, the more true it becomes. A lot of us fear that failing in one area of our day-to-day lives - skipping the gym or forgetting to stack the dishwasher - means we have failed overall, but if you keep telling yourself that today you choose not to tick everything off the to-do list rather than that you have failed to do so, it starts to make you feel calmer. When I began I also felt profoundly down for some reason, but as the days passed I was cheered. It was free; no one need know I was doing it. I slept better and my headache disappeared. The tapping sends electrical impulses through the body, according to the author, which 'clears blockages'. I don't know how this works but it seemed to for me. In the book there are many case studies: Mary the water phobic, who dipped her toes in the pool after one tapping session; a 50-year-old lung cancer sufferer who went into remission after four months of tapping; a woman with chronic pain who tapped herself better and a breast cancer sufferer with insomnia who slept through after one day of tapping. These may or may not be credible stories (I'm sceptical about the cancer remission) but there is science to back up the claims. Still, I think a lot of it is simply the result of us wanting it to work, especially in cases of extreme illness where all other alternatives have been tried. But for what it's worth I'm a convert. Tapping seems to flick a mental switch, asking your subconscious to solve your problems for you. And after all that is when self-help works best, when it's delegated.

The independent flick, which opens this week, would never have happened unless a Ukrainian born billionaire, ex-NBA star and some of the top African-American entrepreneurs had gotten together to raise the $30million budget. The film tells the true story of Eugene Allen, the White House’s butler for over 30 years, who served eight U.S. presidents.

'Leftover women' are highly successful career women aged 26 to 34 who remain unmarried . Hysteria is growing in China about the number of unmarried 'leftover women' - but the fault lies with the country's insecure male population, according to a new investigation. Far from spurning suitors, highly successful career women aged 26 to 34 badly want to be married, but find themselves constantly rejected by Chinese men who are uncomfortable with their careers and achievements. The findings come from Dr Sandy To, a sociologist based at the University of Hong Kong. One woman, a 29-year-old fund accountant with a UK Master's degree, described how a . potential suitor, introduced to her by her parents, backed off because . 'he said he felt that he had to spend a lot of effort to control me, so . he chose someone else who was easier to control.' Another interviewee, a financial . services manager, 33, said: 'I used to date a guy who was much olderâ€¦ He . preferred me not working. His idea was that I should quit work after we . got married.' The results come just one week after the country's communist government upset its young female population by ordering its . feminist All-China Womenâ€™s Federation to use the derogatory term 'leftover women' in order to urge them into marriage. Far from spurning suitors, these women badly want to be married, but find themselves constantly rejected by Chinese men who are uncomfortable with their careers and achievements . China's . government and media are concerned over the phenomenon . of the 'sheng nu' - literally 'leftover women' - who remain unmarried . despite having a good education and high-flying jobs. In 2007, the Chinese Ministry of . Education attributed their failure to find a husband to their 'overly . high expectations for marriage partners', in an official explanation of . what sheng nu means. But Dr To's investigation into the first-hand experiences of these women found that these women struggle to find a lasting relationship because of the constraints of the conservative, patriarchal society in which they live. Specifically, the 50 women interviewed for the study - all educated to degree level and half with a Masters - found that men either discriminated against them because of their achievements, or expected them to spend more time doing housework in order to make their lives together a success - often at the expense of their jobs. Dr Sandy To says many high-flying Chinese women wish to marry, but cannot find a man who is comfortable with their successes and achievements . Dr To said: 'During China's early reform era, management-level women faced discriminatory treatment in the marriage market. Dr To's research found 'leftover women' could be split into sub-categories: . Maximisers: women who seek out even higher-achieving men who will not be . intimidated by them, or actively conceal their own successes in an . effort to make themselves seem more compatible. Satisficers: a fusion of 'satisfy' and 'suffice', these women take . the opposite approach, actively seeking out lower-status men who will . not force them to quit work and take on domestic roles, because they . themselves are not in breadwinner jobs. Traditionalists: these are women who . continually strive to find a typical marriage partner for their . demographic and struggle psychologically with the pressure of social . expectation . Innovators: women who . respond by actively seeking out a non-married lifestyle. 'Four decades later, my research found that highly-educated women in today's post-reform era still suffer from the same discrimination, as they are passed over for less-educated, less career-orientated women instead. 'Many of them want to pursue the traditional path of marriage and even end up seeking higher-status husbands in an effort to do so. 'Ironically, most are shunned by men because of their own accomplishments. These women can hardly be blamed for their ""leftover"" status, because they are the ones who are being rejected.' Dr To, who is based at the University . of Hong Kong, carried out the research while a PhD student at the . University of Cambridge. Her study was conducted in Shanghai between . 2008 and 2012 and involved Chinese women from 14 different cities. For . most Chinese people, marriage is still a 'must'. This has led to a . nationwide craze for matchmaking reality shows on TV, and matchmaking . events in public parks in almost every Chinese city, where parents . advertise their daughters' physical and economic attributes on . billboards. Dr To wanted to . find out why the so-called 'leftovers' had not got married, whether they . wanted to do so, and how they were responding to the social stigma . attached to being single in a culture which prizes marriage so highly. Contrary to the assumption that sheng nu are somehow pioneers for a new, more liberated generation of Chinese women, Dr To found most remain keen to get married . Her . four-year research project showed that despite official claims that . these women snub men who fail to live up to their own standards, the . reverse was often true. Many had been rejected by men who felt more comfortable with less accomplished women. Others had struggled in relationships with boyfriends who expected them to spend less time at work and focus more on domestic and family life. Dr To also investigated how women tried to cope with these 'male superior norms'. Contrary to the assumption that sheng nu are somehow pioneers for a new, more liberated generation of Chinese women, she found that most remain keen to get married.","Millions of high-flying women aged 26-34 remain unmarried .

Virginia Water in Surrey has become the first place outside London where house prices average more than £1million. And with its stunning lake views, commuting distance from London and the exclusive Wentworth Golf Club, it’s not hard to see why. But buyers hoping to join the likes of Sir Bruce Forsyth, Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Elton John – who have all bought properties in the sought-after location – will have to fork out more than £1million for the privilege. Property bubble: The leafy village of Virginia Water in Surrey now has an average house price of more than £1million . Attractive: Within an easy commute of central London and close to Heathrow and private schools, Virginia Water is a popular residential area . Millionaires' club: Property prices in Virginia Water have risen 6 per cent in the last year . The town, which has just 3,000 residents, has the most expensive homes in the UK, according to property website Zoopla. Property prices have risen by 6 per cent in Virginia Water, whose average price of £1.03million makes it £200,000 more expensive than the second most expensive place, Cobham, also in Surrey. 1. Virginia Water, Surrey                £1,034,368 . 2. Cobham, Surrey                         £842, 806 . 3. Beaconsfield, Bucks                   £806, 459 . 4.

Welwyn, Herts                           £687, 558 . The Property Rich List shows Britain’s most expensive street is once again Kensington Palace Gardens, West London, with an average price of £36million – which is 156 times the cost of an average British home. Close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home at Kensington Palace, the road has previously been nicknamed the Boulevard of Billionaires. Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax Bank, said: ‘In London, when you are talking about real prime areas, it’s foreign buyers who have been coming in and looking to invest. 'They see it as a haven. But places like Virginia Water are prosperous areas too.’ Illustrious neighbours: Sir Bruce Forsyth, pictured left with his wife Wilnelia, and Sir Cliff Richard are among those who own a property in picturesque Virginia Water . Sought after: Virginia Water's prestigious Wentworth Golf Club plays host to a PGA tournament every year . Charming: Virginia Water still retains its villagey atmosphere, despite the influx of wealth into the town . Not all the houses in Virginia Water are worth millions, but their price is pushed up by the area average . Lawrence Hall, spokesman for Zoopla, . said: ‘Only the super-wealthy can entertain the notion of living on the . most expensive streets and they are paying as much for the address and . the location as they are for the size and quality of the property. 'You can find magnificent mansions in . other parts of the country for a similar price to even just average . properties in areas like Kensington. Zoopla’s report conﬁrmed the gulf between property values in the north and the south of the UK housing market. Britain’s ten most sought-after streets are in London. Of the 8,230 streets in the UK where the average property value is more than £1million, only a quarter – 2,064 – are outside the South East. The cheapest street in Britain is Merryﬁeld Court in Skegness, with homes valued at little more than £31,000. The Zoopla report also revealed that there are a record number of British ‘property millionaires’. Top of the pile: Kensington Palace Gardens in West London remains the most expensive street in Britain with an average house price of £36million . Here are Britain’s most expensive streets, with the average property value:1. Kensington Palace Gardens, London W8, £36,066,1482. The Boltons, London SW10, £23,375,7583. Grosvenor Crescent, London SW1X, £19,768,9634. Courtenay Avenue, London N6, £10,750,3365. Compton Avenue, London N6, £10,006,0146. Frognal Way, London NW3, £9,513,7167. Park Place Villas, London W2, £8,980,4778. Montrose Place, London SW1X, £8,980,4689. Cottesmore Gardens, London W8, £8,813,42910. Palace Green, London W8, £8,644,535 . Nearly 325,000 homes are worth more than £1million – up by 80 per cent in four years and by a third in just 12 months. The scale of the increase in ‘property millionaires’ is eye-watering. In 2009, there were 183,630, but the number has jumped by nearly 80 per cent to reach the all-time high of 323,684 today. In the last 12 months alone, Britain added 78,000 new 'property millionaires' - an average of 1,500 a week. Many homeowners bought their property for a fraction of the current value decades ago and now discover to their delight that it is worth a seven-figure sum. But many others are not so lucky. Their home may be worth more than £1million, but they have a super-size mortgage which means they have very little equity in the property. In a further sign that the market is gathering pace, average UK prices have gone up to £168,941, marking the strongest year-on-year uplift seen since September 2010. New figures from Nationwide reveal that on a month-on-month basis, house prices rose by 0.3% in June, marking a slight slowdown compared with a 0.4% rise recorded the previous month. The building society said that Government efforts to kickstart the market, as well as a lack of available homes to buy, are helping to bolster house prices. However, there are big regional divides. Prices in London now stand at a new all-time high at an average £318,214, which is 5% above their previous 2007 peak. This house in Virginia Water is typical of the homes in area - modern, luxurious, and classical in design . Nationwide’s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said London 'has seen the greatest recovery in prices of any region'. By contrast, prices across the UK are still around 9% below their pre-crisis peak. Prices in England are currently 5% lower than those seen in 2007, while they are 13% down in Wales, 12% lower in Scotland and have plummeted by 53% in Northern Ireland compared with their 2007 levels. Ten out of 13 areas across the UK have seen house prices increase over the last year, while three - Scotland, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire and Humberside - have seen falls. Among England’s cities outside London, Newcastle saw the biggest housing market jump year on year, with prices up by 11% to reach £173,296 on average, while Liverpool saw the biggest annual drop, with an 8% slide taking prices to around £142,454. A string of recent studies have pointed to signs that the housing market is picking up, helped by Government initiatives such as Funding for Lending, which gives lenders access to cheap finance and has prompted a sharp increase in mortgage availability as well as lenders slashing their rates. Virginia Water is said to have been named after Elizabeth I who was known as the Virgin Queen . The first village outside London where the average house price is more than £1million, Virginia Water has a population of 6,113. Made up of a series of private roads set around the four golf courses of the Wentworth Club, it is said to take its name after Elizabeth I, the Virgin Queen. In truth, a cool million would probably buy you very little. Several of the palatial mansions, complete with marble kitchens and indoor pools, can go for upward of £10million. Within easy reach of central London, Heathrow and some of the most elite private schools in the country, it has been a popular retreat of the rich and famous since the Twenties. These days, such is the high value of land on the estate, many are bought to be demolished and replaced by a new-build. ‘It’s surrounded by greenbelt so there’s no new land to be had,’ says Ken Reay, of Queensgate Corporation. ‘The only option to build a new home is to buy an old one, knock it down and put one up on the site. In the past decade, land values have doubled to around £2 million per acre.’ The estate was once the preserve of golfing royalty - Ernie Elsa and Nick Faldo have both owned properties - but is now becoming increasingly popular with foreign buyers. Virginia Waters hit the headlines in 1998 when General Augusto Pinochet was placed under house arrest in one its mansions prior to his extradition. More recently, it was the setting for the dramatic death of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Other famous residents include  ex-Formula 1 team owner Eddie Jordan, Sir Elton John and boxer Prince Naseem.","Exclusive Surrey enclave breaks £1million barrier after 6 per cent increase .

Once again on Oscar night, Tinsel Town gave warmly with one hand — while cynically taking away with the other. The good news is that at least nine Britons will fly back across the Atlantic with coveted golden statues. But the bad news is that Argo — the movie that won Best Film — is yet another piece of Hollywood’s Brit-bashing junk history that casts the British in a poor light. Scroll down for video . Winner: Argo, starring and directed by Ben Affleck picked up Best Picture Oscar, but plays fast and loose with the facts of the British involvement in the Islamic revolution in Iran . According to the Affleck version of the rescue mission, the U.S. Embassy staff were turned away by British diplomats . The film, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, tells the story of how the Canadian government and the CIA managed to rescue six American diplomats from the clutches of the Iranian students who occupied the U.S. embassy during the 1979 Islamic revolution. Although the movie is a cracker — tense and terrifying — like so much that comes out Hollywood, Argo plays fast and loose with the facts. And unsurprisingly, the Brits are given a real pasting. For, according to the Affleck version of the rescue mission, the six embassy staff were refused refuge by British diplomats. ‘Brits turned them away,’ says a senior CIA character in the film. You can imagine the outraged comments over industrial buckets of popcorn in movie theatres from Alabama to Alaska. ‘Goddamn Limeys! So that’s what we get for bailing them out during World War II.’ The truth, however, could not be more different. The British did give their American colleagues sanctuary. Far from being cowards, the Brits were heroes. Many of the British diplomats then stationed in Iran are still alive — and they’re fuming. ‘When I first heard about this film, I was really quite annoyed,’ says Sir John Graham, 86, who was in Tehran at the time of the crisis. Sir John is understandably concerned that Argo will become accepted as the definitive history of what happened. He may have a point. The movie also stars 'Breaking Bad' star Bryan Cranston (left) Remember U-571 — the U-boat thriller set in World War II — which saw the Yanks, and not the British and the Poles, capture an Enigma coding machine and turn the course of the war? Or how about the abysmal piece of faux-history that was Mel Gibson’s Braveheart, which depicted the British as the rapacious, murderous oppressors of the noble and romantic Scots? Who can forget Saving Private Ryan, . Steven Spielberg’s World War II epic, that effectively presented D-Day . as an exclusively American effort? The . sad irony is that what really happened in Tehran in 1979 is just as . thrilling as Argo, if not more so — and it involved astonishing British . pluck. Ben Affleck may have won the Oscar for Best Film, but the movie won't be picking up any awards for being historically accurate anytime soon . When the . American Embassy was overrun by armed students on November 4, 1979, five . members of staff managed to escape by a side exit. The remaining 55 . embassy staff were to be held captive for a further 444 days. The . most senior member of the escaped group was Robert Anders, who worked . in the visa department. He decided the best place to find refuge was the . British Embassy. The group made its way through the bustling streets, only to find the British embassy was also surrounded by an angry mob. Thinking . on his feet, Anders quickly took the group back to his flat and from . there tried to contact anybody who might help rescue them. After . a tense night, a call came through from the British embassy informing . the five terrified Americans that it could give them refuge in its . residential compound, which was known as Gulhak. As . Argo neglects to mention, this was an exceedingly brave offer. Both the . British embassy and residential compounds were under serious threat. After what had happened to the Americans, the British understandably . feared an attack on their own staff. The Iranian revolutionaries had . dubbed Britain the ‘Little Satan’, and for our officials to shelter . diplomats from the ‘Great Satan’ (America) meant running a huge risk. The caller told Anders that a British car would come for them later that morning. The Americans sat and waited . . . and waited. What the five anxious Americans could not have known was that the British rescuers had got lost.Diplomats . Martin Williams and Gordon Pirrie spent hours fruitlessly negotiating . the thronging streets in, of all cars, an orange 1976 Austin Maxi one of . them had driven to Tehran all the way from England. But they were . unable to find Anders’s flat. At . around 5pm, the Americans called the British embassy, only to be told . by a diplomat that the Iranians were ‘coming over the walls’. A U.S. hostage, blindfolded and with his hands bound, being displayed to the crowd outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian hostage-takers in 1979 . The Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 saw demonstrators climb the wall of the U.S Embassy to burn a flag in defiance . Indeed they were. For as the city . grew dark, an army of students invaded the embassy compound. They broke . into offices and houses, smashing windows and doors. Among . those who witnessed the attack was Imelda Miers, wife of the British . Political Counsellor, David Miers. That night, Lady Miers was in her . house with her son, Thomas, who was aged just seven. ‘My . little boy was terrified, and so was I,’ she recalls. ‘We hid in my . bedroom, but then I decided that was not a great place to hide, in case . they set fire to the house.’ Lady . Miers left her room, hiding Thomas under her coat. She was soon . accosted by six students, all clutching Kalashnikovs, one of whom she . swore could be no older than 12. ‘I . thought they were going to shoot me,’ she says, ‘but when I realised . that they weren’t, I grew angry with them, and asked them if their . mothers knew they were out!’ Along with the other British embassy staff . and their wives and children, Lady Miers and Thomas were taken to a . single building where they were held captive. Although . he was in London at the time, the ambassador Sir John Graham today . suspects the students who attacked the British embassy were looking for . the Americans. ‘They claimed they were after arms,’ says Sir John, ‘but I . don’t think that was true.’ The 10 American hostages being presented to the media at the occupied U.S. Embassy shortly before their release . The American hostages being paraded outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 . Meanwhile, Williams and Pirrie had . finally found Anders and his group after hours of driving around the . backstreets of Tehran. The Americans were taken in an edgy drive to the . as-yet-untouched British residential compound. ‘The . Americans were very nervous,’ Williams recalls, ‘and they kept trying . to duck down, which in my view would only look suspicious.’ Happily, they arrived at Gulhak undetected and received a warm welcome. As . the CIA officer Antonio Mendez, who helped to mount the eventual . rescue, recalls in his book, Argo: ‘The British were kind hosts, and . offered them a house of their own, fed them a warm meal, even prepared . cocktails.’ So much for . Affleck’s suggestion that the British ‘turned away’ the Americans. Martin Williams’s wife Sue cooked that meal and the Americans went to . bed. But while they slept, the Iranian students were approaching Gulhak. Fired up with the success of  storming the British embassy, they were now ready to seize the residential compound. Standing . at the gate was a Pakistani guard in his 50s called Iskander Khan, who . brilliantly convinced the students the compound was empty — and they . went away. ‘We and the Americans had a very lucky escape,’ says Martin . Williams. ‘We were very grateful to Iskander Khan.’ The . following morning it was decided the Americans would have to move on . for their own safety. Anders and his group were told that they would . have to go, as Gulhak was clearly not secure. According . to the account written by Antonio Mendez, the Americans felt they were . ‘being kicked out’ by the British, but Williams says this is not the . case, as the reasons for leaving Gulhak were ‘self-evident’. Freed American hostages, landing at Frankfurt Airport after a flight from Iran on their way home to the U.S. Argo tells the story of how 6 American diplomats were rescued from the occupied U.S. Embassy during the 1979 revolution . For a few days the five Americans were placed in an empty house belonging to a U.S. official, where they were joined by a colleague who had also escaped from the embassy and had been in hiding. This group of six was eventually saved by the rescue mission organised by the Canadians and the CIA. After the rescue, the story remained secret, kept in classified files. However, the diplomatic community knew the British — and others — had done their bit. A recently-released State Department Briefing Memorandum from February 6, 1980, states that the British embassy was involved in the rescue of the Americans. Many of the British embassy staff from that time have seen Argo. ‘It does not bear all that much relation to the facts,’ observes Sir David Miers drily. ‘It is not a true story.’ Ben Affleck has acknowledged the film casts Britain in a bad light. ‘But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone,’ he said. Such a defence cuts little ice with Sir John Graham. ‘I can’t see why the film-makers couldn’t have acknowledged that we and others did actually help the diplomats,’ he says. ‘It wouldn’t have ruined the drama at all.’","In the film six U.S. embassy staff were .

In other cases some . doctors baulk at the prospect of discussing death or patients are simply . not told what support is available.

Despite being in constant pain, David Coupe lost his £50 a week payment, leaving his family reliant on friends and family for handouts, and unable to afford to heat their home. Although the 57-year-old tried to appeal the ruling by the Department for Work and Pensions, which was based on evidence including a report by Atos, the private company behind fitness-to-work tests, he was told it would take a year. Constant pain: Farmer David Coupe, 57, died from a rare form of cancer while he waited for the decision to strip him of his £50-a-week incapacity benefit to be overturned.

Christopher Tappin last night revealed he had to endure nights of ‘psychotic screams’ during his time in prison. The retired British businessman, who was held in a New Mexico prison for two months on arms dealing charges, said he was locked in a cell near inmates with psychological problems who kept him awake every night. Mr Tappin, 65, from Orpington, Kent, said: ‘The night screams were horrific. When I was in isolation, in the prison’s special housing unit, the screams would start every night. Released: Christopher Tappin, 65, shows off the tag on his leg which he has been given as a condition of his bail. He is not allowed to leave the U.S. while he awaits trial . ‘During the day the inmates were in a narcotic-induced stupor because they dosed them up with drugs, but by the night time the drugs had worn off. ‘I barely slept while I was in isolation. There were constantly doors slamming, these screams were ringing out and the lights were on 24 hours a day. It was awful.’ Mr Tappin, former president of Kent Golf Union, was extradited to the US in February after losing a protracted legal battle before the High Court. He was released on bail on Wednesday after two months behind bars at the maximum-security prison. He was held in the Otero County Detention Centre, which houses accused murderers, and was forced to wear a prison jumpsuit and shackles. He originally spent 23 hours a day locked up in isolation before being moved to a shared cell . The businessman was forced to surrender his British passport to US Marshals when he was extradited and must remain in Texas while he awaits his trial. Under his bail conditions, he is living with Dan Cogdell, one of his US lawyers, at his family home in Montgomery County, near Houston. Free: Christopher Tappin, 65, has described how he barely slept while behind bars. He has been bailed to live with his lawyer Dan Cogdell, left, as his case awaits trial . Custody: Tappin was held at the Otero County Prison Facility in the New Mexico desert for two months before being released on bail . His new home is a far cry from the isolated fortress surrounded by towering razor-wire fences, security lights and cameras. Mr Cogdell lives in a £620,000 mansion which boasts a pool and is nestled inside a luxurious gated community. Yesterday Mr Tappin spoke to his wife, Elaine, for the first time since being released from jail. He described the phone call as ‘emotional’ and said she cried when she heard his voice. ‘I spoke to her from jail a few times but it was nice to speak to her in my own time and for as long as I wanted, rather than being restricted to phone cards and pay phones,’ he said. ‘She was hoping to come and visit me next week, but she has a virus – a coldy flu-type thing – and she’s been told she can’t fly. ‘It’s a shame, but my son, Neil, is still coming so it will be great to see him. We’re planning to play a round of golf or two during his visit.’ Free at last: Tappin leaves court in El Paso, Texas, after being released on bail. The former Kent Golf Union president faces up to 35 years behind bars if found guilty at trial . He said Mr Cogdell’s wife, Robin, cooked him a traditional British meal for his first post-jail dinner. ‘Robin prepared us fish and chips. It was very good,’ he said. ‘I’d eaten breakfast at 9.30am on Wednesday and I hadn’t had anything in between so I was starving. ‘I had a glass of Boddington’s with the fish and chips. It was wonderful.’ Mr Tappin has to wear an electronic tag at all times to track his movements and his travel will be limited to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances. The grey-haired businessman, who uses a walking stick, faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran. He denies the charges. His case has fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said Mr Tappin’s extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not ‘readily curable’, warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system. Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have deemed it ‘one-sided’. Faraway: Christopher Tappin with his wife Elaine back home in Kent before his extradition.

They were then followed into the cathedral by Prince William, dressed in navy, and Prince Harry, in a lighter blue suit. Shortly afterwards, the coffin was carried into the church by men dressed in tweed suits, with the trousers cropped just below the knee. It was followed by Mr van Custem’s widow Emilie, and his four sons. Prince Charles and Mr van Cutsem, a former officer in the Household Cavalry, had been close since their days together at Cambridge University and shared passions for rural life, field sports and conservation. He and his wife were hugely important to not only to Prince Charles, but also his sons.

The Prince of Wales had attended the requiem mass with his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, flanked by Princes William and Harry. They were the first to leave Brentwood Cathedral in Essex after Mr van Cutsem's coffin was followed out of the church by his wife Emelie, and four sons. The private service, led by Rt Revd Thomas McMahon, the Bishop of Brentwood, lasted around 90 minutes. Each of Mr van Cutsem's four sons, Edward, Hugh, Nicholas and William gave readings during the mass which featured traditional hymns including Pie Jesu sang by the choir. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the retired archbishop of Westminster, read the prayer of commendation.

Thirty years later, at the wedding of William and Kate, their five-year-old granddaughter, Grace, was the flower girl pictured covering her ears during the flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. William and Harry spent a lot of time with the van Cutsem family as their parents’ marriage broke down, and became close friends with the couple’s four sons, Edward, 40, Hugh, 39, Nicholas, 36, and William, 33. Friendship: Prince Charles and Hugh van Cutsem became friends more than 50 years ago at Cambridge and were always close . Paying respects: Prince Harry strides into Brentwood Cathedral followed by Prince William who spoke to another mourner . It is thought that one of the four van Cutsem sons will be asked to be a godfather to Prince George. For several years, Mr and Mrs Van Cutsem were Sandringham neighbours of the royal family as the leaseholders of Anmer Hall, a 10-bedroom Georgian property. After their lease expired, the van Cutsems moved into a country house on their own estate at Hilborough, near Swaffham in Norfolk.

The wife of a British man facing arms dealing charges in the United States has described a judge's decision to remand him in custody ahead of his trial in the United States as 'heartbreaking'. Elaine Tappin said it was an 'outrage' that her 65-year-old husband Christopher was refused bail after he was extradited to the United States two weeks ago. Judge Robert Castaneda ruled Tappin must remain in custody after US prosecutors told the federal court in El Paso, Texas, he may be a 'danger to the community' if released. Accused: An artist's impression of Christopher Tappin at his bail hearing in the El Paso Federal Courthouse . Heartbroken: Elaine Tappin with her husband Christopher, before he was extradited to the U.S. Mrs Tappin, 62, of Orpington, Kent, said: 'This is an outrage. God only knows how he'll bear up. It's heartbreaking.' Tappin has spent 23 hours a day locked in his cell at the Otero County detention centre in New Mexico since he was extradited to America. His wife went on: 'I am shocked and deeply disappointed. He's a man of his word and is certainly not at risk of fleeing - where would he go? 'He doesn't have his passport or access to money. Why has the British Government allowed him to be incarcerated in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day before he's even been tried? 'Tony Blair helped the NatWest Three, why can't David Cameron help Chris?' Denied bail: The prison van carrying Christopher Tappin away from the federal courthouse after he was remanded in custody . Mrs Tappin added: 'He's not a danger to anyone - he's a 65-year-old granddad. 'How is he supposed to prepare a proper defence when he's only been allowed to communicate with his lawyers from behind a plastic screen?' Tappin lost his two-year battle . against extradition to America two weeks ago and denies attempting to . sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles which were to be shipped from . the US to Tehran via the Netherlands. The . president of the Kent Golf Union, who faces up to 35 years in jail if . convicted, was escorted into the courtroom on Friday wearing an . orange-red prison jumpsuit, with his feet and one hand shackled. Incarcerated: Christopher Tappin is a 65-year-old grandfather . US marshals allowed the other hand to remain free so he could use a cane he needs to walk. Assistant US attorney Greg McDonald asked the judge to keep Tappin in jail for the remainder of the proceedings. 'The risk is not that he'll punch somebody in the face, but through the use of a computer and the knowledge he has, he might pose a danger to the community,' Mr McDonald said. Tappin has no ties to the US and failed to disclose to court officials his frequent travels to Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, he added. But Kent Schaffer, representing Tappin, said if released, his client would have complied with any restrictions imposed by the court and his family was ready to post bail of 50,000 dollars (£31,600). His case fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said Tappin's extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not 'readily curable', warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system. Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have described it as 'one-sided', but an independent review by retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Scott Baker last year found it was both balanced and fair. Tappin's extradition follows an investigation which started in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about buyers who might have raised red flags. Those customers were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies. Caged: Tappin has spent 23 hours a day locked in his cell at the Otero County detention centre in New Mexico (pictured) since he was extradited to America . Briton Robert Gibson, an associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles. Gibson provided ICE agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers. American Robert Caldwell was also found guilty of aiding and abetting the illegal transport of defence articles and served 20 months in prison. In a brief telephone conversation with his wife, Tappin told her he was shackled and confined in a cage for five hours before his bail hearing on Friday, a family spokeswoman said. The judge agreed that measures could be imposed to ensure Tappin is monitored if released, but he said a discrepancy in Tappin's financial statement led to him being denied bail. Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the US Attorney's office in the western district of Texas, said Tappin was denied bail because he 'posed a flight risk'. His trial will take place before US District Judge David Briones in El Paso, but no date has been set.","Christopher Tappin refused bail while he awaits trial over arms dealing charges .

Freedom: Christopher Tappin, 65, leaves court after being held in custody for two months while he awaits trial . A retired British businessman extradited to the United States over arms dealing charges has been released on bail. Christopher Tappin, 65, was freed after two months in custody following a ten-minute court hearing at the federal magistrates court in El Paso, Texas. The millionaire, from Orpington, Kent, was forced to surrender his British passport to U.S. Marshals when he entered the country and must remain in Texas while he awaits his trial. Under his bail conditions, he will live with Dan Cogdell, one of his lawyers, at his family home in Montgomery County, near Houston. He must wear an electronic tag at all times and his travel will be limited to within two Texas counties as well as the border city of El Paso for court appearances. ‘If for some reason you fail to comply, you could be arrested and sent back to jail,’ Magistrate Judge Robert Castaneda warned. Tappin, who uses a walking stick, faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted of trying to sell batteries for surface-to-air missiles to Iran. He denies the charges. The former president of Kent Golf Union was extradited to the U.S. in February after losing a protracted legal battle before the High Court. He has been held in Otero County Detention Centre – a maximum-security prison in the New Mexico desert which houses accused murderers – ever since and has appeared in court in a prison jumpsuit and walking in shackles. He originally spent 23 hours a day locked up in isolation before being moved to a shared cell. In contrast, Mr Cogdell’s home is a mansion which boasts its own pool, and is nestled inside a luxurious gated community. The decision to release Tappin on bail pending his trial was made on Monday by Judge David Briones. Overturning an earlier decision to keep him in custody until his trial got under way, he said: ‘He is an older gentleman with some health problems, a pillar in his community, and has a strong support system.’ Yesterday Tappin appeared in court wearing a dark green prison jumpsuit. One hand was free to use his walking stick, the other was handcuffed to his waist. His bond was set at $1million (£620,000) and Judge Castaneda said Tappin had already posted the $50,000 (£31,000) to secure his release. Jail: The maximum-security Otero County Prison Facility where Tappin was previously held. He was originally kept in isolation for up to 23 hours per day . He told Tappin that he must meet with pre-trial services as soon as he arrived in Houston and get fitted with a GPS monitoring device to track his movements. Earlier this week Tappin’s wife, Elaine, said: ‘We have not yet had the opportunity to speak to him but we are making arrangements to visit him as soon as we can.’ Tappin’s case has fuelled the row over the fairness of the extradition treaty between the UK and the US. Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said Tappin’s extradition highlighted problems with the treaty which were not ‘readily curable’, warning that many Britons were left uneasy when faced with the seemingly harsh and disproportionate sentences in the American justice system. Released: Christopher Tappin was released after being bailed to live with lawyer Dan Cogdell in Montgomery County, near Houston . Far away: Chris Tappin with his wife Elaine pictured in his home in Orpington, Kent, before he was extradited to the U.S. Other critics of the 2003 treaty, including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, have deemed it ‘one-sided’. In court, it emerged that the U.S. immigration and customs enforcement agency are holding Tappin’s passport as a piece of evidence and looking into the countries he has travelled to. The grey-haired businessman left court after changing out of his prison clothes and into a shirt and trousers. Asked how he was feeling, he said: ‘Very well thank-you.’ He described his time in prison as ‘tolerable’ and said the experience ‘got better’ after he was moved from isolation into a shared cell. Asked whether he thought he had been treated unfairly, he said: ‘All I can say is I’m quite thankful to Judge Briones for granting me bail and I’m looking forward to putting my case to the court.’ Tappin said he was ‘excited’ about speaking to his wife, Elaine, and planned to phone her as soon as he could. Asked what he was looking forward to most about being out of jail, he said: ‘I’m looking forward to a fish and chip dinner and sleeping in a comfortable bed.’ His lawyer, Mr Cogdell also said he planned to take him out for some traditional Texan barbecue food. Tappin was expected to visit the ICE office to sign paperwork allowing him to stay in the US, before getting on a flight to Houston.","Christopher Tappin, 65, from Kent must remain in Texas while he awaits trial .

As Princess Eugenie stepped out last night with her boyfriend of three years, the growing resemblance between her beau and her father was more striking than ever. When she picked barman Jack Brooksbank as her boyfriend, it's unlikely Princess Eugenie realised he would eventually become the spitting image of his potential father-in-law Prince Andrew. The pair were pictured leaving the launch party of Mr Fogg's in London last night looking more in love than ever after spending the evening with Pippa and James Middleton along with their partners Nico Jackson and Donna Air. Eugenie and her boyfriend Jack stepped out last night (left) baring a strong resemblance to a young Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson in 1986 upon the announcement of their engagement (right) Princess Eugenie's boyfriend Jack Brooksbank (right) looked remarkably similar to a young Prince Andrew (left) in his smart, dark outfit . The pair, who have been dating since 2010, looked very much in love as they shared a joke leaving the launch party of Mr Fogg's . Eugenie looked elegant in a long sleeved white mini dress with a black belt emphasizing her waist. The dress featured a black lace panel at the front and the 23-year-old princess accessorised with summery black cork-soled wedges which made the most of her slim, tanned legs, and a black handbag. She held hands and shared a laugh, with 26-year-old Jack who buttoned up against the cold in a classic dark wool pea coat with the collar pulled up. Underneath he wore dark suit trousers and shoes, in the same discreet and smart fashion so often seen on Eugenie’s father Prince Andrew. And with his curly dark hair and pale complexion, the similarity between Jack and his potential future father-in-law was undeniable. The couple are in fact distant cousins, sharing common ancestry, but Jack, 26, keeps his feet firmly on the ground working as a waiter in London . With his curly dark hair and pale . complexion, the similarity between Jack (left) and his potential future . father-in-law (right with ex wife Sara Ferguson) is undeniable . Jack may be working as a waiter and a barman, but his heritage is in fact exactly what you would expect from a royal escort. He was educated at pricey public school Stowe and has an aristocratic background. In fact, so blue is his blood that he and Eugenie are actually distant cousins, with two of their closest common ancestors being Thomas William Coke, the 2nd Earl of Leicester (died 1909) and Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl of Harewood (died 1820). Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico James also attended the launch party last night . James Middleton (brother of the Duchess Of Cambridge) and Donna Air joined the A list crowd at the opening of Mr Fogg's in Mayfair . Eugenie, who recently graduated  from Newcastle with a degree in English literature and history of art, is clearly besotted with Jack, whom she has introduced to her family. Jack has even been on holiday with Eugenie’s mother Sarah Duchess of York and her sister Princess Beatrice. Though her parents divorced when she was just 6 years old, both Eugenie and her sister remain close to their father, who is fourth in line to the throne.","Eugenie seen out last night with boyfriend of 3 years Jack Brooksbank .

A Texas megachurch connected to a pastor who has openly questioned the benefits of modern medicine has been forced to host vaccination clinics after 21 members of the congregation contracted measles. The outbreak started when a person who contracted measles overseas visited Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark, located about 20 miles north of Fort Worth, Texas. Officials with area health departments said those affected by the outbreak range in age from 4-months to 44-years-old. TV evangelist Kenneth Copeland, pictured with his wife Gloria, is an advocate of faith healing and has talked of his belief in the vaccine-autism link . All of the school-age children with measles were homeschooled, and the majority of those who were infected had not been vaccinated. 'If it finds a pocket of people who are unimmunized, and the majority of our cases are unimmunized so far, then if you are around a person with measles, you will get sick,' Russell Jones, chief epidemiologist for Tarrant County Public Health, said Monday. In a recent sermon posted online, senior pastor Terri Pearsons encouraged those who haven't been vaccinated to do so, adding that the Old Testament is 'full of precautionary measures.' 'I would encourage you to do that. There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that. Go do it. Go do it. Go do it. And go in faith,' said Pearsons. A sign marks the entrance of the Kenneth Copeland Ministries Eagle Mountain Church in Newark, Texas . She added, if 'you've got this covered in your household by faith and it crosses your heart of faith then don't go do it. 'The main thing is stay in faith no matter what you do.' Pearsons is the eldest daughter of televangelist Kenneth Copeland, and her church is one of the cornerstones of Kenneth Copeland Ministries. He is an advocate of faith healing and has talked of his belief in the vaccine-autism link on his online talk show. Measles is spread by coughing, sneezing and close personal contact with infected people; symptoms include a fever, cough, and a rash on the face. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two doses of the combined vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, called the MMR. The first does should be when they are 12 to 15 months old and the second when they are 4 to 6 years old. Senior pastor Terri Pearsons encouraged those who haven't been vaccinated to do so, adding that the Old Testament is 'full of precautionary measures' Vaccination opt-out rates nationwide have been creeping up since the mid-2000s, spurred in part by the belief the battery of vaccinations routinely given to infants could lead to autism despite scientific evidence to the contrary and the debunking of one of the most publicized studies that first fueled vaccine fears years ago. Pearsons' father is a pioneer of the prosperity gospel, which holds that believers are destined to flourish spiritually, physically and financially - and share the wealth with others. He has built a vast ministry with a worldwide reach. Eagle Mountain International Church is located on the grounds as the Kenneth Copeland Ministries. Robert Hayes, risk manager with Kenneth Copeland Ministries, said they have held several vaccination clinics since the outbreak. He said the church has never advised against adults or children getting immunized for measles or seeking medical care. Measles is spread by coughing, sneezing and close personal contact with infected people; symptoms include a fever, cough, and a rash on the face . A statement from the organization said their position regarding any medical condition is to 'first seek the wisdom of God, His Word, and appropriate medical attention from a professional that you know and trust.' Hayes did not know why some people had not immunized their children. 'Some had for whatever reason chosen not to. Some depending on the age of their child were advised by their physician to wait until the child was a certain number of years old. I don't get a sense for why after that they did not,' he said. He said if people are still choosing to not be immunized and they've been exposed to the measles they are being asked to isolate themselves until it is clear they are not infected. The incubation period for measles is about two weeks from exposure to fever. People are contagious from four days before getting the rash to four days before breaking out in a measles rash.","TV evangelist Kenneth Copeland is an advocate of faith healing and has talked of his belief in the vaccine-autism link .

Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe was fatally shot in the head as he got out of his car to approach a suspicious-looking vehicle . Murdered garda Adrian Donohoe’s colleague was warned that he too would be shot in the head if he attempted to help his dying friend. The chilling and heartless warning stopped Detective Joe Ryan in his tracks as he ran to the aid of his partner, who had been blasted in the head with a shotgun during a botched robbery. ‘They shouted at Detective Ryan not to take another step. He watched as they shot his colleague and was told he too would be shot if he took another step,’ a well placed source revealed. The two detectives had arrived at 9.30pm on Friday to escort staff who were about to transfer €10,000 from the Lordship Credit Union at Bellurgan, near Dundalk in Co. Louth – just half a mile from Adrian Donohoe’s family home – after closing for the night. As they entered the credit union car park, Detectives Donohoe and Ryan saw a suspicious-looking  dark-coloured car parked there, with three men inside it. A fourth man was waiting by the car as if on lookout. Det Donohoe made to step out of the car to investigate but before he could even stand up properly, one of the men opened fire without warning and shot him once in the head with a shotgun. The source said: ‘Detective Ryan was told he too would be shot if he took another step. The gang then took the keys of the garda car before taking off. ‘They clearly panicked once they saw Adrian get out of the car but they were cool enough to take their keys. ‘And this was all for the sake of small money. It’s beyond belief. ‘They didn’t even give him a chance. No words were exchanged and he did not have his weapon in sight. He was shot before he even got a chance to stand up as he got out of the car. ‘He fell to the ground and died instantly. It’s absolutely appalling.

All the major national units including the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Special Detective Unit and Air Support Unit are involved. Our exclusive aerial images show the scene of the horror shooting at the rural credit union, which is opposite the local Catholic Church. The scene is now sealed off for technical examination. It has been 17 years since a Garda was shot dead in Ireland. In 1996, Jerry McCabe was shot in the head as he escorted an An Post van in Adare, Co. Limerick. Yesterday, Superintendent David Taylor described the scene of Adrian Donohoe’s murder as ‘chaotic’ and said gardaí were still trying to piece together the exact details. ‘This is a cold-blooded murder,’ he said. ‘Detective Donohoe had just alighted from the car. The scene was chaotic and we don’t have the exact timeline. He just stepped out of the car and was fatally wounded. ‘Detective Ryan is absolutely traumatised. It was a traumatic event for him to witness. His life was under threat too.’ Supt Taylor said Mrs Donohoe was ‘shattered’ over her husband’s death. ‘She is in bits,’ said Supt Taylor. ‘They have a very young family and they are absolutely in bits. ‘We are particularly interested in a dark coloured car that was seen driving in an erratic manner leaving the scene. ‘We have no indication which direction it went, north or south, and do not have registration details. Supt Taylor added: ‘Dr Khalid Jabber attended the scene and later last night the remains of Detective Donohoe were removed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where a full post mortem was carried out today.’ Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan, Deputy Commissioner Noreen O’Sullivan and Kieran Kenny, Assistant Commissioner for the area all attended the scene yesterday. Mr Callinan described the murder as a ‘sad day for Ireland’. Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan signs a book of condolence inside Dundalk Garda Station .

In what he called a ‘cry for help’ in tracking down the killers, Mr Callinan pledged: ‘I want to assure the family that we will be doing everything in our power to bring the perpetrators of this terrible murder to justice. ‘It is a very, very sad day for An Garda Siochána and for Ireland. We were deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of our colleague while he was carrying out his duty. ‘I just want to say at this time is that my thoughts, and the thoughts of everyone in An Garda Siochána and I am sure the wider community are with the Donohoe family and their immediate and extended families, particularly with Caroline and their two young children. ‘I was in contact last night with the family through my colleagues. Obviously, there is great upset and sensitivity involved so we have to allow them some time. ‘I have received overwhelming support from the Government, from my minister, from the President and many, many more political and community leaders and we deeply appreciate that. ‘This is a cry for help for An Garda Siochána,’ he said. ‘There are people out there who are aware of who these people are and I appeal to those people to come forward and help us. Society needs to make some choices here. We do need the public’s help and this is an opportunity for them to come forward. ‘Up to four people involved in the actual raid and how many were involved beyond that will remain to be seen. ‘We will put all our energy into finding out who precisely was behind this robbery. ‘It is too early to speculate if there is a subversive element in relation to this or if they are criminals, ordinary criminals.’ He described Adrian Donohoe as a ‘popular and effective’ garda who was highly respected by his peers and the community. Superintendent Dave Taylor from the Garda Press Office said a massive manhunt was now under way. ‘This is a cold-blooded murder,’ he said. ‘Detective Donohoe had just alighted from the car and was fatally wounded.’ Superintendent Dave Taylor described the killing as 'cold-blooded murder' Police hunt for clues at the crime scene near Dundalk yesterday . Adrian Donohoe was involved in a number of high-profile investigations last year. He led a probe that resulted in three men being convicted of extorting €67,000 from their victim in 2009. The men were jailed for terms of eight to 10 years. Det Garda Donohoe told a sentence hearing in Dublin last summer that the victim was still living in fear and was considering emigrating following the incident. ‘Everybody is deeply saddened and shocked by what is happened.’ Popular Adrian Donohoe was highly involved in GAA and managed the Louth Garda team that competed in a Garda inter-country competition in 2010. Tributes have been pouring in since his death. Louth TD Fergus O’Dowd said the community was reeling from the tragic news. ‘It’s absolutely devastating. It’s a shocking crime that a garda has been killed in such terrible circumstances. He was obviously a very brave and committed man. It’s an awful tragedy.’ Fianna Fáil justice spokesman Niall Collins said he had contacted the Garda Commissioner to express his sadness at the news and pass on his condolences to his family. Local Labour TD Ged Nash expressed his disgust at the news. ‘I want to express my sincere condolences to the family and the Garda his colleague’s in Louth and in the force across the country,’ he said. ‘There is a real sense of shock right across the country. ‘It’s a disgraceful and heinous act. It is the worst possible crime to kill a Garda in the line of duty when he is out there protecting the community. It is murder. Paddy Clarke, a garage owner beside Dundalk Garda Station, said he knew Adrian well and described him as a ‘lovely, family man’. ‘He used to come in for his coffee all the time and always had a smile on his face. He would park his car at my garage before going to work and his wife would collect it later that evening. ‘I always had great time for him, he was the best man you could meet.’ Gardaí have appealed for any witnesses to come forward and have asked for the public to contact them the Dundalk incident room on (042) 938 8470 or the Garda confidential line .","Father-of-two Adrian Donohue was gunned down without warning during a botched robbery attempt near Dundalk, County Louth, last night .

Distinction: The new Bill will allow same sex couples to marry - but not to use adultery as grounds for divorce should their partner be unfaithful . Plans to allow same-sex couples to marry in Britain could pave the way for the concept of adultery to be abolished in law, experts have said. Under the Government's draft Bill only infidelity between a man and a woman constitutes adultery. So while the law would give same-sex couples the right to wed, they would not be able to divorce their partner on the basis of adultery if their spouse went on to be unfaithful - unless they cheated with somebody of the opposite sex. It also states that a straight . person who discovered their husband or wife had a lover of the same-sex . could not accuse their unfaithful partner of adultery in a divorce . court. Lawyers and MPs have argued that the . distinction over adultery - which arose after Government legal experts . failed to agree on what constitutes sex between same-sex couples - . would cause confusion. They warned it would create . inequality between heterosexual and homosexual married couples who found . themselves in the divorce courts, and said it would likely result in . adultery being abolished altogether as a grounds for divorce. The lawyers who drafted the . Government's Bill managed to swerve the contentious question of what . constitutes sex between homosexual couples by adding a clause which . states that only 'conduct' between a married person and a person of the . opposite sex would constitute adultery. Leading divorce lawyer Ayesha Vardag . told the Daily Telegraph the impact of the clause could lead to the . concept of adultery to being scrapped from law altogether. She said abolishing the act of . adultery as a basis for divorce would be the only 'appropriate and . balanced' way to deal with the distinction between same sex and straight . couples arising from the new Bill. Confusion: The distinction between heterosexual and same-sex couples under the new Bill would lead to confusion, lawyers and MPs have said . The Government's draft Bill was published this week. David Cameron is forging ahead with the law despite fierce opposition from within the ranks of his own party. It will give same-sex couples the right to marry in civil or religious ceremonies if the faith in question chooses to carry it out. Culture Secretary Maria Miller, who is also minister for equalities, has said the Bill would ensure ‘equal and fair’ treatment for gay couples. She has said the law 'protects and promotes religious freedom', allowing all religious organisations to act according to their doctrines and beliefs. This Bill protects and promotes religious freedom, so all religious organisations can act according to their doctrines and beliefs.’ But Tory MPs who oppose the law argue there is no guarantee that faith groups and public sector workers could not be sued under equalities legislation - and be defeated in the European Court of Human Rights.

"By . Natalie Clarke . PUBLISHED: . 19:28 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:44 EST, 5 January 2013 . Here is a certain sort of precocious child — usually the product of a star-struck mother — who wants more than anything to be really, really famous. Growing up in a big house in Putney, South-West London, Jack Whitehall was once such boy. In 2000, when he was 12, Jack, or 'Jacky' as he is known to his ­doting parents, ­auditioned for the part of Harry Potter in Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, the first film in the series. He lost out, of course, to Daniel Radcliffe. Each successive film — and Radcliffe's mounting fame and riches — was a cruel reminder to 'Jacky' and his family of what might have been. Crude: Jack Whitehall (left) caused controversy with jokes about the Queen on Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012 . This week, however, at the age of 24, the comedian has finally got the attention he has always craved. His name has been in the papers virtually all week following his ­controversial appearance on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz Of The Year 2012 last Sunday — although not for positive reasons. Whitehall, who was on the show with friend and fellow comic James Corden, as well as Jimmy Carr and Jonathan Ross, began by cracking lewd 'jokes' about the Queen and Prince Philip before making a series of ­infantile, sexually explicit remarks about sprinter Usain Bolt and singer Susan Boyle. During the show, he drank roughly a ­bottle of wine and appeared intoxicated, sparking speculation that alcohol was to blame for his puerile display. Not so, according to one who knows him. 'What we saw on the show is what you get away from the cameras,' says the acquaintance. 'He comes out with the most unbelievably crass things, he's incredibly ­childish. He has been very spoilt all his life and thinks he can say what he likes.' But where did baby-faced ­Whitehall, whose new beard looks quite incongruous against his pink cheeks, acquire such blithe confidence? A clue may lie in his background, which is about as luvvie-ish as you can get. His father is Michael Whitehall, 72, a former theatrical agent turned producer. His clients over the years have included Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Richard E. Grant, ­Daniel Day-Lewis and Edward Fox. Outrage: Whitehall appeared with other comedians, including Jimmy Carr, Russell Howard and James Corden . Mother Hilary, 51, is a former actress (stage name Hilary Gish) who retrained as a 'doula' — someone who assists a pregnant woman before, during and after childbirth. Jack has a sister Molly, 23, and 20-year-old brother, Barnaby. His godfather is actor Nigel Havers, an old showbiz friend of both his parents. Michael Whitehall's first wife, whom he married in 1969, was Jane McIntosh, who went on to marry the lyricist Tim Rice. He also had a ­relationship with Lynne Frederick, who later married Peter Sellers. In 1989, Mr Whitehall was involved in a high-profile High Court action brought by a former long-term lover, Victoria Windeler, who tried to claim a share of his homes and assets. Miss Windeler, who told the court of lavish champagne parties thrown by Mr Whitehall for stars such as Havers, Peter Bowles and Stewart Granger, lost the case. Over the years, Mr Whitehall, the author of Shark-Infested Waters, a waspish account of the showbusiness world, has had ­various production companies, which have left him very well-off. Last year, the family sold their six-bedroom house overlooking Putney Common for £4.25 million and moved to another house overlooking the Thames nearby, for which they paid £2.55 million. The new property is mortgage-free. Privately educated: The comedian went to the £24,000-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire . Born into such a gilded showbiz set, it is little wonder Jack Whitehall has achieved TV fame at such a young age. He ­certainly started young. At the age of four, he and sister Molly appeared in The Good Guys, a television series produced by their father, and starring their mother and Nigel Havers. He was privately educated at The Harrodian School in South-West London and £24,000-a-year ­Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Another pupil, the Duchess of ­Cambridge, then Kate Middleton, was five years his senior. There were lots of auditions as he was growing up and he talked about his attempt to play Harry Potter on Radio 4's Front Row programme. It was aired two days ago but was recorded before the furore over the Big Fat Quiz erupted. 'That was very much driven by my mother,' he said. 'She was very excited. She bought us all the books. Weirdly, the audition process came to my school and they did an open audition where one of the cast agent's assistants looked at loads of different pupils to see if any of them would work in the film. 'My Dad, being an agent at the time, said: 'This is nonsense, Jack, we're not sending you off to some open audition. They never find anyone from an open audition. I'll get you a one-to-one because I know David Heyman's (the producer) mother, I used to work with her.' 'He knows all these people, so he said: 'I'll get you in the door.' Mockney: Whitehall ditched his earlier attempts to play down his posh background . 'My Mum made me up to look like Harry Potter, put me in round framed glasses, did the hair so I looked just like Harry, so I went in and completely fluffed it, hadn't read the book, so when she was ­asking me who the scariest villain was . . . I completely forgot the name of the character and I didn't get it. 'My Dad was very disappointed because he thought that could have been his gold ticket to LA.' When Whitehall began touring on the comedy circuit, he tried to ­disguise his plummy voice and acquired a 'Mockney' accent, which he thought would go down better with audiences. When it didn't, he changed his routine and began playing up to his 'posh public schoolboy' background. The Whitehalls, according to an acquaintance, are very aspirational and don't mind if people think they are more posh than they are. 'They're rather like the Middletons,' explains a source. 'Real social climbers. The Dad sounds like a character from Downton Abbey.' Whitehall talked about the class issue on Front Row. 'It's a weird one. I never know what defines you as being posh,' he said. 'I went to a posh school, definitely. People at Marlborough were all trying to hide the fact we were posh. 'And my Dad is very, very middle class, and he came from not a ­middle-class background and ­neither did my Mum, so I guess I'd be first generation posh.' He became friends with James Corden and Matthew Horne — stars of the sitcom Gavin And Stacey — on the comedy circuit. And he admits they got him his big break in television when they 'bullied' the producers of Big Brother's Big Mouth into ­giving him an opportunity to present the show in 2009. Who says it doesn't help to have friends in the business? In 2010, Whitehall was nominated for Best Newcomer at the ­Edinburgh comedy awards and he became a ­regular on BBC2's Mock The Week and was also a guest ­presenter of BBC 2's pop quiz Never Mind The Buzzcocks. Early on, Whitehall discovered he could find easy laughs by pushing the boundaries of good taste. During the recording of Front Row, he recalled: 'The first time I ever did live at the Apollo, I was doing a routine about sex and I looked out into the audience and I saw Antony Worrall Thompson, because he was one of the ­celebrities they had invited. Newcomer: Whitehall made his acting debut last year as JP in Channel 4 comedy drama Fresh Meat . 'And it triggered this memory, which is a true story, that I lost my virginity in one of his establishments, which is a restaurant hotel that he had, and I said this. 'I blurted it out on stage and then did some jokes about it, then came out at the interval and found my Mum apologising to Antony Worrall Thompson, saying: 'I'm so sorry. He does this all the time. We have no control over him.'' In June 2010, the News Of The World published pictures of Whitehall snorting cocaine through a £20 note at the side of the road outside a nightclub in Manchester. There was a time when such a thing could have destroyed a young performer's career, but the episode was just a minor blip for Whitehall. he made his acting debut in 2011 in the Channel 4 comedy drama Fresh Meat, in which he plays JP, a public schoolboy who failed to get into a good university. Starring alongside him was Gemma Chan, who had previously appeared with Billie Piper in the ITV2 drama, Secret Diary Of A Call Girl. The pair became an item and last year moved into a £2.6 million flat in Notting Hill — bought with a £1 million deposit from Whitehall. Good education: The star of Bad Education is said to enjoy the attention of young female fans . The couple's neighbours include Stella McCartney, Jeremy Clarkson and Chancellor George Osborne. Finding the funds shouldn't have been too much of a strain for Whitehall. His company, Jackpot Productions, has assets of £600,000 and accounts to the end of January 2012 show a profit of just over £400,000. Before this week, Whitehall's star showed no sign of waning. Last year, he appeared in a BBC3 comedy drama about a young teacher, Bad Education, which he wrote. Those in his circle say fame has made him more cocksure and ­unrestrained than ever and that he particularly enjoys the attention of the young female fans of Fresh Meat and Bad Education. He is said to be unfazed by all the outrage following his latest TV appearance, and actually rather enjoying it. 'He's delighted,' says a source. 'He thinks it's going to do wonders for his career.' Later this month, Whitehall was due to present a prize at the National Television Awards. A producer of the show said earlier this week there would be a meeting to decide if he should withdraw, but it appears that he will present the award as planned. At least he's got a few weeks to think of a decent joke.","A puerile display has finally got the comedian the attention he has craved .

A California boy who shot dead his neo-Nazi father at age 10 has been sentenced to seven years in juvenile prison. In sending the boy to a detention center instead of a mental hospital, Riverside Judge Jean R. Leonard ruled that Joseph Hall - now age 12 - is a threat to society and must be kept behind bars. Defense lawyers had argued he needed intensive treatment, not a prison cell, in order to rehabilitate him. Under the sentence, Joseph is expected to be eligible for parole when he is 20 - though he could get paroled at age 18 with good behavior. He cannot be held past age 23. He will likely be sent to the O.H. Close Detention Center in Stockton, California - a juvenile prison that houses inmates in bunk-style housing and includes school classes and strict discipline. Troubled: Joseph Hall was just 10 when he admitted to shooting his father in the head at point blank range while he slept . Joseph will likely be sent to the O.H. Close Detention Center in Stockton, California (stock photo) In May 2011, Joseph shot his father . Jeffrey Hall in the head at point blank range as the 32-year-old slept . on the couch. He was just 10 at the time - one of the youngest boys . charged with murder in recent years. Hall was a leader of the local chapter of the neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Movement. In January, a judge convicted him of second degree murder. Since then prosecutors and defense attorney's have . been locked in battle over where Joseph should serve out his sentence. For an adult, the charge usually carries a sentence of 40 years to life. Riverside prosecutors . say the boy has a history of violent behavior - choking his teacher, . stabbing his sister and clubbing his uncle - and that he planned the . killing because he didn't like his father. The . defense questioned whether it is right to punish a 13-year-old boy . for a killing he committed two and a half years ago and how best to . rehabilitate someone who grew up in an abusive home, attacked his . elementary school teachers and was indoctrinated in the beliefs of white . supremacy. He has been . living in the county's juvenile hall since the killing but spent about . three months at a state youth detention center where he was evaluated to . see whether a placement there could serve his needs. Several people . from the state are expected to testify at the hearing. In . the meantime, the small child who scribbled on a notepad and looked . bored during his trial as prosecutors displayed photos of his father's . blood-splattered body grew into a gangly teenager who is more . focused than ever before. He . attends class, gets regular therapy and has made progress in . controlling the violent outbursts that got him kicked out of almost . every school he attended. He has even, with time, won the affection of . the prosecutor who got him convicted. Neo-Nazi: Jeff Hall, 32, was a regional leader of the white supremacist group the National Socialist Movement - though prosecutors argue that had nothing to do with his murder . 'I . have grown attached to him in an odd way. I enjoy watching him grow and . change but I am convinced he has done better in a quasi-military penal . environment,' said Riverside County Chief Deputy District Attorney . Michael Soccio. 'He seems to like it, he knows what the rules are and what is expected and he is treated with dignity.' That's . why Soccio argued the boy, now 13, would do best in the state's . juvenile justice system, where he would go to school and live in a . dorm-like setting at a high-security facility for young offenders, . possibly until age 23. Defense attorneys, however, said the teen has serious emotional disabilities that the state isn't equipped to handle. They . want to see him placed in a residential treatment center, where . security would be lighter and the therapy would be more intense. Punam . Patel Grewal, the boy's defense attorney, said he would also be at risk . in a state facility because of his father's neo-Nazi beliefs. 'It . is a very dangerous place for him. He's got a lot of vulnerability . here,' she said. 'When he comes out at 23, we've got a huge problem.' Speaking out to NBC Los Angeles, Joseph's mother said that she fears for her son's safety and education if he is sent to a state juvenile justice facility. 'With the current situation, it looks really dim,' Leticia Neal said. Neal said her son has been struggling with emotional issues and learning challenges as a result of his upbringing. 'I’m very concerned,' Neal told NBC4. 'It makes me wonder, will he ever graduate from high school?' Abusive: Defense lawyers said Jeff Hall beat and . kicked his son and that he raised in children in a household infected . by violence . Murders . by defendants as young as the one in Riverside are extremely rare and . usually involve children who have mental health issues and have lived . through extreme physical and psychological trauma, said Sarah Bryer, . director of Washington, D.C.-based National Juvenile Justice Network. 'If . the end goal is rehabilitation, then that youth's mental health . concerns are going to have to be front and center,' she said. 'I think . the judge has to ask the question, when this kid walks out — and this . kid will walk out eventually — how is this kid going to be better?' Hall's killing attracted national attention when it happened on May 1, 2011 — and not just because of the defendant's age. Hall, . an out-of-work plumber, was also a regional leader of the National . Socialist Movement who organized neo-Nazi rallies at synagogues and day . labor sites and had hosted a meeting for the group at his house the day . before he died. Hall, 32, ran unsuccessfully for a water board in 2010 and alarmed voters with his white supremacist rhetoric. Prosecutors . say Joseph waited until Jeff Hall passed out drunk on the couch after . an argument with his wife and then retrieved his father's Rossi .357 . magnum revolver and shot him in the head at point-blank range. Joseph . admitted to the shooting and told police that he didn't think he would . be prosecuted because he saw an episode of the TV crime drama criminal . minds where a young boy killed his abusive father and wasn't arrested. 'A . bad father did something to his kids and the kid did the exact same . thing I did - he shot him,’ the boy said in a video recording of an . interview played at the trial. ‘He . told the truth and wasn't arrested and the cops believed him. He wasn't . in trouble or anything. I thought maybe the exact same thing would . happen to me,’ Joseph said. Brutal: Joseph Hall, age 10 at the time, . admitted to using his father's .357 magnum revolver to shoot him in the . head at point blank range . Prosecutors . said the boy shot his father behind the ear at point-blank range as he . slept on the sofa after coming home from a night of drinking. The . child took the .357-Magnum from his parents' bedroom and later told . police he was afraid he would have to choose between living with his . father and his stepmother, who had been fighting and were headed for a . divorce. The boy's . stepmother initially told police she had killed her husband, but later . recanted and said she was trying to protect her stepson. His sister . testified that he told her of his plan the day before, while they were . playing on a swing set. During . trial, the boy's defense attorney portrayed him as a victim of both his . father's racist beliefs and of his violent upbringing. The boy's stepmother told authorities that Hall had hit, kicked and yelled at his son for being too loud or getting in the way. Hall . and the boy's biological mother had each accused the other of child . abuse multiple times during a protracted custody dispute. Social service . workers visited 20 times but never removed the boy or his siblings from . the custody of Hall. The . child also had a history of being expelled from school for violent . outbursts, starting at age 5 when he stabbed a teacher with a pencil on . the first day of kindergarten. He also tried to strangle a teacher with a . phone cord.","Joseph Hall shot his father Jeffrey Hall in the head at point blank range in May 2011 .

A Florida mother has been sentenced to 54 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to sexually abusing her children together with her husband, a decorated Marine. Sarah Adleta, 29, was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. Her retired Marine ex-husband Jonathan Adleta, who was awarded the Purple Heart, was found guilty last month and faces 10 years to life in jail. The disgraced Marine officer, 25, allegedly wanted to have 'daddy-daughter sex', according to graphic details from the trial in Orlando, Florida. Doomed: Sarah Adleta, 29, was sentenced to 54 years in federal prison for abusing her two children. Her Marine husband Jonathan Adleta (right), who has been found guilty, will learn his fate in December . Jonathan Adleta allegedly told Sarah when she was pregnant that he would only marry her if she consented to him abusing their daughter while she was expected to do the same to their son, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Even after the couple divorced, the children's horrifying ordeal continued. The mother went to live in Orlando, Florida with the children but her ex convinced her to let him abuse their daughter over Skype. She also brought her daughter to visit her ex-husband in Oklahoma so that he could abuse her. During Adleta's sentencing hearing Monday, mental health counselor Cherilyn Rowland Petrie testified that the couple's young daughter exhibited such disturbing sexual behaviour that she had to be removed from the home of a family that had been caring for her following the arrest of her parents, The Orlando Sentinel reported. Traumatized: A mental health expert testified that the couple's daughter (left) had the developmental level of an 18-month-old and exhibited such disturbing sexual behaviour that she had to be removed from a foster home . The girl, who was 4 years old at the time, had the developmental level of an 18-month-old, was malnourished and not potty-trained. Sarah Adleta's father made an emotional plea asking the judge to give his daughter the maximum sentence, telling the court that 'justice is needed.' The 29-year-old appealed for mercy, telling the judge that she was manipulated by her ex-husband, Jonathan Adleta. The defense was hoping that the mother of two would get a concurrent sentence of 27 years instead of two consecutive 27-year terms, with public defender James Smith arguing that Miss Adleta helped convict her ex-husband by offering her testimony against him. However, Judge Roy Dalton Jr said that the facts of this case were so 'egregious' that he decided to sentence her to 27 years in prison for each of the two counts. The abuse began when the little girl was born in March 2009. The couple married the following year. Sarah . Adleta  told the court this week that she consented to the abuse of her . children because she loved Adleta and needed the financial support. Horrifying: Jurors heard despicable details of the sexual abuse of two young children at Orlando federal court this week (pictured) The Adletas' horrifying and despicable sexual abuse of their own children . was only uncovered when FBI were tipped off when the mother sent naked . pictures of herself and the toddlers to a man in North Carolina. The mother performed sex acts on her children so the man, Aaron Dixon, could watch, according to testimony she gave the court during her husband's trial last month. Jonathan . Adleta served with the U.S. Marines for four years as a training . officer. He was awarded the Purple Heart following a tour of . Afghanistan.

The National Security Agency collects hundreds of millions of text messages from around the world every day, according to the latest Edward Snowden revelation. NSA spies cast a global net collecting about 200million texts a day for the purposes of extracting phone metadata such as location, contacts and financial info, the Guardian reported. The spy agency also shares the collected information with British spy agency GCHQ, according to the paper. Still disclosing secrets: Spy document leaker Edward Snowden is still providing news outlets with NSA documents despite a stoppage of the leaking being stipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the terms of his asylum in Russia . The report details the program codenamed ‘Dishfire.’ Dishfire indiscriminately collects and stores ‘pretty much everything it can’ without discerning between actual surveillance targets and innocent civilians. The messages gathered are usually automated messages people receive when they miss calls, are roaming internationally or come from bank and credit card transactions. Spies are then able piece together people’s travels, contacts, spending habits and more – this work is not limited to persons of interest. The Guardian revealed several slides from a 2011 NSA presentation titled ‘SMS Text Messages: A Goldmine to Exploit.’ The presentation, just like others published in the paper, details exactly how the dragnet operates. A program referred to as ‘Prefer’ is used in tandem with Dishfire to mine the automated messages and source ‘content-derived metadata.’ Spy central: The NSA headquarters iin Fort Meade, MD . Typical days saw more than 5million missed call alerts, roughly 1.6million border crossings, about 110,000 names and over 800,000 financial transactions mined by the spooks. Geolocation data was also extracted from a further 76,000 texts a day from ‘requests by people for route info’ and ‘setting up meetings,’ as well as travel advisories including flight delays and cancellations. Documents shown in the Guardian report suggest that U.S. phone numbers are removed from the database, but others – including U.K.-based communications – are retained. GCHQ is not permitted to search through the data without a warrant, but are able to historically = see who U.K.-based persons are texting. A GCHQ memo published in the paper details what sets the NSA program apart from the rest.‘In contrast to [most] GCHQ equivalents, DISHFIRE contains a large volume of unselected SMS traffic,’ the memo reads. Mostly automated messages: The texts snared by the NSA are mostly automated notifications from a variety of services used by everyday people . ‘This makes it particularly useful for the development of new targets, since it is possible to examine the content of messages sent months or even years before the target was known to be of interest.’ Security analysts are asked in a separate GCHQ memo to limit their searches to no more than 1,800 numbers at a time, a show of how encompassing the program can be in the right hands. An NSA spokesperson denied the agency has unfettered access to global text messages, and claimed to the Guardian that any suggestion to the contrary is false. A GCHQ spokesperson declined to comment to the paper, saying that ‘it is a longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters.’ The revelations came only one day before U.S. President Barack Obama is set to publicly speak about possible NSA reforms.","The latest Edward Snowden revelation shows the NSA collects almost 200million text messages a day .

A mother has spoken of her heartbreak after her son died in a car crash as he rushed to see his fatally injured sister - just months after he shot dead his mom's fiance in self defense. The string of tragedies has devastated Rose Tucker, 43, who is now planning funerals for her children Ricky, 20, and Brenda, 21, six months after losing her fiance, James Hickey, 37. 'I cry all day,' she told the Detroit Free Press as she looked over family photographs in her Detroit, Michigan home. 'I don't know what to do, so I'm lost.' She explained that the heartache began in April when she was fighting with Hickey, who had lived with the family for 18 years. After her son pulled her fiance off her, Hickey pulled a gun and shot him. Tragedy: Ricky Tucker, left, died in a car crash as he rushed to see his sister Brenda, right, in hospital after she fatally shot herself in the chest on Sunday morning. He did not know she was already dead . Ricky returned fire and hit the man he saw as his stepfather in the chest, killing him. Although the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office ruled Ricky acted in lawful self-defense and did not press charges, he punished himself - and he and his sister took the death badly. 'They've both been messed up since that happened,' their mother told the Free Press. She explained that they had both tried to take their lives, which had alienated some relatives. Then early Sunday morning, she received a call from Ricky that her daughter had a gun at the Texas Bar & Grill on Kercheval, which is owned by the family. Loss: Their mother Rose Tucker, left, said that both her children were struggling with the death of her fiance James Hickey, right, who was shot dead by Ricky in self defense during a fight in April . 'She grabbed a gun, and I took it away from her head,' her uncle, Eddie Falbo told the Detroit News . 'Others . were talking to her. I came out the door and heard, ""pop"". It was . terrible. There were about eight to ten people in the bar; everyone . heard it.' Before Rose arrived, Ricky called again to tell his mother the news.

A credit card belonging to a Wall Street Journal reporter, who has been missing from his New Jersey home since Saturday, has allegedly been used in Mexico. David Bird was last seen at his Long Hill Township home on Saturday afternoon, when he told his wife he was going for a walk. Police searched the woods and river near his home, but there had been no sign of the 55-year-old until his credit card was reportedly used on Wednesday night. Missing: David Bird was last seen on Saturday when he told his wife he planned to take a walk . According to NBC News, the card was used for a purchase in Mexico, and the family believe Mr Bird's disappearance may be connected to his coverage of Opec. Mr Bird, a father-of-two, covered energy markets for the Wall Street Journal, and works for the Dow Jones. He was recovering from a gastrointestinal virus when he disappeared, leaving behind his cell phone and vital medication he has to take twice a day for a liver transplant. Carolyn Buscarino, who has known the family for ten years, dismissed the NBC report as 'speculation' and told the New York Post: 'There are a lot of rumors going around.' Opec - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - is a group of 12 oil-exporting countries based in Africa, the Middle East, South America and Latin America. Mr Bird's reports on the organization tended to be straightforward news pieces, leading others to also dismiss the connection between his disappearance and the group as nothing more than rumors. A call to the Morris County Prosecutor's Officer to confirm reports of the card being used has not yet been returned. Police Chief Michael Mazzeo told the Echoes-Sentinel on Thursday morning that the 'only thing to report is that he is still missing'. Search: About 200 police and volunteers have been combing woodland and a river near David Bird's home . Mr Bird's wife, Nancy, reported her . husband missing a couple of hours after he left their home at 4.30pm, . saying he wanted to take a walk before heavy rain was expected. 'I . knew this wasn't right. Something was wrong. He's a really great dad . and a really great husband,' she told the Wall Street Journal. An extensive search involving about 200 police and volunteers has been carried out since Saturday. Helicopters and divers have been used to search the surrounding area and walking routes favored by Mr Bird. Despite needing medication twice a day for the liver transplant he had about nine years ago, Mr Bird regularly hiked and also ran the New York Marathon last year. When he left the house, the 6ft 1in reporter was wearing a red jacket with a yellow zipper, and a hat with a flashlight strapped to it. , .","David Bird was last seen going for a walk near his family's home .

Two young children have been left orphaned after their father died in his sleep in the same bed where their mother had succumbed to cancer just two months before. Stephen Furbush, 39, passed away following a suspected heart attack at his home in Canton, Massachusetts on Sunday, leaving his children, Kayley, six, and Patrick, three, with no parents. His wife Kristen had died in November after a six-month battle with brain cancer. 'The kids were almost getting back . to some kind of normalcy,' Kristen’s father, John O'Keefe told the Patriot Ledger. 'And . then bang, this happened. It's crazy. I don't know why.' Torn apart: Stephen Furbush, right, died in his bed on Sunday - just two months after his wife Kristen passed away from cancer, leaving their two children, Kayley and Patrick, without parents . Mr O'Keefe and his wife, who are 64 and 62 and both work, are now looking after Kayley and Patrick at the children's home, while numerous cousins, uncles and aunts rally around them. Stephen's brother said three-year-old Patrick doesn't really understand the deaths, but that little Kayley immediately broke down on hearing about her father. 'She immediately grasped onto the nearest family member and started sobbing,' he said. 'She just went through this two months ago with her mother, and we explained to her, ""Kayley, you have two angels now looking down on you"".' Stephen had spent Saturday night at home watching the football game with friends. One stayed overnight and made the heartbreaking discovery on Sunday morning. Loved: The siblings, aged three and six, are now being looked after by their mother's parents . Broken heart syndrome, which is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or takotsubo cardiomyopathy, can strike even healthy people, according to the American Heart Association. It is caused by a stressful situation, from suffering a break-up or death. It may be misdiagnosed as a heart attack because the symptoms and test results are similar;  1 to 2 per cent of people diagnosed with a heart attack are really suffering from the broken heart syndrome. Tests show changes in rhythm and blood substances that are typical of a heart attack, but unlike in a heart attack, there's no evidence of blocked heart arteries. In the condition, part of the heart temporarily enlarges and doesn’t pump well. It can cause severe, short-term heart muscle failure, but it is rarely fatal. It is usually treatable and sufferers can make a full recovery within weeks. Authorities said the death is not suspicious and the Boston Herald reported that the cause was a heart attack. This time last year, the couple was enjoying bringing up their young children after seven years of marriage and four years living in Canton. But last May, Kristen started to suffer from blurred vision and headaches. An MRI scan found a tumor pressing on an optic nerve and Kristen began radiation and chemotherapy - but her condition worsened quickly. On a website set up to share details of her care, Stephen wrote on November 8: 'The cancer is moving faster than the medical science.' She returned home and passed away on November 11. 'She just wanted to come home and get her . loving arms around her two beautiful children whom she loved more than . any mother ever has,' Stephen wrote. 'She said all her . goodbyes, made her peace and set her soul free.' Stephen's relatives said he had been tremendous with his children following the death of his wife.

Dialling 911 to report a robbery is entirely reasonable – but if you've just had illegal substances forcibly taken from you, then don’t be surprised if the police aren’t entirely sympathetic. Just such a scenario is said to have played out in the car park of a Taco Bell in Westlake, Ohio, last September. Two men, Sebastian Wozniak, 20, and Anthony Klier, 22, met a group of teenagers in the parking lot to practice medieval sword fighting, but also wanted to sell them marijuana, police alleged. Two Ohio men complained to police that they'd been the victim of a robbery, but an investigation revealed that it was their drug stash that had been taken . When the sword play finished the group climbed into a car, where Wozniak and Klier allegedly attempted to sell the teens $80 of the illegal substance. However, one of the teens disabled Wozniak with pepper spray, grabbed the drugs and fled. Wozniak and Klier immediately dialled 911 to report that they’d been robbed, but did not mention precisely what had been taken. The attempted drug deal took place in a Taco Bell car park (file picture) The subsequent investigation by the authorities, which consisted of phone record analysis and interviews with witnesses, led them to believe that Wozniak and Klier actually had their own drug stash swiped. Wozniak was later charged with trafficking marijuana, obstructing justice and possessing criminal tools. Klier faces charges of trafficking marijuana and obstructing justice, Cleveland.com reported. Wozniak’s charges were eventually reduced to misdemeanors and he pleaded guilty to them on Tuesday at Rocky River Municipal Court.","Sebastian Wozniak, 20, and Anthony Klier, 22, reported a robbery last year .

Annise Parker, the mayor of Houston, has married her longtime partner Kathy Hubbard in a sunset ceremony at a private residence in Palm Springs, California. A small group of family and friends, including Parker's mother and Hubbard's sister, attended the service on Thursday. The ceremony was performed by the Rev. Paul Fromberg, rector of St. Gregory of Nyssa Episcopal Church in San Francisco. House Mayor Annise Parker (right) and her long-time partner, Kathy Hubbard, celebrate at their wedding on Thursday in Palm Springs, California . The couple chose Thursday as their wedding date because it was the 23rd anniversary of the beginning of their relationship. When she was elected in 2009 Parker became the first openly gay Mayor of any major US city . 'This is a very happy day for us,' Ms Parker said in her statement. 'We have had to wait a very long time to formalize our commitment to each other. 'Kathy has been by my side for more than two decades, helping to raise a family, nurture my political career and all of the other ups and downs and life events that come with a committed relationship. 'She is the love of my life, and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life married to her.' Rev Fromberg is a gay priest who had been rector of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Houston before leaving for San Francisco. Ms Parker's election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor. While California allows gay people to marry, Texas does not recognize same-sex marriages. According to the mayor's statement, Ms Hubbard will avail herself of other insurance options 'and will, therefore, not participate in the new policy granting city health insurance benefits to spouses of legally married city employees.' Ms Parker has previously stated that she wanted to get married in Houston, but acknowledged that being able to do so may be a long time in coming. It has proved one wait too long, however she will still benefit from laws she passed which give employee benefits to same sex spouses married in states that recognize them. Parker had previously said that she wanted to be married in Texas, but acknowledged that change may be some time in coming . This move has angered some of her detractors, including Harris County GOP chair Jared Woodfill, who told ABD Eyewitness News: 'This is about a bigger political agenda for her. 'The fact she is going to another state and then will come back and live and enjoy the benefits of her unilateral, executive, unlawful order represents, that really the worst in a politician.'","Annise Parker has married her 23-year partner Kathy Hubbard .

The most expensive item on the menu at most Waffle House restaurants is less then $20. So when a South Carolina man and his wife stopped by the popular chain restaurant for breakfast last week, he was absolutely floored when his bill for the couple was more than $1,600. 'I almost had a heart attack,' Jim Andrews told a local news station after he was charged $1,666.61 for two breakfast entrees at a Waffle House in Piedmont. Obviously, Andrews and his wife didn't eat more than $1,600 worth of food between the two of them at a Waffle House, so there certainly had to be an explanation for the enormous bill. Pricey: Jim Andrews was charged more than $1,600 for breakfast at a Waffle House restaurant . Cheap: In most cases, the most expensive item on a Waffle House menu is less than $20 . There was - but Andrews had to take his inflated tab all the way to the company's corporate office to sort it out after the manager at the restaurant refused to acknowledge that something was clearly amiss. The actual bill for Andrew's breakfast was $16.51. When the cashier rang it up, he says, something went terribly wrong. 'I sign it, and I look at it again, and it says $1666.61,' he tells Fox Carolina. Obviously a mistake had been made. But Andrews says that when he brought the error to the attention of the cashier, the cashier argued with him about the ludicrous charge. Oops: Andrews says the accident happened when a 6 on the credit card machine got stuck . Correction: After being forced to go to the restaurant's corporate office, the charges on Andrews' credit card were corrected . After emailing several people about the ridiculous charge, Andrews says he finally got through to the restaurant's corporate office, where he was finally able to have the pending charge reversed. 'Our accounting department spoke with Mr. Andrews this morning to . apologize and correct the matter,' a spokesman for the restaurant chain says in a statement.

According to Andrews, he was told that the mishap occurred because a 6 on the credit card machine was sticking, which caused it add two extra digits to his bill. He says that if he knew that was the case, he would have happily just paid in cash. Of the incident, Andrews says the most frustrating part was arguing with the cashier about what obviously was a mistake.

A claustrophobic mortgage banker has told the story of how a round of golf ended up with him plunging into a sinkhole that opened as he walked across the 14th hole. Mark Mihal, 43, and his partner Mike Peters, were easily beating regular opponents Ed Magaletta and Hank Martinez during a game in early March last year. Mr Mihal and Mr Peters had both outdriven the other pair on the 14th hole of the Annbriar golf course in Waterloo, Illinois. Each landed the ball nicely on the fairway, leaving Mr Magaletta and Mr Martinez at the edge of the woods trying to clear a bunker. But while Mr Mihal was waiting for Mr Peters to hit his second shot, he noticed a shallow, bathtub-size depression in the grass of the fairway. It was out of place on the well-kept course, and looked as if it would be tricky to play out of. He walked over and stepped into the depression - and promptly vanished. Acidic rainwater thousands of years ago had started dissolving the limestone bedrock 30 feet under the topsoil. Eventually, an underground pit had formed, topped by a clay arch covered with only a flimsy layer of turf. Mr Magaletta shined a small torch out of his pocket and pointed it down the hole. All he could see of Mark was a bit of white T-shirt. He shouted down to him: 'Are you all right, Mark?' 'No, I’m not. My shoulder’s broken. I can’t move.' The stricken golfer replied according to a feature in the February issue of Reader's Digest. Mike Peters, Hank Martinez, and Ed Magaletta call to Mark Mihal in the sinkhole . To make the situation worse, Mr Mihal is claustrophobic so his friends enlarged the hole overhead, letting in more daylight. The sinkhole was about 12 feet across and narrower at the top and he had landed on mud and other debris that had fallen with him. One of the course’s owners, William Nobbe, and his son Russ arrived with a 12-foot ladder and a rope, but as it was too short, they resorted to putting it on the mud pile. The injured man then had to slide across the mud pile and tried to climb up the ladder but he was too hurt to manage it. Mr Magaletta then went down to fetch his friend. San Francisco, California, 1995. A broken sewer pipe caused this hole . In 1995, a San Francisco sinkhole caused huge problems for residents. City officials surveyed a 60-foot-deep sinkhole that swallowed two homes in San Francisco's exclusive Sea Cliff district and forced the evacuation of nine other homes, .

A group of rabbits have been stranded in the middle after rising floodwater cut them off from the land. The animals climbed up onto a concrete patch outside a sports hut in Windsor, Berkshire but were unable to move off their temporary home. They ran from side to side in an attempt to find a way off the newly created island - but without success. Trapped: A group of rabbits was stranded on concrete step outside a sports hut in a Windsor park . No escape: The hut was cut off from the rest of the park by rising floodwater over the weekend . The distressed animals were spotted by photographer Ed Brown when he was walking in Home Park, in the shadow of Windsor Castle, over the weekend. Rabbits are able to swim - but Mr Brown said that the animals stranded in the park seemed to be too nervous to jump into the water and seek safety. 'My girlfriend Kirsty spotted the rabbits as we were walking from our home in Datchet to Windsor to see how bad the flooding in the area was,' the photographer said. 'We stood for over half an hour watching the rabbits, none of them made any attempt to jump in but they kept going to the edges and peering over in the water.' Attempt: The animals tried to get away but were unwilling to leap into the water . Caught on camera: Ed Brown saw the rabbits as he was walking through Home Park with his girlfriend Kirsty . The eventual fate of the distressed animals is unknown. The pictures were captured after three weeks of heavy rainfall across the South of England, leading to serious floods in many areas. Home Park is next to the River Thames, which has burst its banks in several places. Plight: The rabbits are among a number of animals which have been caught up in the stormy weather . The Windsor rabbits are not the only animals to be affected by the storms in recent weeks.

Few are the stars who can boast the staying power of Kate Moss, a woman whose modelling career has spanned an incredible 20 years. Despite hitting the big 4-0, she remains an icon - particularly in the eyes of artist and erstwhile journalist Russell Marshall, who is celebrating her birthday with the launch of a retrospective dedicated to portraits of the model. Ever the icon: Despite hitting the big 4-0, Kate Moss remains as popular as ever, says artist Russell Marshall . Glamorous: The model's longevity and rock n' roll exploits have turned her into a legend . 'The retrospective has been produced . from my perspective,' he explains. 'Kate's been in the public eye as long as I've been . working in the newspaper industry, so I've seen countless images of her . appear on the picture desk.' The new exhibition includes some of the most iconic photographs of Moss ever taken, among them several that have come from newspaper archives and been reworked by the artist. Starting with early portraits of the future supermodel as a 14-year-old, the exhibition, at the Imitate Modern gallery in Marylebone, charts her progress from ingÃ©nue to icon. Future supermodel: Marshall's retrospective begins with early portraits of Moss at the start of her career . Daring style: Kate in 1991 and dressed as a geisha at a Vivienne Westwood show in 1993 . 'Kate has done things get way on her terms,' adds Marshall. 'She's never been a slave to convention [and] that is a quality I admire.' Although Marshall makes no secret of his penchant for creating work featuring the model, he's no stranger to working with other celebrities. None, however, are typical tabloid favourites, with Marshall insisting that he's in the business of portraying icons, not 'celebs'. Thus, other series feature Sid Vicious, Elvis Presley and Steve McQueen, although he admits that few inspire him quite so much as the Croydon supermodel. Icon: Kate Moss in a Russell Marshall print based on early photos from her Topshop collaboration . Masterclass: Moss shows why she's worth it in a photo taken to promote her final collaboration with Topshop . 'There are many celebrities but few become legends,' he adds. 'Kate Moss has achieved that status.' Despite spending hours contemplating Ms Moss, Marshall reveals that he still can't quite put his finger on what makes her so special. 'If . I knew exactly what makes Kate Moss a legend, or an icon as opposed to . just a celebrity, I would probably be in artist management,' he begins. 'But Kate's . silence is all part of the mystery and the reason why we love her. 'Either way, it's probably best not to analyse it too closely or you might destroy it. Then where would we be!' 40: A Kate Moss Retrospective opens today and runs until 15 February at Imitate Modern in Marylebone and online at beautifulcrime.com .

Once an endangered species on the brink of extinction, the majestic gray whale is now a common sight off the California coast. The 40-foot, 40-ton behemoths have become so common that sightings off the Los Angeles coast have doubled since 2012. The huge pods are migrating from Alaska to Baja California in increasing numbers and scientists are baffled as to why it's happening. Scroll down for video... Prevalent: Whale watchers are delighted by the number of whales they are spotting swimming off the California coast this year . And while the researchers wonder if its a change in salinity, shifting currents or perhaps an explosion in population of the massive mammals that's made them such a common sight, whale watchers are delighted at their suddenly easy hobby. 'It’s pretty exciting. It’s the first time I’ve been out here and I’ve been in California for 50 years ,' whale watcher Trenna Cousins told KCAL. The folks at Captain Dave’s Dolphin & Whale Watching Safari couldn't be happier. Heading south: More than twice as many of the 40 ton majestic mammals have appeared off the California coast this season as they make their way to the warmer waters off Mexico . 'We’ve seen more whales than I have ever seen in my 20 years or so of being a captain,' said Captain Dan Salas while on an expedition Tuesday. The whales migrate each year from the arctic waters of the Bering Sea to the warm currents off the coast of Mexico. They aren't an uncommon sight around December, but they've certainly never been prevalent like they have been this past year. Scientists are puzzled as to why the whales are suddenly so common. 'It could  have to do with currents, it could have to do with temperature or salinity. It doesn't have to do with food because they don't eat on south- or north-bound migration,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger, director of the Gray Whale Census Project told CBS News. Thar she blows: A gray whale comes up for air as sprawling Los Angeles looms in the background. The species was once nearly extinct but has made a huge comeback in recent decades. While scientists are unsure if the cause is increased population, more gray whales than ever before are being spotted off the coast of California . While there is no evidence the whale population is increasing, scientists say this past year has seen an increase in the number of calves traveling in the massive pods. Despite the uncertainty, researchers hope the more prevalent sightings mean positive things are happening for the once-critically endangered creatures. 'It could very well mean that more are coming down because they're pregnant and ready to give birth, and others are coming down ready to get pregnant for the next year,' Alisa Schulman-Janiger.","368 gray whales were spotted off the California coast in December 2013 but only 182 were spotted that same month in 2012 .

The industrial town of Rjukan is nestled deep in a valley floor in the rugged Telemark county and with the sun moving low across the sky during winter, it gets no direct sunlight between the months of September and March. For years the sun-starved locals have had to take a purpose-built cable car to the top of the mountain side in order to catch a few winter rays. Scroll down for video . Let there be light: The Norwegian town of Rjukan will receive its first ever rays of winter sunshine this year after locals set up giant mirrors to bounce light onto the town square . Beam: The giant mirrors will be placed on the valley side to bounce the light down onto the town square . But that is soon set to change as for the past few weeks, helicopters have been hoisting three huge mirrors into position some 450 metres above the town at the top of the valley sides. Known as heliostats, they have been designed to track the movement of the sun and reflect the light down directly onto Rjukan's main square. The idea is not new. It was first suggested in Rjukan 100 years ago by a worker at the nearby hydroelectric plant. In the shade: Rjukan is nestled in a valley floor in rugged Telemark . county and as the sun moves low across the sky in winter, it gets no . direct sunlight between the months of September and March . The plant's founder, celebrated . Norwegian engineer and industrialist Sam Eyde was concerned his workers . weren't getting enough sunshine during the winter months. He . considered the mirror idea but felt they lacked the technology to make . it work so opted instead for the construction of a cable car. Rjukan is situated in Norway's rugged Telemark county . In 2006, a similar project was successfully set up in the village of Viganella in northern Italy which had suffered from exactly the same problem. A delegation from visited Viganella to see how their mirror had transformed people's lives, and was suitably impressed. After five years of debate, Rjukan town council finally agreed to invest the necessary 5 million Norwegian kroner (£544,000) to build the mirrors. They are controlled by computer to follow the path of then sun, adjusting to the best angle to ensure the town square is bathed in light. Solar panels will power equipment to automatically wash the mirrors and move them into position. Designers hope the sunshine will revitalise the town during the winter months.

Khan Said, known as Sajna, will replace leader Hakimullah Mehsud who was killed along with three others in a strike by a U.S. drone, militant commanders and security sources have confirmed. Said is believed to have masterminded an attack on a jail in northwest Pakistan that freed nearly 400 prisoners in 2012 and an attack on a Pakistani air force base in the same year. Killed: Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, pictured sitting with other militants in South Waziristan in 2009, was killed in an American drone strike yesterday . Pakistani Taliban fighters secretly buried their leader early this morning and moved quickly to replace him while vowing a wave of suicide bombs in revenge. At the same time the Pakistani government has denounced Mehsud's killing as a U.S bid to derail planned peace talks. Despite his reputation as an uncompromising militant leader their had been hopes that the two sides could reach an agreement in as the talks got underway. Information Minister Pervez Rashid told the press that Pakistan would not allow American intervention to distract them, he said: 'The . U.S. has tried to attack the peace talks with this drone but we will . not let them fail.' Some angry politicians even demanded that U.S. military supply lines into Afghanistan be blocked in response. Back on the rocks: Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif holding talks with with President Obama last month, the Pakistani government has accused the US of trying to derail peace talks with the Taliban . Bounty: Mehsud has been among the CIA's most wanted men in the world for at least four years with and offer of $5million for information . Shah Farman, a spokesman for the . government of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said . provincial legislators would pass a resolution on Monday to cut NATO . supply lines into landlocked Afghanistan. The supply . lines Pakistan have been crucial since the . Afghan war began in 2001 and remain vital as the United States and other . Western forces prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of next . year. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, and three others were killed on Friday in the militant stronghold of Miranshah in northwest Pakistan, Pakistani security officials said. His vehicle was hit after he attended a meeting of Taliban leaders, a Pakistani Taliban fighter said, adding Mehsud's body was 'damaged but recognisable'. His bodyguard and driver were also killed. He was secretly buried under cover of darkness in the early hours by a few companions amid fears that his funeral might be attacked by U.S. drones. Azam Tariq, a Pakistani Taliban spokesman said the killing of the group's leader would lead to revenge attacks. He said: 'Every drop of Hakimullah's blood will turn into a suicide bomber. 'America and their friends shouldn't be happy because we will take revenge for our martyr's blood.' Mehsud took over as leader of the al Qaeda-linked Pakistani Taliban in 2009. The group's two previous leaders were also killed in attacks by U.S. missile-firing drones. But the swift moves to replace Mehsud some Taliban commanders were reportedly unhappy with the choice and wanted more talks. Uncompromising leader: This photo from November 2008 shows Mehsud, second from left, speaking to journalists at a Taliban base . Chief: Mehsud pictured holding a rocket launcher with his comrades in 2009, he was buried under cover of darkness this morning for fear that his funeral might also become a target for US drone attacks . The differing views point to divisions within the Pakistani Taliban, an umbrella group of factions allied with the Afghan Taliban and battling the Pakistani state in the hope of imposing Islamist rule. They have killed thousands of Pakistani civilians and numerous members of the security forces and in September claimed to have been behind the killing of an army general. In Washington, two U.S. officials also confirmed that CIA drone strike had been responsible for Mehsud's death. In 2010, Mehsud appeared in a farewell video with a Jordanian suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan. Mehsud was then in his mid-30s and had a sharp face framed by a beard and a tangle of long hair, usually flowing from beneath a traditional Afghan hat. In May, Mehsud's deputy was killed by drone nearby. Last month, one of his top deputies was captured in Afghanistan.","Khan Said, known as Sajna, will replace .

The Tory party has hired the election guru who returned Barack Obama to the White House to help David Cameron to win in 2015. Jim Messina will offer high level strategy advice to the Conservative party, including winning the battle for votes on Twitter and Facebook. The recruitment of a senior Democrat aide is a major blow to Labour, which has been without an election co-ordinator for a month. Guru: Jim Messina, who headed Barack Obama's successful re-election campaign last year, is to bring his expertise to the UK as an adviser to the Conservatives . In a sign that the Tory party is . already on an election footing ahead of May 2015, Mr Messina has been . brought in to repeat his success in securing President Obama’s . re-election against a grim economic backdrop. He . is expected to advise Tory election boss Lynton Crosby, the Australian . strategist who has ordered ministers to ‘get the barnacles off the boat’ and focus on issues which matter to voters. Mr . Cameron has brushed aside criticism that lobbyist Mr Crosby has clients . including tobacco firms, while the coalition has dropped plans for . plain cigarette packaging. Senior Tory sources claimed the deal with Mr Messina, who will remain based in the US, is evidence that Mr Obama would like to see Mr Cameron, rather than Mr Miliband, win the 2015 election. Mr Messina, who is working solely on the election campaign, and not on party policy, will report directly to Mr Cameron’s Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby, and Tory co-chairmen Grant Shapps and Lord Feldman. Sources said he ‘does not come cheap’ although he has ‘not yet’ cost the party £1million. Special relationship: David Cameron is delighted at recruiting Jim Messina, who led the campaign to re-elect Barack Obama last year . Tory officials said Mr Messina has . been secretly working for the party for several months and has advised . Mr Shapps on how to set up a group of 2,000 volunteers who will storm . into marginal seats during the election campaign. Last night Mr Messina confirmed his role with the party. He said: ‘I have long admired Prime Minister Cameron. ‘While I will not be moving to . London, nor will I be managing any type of day-to-day political . operations, I will be offering  strategic campaign advice leading up to . 2015.’ Boss: Australian Lynton Crosby will run the election campaign, with advice from Mr Messina . The Conservative is aligned to the . more right-wing Republican party in the US, but Mr Cameron has been keen . to play up his close ties and friendship with the Obama administration. Many in the Labour party will be privately deeply disappointed to see a Democrat working for the Tories. Two years ago Team Miliband was delighted to hold talks with President Obama at Buckingham Palace. The President stressed to the Labour leader the ‘importance of having an optimistic sense of national mission’. In the mid-1990s, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair met a young Bill Clinton to plot how Labour could return to power after 18 years in opposition. But Tom Watson quit as Labour's general election co-ordinator last month at the height of the row over his union links and claims Unite had sought to influence candidate selection and party policy. Veteran Labour MP George Mudie yesterday admitted he had no idea what his own party's policy was on education, welfare or health and warned Mr Miliband was 'hesitant' and 'confused'. Mr Messina served as President Obama’s deputy chief of staff, when he was described as ‘the most powerful person in Washington you've never heard of’. He later moved to head the Obama re-election machine, where against rising unemployment and grim US economic figures the incumbent president went on to beat Mitt Romney in 2012.

Hoax victim: Followers of famed Lakewood Church Pastor Joel Osteen were fooled into believing he had denounced God and was quitting his church in an elaborate online prank . An internet message and news reports claiming that a famed televangelist was to renounce God and quit his church have been revealed as an elaborate online hoax. Followers of Pastor Joel Osteen were fooled into believing that the 50-year-old preacher had lost his faith and resigned from his ministry. But an online statement purporting to be from Mr Osteen claiming that there is 'zero evidence ""God"" even exists' and a series of fake news websites carrying reports of his resignation turned out to be the handiwork of pranksters. The unknown perpetrator of the hoax set up a fake blog, an identical copy of Mr Osteen's website and a false Twitter and YouTube account to announce the Pastor's apparent resignation. The statement posted on the fake blog read: 'I have been accused of altering the ""message"" to fit my own doctrine and dogma. Others have accused me of preaching ""feel good Christianity"". 'I have also been accused of profiting greatly from my ministry, with my books and television deals. 'Many of their criticisms are legitimate. 'What they don't know is that deep down in my heart, for a number of years now, I have been questioning the faith, Christianity and whether Jesus Christ is really my, or anyone's, ""saviour"".' It added: 'I believe now that the Bible is a fallible, flawed, highly inconsistent history book that has been altered hundreds of times. 'There is zero evidence the Bible is the holy word of God. In fact, there is zero evidence ""God"" even exists.' As well as the pseudo-website, subsequent stories appeared on bogus versions of news outlets including CNN, Yahoo.com and the Christian News Network. Prank: An announcement purporting to be from the Pastor appeared on a false version of his website . 'Lost faith': The false announcement claimed that there 'is zero evidence ""God"" even exists' Elaborate: A YouTube video was also created to spread the false rumour that Pastor Osteen had quit . A fake CNN banner story carried the headline: 'Pastor of mega church resigns, rejects Christ'. But the false Twitter feed has since been removed and one of the fake websites set up, joelosteenministries.wordpress.com, suspended for violating the website's terms of service. Officials at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, where Mr Osteen has been chief pastor since 1999, told The Houston Chronicle that they were aware of the hoax and 'false rumour'. Fake: As well as the hoax statement, false versions of several top news websites were created to carry the story . Convincing: Although the Lakewood Church says that it is aware of the hoax and 'false rumours', no one has claimed responsibility for the prank . Pastor Joel Osteen's sermons reach over seven million broadcast media viewers weekly in more than 100 nations around the world. His popularity saw him featured as one of ABC News' 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006 and he was also named Most Influential Christian in America in 2006 by The Church Report. Mr Osteen has written more than 20 books and has been criticised in the past for his apparently lavish lifestyle.","Lakewood Church Pastor Joel Osteen fell victim to a complex internet prank .

The suspected thief fleeing a frozen food store with £10 worth of bacon was hardly in the arch-villain class. But that did not deter Superman from swooping into action. The Man of Steel, alias security guard Luke Junior, was wearing his red-and-blue caped outfit as part of an outdoor charity family fun day, with stalls and games for children. When he saw staff chasing the shoplifter from the store, he grabbed the man, swiftly placed him in an armlock and held him until two policewomen arrived to arrest him. As they marched the offender away in handcuffs, Superman was given a round of applause by onlookers while the movie’s theme tune was played over loudspeakers by the DJ who was hosting the event in Sheffield – coincidentally the City of Steel. The drama unfolded as 24-year-old Mr Junior was helping the Gleadless Valley Community Action Group raise money for a skate park. A Superman fanatic, he imported the £500 costume from Argentina and is a regular figure at charity events in South Yorkshire. As he chatted with members of the public outside a Cash Converters shop, the 38-year-old thief emerged from Heron Foods pursued by the manager and others. He has since admitted theft of seven packs of bacon and is awaiting sentence. Recalling the citizen’s arrest, Mr Junior said: ‘The last thing you want to do is run straight into Superman. He was going nowhere but the police station. ‘I saw the manager chasing him and I felt I had to physically restrain him and make a citizen’s arrest. I wouldn’t advise everybody to do it because it can be dangerous and it’s not something to take on lightly. ‘I had to pin him up against the window of the Cash Converters store.

But Tina Williams has a warning for them: big breasts come with their own problems. 'I've always been shapely,' says Tina, a 62-year-old retired civil servant from Sheffield. 'It runs in the family. Even when I was at my slimmest I was a D cup. 'They never used to cause me problems, but about 20 years ago I noticed a red rash under my chest. It could be extremely sore and sometimes it would bleed. At night I'd want to hold my bust up because it was so painful.' Fuller figure: Tina Williams suffered from intertrigo, a a fungal, bacterial or viral infection of broken skin . Tina was suffering with intertrigo, a condition that many women with large or sagging breasts have - yet it's rarely  spoken about. The problem starts when the skin under the breasts rubs against them, causing irritation. Because the area is warm and moist, it is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria or yeast which are found naturally on the skin. These multiply, causing the rash to become infected. The symptoms can be extremely painful - and embarrassing, too, as the unsightly infection has an unpleasant odour. 'The smell was the worst thing, and no amount of showering or using cream seemed to get rid of it,' says Tina, who lives with her husband David, 66, a retired local government officer. 'I used a lot of perfume. 'Initially I tried to keep the area dry with talcum powder but soon realised I needed something more. I saw my GP, and he said it was a fungus. I felt dirty, even though I showered every day. 'It was like it was my fault, and at the time I thought I was probably the only one with it, as it's not really something you talk about.' Her doctor prescribed an anti-fungal cream containing steroids, which helped, but didn't clear the rash completely. 'The intertrigo would still flare up about half a dozen times a year - particularly during the hot summers,' she says. 'Looking back, I think it worsened when work was stressful, too. 'I also found the wire from underwired bras would really dig in and aggravate the whole thing.' Intertrigo is a fungal, bacterial or viral infection of broken skin. As well as large-chested women, it is a common problem among overweight or obese people, and can occur in other parts of the body such as the folds of the skin around the groin or buttocks, armpits, and even behind the ears. Envy: Many women desire larger busts, but they come with their own problems . One Dutch study found one in 20 hospital patients and as many as 17 per cent of people in nursing homes were suffering with it. 'Intertrigo becomes more common as cupsizes go up, but it's more to do with the shape of the breasts than the size - even someone with small breasts could suffer intertrigo if they sagged and rubbed the skin,' says Dr Graham Johnston, a consultant dermatologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary. 'It's especially common as ladies get older and after they've had children. The breasts sag, and the skin thins with age, too, which means it's more sensitive. A badly fitting bra can cause the skin to chafe. The skin gets red and itchy because of all the sweatiness and chafing. 'But it's the growth of infection that causes real problems - this is from the normal bugs or yeast we have on our skin.' Diabetes - a known risk for people who are overweight - can further complicate intertrigo. 'Diabetes makes the skin more prone to infection because high blood sugar levels can weaken the immune system. 'This problem gets significantly greater the bigger you get. 'Some large ladies, if they fail to lose weight, get into a vicious cycle of troublesome intertrigo that will never go away.' Stress, which is known to exacerbate many skin conditions, can make it worse, adds Dr Anthony Bewley, consultant dermatologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. 'It can be very distressing. There's almost always a problem with people not coming forward due to embarrassment, because of the areas of the body that it concerns - and especially if it's smelly.' Caroline Morrice, 48, has had intertrigo for 20 years, but never went to her doctor out of embarrassment and because she felt nothing could be done about it. 'It's not something that's always there, but it's definitely worse in hot weather. I have the rash under my breasts and around the groin area,' says Caroline, who is chief executive of the charity Guillain-Barre Syndrome Support Group. 'I wear well-fitting underwear and shower frequently, and use Sudocrem on it which helps (the cream, designed for nappy rash, contains antifungal and antibacterial agents). 'But I thought it was something I had to put up with because I'm a bit overweight, so never thought of seeing a doctor.' Good personal hygiene is key to preventing infection, explains Dr Johnston - unfortunately, while many people may be scrupulous about cleanliness, they are unwittingly doing the wrong thing. 'It's important to make sure the area remains clean and dry. I suspect a lot of ladies think they should be scrubbing and using creams on it, but ironically harsh soaps and cleaners can make it worse because they take away layers of skin, meaning the soap particles get trapped there and cause greater infection. So we recommend or prescribe a soap substitute such as an emollient.' Aqueous cream is a good soap substitute and should always be rinsed off, although if it stings during washing, ask your chemist for another soap substitute. 'Your second line of attack will be anti-fungal creams which can be bought over the counter, or if it's really sore your GP might want to prescribe an anti-fungal with a bit of steroid in it to allow the skin to heal,' says Dr Johnston. In the most severe cases, the skin can break and bleed, and those patients may need antibiotics. Anyone suffering with this rash should consider seeing their doctor, because it may turn out not to be intertrigo, says Dr Johnston. 'Intertrigo can look almost identical to psoriasis which typically causes large, red, scaly patches on the skin - intertrigo is particularly close to flexural psoriasis which targets the folds of the skin under the breasts and buttocks. We do see patients who've been referred to us with intertrigo, but turn out to have psoriasis. 'The key is to look at whether they have the rash elsewhere on the body, such as the nails and scalp - that would suggest psoriasis. 'If you are small-chested but have a rash under your breasts it's more likely to be something like psoriasis or an allergy.' Irritation: A badly fitting bra could cause the skin to chafe, making the skin more prone to infection . Tina Williams thinks her intertrigo may have been triggered when she gained weight because of an overactive thyroid - she had an operation for this but, to her distress, continued to put on weight, gaining 3st. Tina, who is 5ft 5in and a size 18-20, has recently started on the two-day fast diet (where you eat 500 calories for two days, and then healthily for the rest of the week) and is starting to shed pounds. After suffering for 20 years, Tina even considered breast reduction surgery, but decided against it after realising how serious the operation is. Then, in March, she stumbled upon a solution when her husband noticed a newspaper article about Optifit, a new bra aimed at bigger-busted women. The bra hugs the body from the back, so the breasts are better lifted away from the body compared to regular bras. 'I never thought it would help with the intertrigo, but within a few weeks of wearing the bra, I noticed the rash was clearing up,' says Tina. 'Instead of having to use the steroid cream every day, I only needed it every other day.' Because her breasts were lifted, they were no longer rubbing against the skin beneath them, allowing the intertrigo to heal. 'The rash has gone completely now - I don't need the cream at all. I'm so relieved to be free of it at last.' Optifitbra.com .","Intertrigo is a fungal, bacterial, or viral infection of broken skin .

Specialist divers spent two years extracting the pewter plates and bowls from beneath the waves off the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. More than 1,200 items of the finest quality English pewter were recovered from the wreck of the unnamed galleon which is thought to have sunk around 1540. Bounty of the deep: 16th century treasure discovered perfectly preserved in a 500-year-old shipwreck is to go on sale in Britain for £200,000 . They have been so well preserved in the sea bed that they are said to be as historically valuable as those raised from the wreck of the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII's fleet rescued from the Solent in 1982. Despite sinking in 1545 during a battle with the French, the starboard hull remained intact on the seabed, along with 19,000 carefully retrieved items. It is believed the ship was transporting the incoming Spanish ambassador from Seville to his new colonial home on the island of Hispaniola, now the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Onboard was thousands of top quality dining sets bound for the tables of his luxurious mansion. But disaster struck when the ship sunk after hitting rocks on the easternmost tip of the island off Punta Cana. Dinner set: This set of three twin-eared pewter porringers (small bowls) are estimated to fetch £3,000 . These large bossed pewter dishes are worth an estimated £15,000. They were discovered in a sunken galleon near the Dominican Republic . Experts say the ambassador was the . only survivor of the wreck - but his expensive possessions were not so . fortunate and they went down with the ship.The wreck was only discovered . in 2011 and the excavation process is still ongoing. Three quarters of the items discovered . will remain in the possession of the Dominican Republic while the rest . has been given to the treasure hunting divers. The salvage team had to chisel through several inches of rock to uncover the stunning artefacts. Some pieces are said to be in as good a condition as when they were made. These six 'Spanish Trenchers' are worth around £3,000.

Around a third of the pewter bears . the mark of Sir Thomas Curtis, regarded as the most important London . pewterer of the 16th Century. Sir . Thomas was Mayor of London in 1557 and his mark also appears on much of . the pewter from the Mary Rose, Henry VIII’s flagship, lost in the . Solent in 1545. The collection is tipped to fetch £200,000 when it goes under the hammer. Among the highlights are a pair of 16-inch plates made by London pewterer Edward Cacher worth £15,000. A pair of octagonal plates made by Sir Thomas could fetch £5,000. Hallmark: A close-up of the mark of Sir Thomas Curtis, London's top pewterer in the 1600s .

'The pewter was of the finest quality, much of it made in England, and was destined for his mansion. 'The story goes that when the ship went down, the ambassador was the only one to survive but he had to swim to shore leaving behind his treasures. 'These items are as good if not better than the pewter found in the wreck of the Mary Rose.

"By . Lucy Buckland . [datecreated] . Damaging: Tory MP Louise Mensch has revealed how taking drugs during her twenties affected her . Tory MP Louise Mensch has confessed taking Class A drugs has caused her long-term damage and disturbed her mind. The 'chick-lit' author has revealed taking illegal substances in her twenties made her anxious, stressed and unable to be happy. Her comments, reported in The Sunday Times, come after the backbencher MP was forced to admit she had taken drugs while working at EMI as a press officer. The 40-year-old Corby MP was contacted earlier this year by investigative journalists who claimed they had photographs of Mrs Mensch taking drugs with Nigel Kennedy in a nightclub. She said it was 'highly probable' she had taken drugs with the violinist and that it was most likely 'not the only incident'. Her admission, far from ruining the mother-of-three's political career, boosted her popularity within the party for being refreshingly honest. Her new confessions revolve around her drug-taking and her love life with her new husband, rock band manager Peter Mensch - who looks after a number of rock groups including the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica. In a candid interview she says: 'I don't want to sound too flippant about it [taking drugs]. It was very damaging and I wish I had not done it. 'I do blame them for disturbing my long-term happiness. I blame drug use in my twenties for making me jumpier and more nervous than I needed to be.' The MP, daughter of a wealthy stockbroker and headmistress, who writes romantic novels under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe, added that that giving up drugs was a 'natural part of growing up'. 'If I went down to a nightclub, there was an awful lot of it going on in plain sight,' she added, but saying she eventually stopped because she 'grew out of it'. Mrs Mensch's profile has increased after her questioning of Rupert Murdoch on the phone-hacking scandal as a member of the culture, media and sport select committee. And although many of her colleagues have praised her political manoeuvring, she describes herself as 'socially liberal and economically Tory'. An appearance on Have I Got News For You and glossy photo shoots have catapulted her onto a different platform to her colleagues. But it seems privacy for her three children, who she shares custody with her former husband Anthony LoCicero, is paramount. After nine years of marriage they split in 2009 citing 'enormous stress', as Mrs Mensch tried to juggle writing with her burgeoning political career. At the time, friends said no one else was involved in the separation. Six months later, she and Mr Mensch went on their first date, he told the Mail earlier this year. The 58-year-old also split from his wife, former school teacher Melissa Meyer, 44, in 2009. And when the pair did marry, they kept it a secret, not even telling Ms Mensch's three children. Shock: Louise Mensch can be seen screaming in horror as Rupert Murdoch was attacked at the select committee hearing . A younger Louise Mensch, who married in June, said giving up drugs was a 'natural part of growing up' And although Ms Mensch doesn't live . with her husband, she revealed taking pride in her appearance is . important for her and her husband. In the interview she adds: 'I love . him and I dress up for him. Not in a Barbie doll way. My palms still . sweat with adrenalin whenever he walks into a room.'

"By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:19 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 1 March 2013 . A Twitter user was arrested today over claims he revealed the identity of the alleged victim in the child sex case involving Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell. Le Vell, who plays Kevin Webster in the ITV soap, appeared in court earlier this week charged with 19 sexual offences against a child. Police said the tweet, sent on Wednesday, also contained 'personal opinion' from the sender about Le Vell's alleged victim. Held: A Twitter user has been arrested over claims he revealed the identity of Michael Le Vell's alleged child sex victim on the day the Coronation Street star appeared in court (above) accused of 19 offences . Under law, victims of all sexual offences are automatically granted anonymity for life. A 23-year-old man from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of publishing a name, address or photograph that would identify someone that should be anonymous. He was held in custody for questioning and later released on bail pending further inquiries, police said. TV personality: Michael Le Vell as Kevin Webster with Sally Whittaker who plays his on screen wife Sally Webster in Coronation Street . Under the Sexual Offences Act 1992, anyone who makes an allegation of a sexual offence is granted automatic anonymity for life. This means that 'neither the name nor address, and no still or moving picture, of that person shall... be published in a written publication available to the public.' It also prevents any details being published of either the accused or the accuser if it is likely to lead to that person being identified. Crucially, the reference to 'publication' also includes social media like Twitter and Facebook as much as more traditional forms of communication like newspaper and TV. This little-understood law landed seven men and two women in the dock last year when they were fined for naming the rape victim of footballer Ched Evans on Twitter. The Welsh striker was convicted of raping the 19-year-old woman in April 2012. During the case, more than 6,000 tweets were sent, with some users choosing to name the victim. All those who admitted the offence said they did not realise they had broken the law. Detective Chief Inspector Chris Bridge, . of Greater Manchester Police's Public Protection Division, said: . 'Maintaining the anonymity of victims of sex offences is absolutely . vital and is something that really helps encourage them to come forward. 'Breaching this ruling is an extremely serious offence and that is why we launched an investigation as soon as we became aware. 'Social media is an immensely powerful tool that does an awful lot of good. 'But it can also be used to spread rumour, speculation and in this case break the law. 'As a force, GMP embraces the use of social media but when it is abused in this way we will take robust action to hold those responsible to account.' Le Vell, 48, whose real name is Michael Turner, faced the charges at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. The alleged offences date between 2001 and 2010 and include six charges of rape, six of indecent assault and seven of sexual touching. The actor, from Hale, Cheshire, was bailed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on March 20. He has denied any wrongdoing and his solicitor said the charges would be 'fully contested' at the crown court.","Man, 23, from Greater Manchester, taken into custody this morning .

He spent years appearing in patchy romantic comedies such as critically panned Fools Gold, How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days and Failure To Launch. But Matthew McConaughey celebrated a remarkable career turnaround on Thursday with his first Oscar nomination. The 44-year-old Texan-born star received a Best Actor nod for his powerful performance as AIDS campaigner Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyer's Club. Scroll down for video... The race is on: Matthew McConaughey, pictured at Sunday's Golden Globes, is up against four-time-nominee Leonardo DiCaprio after receiving a Best Actor Oscar nomination on Thursday . McConaughey shed 50lbs to play Ron . Woodroof in the film, based on the real-life tale of an AIDS patient who . began smuggling unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he . found them effective at improving his symptoms. 'I’ve got a pretty full tank . of energy when it comes to what we did in this film,' he told The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of his nomination. 'I’ve got a lot of . stories to share. It excites me to share the . story each time I talk about it. There’s always a fresh subject. It . means something different to everyone.' His chances of scooping the big prize increased tenfold when he beat acting legends Tom Hanks and Robert Redford to win the Golden Globe for Best Actor In A Motion Picture, Drama on Sunday. In . the running: The five Best Actor nominees for the 86th Academy Awards . were announced by Chris Hemsworth and Academy President Cheryl Boone . Isaacs in Los Angeles on Thursday . Globe triumph: McConaughey gave an entertaining speech after winning his Globe . Role of a lifetime: McConaughey has received a slew of nominations during awards season for his role as Ron Woodroof in Dallas Buyer's Club . Now, many commentators believe he can beat four-time Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio to the prize at the prestigious ceremony on March 2. DiCaprio was first nominated back in 1994 in the Supporting Actor Category for What's Eating Gilbert Grape before receiving Best Actor nods for The Aviator in 2005 and in 2007 for Blood Diamond. Having scooped the Golden Globe for Best Actor in the comedy category on Sunday, DiCaprio will certainly provide stiff competition for McConaughey for his critically acclaimed role in Martin Scorsese film The Wolf Of Wall Street where he plays banker Jordan Belfort. Fourth time lucky? DiCaprio has been nominated for his role as banker Jordan Belfort in The Wolf Of Wall Street . Star turn: Christian Bale's performance as a 1970s con artist in American Hustle won his his second Oscar nomination . DiCaprio and McConaughey are up against Christian Bale for his role as 1970s con artist Irving Rosenfeld in American Hustle and Chiwetel Ejiofor as a free man sold into Slavery in 12 Years A Slave. Veteran actor Bruce Dern, 77, rounds off the Best Actor contenders for his part as eccentric father Woody Grant in Alexander Payne's road trip film Nebraska. As a first time nominee, McConaughey would normally be considered something of an outsider at the Oscars, but his Golden Globe win and Screen Actor's Guild nomination may give him the edge over DiCaprio who has not been recognised this year at the SAGs. Contenders: Bruce Dern and Chiwetel Ejiofor are nominated for Nebraska and 12 Years A Slave . Acclaim: Chiwetel was nominated alongside his 12 Years A Slave co-star Lupita Nyong'o, who will compete in the Best Supporting Actress category . Long career: Veteran actor Bruce Dern, 77, rounds off the Best Actor contenders for his role as eccentric father Woody Grant in Alexander Payne's road trip film Nebraska . In an interview with GQ . last year, McConaughey revealed he decided to make a change in his career around the time of his 2009 . film The Ghost Of Girlfriends Past - a critically panned rom com based loosely on a Christmas Carol. He . described the perception of him at that time as 'Outdoors, shirtless on . the beach, does a lot of rom-coms, girlfriend loves him, good-looking. It's like he rolls out of bed and shows up and makes it look easy.' Although he 'enjoyed himself' doing the rom coms, the Magic Mike star felt the need to 'shake . things up' in his acting career. He wanted, he said, to enjoy watching . his movies as much as he enjoyed making them. 'I wanted new . experiences,' he admitted. Cue . a two year acting hiatus which saw McConaughey  go 'into the shadows,' concentrate on his personal life and children with wife Camila Alves and wait . for projects which would 'evolve' him as an actor. Panned: McConaughey appeared alongside Kate Hudson in rom com Fools Gold back in 2008 . Failure To Launch: The actor appeared alongside Sarah Jessica Parker in the 2006 flop . He returned in 2011 thriller The Lincoln Lawyer, a much darker film based on the crime novel of the same name. Male stripper film film Magic Mike was next, where McConaughey . would show off his famous six pack, and 2013 coming-of-age-drama film Mud . where he played a fugitive drifter. Then came Dallas Buyer's Club, a low budget movie which McConaughey had been pushing to make for a while. The rest is now history. 'I'm . in the clay in my career,' he told GQ. 'I'm turned on. I'm interested . in things. I saw Dallas Buyers Club. I liked it. I liked that guy. I . didn't catch you acting, McConaughey. I forgot that was you, . McConaughey.'

Teenage girls are being manipulated and confused by role models who turn from clean-cut to raunchy, a leading headmistress warns. Jo Heywood, who runs a £30,000-a-year girls’ boarding school,  singled out Miley Cyrus for her damaging ‘mixed messages’. The singer, 20, became a child star in 2006 as the wholesome lead in the Disney series Hannah Montana. Role model? Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana in 2009, left, and performing with Robin Thicke at the MTV awards. Girls' school headmistress Jo Heywood says teenage girls are confused by role models who turn from clean-cut to raunchy . But in the past year, she has become embroiled in controversy, culminating in a provocative ‘twerking’  performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August. Miss Cyrus appeared in a skin-coloured bikini, danced suggestively with singer Robin Thicke and made lewd gestures with a foam finger. Mrs Heywood, of Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire, said she hoped the success of athletes such as  Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton at the London Olympics would give girls a new generation of women to admire. Speaking out: Head teacher Jo Heywood singled out Miley Cyrus for her damaging 'mixed messages' It had seemed that ‘finally women were being recognised for their achievements rather than their looks, which reality show they were on or which celebrity they were dating’, added Mrs Heywood. ‘As head of a girls’ school, I have long been yearning for more appropriate female role models for today’s young women,’ she continued. ‘We knew what these sportswomen stood for: hard work, sacrifice and achievement. They were clear-cut role models for young women. ‘A year on, I am not so sure that . anything has really changed. I am more than a little concerned that some . of the so-called role models young girls may look up to are giving them . confusing, mixed messages. ‘Fast forward to another example of how young women are being manipulated and confused by potential role models. ‘Many . young girls have grown up as fans of Hannah Montana. Hannah, played by . petite and pretty Miley Cyrus, was the archetypal all-American teenager: . a girl to look up to. ‘A . few years later and we find Cyrus giving a headline-grabbing and . controversial performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. Worryingly, . Miley has apparently said she does not know what all the fuss is about. ‘However, . there is plenty to be concerned about, especially when these once . clean-cut role models steer another course so publicly.’ Writing on the Independent School . Parent website, she also pinpointed Leah Totton, the 24-year-old doctor . chosen by Sir Alan Sugar as the winner of the latest series of The . Apprentice. Concern: Mrs Heywood said there was 'plenty to be concerned about' when stars such as the once clean-cut Miley Cyrus steer another course . Praiseworthy: Mrs Heywood said she had hoped the success of athletes such as Jessica Ennis, left, and Victoria Pendleton, right, at the London Olympics would give girls a generation of women to admire . He is . backing her in a venture launching a chain of cosmetic surgery clinics. ‘What message is this young woman projecting by her choice of business . and what message is Lord Sugar giving by investing in this business?’ said Mrs Heywood. ‘Leah is a confusing role model. As a woman who has worked hard and excelled in her medical career and as a winner of The Apprentice, she has many admirable qualities and yet what she stands for and what she plans to do is far less admirable.’ Questions: Mrs Heywood asked what message Apprentice winner Leah Totton was sending to young women by launching cosmetic surgery clinics . Mrs Heywood said her school, which charges more than £30,000-a-year for pupils aged 11 to 18, was examining the ‘confusing’ way women are depicted in the media. Yesterday, a teachers’ union leader joined the debate, criticising airbrushed images of stars for damaging the self-esteem of both male and female pupils. Dr Mary Bousted said: ‘With the greatest ever proportion of women gaining degrees, and with girls outperforming boys in school at many levels, it’s disgraceful and damaging that the majority of women in magazines are airbrushed celebrities.’ The general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers added: ‘This bombardment of images demonises those who do not conform to the unrealistic and narrow depictions of the female body. ‘ATL members report that body image pressure not only impacts on female pupils but increasingly leads to low self-esteem, lack of confidence and anxiety in male pupils too. ‘With academic and social pressures, young people have enough to deal with. 'Comparing and competing not only with their peers on looks, but with airbrushed celebrities in the media, only leads to misery.’ Miss Cyrus has declared she paid no attention to negative reactions to her appearance at the MTV awards. She has also had a spat with singer Sinead O’Connor and spoken publicly about her use of drugs.","Jo Heywood says teens are 'confused by potential role models'

Edie Littlefield Sundby told MailOnline that government-run health insurance is a recipe for disaster, and tweaked White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer for his 'snotty' tweet undermining her story . Edie Sundby, the 62 year-old California cancer survivor who made a powerful intervention into the Obamacare controversy with a stinging Wall Street Journal op-ed told MailOnline today blasted the 'snotty' tweet by a White house aide that attempted to undermine her moving story. White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer sparked outrage on Monday by tweeting a link to a liberal blog post that claimed Sundby – who passionately described how she suffers under the changes of the Affordable Care Act – only lost her health insurance because of corporate greed. Pfeiffer operates an 'official' White House Twitter feed, meaning that he speaks for the administration whenever he posts messages there. Sundby said his tweet in response to her touching essay was 'snotty,' but then thanked Pfeiffer for pointing her to 'some information that I was not privy to.' Sundby, who has battled her cancer since 2007, explained in the op-ed that she is 'one of the losers' in the president's signature health insurance overhaul. Her existing care has allowed her to outlive doctors' expectations by more than five years already. The beauty products entrepreneur and yoga devotee hikes daily to keep her body's defenses up. But her physicians are her first line of defense. Cancer specialists at Stanford have 'kept me alive,' she wrote, 'but UCSD has provided emergency and local treatment support during wretched periods of this disease, and it is where my primary-care doctors are.' Scroll down for video . Dan Pfeiffer, the White House Communications Director, tweeted out a liberal organization's hit piece on Sundby's insurance company -- he used his 'official' Twitter account which speaks for the administration . Sundby says government shouldn't be trusted to run health care for the entire nation, since it can't effectively run the DMV and it's already broken Americans' trust by raiding the Medicare and Social Security trust funds . Both hospitals, and the doctors who practice in them, are covered by her current PPO. But Covered California, the state's Obamacare insurance exchange, doesn't offer a single plan that both Stanford and UCSD's medical centers will accept. 'I am a determined fighter and extremely lucky,' she wrote. 'But this luck may have just run out: My affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective December 31.' On Tuesday she told MailOnline that thanks to Pfeiffer's tweet, 'I now understand why United Healthcare pulled out of the California market. They had a tax disadvantage.' Think Progress, the liberal advocacy blog that the White House official promoted, dropped that bombshell in among its defenses of the Affordable Care Act. 'In California, a tax advantage put in $100 million last year went to Blue Shield and Anthem BlueCross,' Sundby said, calling it an instance of 'political cronyism.' United Healthcare, her insurer, 'had to pull out of this market because they couldn't compete against that $100 million in tax welfare,' she explained. 'The outrage should be against the tax code,' instead of over her Wall Street Journal essay, she said. 'With tax breaks here and there, our government controls winners and losers. Just like with health care.' 'I really, really love living,' Sundby told MailOnline, but she's scared that the health care keeping her alive could be sidelined in the name of cost-cutting . After her first cancer diagnosis, the devout Sundby walked 800 miles, visiting all of California's old Catholic missions. 'Statistically, she should be dead,' read a website set up to track her travels. Pictured with her husband Dale . Sundby also said President Obama and every member of Congress should voluntarily put themselves and all their family members and staffers into the health care exchanges instead of remaining on their government-funded 'Cadillac plans.' 'There's something we could do right now,' she said, 'and that's for the American people to insist that government officials sign up for their own insurance on the exchanges.' 'That's the right thing to do. They legislated it. The American people have to use it. That's the best way to fix the health care system. Make everyone in charge understand just what a big mess this is.' 'I think the executive branch – president Obama actually – Do you know what would warm our hearts, really? It would be for President Obama to get up and say. ""I have just put all my staff, and I just put my family, my precious family, on the health care exchanges. I believe so strongly that it will work and that it's working now, that we're going to get in the boat with you.""' She said Obama should issue an executive order 'requiring that my cabinet and other parts of the federal government's executive branch sign up for our health insurance on the exchanges.' 'Congress should do it on their own too,' she said. Asked if putting government in charge of health care was a recipe for disaster, Sundby gave an enthusiastic 'Yes!' 'Government is potentially making life-or-death decisions for me? My God – they can't even run the DMV.' Sundby is the prototypical ray of sunshine, fighting cancer with a positive attitude and a healthy dose of respect for the disease's power . With Obamacare pushing her insurance company out of the individual market, Sundby says she might not be able to keep visiting her cancer center -- and its caring staff -- who have been keeping her alive . 'The path to hell is paved with good intentions,' she insisted. 'They've mucked up Medicare and Social Security by putting all that money in the general fund. Why didn't they put that money aside for us? And why do we trust these people to run something even bigger?' Sundby told MailOnline that she didn't intend to spark a political firestorm. Her life has been a quiet and pleasure-filled one, from her church worship to her 38-year-strong marriage to former Palo Alto, California IBM chief Dale Sundby. The pair's twin daughters are in their 20s, and Edie would very much like to stick around to watch them build their own families. She wrote her op-ed as a response to a Los Angeles Times story that made her reflect on her years fighting cancers – first in her lungs and then in her gallbladder. She has undergone more than 65 cancer treatments. Her body has been wracked by more than a half-kilogram of chemotherapy drugs. Two surgeries claimed portions of her liver and her right lung. She told MailOnline: 'I'm a registered independent. I have voted for as many Democrats over the years as I have Republicans. I did not do this as a political thing.' 'But I'm hearing that millions – millions! – feel like I do, and are having the same kind of frustration.' White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer (R) is close to Barack Obama, meaning that his tweets provide the impression that he's speaking for the president . She said she reads The New York Times online every day, and The Wall Street Journal in print. The Times ran her essay in July about how she has stayed one step ahead of cancer, but 'it only got 34 comments,' she said. 'So the Journal got this one.' Long walk: Sundby trekked 793 miles to visit all of California's old Spanish missions, as a show of gratitude for a lengthened life that doctors warned her not to expect . Sundby doesn't watch television at all. 'Wolf Blitzer called and I had no idea who he was,' she said. 'I had to Wiki him. I had to Wiki [Larry] Kudlow, I had to Wiki [Neil] Cavuto.' Pressed to look over the horizon, Sundby warned that the U.S. is pointed toward reproducing Britain's National Health Service. 'We're headed in that direction, and I don't think it's good,' she told MailOnline. 'The people who come from all over the world and sit with me in the waiting rooms of these cancer centers, they come here because we have the most cutting-edge medical care in the world. And that's so expensive. When we focus too much on cost-cutting, well, there it goes.' Sundby completed a 793 mile walk through California shortly after her first cancer diagnosis, visiting every one of the old Catholic missions on foot. She calls her trek along the old El Camino Real mission . trail from San Diego to Sonoma a 55-day, 14-1/2 mile per day walk 'to . celebrate life and God's Grace.' Her life has lasted nearly seven years since a doctor told her, 'You have some things going on in your abdominal area, and it looks like cancer.' The White House did not respond to a request for a reaction from Pfeiffer.","Edie Sundby said she understands now that 'tax cronyism' and Obamacare teamed up to push her health insurer into canceling her policy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:47 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:47 EST, 25 October 2013 . Cuban dictator Fidel Castro was questioned by the Warren Commission after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, a new book has revealed. The previously-undisclosed meeting between a U.S. investigator and the Cuban president after the November 1963 killing has been shared in 'A Cruel and Shocking Act: the Secret . History of the Kennedy Assassination' by Philip Shenon, a former . investigative reporter for the New York Times. It reveals that the commission investigating the death in Dallas, Texas sent an investigator to waters off Cuba and took Castro out in a U.S. Navy boat and then onto a yacht. Before the meeting, Castro had expressed interest in speaking with the commission, Bob Schieffer explained on CBS' Face of the Nation as he discussed the book. Questions: Following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, U.S. investigators questioned Fidel Castro (right, pictured in 2004) over what he knew about the death but he said he had nothing to do with it . 'The investigator gets off the boat, . talks to Castro, they talk for three hours,' he explained. 'Castro says - as you would . expect - ""No way, no how did I have anything to do with it"".' Schieffer, who called the book 'magnificent', noted that the investigator sent to speak with Castro was William Coleman, who later became secretary of . transportation in Gerald Ford's administration. He was sent because he had actually met the dictator while he was on his honeymoon in Harlem and they had shared a love of jazz music. Although they weren't friends, they did know each other, and it was for this reason that Coleman was sent, CBS reported. In the book, which is out October 29, Shenon doesn't dispute the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald worked alone when he murdered Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Probe: U.S. investigator William Coleman (left in 1976 when he became the US Secretary of State for Transport) was sent to waters off Cuba to meet Castro (pictured in 1964) because they had previously met in Harlem . Moments from tragedy: President Kennedy and his wife smile at crowds from their motorcade in Dallas, Texas just moments before he was shot on November 22, 1963. Castro said he knew nothing of the plot . Instead, he underlines that there's no evidence to suggest there was a conspiracy or anybody else involved, despite numerous claims to the contrary. It also comes after retired CIA analyst Brian Latell claimed in a book last year that Oswald told Cuban intelligence officers that he had planned to kill Kennedy. 'Fidel knew of Oswald's intentions - and did nothing to deter the act,' he wrote. He wrote that a Cuban spy defector told him that on November 22, 1963, he was told to gather any intelligence coming from Texas - and within three hours he learned that the president had been shot. The defector told a CIA debriefer: 'Castro knew. They knew Kennedy would be killed.' Accused: Lee Harvey Oswald, pictured in the Dallas police station, was arrested for the shooting but before he could stand trial, he was shot by a club owner while he was being moved to a jail . The Warren Report denied that anyone else was involved and instead only Oswald, a former Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union, was arrested for the death. He denied any role in the assassination. Two days after his arrest, he was shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as he was transferred from police headquarters to jail.","The Warren Commission sent an investigator to quiz Castro over JFK's assassination - but he denied being a part of it, a new book has revealed ."

But last year Clayton flew back to his homeland. ‘I’ve no idea why he left me,’ she says. Now Lucinda admits she is finding it a struggle being a single parent to their ten-year-old daughter — and the rigours of managing her business. She has already run into difficulties, upsetting locals in her Wiltshire village who are annoyed about the continuing presence of a ‘temporary’ mobile home and stables for which she had no planning consent. Lucinda says: ‘All I’m trying to do is my best to survive. Life has been difficult since Clayton.’ IT'S early days yet, but the next time Prince Philip wants alterations to his many well-worn suits, he may need to congratulate his Savile Row tailor Patrick Grant. Oxford-educated Grant, who  steps out with Victoria Beckham’s handbag designer, Kate Hillier, is itching to start a family. ‘I’m 41 and we’ve been together for six years, so I’m more than ready for parenthood,’ he tells me at a Hardlyever wornit.com fashion charity party at the Dorchester. ‘I am hoping I don’t have  to wait too much longer.’ YOU would have thought having Abu Hamza as a neighbour would hardly have been good for property values.

Although the agent mentions its ‘proximity to many local amenities’, no reference is made to the Hamza clan, who still live in their council-owned house.

The man with the Belfast . accent, herringbone overcoat and upside-down spectacles, usually seen . shivering outside 10 Downing Street. But long before he stepped in front of the television camera, Cole was a Fleet Street old-timer.‘Hondootedly, . Mrs Thatcher…’ was how the satirical magazine Private Eye began his . spoof bulletins. His Spitting Image puppet had a Douglas Hurd hairdo and . Prince Philip’s ears. But although Cole was caricatured, he was also trusted by the public to tell things straight. On air, he kept his life-long Labour leanings in check. 'Hondootedly, Mrs Thatcher', was how Private Eye began its satirical bulletins by John Cole, who has died . Mr Cole, a household name with his . distinctive accent and glasses, even became a . Spitting Image puppet . As political editor of the BBC from . 1981 to 1992, he had a seat in the Westminster cockpit during one heck . of a ride. From dawn’s radio slots to television’s late-night news . shows, there he was, squawking down the microphone, peering into the . camera lens like a man peeking through a keyhole. But the unrelenting hours took their toll. He had health problems, particularly with his heart. Yesterday, . David Cameron led tributes, describing Cole as ‘someone who has . contributed so much to British political life’ and a ‘titan at the BBC, . an extraordinary broadcaster’. Ed Miliband said: ‘My generation grew up watching John Cole. He conveyed the drama and importance of politics.’ And . what big stories Cole covered: the Falklands War and its aftermath; the . loopiness of Michael Foot’s Labour party; the miners’ strike – and then . the downfall of The Lady Herself – that scintillating drama in the . autumn of 1990 when the parliamentary Conservative party took revenge on . its bossy Boadicea. Described as humble, John Cole never stooped to the left-wing bias which existed in much of the BBC . As a very green sketchwriter, I got . to know John a little at that time. He was generous with his time. He . never let Mrs T shout at him but he never gave her cause to do so. Though it was open knowledge that he did not share her politics, he . reported her views with interest and respect. Her . own suspicion of the ‘Bolshevik Broadcasting Corporation’ was no . secret. But BBC bias had its roots at Broadcasting House, not in the . reporting of political editor Cole. Once, Tory MPs practically assaulted . Cole in the Commons lobby when BBC1’s Panorama went on its periodic . anti-Tory sallies, but they had the wrong target. Mrs . Thatcher realised that Cole was a grown-up surveyor of the political . scene. He had lived a bit and he had a newsman’s acceptance of events. Not for him such cheap ruses as the ‘rabbit punch’ question – when an . interviewer tries to shock a politician with a startling question. Nor . did Cole have much time for the political correctness which has since . afflicted the BBC. He was an Ulster Protestant, after all. John . Morrison Cole, son of an electrical engineer, was born in 1927 and . educated at Belfast’s Royal Academy. He joined the Belfast Telegraph in . 1945, covering industrial and political stories. In 1956 he joined the . Manchester Guardian and reported trade union matters. Cole . hoped to become editor of The Guardian in 1975 but his flinty . Presbyterian ways – not least his realistic view of Ulster Unionism – . were incongenial to the London Leftists who were by then in the . vanguard. So he moved . to the Observer, where he became deputy editor. He joined the BBC only . after that paper was bought by industrialist Tiny Rowland. His BBC . colleague John Humphrys recalled yesterday: ‘I didn’t think we should . employ him as the on-air political editor because people would simply . find it too difficult to understand his accent. Today's generation of politicians and journalists grew up watching Mr Cole reporting on life in Westminster . ‘Mercifully they ignored my advice . completely. Of all the massive errors of judgment I’ve made, that was . probably my biggest. He turned out to be a great star. People related to . him as a warm and decent human being. They could see he was a decent . man.’ In his newspaper . years, Cole was a committed Labour man. He suppressed editorial . criticism of Establishment Labour figures such as Jim Callaghan, Denis . Healey or Merlyn Rees. Despite . his later image as an avuncular figure, Cole was a tough guy. At the . BBC, in those days, there was a duty to abjure party bias. One of Cole’s . on-air catchphrases became ‘it seems to me’ – a line he used to . indicate to viewers his descent into (fact-based) conjecture.

Ralph Tarrant has just taken the title of Britain's oldest man - but says he doesn't understand what 'all this fuss is about'. The Sheffield great great grandfather has been handed the crown following the death of 110-year-old Reg Dean yesterday. Aged 109 and 185 days old, Mr Tarrant was born only a year after Mr Dean in 1903. Still on the go: Great great grandfather Ralph Tarrant from Sheffield is now Britain's oldest man aged 109 . Memory lane: Britain's newly-crowned oldest man, Ralph Tennant, looks through his collection of photos . Times gone by: Ralph and wife Phyllis on holiday in Skegness in 1929, left, and in Hornsea in 1931, right . He was one half of Britain's oldest married couple until his wife Phyllis died aged 102 last year. And Mr Tarrant says the secret to a long life is to enjoy vices as well as much as virtues. 'Stay active and stay interested,' he said. 'There's no need to live too carefully I smoked until I was 70 and I still enjoy a drink. I have a sweet tooth too and my . favourite meal is cottage pie which I make myself.' Both Mr Dean and Mr Tarrant lived through two world wars and saw 24 prime ministers come and go. A former church minister, Mr Dean put his long life down to a mysterious elixir he was once given by a physician in India. Passed on: Reg Dean was Britain's oldest man before he died yesterday aged 110 . 'He said, ""If you drink this you will live for ever"" â€“ and this is the result,"" he told the Derbyshire Times last year. But Mr Tarrant, a former insurance man, who retired in 1968, credits simpler pleasures for his longevity. He said: 'I am old but it isn't that . hard, I still live independently I do my own shopping and I enjoy . cooking. I go out walking when I can so what's the big deal? 'I . just don't understand all this fuss about getting old. I feel really . smashing for my age.My health is good. The only thing is I have . recently started using a walking stick - but I can still go like the . clappers.' Mr Tarrant was born in Nottingham on . July 7th 1903, and moved to Sheffield when he was seven. He left school . at 13 and started work as an office boy at a local steelworks. He . moved around different departments , became a steel inspector and . served as a corporal in the RAF during the war before selling insurance . with Refuge Assurance until he retired in 1968. Mr . Tarrant met his wife Phyllis in 1922 and they married in Crookes , . Sheffield, 11 years later, the day after Ralph's 30th birthday. Between them, Ralph and Phyllis Tarrant had received a total of ten cards from the Queen and were as devoted to each other as ever before Phyllis died last year. 'The key to a long . and happy marriage is to give each other hell every chance you get! That's certainly what we did and it kept us young, we were great . friends,' he said.

He was previously one half of Britain's oldest married couple before his wife Phyllis died last year aged 102 . The couple visited the USA eight times, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Hitler's . hideaway in Austria and even danced under the stars on a cruise around . the Greek islands. 'I . sometimes feel that we didn't really start living until we retired in . our sixties and went off travelling round the world. We did more in our . later years than we ever had the opportunity to do when we were young. 'Capri was my absolute favourite that's where we ended up swimming with Gracie Fields,' he said.

Now there’s something else they can rely on them for – foiling armed robberies. In a remarkable display of  ‘people power’, the townsfolk banded together to thwart two career criminals who had raided a jewellery shop . Smash and grab: As London and Clark smashed through glass cabinets in the jewellery store, dozens of passers-by were gathering outside, the action caught on CCTV . A retired businessman stood his ground after one of the robbers stabbed him in the eyebrow, passers-by swiped the keys to their getaway vehicle and a travel agent yelled: ‘Who do you think you are, Bonnie and Clyde?’ Christopher London, 25, and Damion Clark, 30, were both jailed yesterday after a court heard how the people of Louth – recently voted Britain’s favourite market town – had stopped them in their tracks. The pair, from Grimsby, raided the Lincolnshire town’s Eastgate Jewellers in June. They wore motorbike helmets, and were armed with claw hammers and a knife. But they hadn’t reckoned on the presence of mind and courage of owner Julie Smith, who pressed an alarm which locked them all in the shop. Left 'high and dry': The court heard how residents of Louth banded together, forcing the robbers to escape on foot . As the robbers began smashing up cabinets, two passers-by came to help, standing guard outside the doors. Mrs Smith ran to her flat upstairs, but the raiders chased her and dragged her back down before forcing her to unlock the doors. But when the raiders made it outside, they found they had been left ‘high and dry’ by passers-by who had taken the keys to their motorbike and knocked it over. Clark fled to a car park where he attempted to drag Eric Chapman out of his car, Lincoln Crown Court heard. When the retired businessman refused, Clark stabbed him in the eyebrow – but Mr Chapman still ‘did not budge,’ the judge said, describing him as ‘made of stern stuff’. Clark was soon detained by other members of the public, including a retired policeman. London fled towards Kidgate Primary Academy school, where he was confronted by deputy head teacher Paul Lidbury. He fled, and was later arrested in a back garden. People power: The criminals, wearing their motorbike helmets, were confronted by dozens of passing shoppers and traders. Two passers-by guarded the shop door while another kicked the pair's getaway bike over . Prosecutor Jon Straw said: ‘This is a very remarkable example of people power. The people of the town banded together and the motorbike they intended to use for their escape was pushed over by a passer-by and the keys taken. ‘They were left high and dry and had to flee on foot.’ Terry Robinson, a travel agent, was one of those who gathered outside the shop. He said: ‘One of them came out shouting “Keep back and no one will get hurt”. I shouted “Who do you think you are, Bonnie and Clyde?”’ Crime scene: After the robbers fled on foot they came across more resistance from locals which led to their arrests and jail sentences . Clark admitted robbery and unlawful wounding. He also asked for 17 other offences to be taken into consideration. Judge Sean Morris branded him ‘dangerous’ and sentenced him to six years in jail with an extended three-and-a-half years on licence. London, who pleaded guilty to robbery and also asked for 12 other offences to be taken into account, was jailed for four years. Foiled robbery attempt: Local residents thwarted .

It was named Britain’s favourite market town in a poll by BBC Countryfile Magazine last year.

Does the U.S really have one of the biggest obesity problems in the world, and which country is actually the Land of the Giants? Pittsburgh artist Nickolay Lamm has studied the body measurements of average men in America, Japan, France and the Netherlands and discovered U.S men are, in fact the fattest, while Dutch men are the tallest. Lamm used these figures to work out the average BMI for each country and has created computer-generated images to show how the nationalities stack up against each other. The image on the left compares the average body shape of U.S. and Japanese men who have 39.7 and 32.6 inch waists respectively.  The right image reveals that average waists for men in the Netherlands are 35.8 inches while French men have average waists of 36.3 inches. Average male BMIs were found to be 29 for the U.S., 23.7 for Japan, 25.55 for France and 25.5 for the Netherlands . The left image shows the relative heights of the average men (left to right) from the Netherlands, America, France and Japan. Average Dutch men are 6ft, while the average Japanese male is 5ft 6. The right image compares the height and waist of the average American on the left with that of a Dutchman, right . The average BMI, height and waist measurements of men in the U.S, Japan, France and the Netherlands are as follows: . Country: USA            Country: Japan . BMI: 29                       BMI: 23.7 . Height: 5ft 8in            Height: 5ft 6in . Waist: 39.1 inches     Waist: 32.6 inches . Country: France      Country: Netherlands . BMI: 25.55                  BMI: 25.5 . Height: 5ft 7in             Height: 6ft . Waist: 36.3 inches      Waist: 35.8 inches . According to the data, the average male in the U.S. has the highest BMI of any country studied, at 29. This puts them at the top end of the overweight range for BMI and is just one point away from being obese. In fact, the only country whose average male had a BMI score in the healthy range was Japan. The average height of American men was found to be 5ft 8in (176.4cm) with an average waist of 39.1 inches (84.1cm). Japanese men were the shortest and . thinnest according to Lamm's Body Measurement Project with an average height of 5ft 6in . (171.4cm) and 32.6 inches (81cm). The average height in the U.S, far left, is 5ft 9in, with an average waist of 33.1in. Japanese men were the shortest with an average height of 5ft 7in and 32in waists. In the Netherlands average waists measure 35in and they were the tallest at 6ft. French men, far right have an average height of 5ft 8in and 36 inch waists . This gave Japanese men the lowest BMI of the group with 23.7 BMI. In Europe, French men were found to have an average height of 5ft 7in (174.4cm). Their . waists, on average, measure 36.3 inches (92.3cm) and this gives France an . average BMI of 25.55 - just on the edge of healthy and overweight . range. Commenting on this relatively high BMI in France, Lamm said: 'France has a culture that respects food . from the farm, and teaches its children to value a well-balanced diet . and proper meal times. Yet, the American culture of eating anytime is . catching on in France and may be the cause of increased obesity levels.' Lamm gathered the measurements from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S, the Jikei University School of Medicine, National Institute for Public Health and the European Neural Network Society. He then used a computer program to create the average male image. This image shows the average French man . The average Japanese man, pictured, was the only group to fall in the healthy BMI range, compared to the other countries studied . In the Netherlands, average men measure 35.8 inches (91cm) and were by far the tallest of the group with an average height of 6ft (183.3cm). This gave them an average BMI of 25.2 - just 0.3 points lower than France and still on the border of overweight. During his research, Lamm also discovered that the Dutch are have some of the world's best . healthcare, particularly at the stages of life that make a . difference for how tall people become. Another study said that the Dutch spread this good health around. Although most well-off Americans are tall, research suggested that the less-privileged groups across all races brought down the average. Lamm gathered the BMI, height and waist measurements from multiple sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S, the Jikei . University School of Medicine, National Institute for Public Health and . the Environment, and the European Neural Network Society. Lamm also worked with expert on body shape measurement, Matthew P. Reed from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, to verify the data.","The average BMI for a U.S. male is 29 - the highest of any country studied .

A picture of Premier League footballer Liam Ridgewell wiping his backside with a wad of £20 notes has infuriated fans. The West Brom defender was photographed squatting over the toilet in the bathroom of his £1.5million home in Barnt Green, Birmingham, with his trousers down. Ridgewell, 28, earns around £20,000 a week - the average annual salary in the West Midlands. Toilet humour: Fans were unimpressed with the photo of Liam Ridgewell wiping his backside with £20 notes in the bathroom of his £1.5million home . He claims the image, in which roughly £1,000 in cash is scattered around him, was simply a 'joke' intended to wind up a friend who had lost a bet. But angry West Brom fans labelled the picture 'arrogant' and 'idiotic'. The offensive picture was sent to The Sun by a supporter who asked not to be named. He said: 'The people of West Bromwich . earn a fraction of what this idiot earns yet he makes a mockery of his . good fortune like this. It makes me sick. 'We’ve always thought footballers were arrogant, overpaid buffoons and this just proves it.' Sorry: Ridgewell, left, last night apologised for the picture, which he said was taken after he won a bet, to 'wind up a mate'. Right, a picture of the player's locker strewn with toilet roll was tweeted today . Other fans at West Brom's home match against Stoke yesterday said the picture was 'insensitive' to people who had to scrape together the money to watch Ridgewell play. Ridgewell, an unused sub in his team’s 1-0 defeat, apologised last night. 'The photo was taken in the . privacy of my home around eight months ago as a joke to wind up a mate, . who I had just won a personal bet with,' he said. 'I only intended him to see the photo . but now it’s public, I can understand how it will be viewed. I am sorry . for any offence it causes.' His agent Rob Segal told Mail Online today: 'All I can say is, it was a joke that actually wasn’t funny at all, it was intended as a private joke with his friends and he sincerely regrets it.' Fury: Fans labelled the 28-year-old (right, taking on Sunderland's Stephane Sessegnon) 'arrogant', 'overpaid' and an 'idiot' A spokesman for West Brom, who are fifth in the Premier League table, said: 'This is a private issue for Liam that has become public. 'As a result, it does not put the club in a good light and we will deal with the matter internally. 'However, we would like to stress that, since Liam joined us 11 months ago, his conduct whilst on club duty has been exemplary.' Ridgewell's teammates today cemented his embarrassment by plastering his locker with toilet roll and posting a photo of it on Twitter. West Brom player Steven Reid posted the picture along with the comment, 'Guess the locker.......' The star is no stranger to controversy. Last year, he cancelled his £170,000 wedding to 23-year-old Kirsty Maclaren, mother of his two children, eight days before the big day.

'Because I’m used to having tall kids, Jonah seems extra tiny at the moment. But at 9lb 2oz, he was a big baby and he’s already gone up to more than 10lb. 'I’m a very protective mother and being so tall means I can keep an eye on where my kids are at all times.' Keisha, who wore men’s clothes when she was pregnant because there weren’t any maternity outfits big enough, said the couple would like another child. Wilco, who has 40-inch legs, stood at 5ft 10in by the time he was just ten . She said: 'Four is a nice number, but we have enough on our hands for the time being.

Dutch-born Wilco buys his clothes from specialist websites that normally supply size 15 shoes to American basketball players.

The friend, who has not been identified, said that Kelley, a military party planner in Tampa, had called her to seek advice after receiving the messages and read them out over the phone. Speaking to the New York Daily News, she described the messages as much more threatening than originally reported, adding: 'Any normal person who got emails like that would have immediately called police.' 'Threats': David Petraeus' former mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured left on Tuesday morning, reportedly sent emails that were so menacing to Jill Kelley, right, that she saw them as death threats . In the messages, which were sent anonymously, Broadwell promised to 'make you go away' and boasted about her military background and having 'powerful' friends, the Daily News reported. 'This wasn’t just a case of cyber-bullying,' the friend said. '(Kelley) was scared for her life. She had reason to be. These emails are the real thing. When she read them to me, I literally had the shivers.' The Wall Street Journal previously reported that, in one email, Broadwell had accused Kelley of touching 'him' underneath a table . and asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions. In another, Broadwell asked: 'Who do you think you are?' Reunited: Broadwell moved back in with her doctor husband Scott over the weekend . Routine: Dr. Scott Broadwell, a radiologist, and his wife (seen top right) leave their home on Monday . She also accused the socialite, a . Petraeus family friend, of 'parad[ing] around the base', adding: 'You . need to take it down a notch.' But the threatening emails, which had . previously been described as 'cat-fight stuff', led to Broadwell's . undoing after Kelley contacted a friend in the FBI about the messages. The anonymous emails contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts and, thinking there had been a potential national security breach, the FBI was forced to investigate. During their probe, they traced the emails back to Broadwell and also uncovered emails revealing her months-long affair with CIA boss David Petraeus, whose biography she had penned. But investigators also found tens of thousands of emails between Kelley and Gen. John Allen, head of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, and deemed some 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious'. Looking forward: Broadwell, pictured on the . school run with her two young sons on Tuesday morning, has told friends . she is sorry for the hurt her affair with the former CIA boss has caused . her family . Back to normality: She is pictured on Monday outside her Charlotte, North Carolina home . The married father of two is now under investigation, but both he and Kelley deny any wrongdoing. Kelley has also denied being any more than . friends with Petraeus and released a statement saying: 'We and our . family have been friends with Gen. Petraeus for over five years. We respect his family’s privacy and want the same for us and our three children.' Her . sister, Natalie Khawam, has also been dragged into the scandal, with . reports detailing her troubled child custody battles and shrewd . socialising skills. Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is now representing . her. The latest . revelations about the contents of the emails - which eventually led to . Petraeus' resignation from the CIA on November 9 - come as Broadwell . moved back home with her husband and children. Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and former mistress . She arrived back in Charlotte, North . Carolina on Sunday after hiding out at her brother's Washington D.C. home for a week after the scandal broke. Her brother, Stephen Kranz, revealed . that Broadwell is 'incredible sorry' for hurting her family and . acknowledged that she made a mistake. 'She's been devastated by this,' Kranz told People Magazine. 'She . is filled with guilt and shame for what she's done and she's incredibly . sorry for the pain she's caused her husband, her family, Petraseus's . family. She accepts responsibility for her actions and knows she made a . mistake.' He added that she is now committed to repairing the damage to her family and protecting her children from the furore following the affair and Petraeus' resignation. On Monday, she was pictured on the . school run and carrying out errands, while her husband Scott was . photographed embracing a friend in the doorway of their home.

Business: Natalie Khawam has hired celebrity attorney Gloria Allred after she was dragged into the scandal . As the family returned home on Sunday, they were welcomed by a group of . friends and neighbours, and a close friend - who did not want . to be named - said Broadwell was overwhelmed by the support. Mrs Broadwell maintained her stony . silence after being confronted by a number of reporters when she pulled . up in an SUV, according to WSOC-TV. Her . husband Scott refused to comment, but appeared happy to joke about the . media circus which has surrounded his family since the affair emerged. Scott was asked: 'Is there anything at all you'd like to say, Scott? Now's your chance, this is it.' But after pausing for a moment, he simply replied: 'No comment at this time.' He later returned to the driveway to . take groceries out of the car and joked with reporters, saying: 'I'll be . out here Tuesday taking out trash, if you want to shoot that.' Homecoming: Paula Broadwell carries her son into her house in Charlotte, North Carolina on Sunday evening . Family: Scott and Paula Broadwell took their two sons into their home after more than a week in hiding . The doctor revealed that the family would be releasing a statement soon, but did not elaborate on when it would be.

"By . Lauren Paxman . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 10 November 2011 . With two days to go until Remembrance Day, poppies are gracing everyone's lapels. But do you know how much of the money you pay for the poppy actually reaches the British Legion? The costs of making paper versions are kept low to ensure that 100 per cent of voluntary donations go straight to the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal. But some of the snazzier versions of the little red flower - such as that worn by Gary Barlow on X Factor - are not nearly as benevolent as they first appear. Kleshna, one of two companies with an exclusive tie-in with the Legion, sells enamelled . and crystal-clad poppies for up to £59.95 - and has admitted to giving just . 10 per cent of the sales to charity. Ill-judged? X Factor judges Tulisa wears Kleshna's £18.95 poppy ring, while Gary Barlow sports the designer's £59.95 poppy brooch . However, Buckley, the other firm selling poppies via the Legion's website, is donating all of the profits from its poppies (at least 80 per cent of its sales on the range) to charity. A spokesman for Kleshna said that they also 'gift in kind' by devoting 20 per cent of their employees' time to the project. An initial call to the Kleshna's company's customer hotline to inquire about the proportion of charity contributions was met with the declaration that Kleshna donates 25 per cent of profits from their poppy collection. But company owner Kleshna Handel later rang MailOnline to clarify that the real figure was actually 10 per cent. ‘I’m very sorry that they gave you an inaccurate figure,' said the designer. 'But if you look on our website, you will see the correct one.’ 'Gift in kind': Kleshna employees spend six months working on the poppy range and the jewellery is very popular - the £49.95 brooch, right, has already sold out . Should Kleshna be giving more than 10 per cent of poppy sales to the British Legion? Any contribution at all is obviously very, very welcome. But . some buyers will be upset to learn that only a small proportion of the . money they have spent on poppy jewellery - which is featured on the . Royal British Legion  website - actually makes it to the Armed Forces. Kleshna justifies the figures by saying: ‘It takes six months of the year for my company and my staff who work on this project. ‘We run a business but genuinely want to give money to charity.’ The company will not release figures on how much it has raised for the charity this year - or how much it shared last year. Kleshna, who was moved to donate to . charity because her family members and friends have died at war, simply . said: ‘It’s a lot of money. We don’t choose to declare how much, because . I don’t like boasting. She added: 'I have been gifted with an ability to create things people want to buy, that is why I give to charity. ‘We work exceedingly hard for this, all for nothing.’ More generous? Eighty per cent of sales from this £25  Buckley brooch goes to the Royal British Legion . There is no doubt that Kleshna's poppies have helped raise awareness of this hardworking charity - especially among the young. For their part, the charity, understandably, is very appreciative of any donation at all. A spokesman from the British Legion said: 'The Kleshna line of poppy jewellery is produced under a licensing agreement with The Royal British Legion. 'In compliance with the Charity Act, this written agreement sets out terms agreeable to both parties under which Kleshna is entitled to the use of our logo in return for a donation to the Poppy Appeal.' An insider added: 'We are very grateful for Kleshna's support. 'She does great things for us and has increased our profits exponentially.' Both Kleshna and Buckley poppies can be bought via the Royal British Legion's website .","Kleshna, one of two companies selling its poppies via British Legion website, donates 10 per cent to charity...

"Came third in last year's Young Apprentice and is now selling Demi's range on his website . Described photographs of him kissing girls in Mahiki 'tragic' By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 12:04 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 24 October 2012 . He is the baby-faced ladies man and self-proclaimed 'unrivaled intellect' who was left red-faced when he was sent packing on The Young Apprentice last year. But despite missing out on the much coveted title, 18-year-old Harry Maxwell has proven his critics (and Lord Sugar) wrong by launching a host of projects, one of which is selling Demi Moore's beauty range on his website. The 49-year-old's range, which is titled More by Demi, has been launched by Oriflame and will be sold on Harry's website LegitEssentials.com- an online department store retailing not-on-the-high-street luxury well-being brands. Scroll down for video . Young Apprentice star Harry Maxwell is launching Demi Moore's beauty range on his very own website . Demi has been working on the range for a year and Harry could not be more excited to be selling it on his site . 'I can't believe that in a year I have been on The Young Apprentice and now I am working on all of these projects, it is amazing,' said Harry in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. Demi has been working on the four-piece range for a year and has created the brand to empower women. 'She feels that her products should give women confidence at a young age. It is entitled ""More by Demi"" because she wants people to strive for more in their lives,' explained Harry. Harry's glamorous and entrepreneurial new life is a far cry from his humble beginnings on the BBC show, where he came in joint third place. The product range features perfume, body cream, shower cream and hair spray and the introductory price is of £28.90 for the next two weeks . 'It was a shame that I didn't win and at the time it was such a massive deal but I am the only one who has gone on to do something. 'In terms of proving Lord Sugar wrong, . the winner Zara Brownless, from what she told me directly, informed Lord Sugar she . didn't have any big plans for the next five years while she finishes . school and uni, but in the meantime has bought an Apple MacBook Pro with . her 25k prize fund. 'I have clearly done more than that, but for me it's . not about beating my former competitors, it's about being the best I . can be,' said Harry. Despite his own mother even calling him arrogant, Harry has been made an ambassador for professional networking site LinkedIn in the UK and is also set to launch two new projects and team up with a Made In Chelsea star to launch their body care range alongside his studies at the London School of Economics. Although Harry didn't win the series, he maintains that he is the only one who has gone on to be a success . He said: 'It may sound cliche but I genuinely want to succeed more than I want to breathe and I will never ever stop trying to better myself. 'Last year I was working with Lord Sugar and Karren Brady, this year I'm working on all this. I'm never going to give up. 'Finishing third in The Young Apprentice Semi-Final in a twist where all the losing team were sent home was just the start of me, and it always would have been that way no matter where I finished.' Outside of the boardroom Harry is just like any other teenager, he loves partying and having fun with his friends. Harry is wholly embarrassed by the photographs of him partying in Mahiki . The Rugby school boy caused a stir last year when he was photographed drinking a £1,000 bottle of Dom Perignon champagne in Mayfair haunt Mahiki with young blonde ladies hanging off his arm (and face). 'Those pictures were horrendous and tragic but at least they weren't self taken,' he joked. Although Harry sacrificed his relationship with his girlfriend when he was caught in a love triangle with fellow contestants Hayley Forrester and Zara Brownless, Harry isn't in touch with the pair anymore. 'It is so hard to stay in touch with everyone from the show. I did actually bump into Lord Sugar at the BAFTAS and had a thirty second conversation with him. 'I would love for him to know what I am doing and I really want to update him on my projects.' With the latest series launching on-screen next week, Harry has some advice to the eager contestants. He said: 'Remember that at the end of the day it is just a competition but play your own game. I have learnt to never say never to anything and I want to make as much money as possible.' Harry advises this year's contestants to focus on their own game just like he did .","Came third in last year's Young Apprentice and is now selling Demi's range on his website .

The Real Madrid manager was being interviewed by Gabriel Clarke after his side's semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund that sent them out of the Champions League. Towards the end of the interview, Clarke said: 'We're going to have to leave it there. Many commiserations tonight. Maybe next season with Real?' Scroll down for video . ITV have been criticised for cutting off Jose Mourinho as he looked set to reveal his next career move . Thumbs up to a move? Mourinho was speaking following Real's semi-final aggregate defeat by Dortmund and hinted afterwards that he could return to Chelsea . Real Madrid won the second-leg 2-0 but Cristiano Ronaldo's side could not recover from a 4-1 first leg defeat . Mourinho replied 'maybe not', and when asked why he said: 'I want to be where people love me...' But rather than push him on reports that he is planning a return to Chelsea, Clarke said: 'We'll take that as England'. Fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at the abrupt end to the interview.

John McAllister, 37, ran from the . family home with an inflatable mattress after spotting his dog . struggling in the ice from a bedroom window. He pushed his way 30ft across the ice . to rescue the pet – then just as he had her in his grasp, the mattress . they were on sank into the freezing water and they drowned. His father Roddy, who had been walking . the mongrel called Tain, was screaming at the side of the loch as he . heard his son’s last words – ‘I need help.’ Speaking at the side of the Gadloch in . Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, yesterday, Mr  McAllister Snr, 56, said: ‘The . dog was squealing and splattering in the water, so John grabbed the . mattress and waded into the water to save her. ‘I called him back at one point because it was getting dark and I started to worry. ‘I told him I wanted to fix some rope around the mattress. ‘But Tain was nearly in his grasp, so he carried on. ‘He managed to get to her and had her in his arms. Then he shouted his last words, “I need help”. ‘I was screaming from the side of the loch, everybody in the village could hear me. Then it went silent. I knew he was dead.’ Mr McAllister Snr was then forced to . wait for nearly two hours by the side of the loch with other family . members while emergency services hunted for his son and the dog. Their bodies were brought out of the water around 7.30pm on Sunday night. Last night, Mr McAllister Snr, a . professional dog walker who has walked pets around the loch for 30 . years, said his son was a ‘hero’. Fighting back tears: Roddy McAllister beside Gadloch in Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, where John died . Fighting back tears, he added: ‘He was so brave.

It just hasn’t sunk in for either me or his mum. It’s just terrible.’ His wife Sandra, 56, was too upset to speak. Mr McAllister Jnr had taken over his . father’s family business and was working as a landscaper. He had been . due to start a big project in Edinburgh yesterday. He lived near his parent’s home in .

Mr McAllister Jnr’s body was recovered . following an extensive search by police divers, a helicopter and fire . crews using a thermal imaging camera. It appears that,  as he rescued . the dog, she was frightened and her claws burst the mattress. It is thought he died clutching his beloved pet. Police described the accident as ‘a tragic incident’. Yesterday, neighbours spoke of the tragedy that has left the whole community devastated. Neighbour Robert Ralston, 40, said: ‘I was so shocked to hear what happened. ‘I’ve known him for more than 20 years and he was such a hard- working man.

Hilary Mantel, the only female writer to twice win the Man Booker Prize, will make Margaret Thatcher the subject of her next book. The Wolf Hall author will pen a collection of short stories about the former prime minister, who died in April last year. The novel, entitled The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher, will be published in September. Publishers have revealed it will be made up of 10 stories featuring the late Baroness Thatcher as the protagonist. But unlike Mantel’s most recent works of historical fiction the plot of each story will be set within ‘contemporary settings’. Nicholas Pearson, publishing director at 4th Estate, said: ‘A new book from Hilary Mantel is a treat. ‘Where her last two novels explore how modern England was forged, The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher shows us the country we have become. 'These stories are Mantel at her observant best.’ Mantel made her name with her novel Wolf Hall which follows the 16th century court intrigues of Thomas Cromwell, adviser to King Henry VIII. The book won Mantel the Booker prize for the first time in 2009 and three years later she was awarded the gong a second time for its sequel Bringing Up The Bodies. Both works topped the best seller list in the UK, with Bringing Up The Bodies making her the first ever author to enter the charts at number one. The 61-year-old author was also awarded the Walter Scott Prize in 2010 and won the Costa Book Awards in 2012. The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher (left) will be published in September. Mantel controversially criticised the Duchess of Cambridge (right) and her appearance . Mantel's Wolf Hall was adapted by Mike Poulton and performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company Production . The Derbyshire-born author caused controversy last year after she attacked the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ with no personality, whose only purpose is to breed. During a lecture at the British Museum, she criticised Kate as appearing to have been ‘gloss-varnished’ with a perfect plastic smile in contrast to the late Princess of Wales, who she described as awkward and emotionally incontinent. She went on to suggest that the ‘painfully thin’ Kate was selected for her role of princess because she posed no risk of showing any character.","Award winning author to write book about the Iron Lady .

Lord Nelson's sword is hidden in a ship wreck 500ft below the surface of the Mediterranean sea, an explorer has claimed. Diver Mark Ellyatt says that he discovered the weapon in the ruins of HMS Victoria, which sank off the coast of Lebanon in 1893. The sword is said to have been among a haul of Nelson memorabilia that belonged to Vice Admiral George Tyron. Collectors could pay up to £1m for the artifact  - which is the same one that the Naval Lord shown holding on Nelson's Column in central London. However, there are concerns about who would claim ownership of the sword if it is recovered from the sea. Mr Ellyatt said he found the sword in Tryon's cabin which had an adjoining cupboard  containing a number of items that belonged to Nelson. 'The MoD wanted to know the whereabouts of anything to do with Nelson. They didn't want it appearing on auction websites,' Mr Ellyatt told the Telegraph. 'They were very interested in the sword but seemed to get cold feet when I offered to bring it up for them. I don't want people to go and strip the ship bare. 'I would like to bring the sword to the surface but I worry that it would be seized by the local authorities. If the items are to be recovered, I would like to see them end up in a museum in the UK.' Mr Ellyatt said that he has hidden the weapon inside the wreck to protect it from looters. He will give more details about the discovery at the International Shipwreck Conference in Plymouth this week. He added: 'The cabin is a bit like a shrine, with all kinds of nice things hanging off the walls. 'There seem to be a lot of things which are older than the ship itself.' Vice Admiral Tryon is known to have been an enormous admirer of Lord Nelson, who died 88 years earlier. He is understood to have kept a large number of items on board HMS Victoria that once belonged to his hero. Proud vessel: HMS Victoria docks in 1887 in front of crowds of well-wishers six years before it sank in the Mediterranean. Nelson's sword is said to have been on board .

Since the wreck was discovered in 2004, several items have been brought to the surface including a model of Nelson's HMS Victory. A sword belonging to Nelson was sold at an auction in 2002 for £336,650. Victor Sharman, a former chairman of the Nelson Society, said that there would be a 'big market' if ay pieces were recovered from the ship. Christian Francis, a member of the team that found the shipwreck, said that he has declared the find to the British embassy in Lebanon. An MoD spokesman said that the Royal Navy would 'welcome' any information about Lord Nelson. The sinking of HMS Victoria came during training exercises for a fleet of 11 warships in June 1893. The conditions were calm and warm. Crowds watched from the shore. However, as the fleet steamed forward in two parallel columns, Tryon ordered his ship - the HMS Victoria - and the other ship at the head of the column - HMS Camperdown - to perform a dangerous manoeuvre. Depsite pleas from other officers, the two ships were both ordered to turn inwards. They collided and the  HMS Victoria sank. Tryon's last words as he went down with his ship were: 'It's all my fault'. The vessel was lost as well as 358 sailors. His ghost was said to have appeared the same evening at a party being thrown by his wife in London.","Sword was among collection of memorabilia that is 'like a shrine' to Nelson .

Touchscreens on smartphones are great most of the time, but sometimes fingers get in the way if you are trying to play a game or look at a detailed document. But now inventors in Minneapolis have solved this problem by transforming the back and sides of a smartphone case into pressure-sensitive pads to enable the whole phone to react to touch. The Sensus protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case, so they will get a clear view of the screen and effectively increase its area. Scroll down for video . Inventors in Minneapolis have created the Sensus case (pictured) which promises to transform the back and sides of a smartphone case into pressure-sensitive pads to enable the whole phone to react to touch . The case made its debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and claims to combine ‘the best of protections and functionality’ while still being relatively slim. A version for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S is set to go on sale in summer for $99 (£60). No release date or price for the UK has been announced yet. The Sensus protective case will allow users to interact with selected apps using only the case . It is designed to be used by gamers, . social media butterflies and business people and could even make . smartphones easier to use for some people with disabilities, according . to Canopy, the company behind the case. The case could be used to take selfies by squeezing its sides, or to play games using the back of the case to execute different manoeuvres. It works by using two different types of sensors - capacitive and resistive - which are already used in most mobile device screens. The capacitive sensor picks up upon electrical current in an individual's skin to indicate where a person’s finger is located, while the resistive sensor detects the level of pressure applied. Together they make the case as sensitive as a phone’s screen. When a person touches the sensors on the back and sides of the prototype case, the built-in processors in Sensus translate that data into information that interacts with compatible apps on the smartphone. The start-up said the case ‘gives interaction with apps a whole new variable and dimension that developers and users alike have never experienced before’. It will work with a number of apps – although only three are confirmed at the moment, - with an increasing number set to become compatible as the case becomes more widely adopted after its release. The start-up claims it will not drain a phone’s battery quickly and will protect a phone from 'bumps, drops and scratches'. A version of the case for the iPhone5 and iPhone 5S will be the first to go on sale, with a larger type for the iPad Mini following closely behind. Owners of an iPhone 5C or iPod Touch will be the next to get the cases and the company said it might develop them for use with Android and Windows Mobile smartphones too. An iPhone case called Yellow Jacket that comes with a 650K volt electrode, is capable of 'halting an aggressive adult male,' according to the firm that makes it. The case is fitted with a safety catch to make sure the electrode doesn't accidentally activate in a pocket, for example. The electrode is also protected by a cover. In addition to being used as a weapon, Yellow Jacket has its own battery and can charge a phone for up to twenty hours. The case can keep up to 10 per cent of this power in reserve to make sure that the stun gun can be used in emergencies, even if the phone's battery is dead. The Yellow Jacket case is sold in the U.S., where it is legal in 42 of the 50 states. Stun guns can only be bought by over 18s without a felony record and must also only be bought for self defence. Stun guns are illegal in the UK and considered to be firearms, which can carry up to a five-year jail sentence. Yellow Jacket does not offer international shipping. To discharge the stun gun, users need to pull the top corner of the case back and push the safety switch up.  To fire the gun, users must press and hold the blue button. Once the electrode is no longer needed, users must pull down the safety button and replace the corner of the case so the device isn't accidentally activated in their pocket. The original iPhone 4S case went on sale in the U.S. last year, and the firm recently unveiled a redesigned iPhone 5 and 5S model at CES.

As the new Pope’s refreshing informality continues to make waves — yesterday, he agreed to be part of a 'selfie' photograph taken by a teenager inside St Peter’s in Rome — there has been an equally seismic change within Britain’s leading Catholic public school, Ampleforth College. The £30,264-a-year school — past pupils include Lord (Julian) Fellowes, Rupert Everett, the Duke of Norfolk and ex-rugby star Lawrence Dallaglio — has just announced that its headmaster, Father Gabriel Everitt, will be retiring next year after ten years in the post. But in a huge break from tradition, the next head will not be a monk, as was automatic in the past. Prestigious: The UK's premier Catholic school is to get a new head - but he won't be a monk . Alumnus: Rupert Everett is among the famous names to have attended  Ampleforth school . Indeed, ever since the school, in North Yorkshire, was founded in 1802, there has always been a monk at the helm, drawn from the school’s founding Benedictine Monastery, Ampleforth Abbey. At one stage, all the school masters were monks, having been specially trained at Ampleforth’s private Oxford College, St Benet’s Hall. And there were no women teachers either. But over the past 20 or so years, and particularly since it became co-educational three years ago, there are many more women on the staff and now, of the school’s 84 full-time staff, just five are monks. Yesterday, a letter was sent out to the parents of the 600 pupils at the school informing them that Father Gabriel, 57, would be retiring, and announcing the 'significant' change. The new lay headmaster will be appointed after September next year. 'At this present time, the imperative to appoint the best possible head for the college compels us to seek a professional lay head,' says the Abbot, Cuthbert Madden. 'This conclusion has not been arrived at lightly, but, given both the nature and commitments of the monastic community and the needs of the school for the best possible leadership, we have decided upon this as the appropriate course of action.' A spokesman for the school tells me: 'It’s a co-educational establishment, so the future head could just as easily be  a headmistress. ‘We will simply be looking for the best Catholic candidate we can find.’ As world leaders agonised over sending warships to Syria, David Cameron faced his own battle on the high seas. Holidaymakers described seeing the portly Prime Minister attempting to haul himself onto a speedboat in Daymer Bay in Cornwall. It happened on the last day of his family break before rushing back to take charge of the Syrian crisis. One onlooker says: 'He was with his family and friends and security on the beach, when this speedboat roared up. He waded out to it and tried to clamber aboard. But despite a lot of huffing and puffing, he couldn’t get in. It took him about five minutes before he finally managed it.' Nerve-wracking: Model Katya Elisarova will appear on stage in London for the first time this week . She dreams of being a Hollywood star, but when model Katia Elizarova treads the boards in London for the first time this week, she admits it will be the most nerve-racking gig of her life. Fortunately, she tells me, her younger sister, Alisa, 22, is on hand to keep her calm. 'Thank goodness for Alisa,’ says Katia, 26. 'She’s flown over from Moscow not only to see me perform — but also to help out backstage.' In Sunstroke, Katia plays a 19th-century Russian woman who has an affair with a dashing Army officer. It opens at the Platform Theatre at King’s Cross. 'There’s no full-time stage crew, so Alisa and I have been painting the stage and helping with the scenery,' says Katia, muse of Russian multi-millionaire Leon Max for whom she has modelled at his stately home, Easton Neston. 'What with endless rehearsals, some days I’ve been in the theatre until midnight. 'Alisa is good at dances such as waltzes, which feature in the play, and she has taught me how to do them, too, while staying with me in Chelsea. 'She loves England so much I think she might even join me here eventually, but she doesn’t want to be an actress, she wants to do something sensible — like being on a  news channel.' Nose job: Naomi Watts had to wear a prosthetic nose to play Princess Diana in an upcoming film . Hollywood actress Naomi Watts has admitted to painstakingly researching Princess Diana’s accent and mannerisms for her forthcoming biopic — but what of her decision to wear a fake nose? While some fans of the Princess may not approve, petite Naomi, 44, says she had to remove the middle of her eyebrows so the proboscis would fit. 'We had a prosthetic nose made because mine is very different to Di’s. She had a strong nose that was pointy. 'If you put a point on the end of my nose, it looks like I’m wearing a nose that’s too big for me,' Oscar-nominated Naomi says. 'So we just went for the bridge of the nose and shaved my eyebrows in the centre to make room for it.' Perhaps she sought Di’s permission from beyond the grave . . . Prince William has already revealed that his son, George, is 'a bit of a rascal', and now he has a playmate. William’s Ludgrove prep school chum, commodity broker Andrew Charlton, is celebrating the birth of Luke Edward Charlton with his wife, Edwina, daughter of Lord Palmer, a scion of the Huntley & Palmers biscuit family. Says a friend: 'Luke was born in Singapore, where Andrew and Eddy live now. Both mother and baby are doing really well.' The couple wed two years ago at Edwina’s father’s grand country pile, Manderston, in Berwickshire. ..................................................................................................................................................... These are heady days for Dan Skelton, son of London Olympic gold medallist and showjumping star Nick. Yesterday, Dan made his debut as a trainer when his horse Gavroche Gaugain ran at Stratford. And, I can reveal, Dan, 28, and his wife Grace, 24, a solicitor who runs her husband’s new office, are expecting their first baby. 'I can’t wait. The baby is due on October 21 and we don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl,' Dan tells me. 'Grace is getting to the stage where it’s a concerted effort for her to do anything. But we’re very lucky to have such wonderful support.' Indeed, his new venture is a family affair: Nick helped set up the stables and Dan’s younger brother, Harry, 24, who won the Irish Grand National in 2009, is stable jockey. P.S. He was responsible for one of the most enduring royal scoops of modern times — Prince Philip’s 'slitty eyes' remark to a group of students during the Queen’s 1986 visit to China. Nonetheless,  the residents of Buckingham Palace  will be saddened to learn of the death of veteran royal writer Alan Hamilton at the age of 70. For the distinguished Times journalist and author covered the highs as well as the lows of royal history with equal flair. Yet throughout it all, he eschewed sensation. When the Queen’s Press secretary was first informed of the 'slitty eyes' gaffe, he implored Hamilton not to write about it.  'Surely The Times, of all people, are not going to use this?' he begged. 'Most certainly,' Hamilton replied, 'but not until paragraph 14.'","Past pupils at Ampleforth include Rupert Everett and Lawrence Dallaglio .

A couple who drastically downsized their wedding plans after the husband-to-be was diagnosed with terminal cancer have been left amazed by the generosity of friends, family - and strangers - who’ve raised enough money through a crowd-sourcing website to pay for a dream ceremony. Jennifer Brennan and Erick Denizard, from Mansfield, Massachusetts, met through a dating site four years ago and immediately fell in love. Mr Denizard proposed to Ms Brennan while on a cruise. She said yes straight away and the pair set about planning a wedding for August 2014. Erick Denizard and Jennifer Brennan, pictured at a New England Patriots Game, initially downsized their wedding plans but were shocked at the amount of donations that came in . However, they received devastating news last year that changed everything – Mr Denizard was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and given six months to a year to live. He’d been experiencing pain in his leg and visited the doctor for a check-up, not thinking for a moment that there was anything seriously wrong. A series of tests on December 6 revealed, however, that the pain came from blood clots – and scans showed that he had tumours on his liver, spine, pancreas, lymph nodes and in his blood. Mr Denizard told The Sun Chronicle: ‘It was just a shock. It's tough to hear that you're on the clock. I have no family history of pancreatic cancer and I'm much younger than the average age patient. Usually, it's found in people age 55 to 71, and I'm only 46.’ They set up a Go Fund Me account, which acts as a portal for donations, to cover the costs of the wedding and medical bill - but they were inundated with nearly $35,000 from friends and strangers alike . The couple immediately cancelled their wedding plans and instead opted to have a much cheaper, low-key affair at a local courthouse. To help cover the costs for this and the huge medical bills for the cancer treatment the pair set up a gofundme account, which acts as a portal for donations. The result was astonishing. Not only did friends and family send them money, but so did members of the public touched by their story. Donors have promised the couple their dream wedding on January 24 in Topsfield .

'We are often times at a loss for words, not knowing how to begin to show our gratitude to each and every one of you. Complete strangers have been moved by our story.' The 35-year-old is desperately upset over her fiance’s diagnosis, but is determined to make the most of the time they have left together. She said: ‘I will be with him every day whether we do something fun and distracting or just sit at chemo. The pain on his face when he cries breaks me.
