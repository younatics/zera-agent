"(CNN) -- Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has entered a treatment facility, the team said Tuesday, following his arrest on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Irsay was arrested Sunday. He's charged with DWI and four counts of possession of a controlled substance. ""Yesterday, Jim Irsay took the first step toward regaining good health. He voluntarily checked into a highly respected health care facility and is committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help him meet his challenges head-on,"" the Colts said in a statement. ""Jim, the Irsay family, and the Colts organization are all deeply appreciative of the incredible outpouring of support and compassion from our fans and the Indiana community."" According to police in Carmel, Indiana, officers stopped Irsay at 11:41 p.m. Sunday in Carmel for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal. He failed roadside field sobriety tests, and a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in pill bottles, police said. The drugs reportedly were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle. Report: Irsay's behavior was alarming around Colts organization . Twitter reacts to the arrest .

"(CNN) -- Insomnia, the inability to fall or stay asleep, can make the days feel fuzzy and the nights never-ending. Insomniacs often get antidepressants instead of drugs designed to help them sleep, research has shown . The disorder can increase the risk for depression and suicidal thoughts, lower work productivity and even raise blood pressure, studies have shown. About 40 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders that prevent them from getting good rest. Singer Michael Jackson struggled with insomnia, a nutritionist who worked for him told CNN.  Sources close to Jackson told CNN that during a world tour in the mid-'90s,  the pop star traveled with an anesthesiologist who would ""take him down"" at night, then ""bring him back up."" Stress or traumatic events can trigger the sleeping disorder.  Insomnia drugs help the patient sleep, but they do not treat the underlying cause, which could be a result of another illness, life changes or shifting work schedules. And patients who seek relief for insomnia may not receive the most effective prescription. Over the last two decades, doctors treating sleep disorders have prescribed more antidepressants than insomnia drugs, according to several published analyses. And there is insufficient evidence that most antidepressants are effective in treating insomnia, concluded a National Institutes of Health panel that convened on the topic in 2005. Doctors may be factoring in cost considerations and their own familiarity with prescribing antidepressants relative to newer sleep medications, experts said. Some doctors prescribe antidepressants because their patients have both depression and insomnia. Insomnia and depression often occur together, but which is the cause and which is the symptom is often unclear. Depending on the patient's circumstances, a doctor might prescribe antidepressants as the primary treatment for insomnia; for example, if there is a history of addiction. But the Food and Drug Administration has not officially approved antidepressants for insomnia. ""There's inadequate body of information to support use of the unapproved treatment,"" said Dr. Vaughn McCall, medical director of the Sleep Center at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""I think the harm in it is the delay of effective treatment. You've made a decision to ignore the proven effective treatment and decided instead to do who knows what."" McCall said he treats an insomnia patient with sleeping drugs first.  When those options don't work, he turns to antidepressants. Sleep experts say some antidepressants can help a person sleep, but their sedating effects can wane over time. There's ""a lot of inappropriate prescribing for insomnia,"" said Rajesh Balkrishnan, the director of the Center for Medication Use, Policy, and Economics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Antidepressants could ""tranquilize you for a shorter period of time,"" about five to six hours, Balkrishnan said.  Insomnia drugs can produce deeper sleep levels for a longer period of time -- about eight to 12 hours, he said. Antidepressants balance the natural chemicals in the brain that are involved in regulating mood. The drugs can block reabsorption of the chemicals, such as serotonin, leaving more available in the brain. Side effects for antidepressants can include headache, night sweats, nausea, agitation, sexual problems and dry mouth. Sleep drugs work by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep. They carry risks of addiction and side effects such as grogginess, headaches, nausea and bizarre behavior while sleeping. There are stages of sleep, from drowsiness to progressively deeper relaxation. The entire sequence normally takes about an hour, and the fourth stage is considered the deepest. After that, people go into what's called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. After about 10 minutes into REM sleep, the brain cycles back to the four other stages (known as non-REM). The cycles repeat throughout the sleep time. The use of antidepressants to battle insomnia could be influenced by cost, since generic antidepressants cost less than brand-name insomnia drugs, doctors said. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic version of Ambien, called zolpidem, for short-term treatment of insomnia. Despite the availability of a less expensive generic version, many doctors continue to prescribe antidepressants, McCall said. Doctors might hesitate to prescribe some types of sleeping drugs because they belong to the same class of drugs, called benzodiazepines, as Xanax and Valium. These drugs can be highly addictive over chronic use.  But not all sleep drugs are benzodiazepines. A sample of 3,400 physicians' prescription practices published in the journal Sleep in 2004 showed that antidepressants were approximately 1.53 times more likely to be prescribed by American doctors than insomnia drugs. ""A lot of it is a holdover from the days where the perception was that sleeping pills would cause dependence and there would be abuse liability,"" said author James Walsh, executive director and senior scientist at the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in Chesterfield, Missouri. ""There was a feeling that they only worked for short periods of time and you develop tolerance to those medicines. Those impressions came from pills used until the 1970s."" Three of the top four most commonly prescribed drugs for insomnia were antidepressants, according to Walsh's 2004 article. Five years later, Walsh doubts many of the prescription practices have changed. ""There are still a lot of doctors prescribing antidepressants and other sedating medicine for insomnia even though those medicines haven't been studied very well for treatment of insomnia and have some different types of risks,"" Walsh said. But Balkrishnan said, ""You can't put the blame solely on prescribers,"" adding that some patients insist on certain medications and find ways to obtain those drugs, despite their doctor's best efforts. The alternative to taking pills is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which teaches the patient how to get better sleep hygiene and ways to avoid sleep-disturbing behaviors. Unlike drugs, this method has no side effects. Using anesthetics to get relief from sleep disorders is highly unusual and inappropriate, several doctors have told CNN. Jackson requested an anesthetic, saying, ""I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep,"" Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who worked for Jackson for a time, told CNN. Doctors say that if Jackson was being anesthetized to battle insomnia, it was a dangerous practice. The possible role of an anesthetic, called Diprivan -- also known as propofol -- has swirled since the pop singer's death on June 25. ""Propofol induces coma, it does not induce sleep,"" said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists.","Doctors prescribed more antidepressants for insomnia .

"(CNN) -- When her baby girl takes an afternoon nap, or on those nights when she just can't sleep, Sarah Andrews, 32, tosses off her identity as a suburban stay-at-home mom and becomes something more exotic: a ""virtual deputy"" patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border. A Texas program lets Internet users around the world monitor live video from the Mexico border. From her house in a suburb of Rochester, New York, Andrews spends at least four hours a day watching a site called BlueServo.net. There, because of a $2 million grant from the state of Texas, anyone in the world can watch grainy live video scenes of cactuses, desert mountains and the Rio Grande along Texas' portion of the international border. When Andrews spots something she deems suspicious -- perhaps a fuzzy character moving from right to left across the screen or people wading through the river with what appear to be trash bags atop their heads -- she and the site's 43,000 registered users can send e-mail messages straight to local law enforcement, who then decide whether to act. ""Today, there's a couple vehicles that are parked side by side next to each other,"" she said by phone, her 7-month-old cooing in the background, ""but I can't tell what's going on, you know?""  See sample videos from BlueServo.net » . The video site's supporters see the 15-camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border violence. Run by the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties, the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border's security across the nation's masses of Internet users. About 20 million people have clicked on BlueServo.net since it launched November 20, and the Web site has gained national attention at a time when many eyes already were focused on the southern border of the United States. Lawmakers are raising concerns about drug-related violence spilling into the United States from Mexico. And, bucking an upward trend, there has been an apparent decrease in illegal immigration into the United States because of the struggling economy, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.  Look at where the border wall is located » . The Bush administration made a number of attempts to curb illegal immigration from the south. The administration added troops to the area and also built a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border, drawing criticism from environmentalists and immigration advocates. Now, a virtual community says it's trying to fill gaps in that protection. Rob Abernethy, a 42-year-old factory worker from Lincolnton, North Carolina, said he spends 30 minutes here and there watching the border out of a sense of civic responsibility. ""It may take the efforts of many to get a small result, but that small result could be rewarding or great in the long run,"" he said. But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals. Although there have been no reports of vigilante groups using the site to make arrests, Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, a Democrat from El Paso, said the program is ""pandering to these groups to keep them politically engaged on this issue."" The program also has been widely criticized as ineffective in Texas newspaper editorials, as well as by some of the Web site's own users. Since the site was launched in late November, only four arrests can be attributed to the cameras, said Don Reay, executive director of the sheriffs' coalition, which runs the project with money from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office. All of those arrests were related to marijuana trafficking, he said, with about 2,000 pounds of the drug seized. Those aren't the kind of results planners were looking for when they started the program, but Reay says the program's unseen value is in the fact that it prevents drug-related violence and trafficking. He said sheriffs along the border have seen decreased crime in recent months, partly because of the camera program, although he said he could not cite statistics to back up that claim. Perry's office said the cameras prevent crime because they don't ""allow the bad guys to op under the cloak of darkness anymore,"" according to Katherine Cesinger, Perry's spokeswoman. The cameras spy on stretches of the Texas-Mexico border where the border patrol isn't particularly active or where the border wall hasn't been constructed, Reay said. He declined to list locations of the cameras for security reasons but said most are hidden on existing structures on private properties. He wants the program to expand ""to cover every place where we don't have a fence"" and says the primary goal of the camera program is to fight crime, not immigration. There's no evidence that security cameras would deter people from crossing the border, said Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, who specializes in immigration. ""If a person wants to come, they'll find a point at which they're willing to cross,"" he said, adding that studies show that more people are drowning and dying of dehydration in increasingly daring attempts to cross the border as security increases. Abernethy and Andrews, the two ""virtual deputies,"" said they would like to see greater transparency in the project. Both said they have e-mailed notes of suspicious activity to law enforcement, but neither has heard whether their alerts were of any help. ""It's interesting. You see different things on there, but I just -- I don't know that it's doing any good,"" said Andrews, the stay-at-home mom. ""I wonder if it's a waste of time."" She said she hopes her work as ""virtual deputy"" will prevent so many drugs from working their way north from Mexico into New York. She also said the site draws her interest because she's nosy about what's going on along Texas' 1,250-mile international border. Abernethy said he will continue to watch the cameras because he feels like he's part of an altruistic group of volunteers. Friends tease him about watching the site, he said. But he sees it as no worse than any other form of quick entertainment -- and maybe he can be of some help in the process. ""It's no different than watching 'Everybody Loves Raymond' reruns,"" he said. ""It's just something to do.""","BlueServo.net lets users watch live video from 15 cameras on Texas-Mexico border .

"Apostle Islands National Shoreline, Wisconsin (CNN) -- For thousands of years, waves on the largest of the Great Lakes have battered northwest Wisconsin, shaping the dramatic sandstone caves of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. But that punishment halted this winter when 93% of Lake Superior froze, creating a spectacular icy landscape many locals say they haven't seen in a generation. It's a serendipitous spinoff from the five Great Lakes being virtually frozen over this winter, a rare event that marks the arctic misery afflicting the Midwest. At one point, more than 90% of the world's largest surface freshwater system was frozen over, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. That figure for the Great Lakes fell to 84% as of Wednesday. The massive freeze, however, has created natural wonders. Bob Krumenaker, the National Park Service's superintendent at Lakeshore, said there have been thousands of additional visitors flocking to ice caves. ""The caves form almost the same kind of features that you'd find in an underground limestone cave -- the soda straws, the curtains, the stalactites -- but they're all forming out of ice in just days and weeks instead of something that would form underground in limestone over hundreds of thousands of years,"" he said. This season has easily been the busiest in terms of visitors: In the past two months, more than 120,000 people have made the roughly three-mile round-trip trek by foot over a frozen Lake Superior to see the ice formations and caves that will melt away in just a few weeks. Debbie Stumpf was one of the intrepid visitors Wednesday. She likened the experience to ""walking into a hall of gods."" ""How many chances do you have to lay on your back and look up at icicles?"" she said. The journey to the caves is a big part of the experience. ""I like that we have to walk so far out to get here. We've seen some really unique people out here,"" she said. Visitors have hailed from all over the world this winter, including China, Japan, Australia and Hungary, Krumenaker said. They all helped make this year the busiest in the history of the park, which received National Lakeshore status under the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1970. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","The ice caves are spectacular this winter at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore .

"(CNN) -- Italian champions Inter Milan have unveiled new signing Samuel Eto'o, with the Cameroon striker immediately being forced to deny suggestions from the Italian media that he has ever had a problem with new coach Jose Mourinho. Samuel Eto'o parades his new Inter Milan jersey after completing his move from Barcelona. Eto'o, who completed his switch from Barcelona on Monda, denied he has issues with Portuguese coach Mourinho and insists he never insulted his team's style of play after a Champions League match between Barca and Chelsea. ""I never said those words that were attributed to me,"" he told a press conference. ""There is also a tape which proves it and, in any case, that was after an intense game. Top 20 summer transfer targets . ""Now I am happy to be here, for me it is a great honor to play for a coach like Jose. It has been years that I have been trying to play under Mourinho and I have never managed it."" Mourinho also laughed off suggestions the pair do not see eye to eye, insisting they have very similar personalities. ""I have met Samuel six times in three years, and I never cared to know if he really said something not very nice about me,"" said the Nerazzurri coach. ""Why? Because he is like me: after losing an important match he doesn't go home happy. The year after this game I wanted to take him to Chelsea, but I wasn't allowed to. I am very happy to have him with us and I'm not talking only as Jose Mourinho but on behalf of the whole squad. Eto'o has signed a five-year contract with Inter as part of a swap deal that saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic move the other way. Inter will also receive 45 million euros ($64m) but the 28-year-old, who only had a season left on his contract with Barca, has shrugged off suggestions this proves Ibrahimovic is the more highly rated of the two. ""Ibra is a great player but I am Samuel Eto'o and my past and my victories talk for me,"" said Eto'o. ""I don't like parallels being drawn. ""I believe the victories I have earned until now can contribute to giving my name the right value."" Eto'o scored 125 goals in 144 games for Barcelona, firing them to a string of titles, including three leagues, two Champions Leagues and a Copa del Rey success, in his five seasons with the club. Eto'o has spent his entire career in Spain since leaving Cameroon in 1997, playing for Real Madrid, Leganes, Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona. However, he expects he will adapt easily to the Serie A style. ""It's true I have always played in Spain but I have great experience of international matches,"" continued Eto'o. ""Here in Serie A there are big players because great players are in teams where they know they will be able to win things. I am here because it is a very competitive league. ""It's true Ibra and Kaka have left Italy, but there are lots of great players in Italy and I am convinced I have made the best choice.""","Inter Milan unveil Samuel Eto'o after he completes his transfer from Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Once again a new Gallup Poll has reported that Vermont is the least religious state in the country, with only 22% of the people willing to call themselves ""very religious."" On the other side of the poll, there is Mississippi, where a whopping 61% of citizens lay claim to that self-description. But what does it really mean to be ""very religious"" and not just spiritual? I've been living in Vermont for much of my adult life, adding up to nearly four decades. And I've been keenly interested in the question of religion, having written a biography of Jesus and practiced Christianity as best I can for much of my life. I've also traveled in the South quite often, and understand where that 61% comes from: Not long ago I drove across Mississippi, and I couldn't find a secular radio station on the dial. It was all preachers, all sounding alike. Repent, repent, repent. Billboards everywhere shouted religious slogans. It seemed there was a church on every street corner in every town I passed through. So what's going on here? Do Mississippians have a direct line to the divine? Don't the majority of people of Vermont also have an interest in religion or belief in God? Is this why Vermont was the first state in the union to allow for civil unions? And does secularism run rampant here? On any given Sunday, while I'm sitting in church, many of my neighbors are out walking in the woods, skiing, or reading a book by the woodstove (it's what we do in Vermont). Indeed traditional churches in Vermont struggle to fill their pews, and one often sees churches being sold off to real estate developers, who convert them into apartments or places where secular business can take place under high ceilings that once filled with prayers. But it would be a mistake to assume the absence of the usual trappings of religion means that people in Vermont -- or anywhere, really-- aren't pondering the big questions. Religious affiliation doesn't necessarily equate with spirituality in any deep way. Indeed, when I step into my local co-operative food store in Vermont, the bulletin board is crammed with listings for local meditation groups or yoga classes or panel discussions on ""spirit and nature."" The community spirit is strong in this state, and the value of helping one's neighbor is cherished here as much as anywhere. And these values include things like spending money on education, on good health care for all, and making sure that the land itself is responsibly used, with a keen awareness of environmental consequences. Indeed, Vermont was chosen the No. 1 greenest state in a recent poll. I'm not sure that the religious fervor in Mississippi necessarily results in any of these things, For example, the state consistently ranks near the bottom in health care for low income people and environmental responsibility . For some years I've taught courses at Middlebury College on poetry and spirituality, and students often say to me: ""I'm spiritual but not religious."" They are, nevertheless, on a quest. They like to ask big questions about God, about human fulfillment, about spiritual practice in the widest possible terms. With them I explore major spiritual texts, including the Book of Psalms, ancient Taoist poems from China, Islamic poetry, and the work of such great Christian poets as John Donne, George Herbert, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and T.S. Eliot. My sense is that there is no end of genuine interest in spiritual matters among students in my neck of Vermont. Yet many of the traditional churches -- in Vermont as elsewhere -- fail to address questions of spirituality in ways that interest those who might have a deep spiritual longing but can't profess a simple faith in God or subscribe to any dogma. Jesus himself put forward the essential questions: What does it mean to live an ethical life? What is this mysterious thing called ""spirit"" and how does it relate to questions about God? How do we live, as people of faith, in communion with each other as well as God? In so many ways, Jesus was the ultimate seeker, hungry for the deepest kinds of experience. He looked for, and found, astonishing answers, inviting us to follow him in our quest. From what I can tell, God-hunger is alive and well in Vermont. But it tends to thrive outside the walls of traditional churches (though it can be found there as well, as apparently 22% of Vermonters will say). I would refer the good pollsters at Gallup back to the story of Jesus, who when asked by pesky Pharisees where the Kingdom of God could be found, said: ""Don't say, look, it's here or there! For, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."" (Luke 17:21) That's a challenging response, but it might not register as an appropriate answer on any Gallup Poll. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jay Parini.","Jay Parini: Gallup poll finds Vermont least religious state. Mississippi is most religious .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- By the time Leikia Reynolds was 12 years old, her life was heading down the wrong path. Her grandparents took her in when she was 11 months old. She didn't know her mother, and her father was serving a 16-year prison sentence. Her grandmother, Dorothy Reynolds, saw the warning signs. ""She was getting into fights. She saw other kids with parents, and she felt left out. She called me 'Mama' and my husband 'Daddy,' "" she recalls. ""She didn't feel good about herself. She was failing in math ... she didn't have good grades."" Looking back, Reynolds agrees. ""I'd just be outside every day until 12 [at night]. I'd be outside playing and being rough."" Her grandmother saw an ad for Big Brothers Big Sisters on TV and knew she had to do something. ""Leikia needed somebody in her life who was younger. ... I'm kind of sickly, and I couldn't get out with her a lot to take her places,"" she says. ""I saw a need for her to have a Big Sister to show her a better life."" Reynolds was matched with Nicole Marchand, a chief assistant district attorney in Atlanta, six years ago. Marchand learned early on the importance of giving back by watching her mother mentor co-workers and other women at their church. After graduating from law school, Marchand was ready to do the same for Reynolds. Marchand spent time with her twice a month and talked to her about making better choices. ""When you're in an environment where that's what you see, you don't know you're doing anything wrong. Leikia was reacting and behaving based on her surroundings,"" Marchand says. ""I tried to give her a different perspective by letting her see the big picture. She was doing things and not evaluating what she did. ... I would make her answer some tough questions and give her some alternatives."" Reynolds quickly learned to walk away from fights. ""When I begin getting into it with people or females, I'll call Nicole and we'll start talking about it. She'll say ignore it. Don't worry about it. Don't listen to it ... don't be feeding into that kind of stuff,"" she says. Marchand also helped Reynolds turn her grades around. She sat down with her early on to work through math problems, and she encouraged her to get tutoring and get involved in activities at school. ""I was headed down the wrong path,"" Reynolds says. ""She helped me focus on the important things in life. ... I need to focus on school. At the end of the day, all I have is school to fall back on to take care of myself."" Along with finding time to impart knowledge, Marchand tried to expose Reynolds to things she otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to. She took her to her first concert, to sporting events and even to Disney World. In 2009, when Marchand was an Atlanta Falcons cheerleader, she also encouraged Leikia to get involved in the Falcons Junior Cheerleader Program. ""It was fun to look across the field and see her,"" Marchand says. ""I would tell all the girls on my team, 'That's my mentee right there! That's Leikia!' ... It was very special for me."" But more importantly, Marchand wanted to create a special bond. ""She's more than a Big Sister. She's like my friend, my mom, everything,"" Reynolds says. ""I feel like if I was to start doing the wrong thing, I could call on her. Or she would probably call me first to get me back on track."" Now a junior at Tech High School, Reynolds has brought her grades up, she goes to tutorial to get help with biology, and she's the point guard on the basketball team. ""She's a very energetic young lady. She's a diligent worker on and off the court,"" says Brian Jones, her basketball coach and physical education teacher. ""I can tell there's a sense of accountability as it relates to her Big Sister. ... She has somebody that she's looking up to that she respects very much."" Reynolds sees how far she's come and has watched other teens get pregnant, drop out of school, get into fights and even spend time in jail. She knows her life could have gone in a similar direction if she hadn't met Marchand. ""I'd probably be at Crim [an alternative school] and just probably doing bad things, being ghetto and getting into a lot of fights all the time,"" she says. Instead, Reynolds has dreams of going to college and becoming a forensic pathologist. She's been on college tours with Marchand and with CREW Teens, a college and career readiness program. If she continues on this path, Reynolds will not only be the first in her family to go to college, but the first to graduate high school. ""I have big dreams for myself,"" Reynolds says. ""If my grandma took care of me for so long, it's time for me to return the favor. And since my dad is incarcerated, when he comes out, he'll see that I'll be the first in our family to go to college. And that I'm really doing something with my life.""","Mentor visits helped Leikia Reynolds realize that education will help her succeed .

"(CNN) -- You know, it's not like older fathers don't have enough to deal with. We have to keep that smile on our faces when the school's reading adviser mistakes us for our son's grandfather. We have to pretend not to notice how much more hair all the other dads have, how much younger their wives are and how much more well-equipped they are to coach the soccer team. That's because when they were kids, they actually played soccer, while we grew up with more '60s-like pursuits, such as baseball, stickball and smoking dope. We have to listen to people saying we're too old to keep up with our own kids, and we have to deal with the fact that they're absolutely correct. But on top of all that, every two years or so, we have to deal with another study saying that we're much more likely to produce children who have Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder and every other mental illness this side of mogo on the go go. (And we have to deal with the fact that all of the fathers of our kids' friends are way too young to catch W.C. Fields references such as ""mogo on the gogo."") Study: Children of older dads at higher risk of psychiatric disorders . A report published this week in JAMA Psychiatry confirmed this trend. It is a huge study of data about 2.6 million Swedish-born children and reveals that a guy like me, who became a father at 45 (I was 46, actually), would be three or four times more likely to have a child with autism spectrum disorder. But look. When Max was born, they told me that because of my age, he was much more likely to have autism than, say, the child of a guy who hadn't had his first prostate exam yet. They ran me through all the other things that could go wrong, which gave me great pause. It's terrible, of course, to think that we older fathers are putting our children's health at risk. Until you think about the alternative -- not having them at all. Then it gets tricky, doesn't it . Max has so far managed to survive my dotage and reach the sixth grade. I'm writing quickly because I like to be done with work at 3:30, when he gets home from school, so we can play a little catch or pingpong or even kick around a soccer ball before he starts on his homework. The thought that I might have listened to the scolds who chastised me for daring to think about having a child in my advanced years -- the thought that this boy might not have come into my life -- is utterly beyond my comprehension. I shudder to even think of Max never having been born -- and because I am a neurotic old Jew, I have to spit on the ground three times for even having written the words, like God will do whatever terrible things to us that we think or say, but then we spit three times he says, ""Oh, well, that's much better then."" Where did we come up with this stuff? As it turns out, Max does suffer from some anxiety disorder issues. Did he inherit them from me? Were they caused by my creaky old decrepit sperm, as the studies suggest, or the cultural heritage that had him born to a father so neurotic that he made his son wear a football helmet to go on the swings? Or is it just one of those things? I have no idea. But I do know this: He is lucky to have me for a dad. He is lucky not despite my age but because of it. Because I am old enough to be done with the workplace striving that used to keep me in the office until way past what would have been his bedtime, had he existed then. Because I'm content to work from home, for a much lower salary, so that I can be here to have that catch. To play that game of pingpong. And to counsel him and console him and help him come up with strategies when the anxiety gets to be too great. And yes, because I have worked all my life and am financially secure enough to get him the help that he needs -- to have him in a school that has responded incredibly well to his disorder.

"(CNN) -- Many people in Mingo County, West Virginia, likely know Rosie Crum the way that Frances Crawford does. The two women, both active in local politics, are friendly. They stop to talk when they see each other. But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners. The former sheriff, Crum's husband, was shot and killed this week. ""She's a good person,"" Crawford said about Crum. ""She's always seemed like a strong person too."" According to County Commissioner David Baisden, Crum was born and raised in Mingo County. She met her husband, Eugene Crum, when she was 14, and they married in 1975. The Crums have two children -- a son and a daughter, both grown -- and grandchildren. ""They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do, and we feel this is the right thing for us to do,"" Baisden said about Crum's appointment. She'll serve out the rest of her husband's term, which runs through the end of next year. Crum has prior no law enforcement experience, but she will have ""plenty of help,"" Baisden said. Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will ""manage the law enforcement end"" of the sheriff's department, he explained. John Mark Hubbard, president of the Mingo County Commission, said Crum's appointment is like an extension of her husband's legacy. The commission voted unanimously. ""We have the full support of the sheriff's department, right down to every man that we spoke to as a deputy, and their support for this is overwhelming. Now we ask for your support."" 'She lost everything' Crum was sworn in as sheriff on Thursday night at the county courthouse, just blocks from where her husband was shot. She did not speak, but she hugged 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, Hubbard said. Baisden said he met with Crum earlier in the day, and that she was understandably emotional. He explained another part of the rationale behind her appointment. ""She lost everything she had. She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck,"" he said. ""We told her we felt like this is the sure way that we could take care of her until she got on her feet."" An election to replace Crum is set to be held in May 2014. Whoever wins will take office on January 1, 2015. Photographs of the new sheriff on her Facebook page show a woman with an easy smile. She holds a paintbrush in one picture -- a dog, a baby and her husband tight in others. Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process. ""Everyone here in the community knows her. It's small town U.S.A., and it will help us overcome the void that's in our hearts,"" he said. ""It's just a symbolic way that we can move forward and get past this tragedy."" CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","Rosie Crum steps in for her husband after he was killed .

"(CNN) -- In the crowded slums of Lagos, Nigeria, untreated sewage mingles with the chaotic network of pipes that deliver water to the city. Those who can't afford a local borehole or a private vendor know better than to take their chances with the taps -- most preferring to go thirsty instead. That's according to Olatunbosun Obayomi, a Lagosian microbiologist and inventor who has lived in the city all his life. But now Obayomi thinks he's found a solution -- one that not only tackles the slums' sanitation issues, but creates free, clean energy in the process. ""With a cheap retrofit, household septic tanks -- the source of the sewage -- can be converted into biogas generators,"" said Obayomi, 29, whose concept has earned him a TED fellowship, a Nigerian Youth Leadership Award and growing international acclaim. ""The idea of turning waste into energy has been around for centuries. My innovation is simply applying the chemistry in a practical way by using the resources we already have,"" he explained. In most homes in Lagos, toilet waste is stored in rudimentary septic tanks beneath the ground. Here it decomposes into a poisonous compound, before being sucked out by a tanker that deposits it all in a nearby lagoon. ""Unfortunately, the system of water pipes is very disorganized, and they often pass through the same place where the sewage is dumped,"" said Obayomi. ""And it's not uncommon for poorly constructed septic tanks to leak directly into the drainage system."" But rather than attempt a wholesale overhaul of Nigeria's waste system, Obayomi's approach makes use of the existing septic tanks -- equipping them with new waste entry pipes that remove oxygen from the decaying process. As he explained: ""When excreta decompose with oxygen, it creates a useless, incombustible mixture that carries disease. But without oxygen, the germs die and the mixture produces a combustible gas."" This biogas -- a mix of carbon dioxide and methane -- can be stored in an adjacent underground chamber and used to power cooking stoves, heat homes or even generate electricity. Opinion: Tackling climate change still a luxury in developing world . ""Converting waste into biogas is a win-win strategy,"" said Sarah Butler-Sloss, founding director of the Ashden Awards, an organization that champions local energy innovations around the world. ""What makes it so elegant is that it resolves a life-threatening sanitation issue -- by treating harmful, waterborne germs -- while simultaneously creating a much-needed source of carbon-free energy,"" she said. Butler-Sloss added that recent figures from the U.N. say 1.4 billion people worldwide have no access to electricity, while 2.7 billion still prepare food on grossly inefficient and carbon-hungry open fires. ""We have seen similar projects in places like India and China -- where everything from domestic garbage to animal waste has been used to produce energy with great success ... Clearly this is the time to embrace domestically produced biogas, especially in the developing world."" It's a view shared by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Patrick Mwefigye is program officer for sustainable consumption and production at UNEP's regional office for Africa. He says that in areas where there is ""little funding, capacity or infrastructure"" for complex waste management, ""we see the production of biogas as having great potential."" At present, Mwefigye says the gas is regularly produced in just a handful of African nations. ""In Rwanda, for instance, the prisons have been fitted with large biogas generators, so that they are almost entirely self-powering,"" he said. But, although Obayomi's retrofitted biogas generator is relatively cheap to build -- requiring only low-tech materials such as plastic pipes, cement and sand -- and despite all the recognition it's attracted, only a prototype has been installed so far. Yet Obayomi conservatively estimates that the average street in Lagos could produce 1,720 liters of biogas a day -- enough for an engine-powered water pump to serve the daily domestic needs of at least 50 families. So what's the hold-up? ""Biogas generators tend to be constructed in situ,"" said Butler-Sloss, ""And while the materials are relatively cheap, they're not mass-produced like solar panels or wind-turbines so, at present, it's difficult to scale-up."" Obayomi has a different take, however. For him, it's not an issue of resources or need, but attitude. ""Although I've been filmed by government TV and won these awards, no politician has approached me to build anything. In Nigeria there is a lot of talk but very little walk,"" he lamented. There is also a problem of credibility, he said. In Obayomi's experience, the hardest place to be taken seriously as a Nigerian inventor is in Nigeria itself. ""It is a new concept for many Nigerians,"" he said. ""There's still this feeling that unless an idea or a piece of new technology comes from the West, then it's not glamorous ... it's not valid.""","Microbiologist says he has simple solution to sanitation problems in Lagos .

"(CNN) -- A Texas court granted a stay of execution for convicted murderer Henry ""Hank"" Skinner on Monday, giving Skinner time to pursue DNA testing his lawyers say could prove his innocence. Skinner had been scheduled to die by lethal injection Wednesday evening for the New Year's Eve 1993 killings of his live-in girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two adult sons in the Texas Panhandle town of Pampa. But the state Court of Criminal Appeals halted the proceeding Monday afternoon, ruling that it needed time to review the state's revised law on DNA testing. In a written statement, Skinner's lawyer, Rob Owen, said the decision ""has ensured that Mr. Skinner's request for DNA testing will receive the thorough and serious consideration it deserves."" Skinner, now 49, has strongly denied any involvement in the crime and claims that the DNA analysis of untested evidence will not only show him innocent but help determine the real killer. He came within 45 minutes of execution in March 2010 before the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in and handed him a legal reprieve. As another execution date loomed, his supporters ratcheted up the pressure on Texas officials to grant his request for DNA testing. ""Executing Mr. Skinner without testing all the relevant evidence would suggest official indifference to the possibility of error in this case and needlessly undermine public confidence in Texas's criminal justice system,"" former Texas Gov. Mark White and 16 other current and former Texas lawmakers, prosecutors and judges wrote in an October 27 letter to Gov. Rick Perry, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and Gray County District Attorney Lynn Switzer. Owen requested a 30-day reprieve from Perry's office Monday afternoon, shortly before the appeals court issued its ruling, arguing that ""substantial new evidence"" has come to light since his trial to support Skinner's claim of innocence. ""Physical evidence from the crime scene, witness accounts and expert testimony all demonstrate that Mr. Skinner was so severely impaired at the time of the murders as a result of his extreme intoxication from drugs and alcohol that he would have lacked the physical and mental coordination to perform even simple tasks, let alone commit these three murders,"" Owen wrote. DNA tests ""could resolve once and for all longstanding and troubling questions about the reliability of the verdict in his case,"" he added. And in a letter to the Dallas Morning News published Sunday, the foreman of the jury that sentenced Skinner to death urged his execution be stayed ""until all of the uncertainty is resolved."" ""Since the trial, I and many of my fellow jurors have grown increasingly concerned that key pieces of DNA evidence from the crime scene remain untested,"" the foreman, Danny Stewart, wrote. ""Either the tests confirm Skinner's guilt or prove his innocence and prevent the state from making an irreversible mistake. There is simply no downside."" Skinner admits being at the crime scene when Busby and her sons died but said he was passed out on the couch from a combination of vodka and codeine and was too intoxicated to have committed the murders. Monday's decision comes four days after the trial court denied Skinner's latest request for DNA testing on a variety of items collected by police, including vaginal swabs from Busby contained in a rape kit; clippings from her fingernails; two knives, one found on Busby's front porch and the second found in a plastic bag in the living room; a dish towel; and blood and hairs from a jacket found next to Busby's body. ""All the district attorney has got to do is turn over the evidence and test it, and let the chips fall where they may,"" Skinner told CNN's Kate Bolduan in 2009 in an interview from death row at the Polunsky Correctional Institution in Livingston, Texas. ""If I'm innocent, I go home. If I'm guilty, I die. What's so hard about that?"" A federal case in which Skinner is also seeking the testing has been put on hold pending the outcome of the state court proceedings. Texas state attorneys argued at a recent court hearing that the testing should not be conducted because there was not a reasonable probability the trial jury would have found Skinner not guilty if the testing had been done for his trial, Owen said. Switzer's office has refused comment on the case, while Perry's office referred questions last week to the attorney general's office, which also denied comment. In May 2010, two months after halting Skinner's execution, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that Skinner has a basic civil right to press for DNA analysis. But Texas prosecutors have fought the testing, claiming that Skinner is not entitled to testing of evidence not analyzed before his 1995 trial. Forensic evidence gathered at the scene, as well as witness statements, points to Skinner as the killer, they maintain. A female friend of Skinner's who lived four blocks away testified at his trial that he walked to her mobile home and told her that he may have kicked Twila Busby to death, although evidence did not show she had been kicked. The neighbor has since recanted parts of her testimony. Authorities followed a blood trail from the crime scene to the female friend's home and found Skinner in the closet, authorities said. He was ""wearing heavily blood-stained jeans and socks and bearing a gash on the palm of his right hand,"" according to the Texas attorney general's summary of the case. Authorities said cuts on Skinner's hand came from the knife used to stab the men. Skinner claimed he cut it on glass. Some DNA testing was done, which implicated Skinner, but not on the items he now wants tested. In addition to Twila Busby, also found stabbed to death were her sons Elwin ""Scooter"" Caler, 22, and Randy Busby, 20, both of whom were developmentally disabled. Busby's family, including Busby's surviving daughter, believes Skinner is guilty. But they also have pressed state officials to do the forensic testing, saying it would end the years-long delay while Skinner has pressed his legal claims.","Henry ""Hank"" Skinner was scheduled for execution Wednesday in Texas .

"(CNN) -- Thirteen nuns and three workers kidnapped in late November from a Greek Orthodox monastery in Syria were freed Sunday, a pro-Syrian government news network and Lebanese state media reported. A convoy of around 30 vehicles picked up the nuns and workers in one part of Syria and took them into Lebanon, the country's National News Agency reported late Sunday. The convoy traveled through Lebanon to another border crossing into Syria, the hillside village of Jdaidet Yabous. There, the group will be met by Greek Orthodox church officials, who will welcome them back into Syria, Syrian state news agency SANA reported. The convoy was at one point delayed several hours for ""logistical reasons"" but later resumed en route to Jdaidet Yabous, Public Security Director Gen. Abbas Ibrahim told NNA. When they did arrive overnight, the nuns -- some smiling, some solemn and at least one of whom appeared to be being carried -- were mobbed by an enthusiastic crowd that included church officials. Ibrahim said that no money was paid to secure the release of the nuns, adding that it was part of a deal in exchange for 150 females that the Syrian government was holding. Qatari intelligence chief Saadeh Kobeisi reportedly crossed deep into Syrian territory to obtain the release of the Syrian nuns. He crossed into Syria as part of a Lebanese Internal Security delegation, the state news agency said. Senior Orthodox Bishop Lucas al-Khoury earlier Sunday spoke to pro-Syrian government Ikhbariya television. He stood on the Syrian side of the border hoping to greet the nuns and said the negotiations for their release took several months because the kidnappers ""made false requests intended to stall the process."" The Greek Orthodox figure, who often speaks out on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, added that the recent Syrian troop offensive on the opposition stronghold of Yabroud worked in favor of the nuns' release. Days after the kidnapping, SANA reported that armed terrorists took the nuns, implying that rebels fighting to oust al-Assad were behind the attack. The chief of an opposition group based in London told CNN he had confirmed that al-Nusra Front fighters abducted the nuns, but Rami Abdurrahman said the fighters did so to protect them from what the group believed would be an impending attack by Syrian government forces. CNN could not confirm Abdurrahman's account of why the nuns were taken from the Monastery of Saint Tecla in the predominantly Christian village of Maaloula, about 40 miles west of Damascus. Abdurrahman leads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in Great Britain. The U.S. State Department has designated the al-Nusra Front a terrorist organization with links to al Qaeda. Christians make up about 10% of the population of Syria, but Christianity has a rich history there. Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River, and some people believe it was in a location now along a part of modern-day Syria. Some of the earliest relics were found there. And Maaloula, in the Qalamoun Mountains, is one of the last places where the ancient Aramaic that Jesus spoke is still the main language. Many of Syria's Christians support the al-Assad government, fearing that an end to his presidency could lead to instability and an Islamist power grab. Meanwhile, on Sunday four rescue workers who rushed to help survivors of a barrel bomb attack in the city of Aleppo became victims themselves when more of the crude explosive devices were dropped by government helicopters, according to the Aleppo Media Center, a communication outlet run by rebels fighting to oust al-Assad. At least 14 are reported dead in that incident, the outlet said. In another neighborhood Sunday, rescue workers recovered the bodies of a husband, wife and five children ranging in ages from 5 to 14, the outlet reported. A barrel bomb had apparently leveled their home, it said. The attack killed at least 10 people total and destroyed six residential buildings, the outlet reported. The father of one child victim wept and flailed his arms against his body as he cried, ""Where is my son, my Hamoudi? They buried them alive. Oh God, they buried them alive!"" a video on YouTube shows.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant could be sidelined for up to nine months after tearing his Achilles tendon, the team said Saturday. The injury happened Friday against the Golden State Warriors. An MRI later confirmed the tear. ""Bryant elected to have surgery to repair the torn left Achilles tendon,"" the team said. ""The successful surgery was performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache and Dr. Stephen Lombardo of the Kerlan Jobe Orthopaedic Group. Recovery time is expected to be a minimum of six to nine months."" A ruptured Achilles could take up to a year to heal, according to Will Carroll, sports injuries lead writer for Bleacher Report. Bryant has previously said that next season could be his last in the NBA. This is the 16th season in the league for the 34-year-old. Asked if the timetable means Bryant will be back next season, trainer Gary Vitti said on Twitter ""that's the plan."" Bryant reacted with disappointment on social media after the injury. On his Facebook page he posted a lengthy update: . ""This is such BS! All the training and sacrifice just flew out the window with one step that I've done millions of times! The frustration is unbearable. The anger is rage. Why the hell did this happen ?!? Makes no damn sense. Now I'm supposed to come back from this and be the same player Or better at 35?!? How in the world am I supposed to do that?? ""I have NO CLUE. Do I have the consistent will to overcome this thing? Maybe I should break out the rocking chair and reminisce on the career that was. Maybe this is how my book ends. Maybe Father Time has defeated me."" Later, Bryant called the injury the first step in a new challenge. ""One day, the beginning of a new career journey will commence. Today is NOT that day,"" he wrote. The post received more than 136,000 likes. According to an earlier tweet from the Lakers, Bryant could tell what the injury was before seeing a doctor. ""I was just hoping it wasn't what I thought it was,"" Bryant said, according to the tweet. The Lakers have two games left in the regular season, both at home. They face the San Antonio Spurs on Sunday and the Houston Rockets on Wednesday. After beating the Warriors 118-116, the team is one game ahead of the Utah Jazz for the final spot in the NBA's Western Conference playoffs. Bryant is the NBA's fourth all-time leading scorer, and he currently ranks among the top three in the NBA in scoring this season, averaging 27.3 points. This season, he has averaged 5.6 rebounds, a team-high 6.0 assists, 1.36 steals and 38.6 minutes in 78 games.","NEW: Bryant has ""successful"" surgery to repair the tendon .

"Editor's note: Ed Foster is the associate editor of Motor Sport magazine. He is also an F1 pundit for CNN's World Sport show and writes blogs for CNN.com International. (Motor Sport) -- Nigel Mansell called it people power, others just call it home advantage. Andy Murray at Wimbledon, Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford and -- this weekend -- Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Paul di Resta at Silverstone: they have the crowd behind them, they can hear the cheers from the stands, see the caps, banners and flags bearing their names. Mansell was so popular with (most of) the British public that he even started his own movement, ""Mansell Mania,"" which peaked at Silverstone in 1987. ""Our Nige"" -- never one to let an ailment or problem go unnoticed -- was suffering from a severe wheel vibration by lap 12. 'Last dinosaur' or F1's brainiest man? It only got worse and soon he was running five seconds behind teammate Nelson Piquet. The Williams team wasn't planning to do any pit stops, but Mansell dived in to change the offending wheel. He emerged 29 seconds off the lead. The fans were distraught -- there wouldn't be a repeat performance of Mansell's win the year before at Brands Hatch -- but he was suddenly flying. ""I think I broke the lap record 11 times in the last 15 laps,"" he said at the time. He was soon up on the back of Piquet and sold a dummy that Cristiano Ronaldo would have been proud of with only two laps to go. Tires take center stage in F1 . His second -- of four -- British Grand Prix wins was complete. The crowd went mad and surged onto the track, so Mansell had to come to a grinding halt on his slowing down lap to avoid running any of them over. Mansell always believed the fans gave him extra power, that extra quarter of a second a lap. It may seem ridiculous, but four of his 31 Formula One wins came on home turf in front of one of the most passionate crowds in the world. Okay, not much comes close to the tifosi at Monza, bedecked in Prancing Horses, but Silverstone is up there. Of course, not everyone shares the same view. British motorbike rider Cal Crutchlow looked a little bemused when posed the question of whether the fans gave him ""extra power"" ahead of his MotoGP race at Silverstone on June 17 this year. ""I don't know ... What? Like Uri Geller with his spoon? If he really thinks about it, it bends..."" he said smiling. Injured female F1 driver's family touched by support . ""I'll tell you what, hopefully all the fans can all sit in the stands on the weekend and think that I can have a podium or something like that and it might happen. ""But seriously you have to treat it like it's any other race when you're on the track."" Two days after this he went out and broke his ankle in practice. Come race day he started at the back of the grid -- with said broken ankle -- and stormed through the field to finish an incredible sixth, overtaking Ducati's former world champion Nicky Hayden on the last lap. So what of the modern F1 drivers? It doesn't make for great reading if you're Button/Hamilton/di Resta and hoping for a win this weekend in front of the 100,000-strong crowd. Sebastian Vettel -- 0 German Grand Prix wins. Mark Webber -- 0 Australian Grand Prix wins. Button -- 0 British Grand Prix wins. Hamilton -- one British Grand Prix win. Fernando Alonso -- one Spanish Grand Prix win (and one win in the European Grand Prix in Valencia this year, which took him to the top of the championship standings). The only man to have serious success on home soil is Michael Schumacher with four German Grand Prix wins, behind only compatriot Rudolf Caracciola -- who won it six times between 1926-39. But seven-time world champion Schumacher has won a record 91 grands prix and it's no surprise the 43-year-old managed four of those at Hockenheim, plus five victories when the European Grand Prix was held at the Nurburgring. However, he has finished ninth and eighth at the German GP since returning from retirement with Mercedes. This weekend most people's money is on Vettel. Before his Red Bull gave way in the last race, he was streets ahead in Valencia. No way anyone was going to catch him. Alonso may have won fantastically in front of his home crowd, but he was cautious afterwards. ""Red Bull is fast"" echoed round the paddock. McLaren, though, has been throwing the kitchen sink, and many millions, at its 2012 challenger in order to close the gap. And with the unpredictability this season has produced there's no need to write off either Button -- who has always been dogged by bad luck in his home grand prix -- or his fellow former world champion Hamilton. Also, there's always that home advantage, but maybe that's just a load of rubbish? We'll see for ourselves on Sunday.","British Grand Prix at Silverstone is home race for Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton .

"(CNN) -- As we approach the Christmas and Hanukkah season, we should remember that the American commercial republic, too often criticized for greed and excess, is unparalleled in generosity. Canadian radio commentator Gordon Sinclair said in the 1970s, at the height of American criticism abroad, that the United States is the ""most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the Earth."" We are still the most generous people in the world today. Often the benefactors of American generosity capture it best. ""There is a reason the world always looks to America,"" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said in an address to Congress this year. ""Your city on a hill cannot be hidden. Your brave and free people have made you the masters of recovery and reinvention."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a separate address to Congress this year, echoed the sentiments, ""Providence entrusted the United States to be the guardian of liberty. All people who cherish freedom owe a profound debt of gratitude to your great nation."" The critics of the American capitalist system are many, but when disaster strikes, the world still turns to America. One thinks most recently of Japan and Haiti. Not only did the United States send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, but it also sent troops, food, water and medical supplies. We remember the moving picture of ""Thank you USA"" etched in the mud next to a rescue helicopter landing circle in Japan. In surveys taken around the world, the United States is most popular in Africa, a continent we've given billions of dollars to help fight AIDS, starvation and other diseases. But we also donate more than money (and the U.S. foreign aid budget is the topic of much debate, and rightfully so). Generations of Americans have sacrificed their lives to fight and die for freedom around the world. At home, with budget cuts affecting families, corporations and the government, Americans are still remarkably charitable. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, which tracks the corporate giving of America's largest companies, recently reported that in 2010, a very tough financial year, total cash donations by this group rose 13%, to $4.9 billion. In 2010, Kroger, the Cincinnati supermarket operator, gave away an astounding 10.9% of its $589 million in 2009 pre-tax profits, totaling $64 million. Wal-Mart Stores donated the most cash last year, $319 million. As for individuals, a new American Red Cross poll suggests that while Americans had to tighten their budgets in 2011, they are still as committed to giving to charity as ever. American generosity is not dependent on the government or public policy. It should be pointed out that conservatives, criticized by liberals as health care and welfare slashers and greedy capitalists, give far more to charity than liberals. Arthur Brooks wrote in his now-famous book, ""Who Really Cares,"" that households headed by conservatives give 30% more to charity than households headed by liberals. Conservatives also give more blood and donate more of their time to volunteer work, according to Brooks. Generosity is in no way demanded or required by our Constitution or laws, yet it is an inherent part of America's cultural fabric. Compared to the rest of the world, American benevolence is unmatched. China, which boasts the second largest economy in the world, is one of the least generous nations on Earth when it comes to charitable contributions. In the annals of human history, there has never been a country as compassionate and generous as the United States. When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the great Russian novelist who defied communism, visited America, he said, ""The United States has long shown itself to be the most magnanimous, the most generous country in the world. Wherever there is a flood, an earthquake, a fire, a natural disaster, an epidemic, who is the first to help? The United States. Who helps the most and unselfishly? The United States."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","The U.S. is unparalleled in generosity, says William J. Bennett .

"(CNN) -- What would be the most sensible way for a city to make use of its old and disused metro stations? Maybe they could be given a lick of paint and put back into service. Or how about rebranding them to drag in tourists with ghoulish yarns of haunted catacombs? In the French capital of Paris, one mayoral candidate has raised the possibility of sprucing up a station that has lain idle since 1939 with elaborate swimming pools, nightclubs and art installations. See also: London's multi-story luxury basements . Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, the center-right candidate of the UMP party, has commissioned a series of arresting illustrations displaying how Arsenal, one of the city's so-called ghost metro stops, could be used. If she becomes mayor, Kosciusko-Morizet has said she will ask Parisians for their own ideas on how to transform the vacant the subterranean spaces. Alongside the aquatic and artistic options, which have been created by the Paris-based firms Oxo architectes and LaisnÃ© Architecte, the mock-ups also include images of the station being converted into a theater and a restaurant. In total, there are 16 disused metro stations beneath the streets of Paris with most closed between the 1930s and 1970s. A small number were also built but have never been used. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties .

"(CNN) -- Last week, in her opinion piece titled ""GOP's slick Black History ads fall short, miss the point,"" Andra Gillespie praised the Republican National Committee's recent Black History Month ads as a positive development, but she criticized us because those ads ""were not enough."" She's right. They're not enough, and we never suggested they were. In fact, the ads, titled ""Honoring Our Past, Building the Future,"" are just part of our Black History Month tribute, which in turn is just part of our year-round, nonstop engagement efforts with black voters and communities across the country. Following the release of the RNC's Growth and Opportunity Project report last spring, the RNC, under Chairman Reince Priebus' leadership, set out to do things differently in the way it engages with minority voters. The need was especially urgent in my community, the black community. It's there, in the black community, where we have the most ground to make up. In less than a year, the RNC has made strides to restart the conversation and build a presence in black communities across the country. As Priebus noted at our second annual Black Republican Trailblazer Awards, we've hired black engagement state directors ""from Michigan to Louisiana, Virginia to Colorado and in between."" The RNC is hiring people who are from the community to work in the community, so they can get to know people and build relationships. These efforts are critical because people, regardless of background, don't always care what you know until they know that you care. Growing the party and recruiting the next generation of black Republicans require that we build relationships in places we haven't always been. Now, I'll be the first to admit that even that is not enough. But it's a big start in a short period of time and a major step in the right direction. The RNC recognizes that no matter how significant our efforts, we can't do it alone, but we do want to set an example for our fellow Republicans. In November, Priebus traveled to Detroit and hosted a round-table discussion with black business and community leaders at which he shared the party's vision for reviving our urban centers. The response was phenomenal. Many Republicans have stepped up to take similar actions, including House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Sens. Rand Paul, Rob Portman and Marco Rubio. They've shown they're serious about growing the party and addressing voters' concerns through policy proposals, listening sessions and visits to communities across the county. We're happy to see that these Republicans realize the importance of engagement efforts not only for the sake of our party but for the future of our country. Unfortunately, when our efforts get discussed, it seems like they are always viewed only through the lens of political tactics. But the very reason that Republicans seek to hold office is because we know that our principles, if properly applied, will improve lives by empowering people and communities. This includes offering parents a choice as to where their children go to school and fighting for adults who need jobs now. So while I appreciate Andra bringing attention to our efforts, I hope she'll take the time to consider the breadth and depth of our engagement efforts in the black community. I hope she wasn't ignoring them for the sake of diminishing our work to score political points. Regardless, the hard work continues, because no matter what, it's never enough. As long as there are voters who we haven't heard from or that haven't heard from us, there's work to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Orlando Watson.","Orlando Watson says Republicans stepping up outreach to the black community .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden doesn't typically leave much off the table. But, in a wide-ranging interview with Kate Bolduan on CNN's ""New Day,"" he had more to say than we've heard yet on everything from immigration and midterm elections to the most popular question of any political interview these days -- plans for 2016. Here's what we learned from the interview: . Biden says presidential decision will come in summer 2015 . 1. A task force isn't just a task force: He's the Vice President in an administration resorting to executive action to keep itself relevant after what has become a long list of bruising losses since Democrats lost their pull in Congress in 2010. When Bolduan asked Biden what could really come out of his new role as head of a jobs task force, he defended himself: ""Some of the stuff we did, major change came out. The Recovery Act and a whole range of other things."" Lackluster response, you say? It's easy to think back to the 2013 State of the Union address -- where he rose with the President to grand applause as Obama said: ""The families of Newtown deserve a vote."" This, of course, followed by a Biden-led task force that was followed with, yes, a vote. But a vote that failed. So, what's the point here? This is something he thinks he can accomplish, is passionate about and will translate to voters. If anything, he is arguing that a vice president who has run twice for the presidency is not worth writing off -- just yet. 2. Biden wants to give Boehner a break: House Speaker John Boehner may have come out putting the ax to immigration reform for this year, but Biden isn't ready to give up yet. Biden said Boehner is ""getting, understandably, not a criticism, a great deal of pressure from the right that wants no part of this. I think he'll work his way through this. I still think we can get this done. It doesn't take much time."" More importantly, he said the administration doesn't want to ""create more problems for John Boehner."" Inside Politics: Boehner says 'never mind' on immigration . ""I think no matter what we said, it would impact the internal dynamic and politics in the Republican caucus. We should let them figure their caucus out,"" the Vice President said. So, whether he is a self-proclaimed optimist or just highly unrealistic, there's an element here of understanding after what seems to be years of deadlock and impasse. But, does this leave enough room for Republicans to come back to the table? We'll see. 3. Biden still is the popular kid -- just maybe not on the campaign trail: Biden is completely aware that the President and some of his policies have seen some record unpopularity over the past few months. And, just as he and the President are set to address the House Democratic retreat next week, he tells us exactly how big of a role they'll play when it all comes down to the wire next fall. Biden to campaign for Florida Democrat in tight House race . ""I've been invited to go into well over 128 races so far. And so there are some places the President is considerably more popular than I am, but there's some places where I can go in and the President can't,"" he said. ""There are some places where it makes no sense for me to go in or for the President to go in."" Regardless, his shining optimism prevails: ""I think we are in the best shape we can be, because the American public agrees with us on the issues."" Source: Obama to stay away from some Senate races . 4. Classic Biden: What one might call a gaffe, others might call it a gift. Biden says what he feels, when he feels like it, at little expense. The best examples come from our interview and remarks he made preceding it. Biden said the ""one overwhelming reason"" not to run for president would be the chance to get back behind the wheel of his Corvette: ""I'd like to get that Z06 with 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds."" When Bolduan asked about the Corvette comment, he said, ""Now you've hit my sweet spot."" This, on top of calling New York's LaGuardia Airport a ""third world country"" as part of the ""embarrassing"" and ""stupid"" infrastructure left in America. He is treading a line that has become so critical to any politician repeatedly thrust into the spotlight. Biden: LaGuardia like a 'third-world country' So, what's the cost? Everything he says could show up in an opponent's campaign ads. Then, what's the gain? No one said it better than CNN's John King on ""New Day"" Friday morning: ""Joe Biden is a BFD in politics for a reason -- he's the gift that keeps on giving."" He went on to say, ""Love him or hate him, what you see is what you get."" 5. Joe Biden wants to be president: Last, and as noted above most important to the immediate news cycle and onward: Biden said he can't give a good reason not to run for president. There is no ""obvious reason."" Parsing Biden's words: If Hillary runs, he won't . But some would remind Biden of a couple: Hillary Clinton is burying him in many of the most recent polls. Healthcare.gov could haunt him in any future political endeavor to come. (Yes, Joe -- health care is a BFD, but the D is still to be determined.) But we know one thing for sure -- summer 2015 is when we'll get our answer. What would Democrats do without Clinton in 2016? Watch New Day weekdays at 6am-9am ET.

"(CNN) -- Some house important corporate meetings; others are family homes. Some are gearing up to welcome top athletes while others open their doors to school children each day. But all these buildings have one thing in common: This year they have won coveted architecture awards for innovative design and construction methods and for promoting sustainability. CNN puts the global spotlight on a handful of buildings that have been recognized not only for their good looks but for their green credentials too. Casa Locarno -- Locarno, Switzerland . Overlooking Lago Maggiore in Switzerland, Casa Locarno was designed by Designyougo and insulated to low energy standards. Instead of using conventional heating, solar collectors on the roof provide energy for the low temperature under-floor heating, as well as for hot water during most months of the year. Award: Green Good Design 2011 . Swarovski Headquarters -- Lake Zurich, Switzerland . Located on the eastern shore of the Lake Zurich in Switzerland, the transparent building houses some 500 staff of crystal manufacturer Swarovski. The low-energy, horseshoe-shaped structure uses water from the nearby lake for heating and cooling. Award: Green Good Design 2011 . OS House -- Racine, Wisconsin, United States . This LEED Platinum-certified family house, located in the town of Racine on the edge of Lake Michigan, was built by Johnsen Schmaling Architects to achieve maximum natural cross-ventilation and make the most of its solar exposure. It features a compact structured plumbing system with low-flow fixtures on taps and shower heads and an on-demand hot water circulating pump. Award: AIA 2011 COTE Top Ten Green Projects . Velodrome -- London, United Kingdom . Sitting at the north of London's Olympic Park, the Velodrome will open its doors this summer to welcome thousands of track cycling fans during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by Hopkins Architects and built to be lightweight and efficient to reflect the design of a bicycle, it is is one of the most sustainable Olympic Park venues. Strategically positioned roof lights allow the use of abundant daylight, while openings in the venue's external timber cladding help to achieve natural ventilation. Award: RIBA . FUSMH -- Madison, Wisconsin, United States . The First Unitarian Society Meeting House was designed by the Kubala Washatko Architects and is a 20,000-square-foot addition to the historic Meeting House in Madison, Wisconsin. The LEED-Gold certified building is about 40% more efficient than a comparable building that doesn't contain the same innovations. Carbon dioxide sensors trigger a ventilation system that provides energy savings when spaces are not occupied, while more than 90% of regularly-occupied areas are daylit. Award: AIA 2011 COTE Top Ten Green Projects . House in Shimogamo -- Kyoto, Japan . ""To be able to see green from every room."" This was the request made to designers, Edward Suzuki Associates, of this two-storied building, in the northern part of Kyoto, Japan. The modern house features a circular screen of frosted glass, behind of which there is a green zone that strikes a pleasant contrast to the industrialized material. Award: Green Good Design 2011 . Sandal Magna School -- Wakefield, United Kingdom . This community primary school in Wakefield is one of the most carbon-efficient schools in the United Kingdom. Inside, all services and building elements are visible and make the school itself a valuable tool for teaching about sustainability. Sarah Wigglesworth Architects made sure that ecological features include completely natural ventilation through wind towers and on-site energy generation for heating and cooling. Award: RIBA . Livestrong Foundation -- Austin, Texas, United States . This 1950s-era warehouse, which previously had no windows, was ""adaptively reused"" by Lake|Flato Architects and transformed into a LEED Gold-certified building. Nearly 90% of the materials from the demolition of the old building were recycled and used in the new structure. As part of the changes, the workers put windows in the roof that harvest Texas' ample daylight for the main workspace. Award: AIA 2011 COTE Top Ten Green Projects . Ixsir Winery -- Basbina, Lebanon . Overlooking Basbina in northern Lebanon, this winery combines a restored 400-year-old feudal house with a modern-built, green-skinned (walls or roof of any building that have green capability e.g. they could have plants growing in them) structure. Designed by Raed Abillama Architects, its cellar spaces are buried within the ground as a thermal sponge, creating the needed equilibrium of temperature and humidity. Award: Green Good Design 2011 . Park Hotel Hyderabad -- Hyderabad, India . This five-star luxury boutique hotel in Hyderabad, India, achieved the first LEED Gold certification for a hotel in India in 2010 and was designed by SOM. The project is distinctive for its implementation of sustainable design strategies, with special focus on daylighting: Perforated and embossed metal screens over a high-performance glazing system allow ample diffused daylight to enter the interior spaces. Award: Green Good Design 2011 . Cherokee Studios -- Los Angeles, United States . This mixed-use housing project in LA was designed by Brooks + Scarpa Architects to make the most of the the mild local climate with passive cooling strategies of cross-ventilation and thermal convection. The entire regularly-occupied building area is daylit and can also be ventilated with operable windows. Award: AIA 2011 COTE Top Ten Green Projects . Marco Polo Tower -- Hamburg, Germany . Designed by Behnisch Architeckten, the Marco Polo Tower brings together a high-end residential project with a holistic ecological building concept. The recessed facades are protected from direct sun by the carefully designed projecting balconies, vacuum collectors on the roof using a heat exchanger turn heat into a cooling system for the apartments. Solar collectors on the roof provide the necessary energy to warm water for the apartments and the communal fitness area. Photograph by Roland Halbe.

"(CNN) -- Upon being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs put off surgery for nine months against the advice of his doctors while he tried to treat the disease with a special macrobiotic diet -- a decision he later regretted, his biographer said. When asked why he didn't have the surgery right away, Jobs said, ""I didn't want my body to be opened,"" according to an interview with the biographer, Walter Isaacson, that aired Sunday on CBS News' ""60 Minutes."" By the time Jobs was finally operated on, the cancer had spread to the surrounding tissue, Isaacson said. But his mortality also motivated Jobs, who died October 5, to create some of Apple's boldest products in his final years, Isaacson told CBS's Steve Kroft. ""He talked a lot to me about what happened when he got sick and how it focused him,"" said Isaacson, in a transcript of the show provided by CBS News. ""He said he no longer wanted to go out, no longer wanted to travel the world. He would focus on the products. He knew the couple of things he wanted to do, which was the iPhone and then the iPad. He had a few other visions. I think he would've loved to have conquered television."" Isaacson's book, ""Steve Jobs,"" goes on sale Monday. In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, Isaacson described Jobs as a driven, eccentric and sometimes cruel man who grew more reflective and fatalistic in his later years. ""I saw my life as an arc and that it would end, and compared to that nothing mattered,"" Jobs told him in one recorded interview. ""You're born alone, you're going to die alone. And does anything else really matter? I mean, what is it exactly is it that you have to lose, Steve? You know? There's nothing."" Adopted as a baby, Jobs recalled as a child once confronting his parents in tears about why his real parents had rejected him. His parents sat him down and said, ""No, you don't understand. We specifically picked you out."" ""He said, 'From then on, I realized that I was not -- just abandoned. I was chosen. I was special,' "" Isaacson said. ""And I think that's the key to understanding Steve Jobs."" Always something of a rebel, Jobs often thought the usual rules didn't apply to him, Isaacson said. He went through a period as a young man where he didn't bathe regularly -- his managers at Atari made him work the night shift because his co-workers complained about his body odor -- and drove a Mercedes with no license plate because he didn't want people tracking him. Jobs also was a Buddhist and a spiritual person whose religious beliefs were altered by his cancer diagnosis, Isaacson said. ""I remember sitting in his backyard in his garden one day and he started talking about God. He said, 'Sometimes I believe in God, sometimes I don't. I think it's 50-50 maybe. ""But ever since I've had cancer, I've been thinking about it more. And I find myself believing a bit more. I kind of -- maybe it's 'cause I want to believe in an afterlife. That when you die, it doesn't just all disappear. The wisdom you've accumulated. Somehow it lives on.' "" Isaacson's book is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors and colleagues. Simon & Schuster says that although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over what was written nor the right to read it before it was published. Isaacson, a former chairman of CNN and the former managing editor of Time magazine, which shares a parent company with CNN, has written biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. The 656-page Jobs book retails for $35.","Walter Isaacson talks about his upcoming Steve Jobs book on CBS' ""60 Minutes""

"(CNN) -- For some, a Twix bar is the delicious chocolate-caramel candy with a cookie crunch. But for Robert McKevitt, a Twix cost him his job and, he says, his house and girlfriend. On October 22, McKevitt, a veteran, was working his shift as a forklift operator at Polaris Industries' plant in Milford, Iowa. It was a temp job that he had secured thanks, in part, to a government program that gives companies tax credits for hiring veterans. McKevitt, 27, toured Kosovo and Afghanistan as part of the Army National Guard. ""It was about halfway into my shift and I had a few extra minutes. I was going to the restroom and the vending machine was next to it,"" McKevitt told CNN by phone from his brother's home in Spirit Lake, Iowa. ""I was going to grab a candy bar and then go to the restroom."" McKevitt said Thursday he was riding his forklift and as he approached the restroom he noticed the vending machine was a few feet from the wall. ""I thought it was a safety hazard,"" he said. ""I don't know why I decided I wanted a candy bar, but I did. So I put in a dollar and it spun like it was going to give out the candy bar, but it didn't. It got hung up on the spiral thing that ejects the candy bar."" What happened next is a matter of debate between McKevitt, Polaris Industries and a judge. According to a legal decision filed by an administrative judge with Iowa Workforce Development, McKevitt was involved in ""misconduct."" The document, the result of an unemployment claim appeal filed by McKevitt, contains a statement from a Polaris representative saying that McKevitt ""was observed by a supervisor lifting a candy machine about one to two feet off the ground with a forklift and then dropping the machine to the ground, which he repeated fix or six times."" ""When confronted,"" it reads, ""he had gotten about three candy bars out of the machine, and he claimed he had only shaken the machine to get out the candy bars that he had paid for that had not dropped on their own. As a result of this conduct, the employer discharged the claimant."" Though he was fired in October, and the judge denied his unemployment claim in December, the Des Moines Register covered McKevitt's story Wednesday, pushing it into national headlines. McKevitt told CNN his version of what happened after the Twix got stuck. ""I tried shaking it by hand, but it didn't do anything. Then I tried putting in another dollar and nothing happened. I could see the candy bar dangling and I was already having a rough day. My girlfriend was nine months' pregnant and it was rough,"" recalled McKevitt. ""I shook the machine and the candy bar dropped so I was happy about that. But then I was upset that I had spent two dollars on a 90-cent candy bar,"" he said. ""Then I took it upon myself to move the machine back with the forklift."" At this point, McKevitt said, a supervisor showed up and assumed the worst. ""It may have looked like I was stealing candy bars, but the machine stole money from me,"" he said. The next day, according to McKevitt, he met with human resources and his supervisors to discuss the incident and a day later he was suspended, pending an investigation. ""I was fired two days after my daughter ... was born,"" he said. After he was fired, the financial stress proved too much for McKevitt. His relationship with the mother of his daughter ended and, unable to make rent payments, McKevitt moved out of his house and in with his brother. McKevitt filed for unemployment, which Polaris denied. ""At that point I realized no one was going to hear my part of the story,"" said McKevitt, who filed an appeal with Iowa Workforce Development, including a 17-page letter detailing his side of the story. But, as bad luck would have it, McKevitt says he never got the notice for his hearing, so he skipped it. Only after his benefits were denied in appeal did he realize he had missed his chance to set the record straight. ""I had to take a job at Walmart making about half of what I was making at Polaris. I'm making just under $9 an hour and before I was making about $16 an hour,"" McKevitt said. ""This issue was blown way out of proportion.""","Robert McKevitt, 27, was fired from Polaris Industries' plant in Milford .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb at a military base has killed at least 10 people in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, in the latest violence to wrack the cradle of the North African country's uprising. The blast occurred as new graduates left a technical school at the base, Libya's state news agency LANA reported, quoting a military source in the city. The car was loaded with a large amount of explosives, it added. Speaking on Libyan television, Ammar Mohammed, a spokesman for the Libyan Health Ministry, said the bombing killed at least 10 people and wounded 23. LANA said at least seven soldiers were killed and nine people were wounded. Benghazi is where the 2011 uprising against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi began. Three years later, it is the scene of almost daily attacks and targeted assassinations, specifically against security officials. While no one has claimed responsibility for the violence that has gripped the city for more than a year, many residents and officials blame it on Islamist extremist groups operating in eastern Libya. Benghazi is the largest city in eastern Libya, where some groups want more autonomy and a greater share of the region's oil wealth. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","The blast occurred as new graduates left a technical school at the base, news agency says .

"(CNN) -- Tennis legend and openly gay athlete Billie Jean King has been named as part of the presidential delegation to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, . King, a 2009 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor, was initially named as part of the opening ceremony delegation but had to pull out because her mother was ill. Russia has faced widespread criticism over its position on gay rights since passing an anti-gay propaganda law last year, which bans anyone from speaking positively about homosexuality in the hearing of children. In a commentary for CNN in January, King said the decision to include openly gay men and women in the presidential delegation to Sochi was perhaps a statement by the United States. ""While I am not planning to protest or demonstrate, I am concerned with the treatment of the LGBT community in Russia and throughout the world. I want the LGBT community living in Russia to know they are not alone and I hope others realize this is not only a gay rights issue, but a global concern for human rights and equality,"" she wrote. ""As I said when I was named to the U.S. delegation, I hope these Olympics will be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people."" The closing ceremony takes place on February 23. President Barack Obama also named Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul to the delegation, as well as former gold medal Olympians Bonnie Blair and Eric Heider, a White House statement said. The delegates will watch some events and meet U.S. athletes as well as attend the final ceremony.

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- High above the beaches in Rio de Janeiro's hillside slums, you can get some of the best views in town. And now, they come from some of the cheapest rooms as well. With the World Cup less than four months away, residents in many once infamous favelas are opening their doors to tourists, renting beds, rooms or even entire houses, and building youth hostels. ""If you want to see the World Cup, see some football matches and experience true Brazilian life you should really check this out,"" says Michael Blommers, a Dutch backpacker staying at a hostel in the Vidigal shantytown. Beds at hostels in Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, which usually go for around $40 a night, are expected to cost as much as $400 during the World Cup. Hotels are even more expensive, with many requiring multiple-night stays. But a bunk at Alto Vidigal Hostel will set guests back just $65 -- four times the usual price, but still a relative bargain. Of course, visitors staying in Rio's favelas will likely be confronted with more than just a modest room. Garbage in these areas often piles up along the roads, while electricity, water and sewage services are spotty at best. Transportation can be precarious. The biggest concern, though, is security. Just a few years ago, Rio's favelas were controlled by drug lords. Police have since stormed many of them, in a process dubbed ""pacification,"" driving out armed gangs in an effort to make it relatively safe for residents and visitors. But they've had mixed results. Periodic gun battles continue in many favelas. Just last week, drug traffickers shot at police posts in Rocinha, one of the biggest shantytowns in Rio. Maria Clara dos Santos says she could hear the recent shootouts from her terrace. She rents rooms in her bright yellow house to foreign tourists and says safety depends on knowing where not to go and following rules. ""Don't use drugs, don't bring girls home, keep it a nice environment,"" she says. A Los Angeles native, Elliot Rosenberg has launched a website with an eye on the World Cup allowing residents to rent out rooms to foreigners. With some 600,000 foreign fans expected over the course of the tournament, there could be plenty of demand. But Rosenberg believes that many of those looking for rooms will be attracted by more than just the about $50 price tags on many rooms. ""They want more authentic, lively, meaningful experiences,"" he says. ""They want to see the real Rio."" And, of course, those great views don't hurt either.

The new resort is scheduled to open in about five years. When it opens, Disney says the park will also have two themed hotels, a large retail, dining and entertainment venue, as well as recreational facilities, a lake and plenty of parking. In total, building the resort is expected to cost more than four billion dollars, which will be split between the Walt Disney Company and its China partners. Disney already has a Disneyland resort in Hong Kong, China, as well as in Tokyo, Japan, but Shanghai's would mark the first Disney resort in mainland China.

"(CNN) -- Gunmen killed two Egyptian military personnel and injured a third when security forces raided a militant hideout on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. Two army explosives experts, a general and a colonel, and five members of the Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis were killed in the shootout in Qalyubia province, north of Cairo, the ministry said in a statement posted on its website. Four other members of the group, one of Egypt's most active militant organizations, were wounded, as was a special forces officer. Intelligence had indicated the group was using a wood manufacturing workshop as a base and to store weapons and ammunition, the Interior Ministry said. The clashes lasted several hours, the statement added. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been blamed for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula as well as on a security forces headquarters in the town of Mansoura last year. It claimed responsibility in January for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around Cairo. Islamist militants are expanding their insurgency in Egypt, where army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is expected to announce he will run for president. El-Sisi played a key role in the military overthrow of former President Mohamed Morsy last July. Militants based in the Sinai Peninsula near the Israeli border have stepped up attacks on soldiers and policemen since Morsy's ouster, which came amid widespread protests against his rule. Morsy and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Police, soldiers raid militant hideout north of Cairo .

But the 23-year-old's luck couldn't hold and finally, on the fifth extra hole, Day sealed the biggest victory of his career to date. ""At that time, you're just thinking, 'Do I need to just hand him the trophy now after those two shots?'"" Day told the tournament's official website of Dubuisson's second ridiculous escape shot. ""I kept shaking my head because there was a couple of times there where I thought he was absolutely dead -- the tournament was mine,"" Day said. But he should have known better. Dubuisson took care of South Africa's Ernie Els in the semifinal, played early on Sunday, and went into the final aiming to become the first Frenchman to win a PGA Tour title. Day, who toppled America's Rickie Fowler in his semi, was three up after nine holes before his French opponent started clawing his way back into the final and made a vital downhill putt on the 17th to reduce the gap to just one. Needing to win the final hole to force sudden death Dubuisson held his nerve to make a short putt after an exquisite shot from a greenside bunker. Then the fireworks truly began. Having flown his approach shot over the back of the first extra hole, his ball landed in cacti bushes and looked to be unplayable. But Dubuisson hovered above the foliage before pulling off a miraculous shot that dribbled to within four feet of the hole, to extend the match. At the next hole Dubuisson again missed the green, his ball resting against the root of a small bush. Once again he dazzled the gallery with an improvised shot that allowed him to halve the hole. ""I walked over there and it was in a tree, a flower tree of some sort, in this little crevice. I mean, it looked absolutely dead,"" Day said. ""I'm like, 'Yes.' I hit 8-iron into 20 feet. There was so much pressure on him. And he does it again."" ""Those two shots were amazing,"" Dubuisson said. ""I just played it like I had nothing to lose."" His fellow professionals agreed, 2010 U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell saying they were two of the best escape shots he'd ever seen, while Ballesteros' son Javier, called Dubuisson his ""new hero."" Finally, at the fifth extra hole and with light in the Arizona desert fading, Dubuisson succumbed, missing a long putt for birdie, as Day sank his from three feet. ""Vic, man, he has a lot of guts,"" Day said. ""He has a great short game -- straight out of the cactus twice. For a 23-year-old kid, he's got a lot of game. We're going to see a lot of him for years to come. ""The biggest thing was, 'How much do I want to win?"" I kept saying that to myself. Last night, I kept visualizing myself with the trophy. I'm glad I could finish it off. But it was a close one."" Day pocketed a cool $1.53 million for his victory and, remarkably, never trailed once during the final 53 holes he played in the tournament. ""I'm disappointed because I made some terrible shots,"" Dubuisson said after his defeat, adding of those two Seve-like escapes: ""Those two shots were amazing,"" Dubuisson said. ""I just played it like I had nothing to lose."" The third place playoff, also required sudden death to settle the outcome -- Rickie Fowler defeating Ernie Els on the first extra hole.","Jason Day defeats Victor Dubuisson to win WGC World Match Play title in Arizona .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of homes and farms have been destroyed by fire in the Australian state of Victoria in recent days, as fire crews battle to contain the state's worst bushfires in five years. Australian public broadcaster ABC News reported at least 26 homes had been destroyed across the state, with most of the damage occurring in the northern Melbourne suburbs of Mickleham and Warrandyte, according to the Country Fire Authority. Victoria Fire Services Commissioner Craig Lapsley said Sunday was ""the most serious fire day we've had in the state in five years,"" referring to the Black Saturday tragedy that claimed 173 lives. A firefighter in Victoria injured after being hit by a falling tree was the only fire-related injury reported at this time. Strong winds and high temperatures-- which have hit 40ËšC in recent days -- have created high-risk conditions in Victoria, where a total fire ban has been put in place. About 40 bushfires are also raging in the neighboring state of New South Wales, with areas in the south of the state placed under high alert. No homes in the state have been destroyed. Lapsley said that Sunday morning's fires were fast-moving and intense, and aided by wind. While cooler temperatures forecast for coming days would be welcomed, he said, ""it doesn't change the conditions, it doesn't bring rain... We will see the fire danger decrease but the fires still have the potential to do damage over the next number of days.""","Bushfires raging in Victoria have destroyed 26 properties .

"(CNN) -- Newsweek's cover story ""Muslim Rage"" has inspired a comedic rage. The magazine's newest issue features an article by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who purports to lecture the West on how to best handle Muslim rage. Newsweek, in an effort to promote the article, turned to Twitter, asking people to tweet their thoughts on the article, followed by the hashtag #MuslimRage. What happened next was not what Newsweek or Ali could have anticipated or wanted. Instead of an academic discussion about the article, or hate-filled diatribes by Islamophobes, it turned into something extraordinary. Opinion: Should Google censor an anti-Islam video? Thousands of tweets bearing the hashtag #MuslimRage filled Twitter, showcasing satire at its best -- the type, by definition, which uses ""wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly."" The tweets -- posted mostly by Muslims it seems -- are a comedic roast of the specious proposition that was peddled to us by Newsweek and Ali. Here are just a few samples: . Danya Hajjaji ‏@DanyaHajjaji . When everyone in history class turns to you once 9/11 is brought up. #MuslimRage . AidWorkerAfghanistan ‏@petey_jee . I told my shrink I was feeling suicidal and he reported me to the FBI #muslimrage . Dalia Mogahed ‏@DMogahed . When I wear a white hijab to a TV interview with a white backdrop. #floatingHead #MuslimRage . Juan Cole ‏@jricole . Television 'experts' saying Iran is an ""Arab"" country. #MuslimRage . Efe Ozturk ‏@Efe_Ozturk . Couldn't toss football around since the ball was made of pigskin #MuslimRage . And as University of California professor Reza Aslan poignantly and instructively tweeted: . Reza Aslan ‏@rezaaslan . Memo to those few violent MidEast protesters, this is how you fight Islamophobia. You make fun of it. #MuslimRage . We know that some Muslims were truly outraged by the anti-Islam video uploaded to YouTube that sparked protests in the Middle East. Some of those protests were peaceful, while others turned violent and deadly. We also know that plenty of Muslims were horrified by the killing of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Libya. The U.S. government is looking into whether this atrocity was premeditated or not. What is disheartening is that some of the media coverage of the protests embodies the worst form of sensational journalism. There were headlines and stories that made it seem as though millions of Muslims across the world had taken to the streets, with Muslim countries in riots and businesses closed. Free speech or incitement? French magazine runs cartoons of Mohammed . One of the most outrageous comments came from MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who said on Monday that Muslims hate us because of the religion itself. Scarborough, to the deafening silence of his co-hosts, further commented, ""If you gave every street vendor, from street vendor to prime minister in that region, a chance to throw a rock at the U.S. Embassy, they would."" How is this different from a radical Muslim cleric telling his followers that every American hates them -- from street vendors to the president -- because of their faith? Scarborough would be right if a majority of Muslims in the world had been protesting. But that is far from the truth. In Indonesia, a nation of over 200 million, several hundred people took part in protests. Just a few months ago, 50,000 Indonesians bought tickets to see a Lady Gaga concert before it was canceled. So, what does this say about Muslims in Indonesia? In Egypt, a nation of over 80 million, about 2,000 people protested on Friday. Of those protesters, a few hundred were arrested by the police. In Lebanon, no protests occurred until Monday. Why? Because the pope had been visiting the country, and the leader of Hezbollah, which the U.S. has labeled as a terrorist group, didn't want to do anything to interfere with the pope's historic three-day visit. A small number of protesters should not define the entire Muslim population of over a billion. The media should know this and report the truth accordingly. Reaction to anti-Islam film fuels debate on free speech versus hate speech . Let's look closer to home. Monday was the one-year anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement. It was marked by protests in a number of cities. In New York City alone there were over 1000 protesters, with 185 getting arrested. Do these protests imply that all Americans are protesting? Of course not. And remember the Chick Fil-A Appreciation Day this summer, which was held to support the fast-food chain amid a debate over its president's opposition to same-sex marriage? It set sales records for the chain and attracted over 600,000 supporters on its Facebook event page. Would it be fair for a foreign news media outlet to report, ""Americans rage against gay marriage""? No. The U.S. media -- and we're not just talking about Newsweek or Joe Scarborough -- need to act in a more responsible way. It appears that our media are more focused on ratings than facts and accuracy. While the media jump on the story and then quickly move on to another story, their impact in defining a people and a culture can be lasting. Let's hope the wave of #MuslimRage responses prompts the media to think twice before they react. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Newsweek's cover story about Muslim rage turned into satire on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- The stakes in a court hearing Tuesday were as big as the star performers at the heart of the matter. SeaWorld appealed to a federal three-judge panel Tuesday, asking it to overturn Occupational Safety and Health Administration safety citations and a ban restricting how humans interact with killer whales during performances. OSHA instituted the regulations after the death of veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010, when Tilikum, the orca she had worked with for years, dragged her into the water and killed her in front of a horrified audience. The governmental agency said the company had violated the general duty clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, saying it exposed its workers to a known hazard in the workplace. Eugene Scalia, son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and former solicitor of the U.S. Department of Labor, argued in the hearing that OSHA is overstepping its bounds and has no more of a right to impose restrictions on a specialized industry like SeaWorld than it does to regulate tackling in the NFL or impose speed limits in NASCAR. Filmmaker: Why I made 'Blackfish' The judges peppered both Scalia and Amy Tryon, who represented OSHA and the Labor Department, with numerous questions on that analogy. ""SeaWorld created this business but cannot create their own safety standard,"" Tryon said. The issue seemed to trouble Judge Brett Kavanaugh. ""It does seem giving the authority (here) would give OSHA the authority over sports and entertainment industries in the U.S.,"" Kavanaugh told Tryon. Scalia also argued that OSHA's restrictions present a ""fundamental difference"" and a ""stark change"" in the premise of SeaWorld's existing business model, which is based on exhibiting humans interacting with killer whales. The theme park was known until 2010 for its famous Shamu shows, which featured amazing demonstrations of trainers surfing on orcas or being catapulted high into the air. ""OSHA isn't asking SeaWorld to prevent all activities,"" Tryon said. ""These are feasible reductions that we know SeaWorld can do because they're doing them now."" In 2010, SeaWorld was originally fined $75,000 for three safety violations, including one ""willful"" citation. After SeaWorld appealed that decision, an administrative law judge in 2012 downgraded the ""willful"" complaint to ""serious,"" reducing the fine to $12,000. Crucially, that judge sided with OSHA's mandate to keep humans out of the water with killer whales unless there were physical barriers to reduce the risk of serious injury or death. SeaWorld disagreed and filed its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. With the court-ordered restrictions, some argue that SeaWorld's very livelihood is on the line. ""SeaWorld offers the public an opportunity to observe humans' interaction with killer whales,"" the company said in court documents. ""This brings profound public educational benefit, is integral to SeaWorld's care of the whales, and responds to an elemental human desire to know, understand, and interact with the natural world."" OSHA argued in a response brief that such close interaction between humans and whales was not crucial to the company's business. ""It is clear from SeaWorld's adoption of these measures that close contact of the kind that resulted in Dawn Brancheau's death is not essential to SeaWorld's ability to draw visitors to its parks, to practice behaviors during shows, or to care for its whales,"" the brief said. Captive orcas have killed four people, including three trainers. ""The ($12,000 citation) amounts to basically a very expensive speeding ticket,"" said Benjamin Briggs, a partner with Seyfarth Shaw LLP who specializes in labor law. ""The one that's going to be harder to prove is proving this type of interaction between whales and the trainers actually makes the interactions more predictable, and by reducing that, and creating greater distances, it's going to undermine not only the level of predictability, but it's going to harm their ability to care for the animals and impact their operations in a more fundamental way."" Trainers have been in ""close contact with whales since the 1960s,"" court documents say. ""During this time, OSHA could have opened an investigation at any time if it believed that close contact presented a recognized hazard."" Briggs said the argument is legitimate, but SeaWorld faces an uphill battle because what OSHA has on its side is history. ""There's a long and well-documented track record of these types of animals behaving aggressively toward humans to the point that they've caused a number of fatalities, not only at SeaWorld, but at a number of places,"" Briggs said. ""That is what OSHA is going to say: 'You absolutely were on notice of this, this is absolutely a recognized hazard.' This kind of track record is not one you can ignore. So it's very important; it's what OSHA's case really hinges upon."" The appeal hearing, normally held in a courtroom, garnered such high interest that it was held at a public forum at the Georgetown University Law Center. The venue was the first time oral arguments for the D.C. Circuit have been heard outside of the court. Spectators included Georgetown University law students, the general public and SeaWorld employees. A decision is not expected immediately. Brancheau's death sparked the making of a documentary acquired by CNN Films called ""Blackfish."" The documentary explores the history of killer whales in captivity and incidents in aquatic parks leading up to Brancheau's death. SeaWorld answers questions about 'Blackfish'","NEW: SeaWorld, OSHA make their cases before federal appeals panel .

"Maykop, Russia (CNN) -- Russian authorities have arrested a prominent community leader from the country's Circassian ethnic minority. The arrest took place on Friday night in the same province where the Winter Olympics are currently being held. The detention of Asker Sokht follows the police roundup on February 7 in the southern city of Nalchik of dozens of Circassian activists who tried to hold a protest denouncing the Winter Olympics. Russian officials could not be reached on Sunday to comment on Sokht's arrest. But the detention of a leader widely perceived as a moderate, who often defended Russian government policy, has sent ripples of alarm through the Circassian community in Russia, which is estimated to number around 800,000. ""This is deeply sad for Circassians,"" said Adam Bogus, the leader of another Circassian council based in Maykop, which is located about 150 miles north of Sochi. ""Even those who weren't strongly associated with the nationalist movement and were fairly assimilated in Russia interpret this as an insult to the Circassian people,"" Bogus told CNN. Circassian activists have criticized the Russian government for failing to acknowledge that the Olympic city of Sochi is also the traditional homeland of their people. ""The question isn't whether or not the Games are taking place on our land,"" said Abdullah Bersirow, a Circassian architect who designed a monument to his people that looms uncompleted over a park in Maykop. ""The most important thing is when they announced (the Olympics), they didn't say a word about us. They tried to forget us as if we never even lived here,"" Bersirow said. Circassians once dominated large swaths of the Caucasus and northern Black Sea coast. They were defeated by the Russian army in the Caucasus War, a conflict that lasted for more than a century, until the mid-1800s. Circassian historian Samir Khotko told CNN that the Circassians fought their last stand against imperial Russia in Krasnaya Polyana, the mountainous area above Sochi where the Olympic Alpine sports are now being held. 2014 marks the 150th anniversary of that final battle. Many Circassians accuse 19th-century Russia of carrying out genocidal massacres of their ancestors, as well as the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of Circassians. Today, members of the Circassian diaspora are scattered across the Europe and the U.S., along with communities in Middle Eastern countries like Turkey, Syria and Israel. Some Circassian activists have led an anti-Olympics campaign on the website nosochi2014.com, which is accompanied by slogans like ""Sochi, the land of genocide."" Russian President Vladimir Putin, who personally lobbied for Sochi to host the Winter Olympics, has repeatedly urged observers to avoid mixing politics with sport. The Russian government has been particularly sensitive to criticism of the Sochi Olympics. On February 7, several activists carrying the rainbow flag of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movement were detained while singing the Russian national anthem in Moscow's Red Square. Last week, Evgeny Vitishko, an outspoken environmentalist critic of the Sochi Games, was sentenced to three years in a penal colony, accused of hooliganism and destroying private property. Human rights activists in Russia as well as the U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch denounced the verdict, claiming it was politically motivated. On Sunday, a spokesman for the International Olympic Committee sided with Russian authorities on the Vitishko verdict. ""We received clarification from Sochi that this is, and we think it remains, a non-Olympic case,"" said IOC communications director Mark Adams. Sokht, the Circassian activist leader, was arrested in Russia's Krasnodar region, the province where Sochi is located. Friends and relatives said Sokht had been active in resettling in the region at least 10 families of Circassian refugees who had fled Syria's civil war. As news of Sokht's arrest spread this weekend, several prominent Circassians asked CNN not to publish their interviews for fear of punishment at the hands of Russian authorities. ""This has led a great number of people to conclude that anybody who deals with the Circassian question -- even the most loyal -- will now be under pressure,"" said Bogus, the Circassian community leader in Maykop. CNN's Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.","Asker Sokht, a leader in Circassian community, was arrested Friday night .

"(CNN) -- America's favorite Flying Tomato goes for a third gold in a row, women finally get to jump from the normal hill and Russian figure skaters take to the ice with the support and pressure of the home nation. Men's snowboard halfpipe . Garbage. That's the word snowboarder Danny Davis used Monday to describe to Yahoo Sports the halfpipe that will be the site of Shaun White's attempt at a third straight gold medal. The preview from the Olympic News Service put it a little more mildly -- OK, a lot more mildly -- saying ""several riders voiced concerns."" The report said the builders were making last-minute changes. That's right, the day before the event the Olympic field of play needs work. ""It's the Olympics. It should be flawless,"" Davis, of the United States, told Yahoo. Bleacher Report sums up the media coverage of the storm a brewin' at the halfpipe. On Sunday night, White was asked by reporters what he thought of the course. He tried to be nice, but they could tell he was not pleased. Still he tried to give it the best spin. ""I'm sure it will be (OK). I have faith,"" he said. One thing is certain. No matter how bad or how good it is, everyone will have to ride the same pipe. Who to watch: White, trying to become the first U.S. man to win an event in three straight Winter Games. Davis and 2013 world champion Iouri Podladtchikov. Women's ski jumping . It seems weird but until this year, women haven't been able to slide down a really slick ramp, then hurtle themselves through the air. That used to be a men's only club (since 1924). It wasn't because women are smarter than men; it was because they were excluded for who knows what reason. Lindsey Van took part in the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. She was one of the jumpers who tested the hills for the men's events. Female ski jumpers took the International Olympic Committee to court before the Vancouver Games but came up with an empty victory. They still watched from the sidelines. But just a year later the IOC announced women's ski jumping was in, so don't blame Van and the others if they are just a little bit excited Tuesday. They've come a long way. Who to watch: Sarah Hendrickson and Sara Takanashi are the top two jumpers since the ski jumping tour began in 2011. At the 2013 world championships, Hendrickson won gold and Takanashi was the silver medalist. But Hendrickson was injured in August and only started jumping again in January. Also keep an eye on 2011 world champion Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria. Figure skating pairs . You want to talk about pressure. How much is there on Tatiana Volosozhar and Maxim Trankov of Russia? It used to be that a gold medal for Moscow was a given in pairs skating. Soviet teams won. Russian teams won. From 1964 to 2006, no losses in the Olympics. Tuesday is Day 1 of 2 to make up for Vancouver, when the Russians didn't even make the podium. The pair had a chance to work any jitters out during the new team competition. They skated in the short program of the event, unlike four-time world champions Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy of Germany, who are second favorites. Who else to watch: Ksenia Stolbova and Fedor Klimov of Russia, who won the free program during the team competition; Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford of Canada, third at the worlds; and Kirsten Moore-Towers and Dylan Moscovitch of Canada. Women's singles luge . Erin Hamlin knows a little bit about upsetting Germans. Five years ago, she won the women's singles luge at the world championships. That's like someone beating the old U.S. basketball team. It only happened about once a decade. And the Germans don't just usually win at the big events; they usually dominate the podium. Hamlin is third after the first day of competition -- behind, well, you already know. She faces two more runs Tuesday to see if she can become the first American ever to medal in singles. Who else to watch: World champion Natalie Geisenberger and Vancouver winner Tatjana Huefner are 1-2 after the first two runs while Russian Natalja Khoreva is fourth and has home-track advantage on one of the longest courses in the world. Women's long-track speed skating . You know you're pretty good when one of your opponents says words to the effect of, ""I really hope I can win the silver or bronze."" Lee Sang Hwa won every 500 meter race she entered this season. That's seven wins, four with world record times. Margot Boer of the Netherlands said the only way Lee loses is if she makes a mistake. And that just isn't very likely. She'll face Brittany Bowe in the first heat, which may be a boost for the U.S. skater. We'd post some comment from Lee, but she doesn't do media before her races. Who else to watch: Olga Fatkulina of Russia, who won the one race Lee didn't enter. Wang Beixing of China and Heather Richardson of the United States.","It appears that as of Monday quite a few snowboarders didn't like the halfpipe .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Sunday a bill that prevents local governments from banning the practice of male circumcision. The legislation comes in response to an effort this summer by a San Francisco Bay Area advocacy group opposed to the practice to get a measure proposing a citywide ban added to the November 8 city ballot. In July, a Superior Court judge ordered the proposed measure removed from the ballot, saying that male circumcision is ""a widely practiced medical procedure"" and that medical services are left to the regulation of the state, not individual cities. The legislation signed Sunday, which takes effect immediately, prohibits governments at the local or county level from ""restricting the practice of male circumcision"" and ""declares that the laws affecting male circumcision must have uniform application throughout the state.""","The law prevents local governments from enforcing such a ban .

"(CNN) -- The daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. has declined the post her father once held as president of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, saying she was interested in being more than a ""figurehead."" The Rev. Bernice A. King was elected to the office in October 2009, but never served as president as a string of legal battles divided the 53-year-old organization. Bernice King told CNN political contributor Roland Martin she made suggestions to the organization in October about how the presidency might operate. She said she felt ""disrespected"" because there was no formal communication until earlier this month. ""What they sent back was merely a job description that primarily spoke to a board-driven organization,"" King said. ""I was elected to lead the organization. I was frankly not interested in merely being a figurehead of the organization."" ""I envisioned SCLC emerging as the vanguard for next-generation nonviolent activism in the tradition of my father,"" King said in a statement earlier Friday. ""Amidst the turmoil, chaos and confusion surrounding SCLC over the last 15 months, my team and I dedicated an exhaustive amount of time, energy and resources to assess the organization and prepare for my transition."" The group's national board of directors said King was shifting ""her attention to furthering her mother's legacy and embark upon other ministry initiatives. ""We wish the best for Elder Bernice King, and pray for her great success as she moves forward,"" it said in a statement. A judge in Fulton County (Georgia) Superior Court ruled in September 2010 the current national board should be in charge, instead of another faction, although that decision is under appeal. Dr. Howard Creecy, acting president of the SCLC, told CNN that the board supported King's right to make a ""quality decision."" ""We never asked for the storms we had to pass through,"" he said, indicating the gap between King's election and her taking the presidency was a ""lengthy period."" The SCLC ""gave a voice"" to people affected by the Gulf oil spill disaster and remains concerned about the plight of the poor, Creecy said, adding that the group is ""restoring our credibility."" Bernice King said she now plans to shift her attention to furthering the legacy of her mother, Coretta Scott King, and pursuing ministry initiatives. ""We wouldn't know Martin Luther King as we know him if it were not for all of her work."" Coretta Scott King died in January 2006, 38 years after her Nobel Peace Prize-winning husband was assassinated. The SCLC has seen a power struggle dating back about a decade, said Ralph Luker, a retired professor who specialized in the civil rights movement and has been an observer of the organization. Bernice King's brother, Martin Luther King III, was president of the SCLC from 1997 to 2004. They and sibling Dexter King had been locked in a bitter legal battle over their parents' estates and rightful succession. The group, which has chapters and affiliates throughout the country, was a leading organization during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Bernice King told Martin she wants to work with the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference on education, health care, immigration and other issues. ""Regardless of what institution, the work of my father will continue,"" she said. It's now up to the SCLC to determine the proper leadership model, the minister told CNN. ""I will continue to pray for them to move forward in a positive direction,"" Bernice King said. Dr. Bernard LaFayette Jr., vice chairman of the SCLC, said the organization will move forward. ""She deserves the right to make her own assessment,"" he said of Bernice King. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Board wishes the Rev. Bernice A. King ""great success""

"(CNN) -- Veteran British broadcaster David Frost, best known for his series of interviews with disgraced U.S. President Richard Nixon, has died. He was 74. His death was reported by the BBC, which aired many of his shows, and by Al Jazeera English, where he also worked. The BBC published a statement from Frost's family asking for privacy ""at this difficult time."" The family said Frost spent Saturday evening giving a speech on a cruise ship, where he suffered a heart attack. He's survived by his wife of 30 years and three children. ""My heart goes out to David Frost's family,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted Sunday morning. ""He could be -- and certainly was with me -- both a friend and a fearsome interviewer."" Frost's interviews with Nixon, and the story behind them, were portrayed in the play and film ""Frost/Nixon,"" written by Peter Morgan. In a 2009 interview, Frost told CNN he did not see the interviews as ""an intellectual 'Rocky,'"" as Morgan called them. Nixon at one point let down his guard, telling Frost, ""I'm saying when the president does it, that means it's not illegal."" For many viewers, that moment cemented Nixon's infamy. More than 30 years later, Frost remembered Nixon as a surprisingly awkward figure who, while once discussing what they'd done the previous evening, asked the host, ""Did you do any fornicating?"" ""It was amazing to discover how ... hopeless he was at small talk,"" Frost told CNN. ""I mean, here was this incredible professional politician, a great pro. And he'd never learned small talk."" Watch a 2009 CNN interview with David Frost . In a 2011 interview with CNN, Frost praised former U.S. President George H.W. Bush. ""He was wise,"" Frost said. ""He was cautious, he knew what he was determined to do."" But it wasn't all serious interviews with politicians. Charlie Courtauld worked with Frost in his later years at Al Jazeera English. ""What was remarkable about Sir David was his ability to put any interviewee at ease, from the most high and mighty to an ordinary person in the street,"" Courtauld said in a statement. ""He found interest in anybody. Whoever he was interviewing would realise that Sir David was genuinely interested in them and their lives. He was very much a people person."" In his early days as a presenter, Frost also dabbled in satire. In the early 1960s he hosted a program on the BBC called ""That Was the Week That Was."" The short-lived show included luminaries like John Cleese and marked the beginning of a broadcast career that mixed news and entertainment. Born in southern England, Frost considered following in the footsteps of his Methodist minister father. That ambition didn't last.

The union with actress Lynne Frederick was brief, just 18 months. In 1994, Frederick committed suicide. Frost later said of Frederick, ""Life was very unfair to her."" Frost's second marriage would last. In 1983 he wed Lady Carina Fitzalan-Howard. The couple had three sons. The late Princess Diana was godmother to the youngest. Although Frost came from humble beginnings, later in life he lived quite well. He was knighted in 1993. His annual summer fete drew A-listers and headlines.

"(CNN) -- The world watched Manchester, and Manchester watched the world turn red and blue. According to some analysts more than 600 million people across the globe tuned into see the blue of Manchester City beat the red of Manchester United 1-0, arguably the biggest audience for the biggest match in English Premier League history. Vincent Kompany's headed goal deep in first-half injury time was enough to take City top of the league from their rivals on goal difference. Psychologically, with two games left, it could prove decisive and hand City the advantage as they hunt a historic first Premier League title. The match itself was enthralling without being exciting, tense without many chances on goal. But by the end, as Manchester City fans sang their club's famous adopted song ""Blue Moon,"" there was a sense that history was being witnessed. United coach Alex Ferguson lost his cool and remonstrated with his opposite number Roberto Mancini. But the game was lost for United. Perhaps as one empire rises, another falls. TV networks from China to Qatar sent their chief correspondents to relay something of the febrile atmosphere to their expectant domestic audiences, audiences that have taken English football as their own over the past two decades. Even in America, traditionally one of the few bastions of football refuseniks, TV chiefs decided to upgrade the match to ESPN's main channel. This, CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin told us, was a very big deal indeed. Yet it wasn't always like this. Once, not so long ago, few outside of those standing on the terraces attending this derby match in the north west of England would have been able to watch the spectacle. True the Manchester derby has always been a passionate, sometimes brutal affair over the years. The fortunes of both the red half of United and the blue of City have ebbed and flowed as the decades pass. City haven't won the league for 44 years. Instead they watched United become the greatest team of the Premier League era, not to mention arguably the most recognizable and profitable brand in the world. But in 1974 the boot was on the other foot when Denis Law -- a United legend who had signed for City -- sheepishly backheeled the goal that relegated United to the second division. Such a scenario in 2012 would be unthinkable. Today the Manchester derby has reached the kind of global prominence that Barcelona versus Real Madrid -- even if Spain's biggest match isn't a derby in the truest sense of the word -- would normally enjoy. Its rise is much more than just the story of two successful football teams. The rise of the Manchester derby is also the story of the rise of globalization. United and City are separated by just five miles yet the local has become the global. On the pitch, 10 different nationalities featured. The stadium's naming rights have been sold to a Middle Eastern airline. United is owned by the Glazer family, the American venture capitalists who knew virtually nothing about football outside of their love of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who bought the English club in an unpopular leveraged buy out. Manchester City has been transformed by the mega money from the Arab world, owned as it is by Sheikh Mansour from the ruling family of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. It was Sheikh Mansour's money that turned a sleepy, underperforming club into champions elect. As the movement of capital and talent has been made easier, football -- and especially the Premier League -- has reaped the financial benefits. But no two entities have benefited more than Manchester's two football clubs. ""I think we deserved to win this game,"" Mancini told British TV after the match. ""I think next Saturday we'll have another difficult day."" And he's right, of course. Manchester City easily fended off United's late charge. United didn't even manage a shot on target during the entire 90 minutes. Now the two teams are equal on points with just two matches left. As Mancini said, next Saturday will be the same as Monday; a difficult day, almost too close to call. But there's one thing that you can predict. On Saturday the world will be watching once again.","Manchester City beat Manchester United 1-0 in derby match key to title race .

"(CNN) -- America's most brilliant document declares all men are created equal, however the same cannot be said for all dresses. Forty years ago, Diane von Furstenberg created a superior, yet remarkably democratic, dress. Though von Furstenberg was only in her 20s, an awkward time for many young women, she proved to have perfect timing when she unleashed her little dress onto the American fashion landscape. And little did she know that it, and she, would become the timeless icons of glamorous practicality they are today. The 1970s were a time when many women were entering the white-collar work force and also declaring their sexual independence. This was a radical combination of recognizing newfound professional power and redefining old sexual restrictions. Diane von Furstenberg gave this new woman something new to wear for her new career and new sex life. The wrap literally dressed the movement. It liberated women from the stuffy and stiff male-imagined ""working gal"" get-ups; it was easy to put on and take off; it was smart, affordable and traveled well. The fabric was clingy but not cumbersome; it celebrated a woman's silhouette instead of trying to control it. The wrap dress would sway with a woman to her first big job, then seamlessly swing with her to her first hot date. DVF designed a dress for the new American woman on the move. Rarely have we seen such a democratic design. The DVF wrap dress embraces diversity like no other before it or since. It can be worn well by women aged 20 to 70 and sizes 0 to 20. It comes in classic solids and a plethora of prints, can be layered with everything from denim jackets to floor-length furs. Piles of jewels can fill the open front V-neckline or an elegant collarbone can be the sole accessory. The DVF wrap dress is often the symbol that one has gotten her first ""real"" job, yet it is equally appropriate if you occupy the corner office. As many women abandon early adult outfits, the wrap dress endures. Most clothing designs are intended to date you, socioeconomically place you, locate and lock you in some position or lack thereof. But not this power piece, it has the flexibility to grow with you, as you become the fully self-determined, self-defined woman you want to be. A woman gets to fill the wrap with her possibility, and that's its genius. The DVF wrap is the American dream dress. Using herself as muse, Diane von Furstenberg had a vision for who the American woman would become. She has been known to say she wasn't sure what she wanted to do, but she knew the woman she wanted to become. And even before she became the DVF we know and revere, she gave that woman and millions of others something wonderful to wear. The classic sweater ballerinas wear in rehearsals, paired with a fluid skirt, von Furstenberg revealed, inspired the wrap dress. Perhaps she foresaw herself and other American women making graceful global moves. Aside from being a sharp businesswoman whose goods can be purchased in more than 55 countries, in 2006 she became president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (the industry's most influential organization). In 2012, Forbes Magazine named her one of the 20 most powerful women in business. She has put herself in the center of several humanitarian and philanthropic efforts, including BORNFREE, a campaign to eradicate the spread of HIV from mother to child by 2015. Yet at the core of her busy (at 67, she says she's never worked so hard) multiplatform life is her focus on women. In a recent New York Times interview, von Furstenberg stated: ""Everything I do now is for the empowerment of women."" And it is certain she has secured her legacy. Like the Declaration of Independence, a Diane von Furstenberg dress has been housed in a prestigious institution in Washington, the Smithsonian. In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama wore a chainlink-print wrap dress on the Obamas' first official White House Christmas card. The same year, former Vogue contributing editor AndrÃ© Leon Talley curated the retrospective ""Diane Von Furstenberg: Journey of a Dress,"" which opened in Moscow. In 2010, the show went to SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and in 2011 to the Pace Gallery in Beijing. It has since been re-imagined and expanded for its American debut at the historic Wilshire May Building in Los Angeles. The show of dresses, photos and original art opened to the public on January 11 and will run through April 1, 2014. The 40th birthday party of the dress that made the career that made the icon will go on year-round, with limited-edition collaborations with the Andy Warhol Foundation and a book, ""The Woman I Wanted To Be,"" coming in the fall. With America facing the very real possibility of a woman winning the White House in 2016, Diane von Furstenberg's 40-year-old business model of investing in independent women, ""celebrating freedom and selling confidence"" appears to be more timely than ever.","Diane von Furstenberg's iconic wrap dress was created 40 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer's revival is gathering pace. The 17-time grand slam champion will seek his fifth title at the Indian Wells Masters event on Sunday, having breezed past 28th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 6-1 in a semifinal lasting just over an hour. ""It was one of my best serving days ever,"" Federer told reporters. ""When you are serving like that, everything seems easier. I was just going for it out there."" The Swiss veteran, who won his fourth title in the California desert tournament in 2012, will return to the top five in the rankings next week -- up three places. He will next face a tougher test of his abilities against world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who he beat last month on the way to winning the Dubai title, also on an outdoor hardcourt surface. Federer, who has yet to drop a set this week, is seeking the 79th title of his illustrious career, and victory over Djokovic will put him fourth in the rankings. Dolgopolov had been trying to become the first player ranked outside the top 30 to beat both Federer and defending champion Rafael Nadal in the same tournament. ""I was ready physically, mentally,"" said the Ukrainian. ""I wasn't nervous much, but I wasn't sharp enough. ""My concentration was going away for maybe one, two points every game, and you can't afford to have that in these matches."" Djokovic, who won the tournament in 2008 and 2011, had to work a bit harder than Federer to beat 2012 finalist John Isner on Saturday. The Serbian avenged his defeat by the big-serving American at the same stage two years ago as he triumphed 7-5 6-7 (2-7) 6-1 in a match lasting two hours 23 minutes.

"(CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader has expressed mixed feelings about his president's recent diplomatic inroads with the United States. On Saturday, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised President Hassan Rouhani for diplomatic efforts he made during his trip over a week ago to the United Nations in New York. ""We support the government's diplomatic moves and consider them to be important. We also support what happened during the visit,"" Khamenei said according to the official Fars News Agency. During his stay, Rouhani was well-received and struck up a markedly more conciliatory tone than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The visit ended with a historic, ice-breaking conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama, who phoned Rouhani. It was the first time presidents of the two countries had spoken since 1979, and the tone was agreeable. But Khamenei felt uncomfortable with aspects of the trip, he said in a speech at a graduation ceremony for army officers in Tehran. ""Some of the things that took place during the trip to New York were not quite desirable,"" the official Fars News Agency quoted him. They were ""inappropriate,"" Iran's English language broadcaster Press TV reported him saying. Part of the trip ""wasn't proper,"" Khamenei said in a post to his official English language Twitter account. U.S. official: Obama, Rouhani discussed fate of 3 Americans . It was the first time the supreme leader, who is the ultimate holder of power in Iran, commented publicly on Rouhani's trip. He had no harsh words for his president, but he did for the United States. ""We are optimistic about our dear government's diplomatic delegation, but we are pessimistic about the United States,"" Khamenei said according to Fars, before officers and soldiers who stood lined up at attention holding their weapons. ""The U.S. government is untrustworthy, egotistical and illogical and breaks its promises,"" he said. He accused Washington of kowtowing to Israel and bending to its wishes. Curbing enthusiasm . The breakthrough phone call between Obama and Rouhani was met with enthusiasm in the United States and elsewhere in the West, but less so with Israel's leadership. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the U.N. General Assembly podium on October 1 to attempt to curb it. He accused the new Iranian president of being a ""wolf in sheep's skin"" who was still seeking to obtain a nuclear weapon. Kerry: U.S. is not being played by Iran . Western leaders have expressed optimism about Iran's more moderate tone under Rouhani, whose recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. But Netanyahu urged world leaders not to be duped by Rouhani, calling him a ""loyal servant"" to the Islamic regime, which he said ""executes political dissidents by the hundreds"" and jails them by the thousands. Netanyahu says he would talk to Rouhani . ""It's not hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program,"" Netanyahu said. ""It's hard to find evidence that Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapons program."" Iran has long insisted that it is only interested in developing nuclear energy technology and has no intention of constructing nuclear weapons. Nascent hope . Khamenei's comments Saturday follow a wave of new optimism in Iran about relations with the West. News of the call between Obama and Rouhani has spawned hope of a diplomatic breakthrough, and it has lifted the mood of many Iranians. U.S. holds out prospect of some sanctions relief . From bakery to barber shop, cafe to carpet store, Iranians stroll through Tehran with a renewed step, uplifted by how their newly elected president seeks something remarkable after decades of cold war-like relations between their country and the West. ""I just feel it. It's not like I've seen anything, but I feel it,"" said retiree Syed Ali Akbar. ""It's the best thing to do. We've been hurting ourselves for years."" International economic sanctions against Iran have strained day-to-day living there, making essential goods such as medicine expensive and hard to come by. That punishment has taken a toll. ""The sanctions have hurt us. Prices have gone up. There are things you can't find,"" said Hossein Mohamadi at the Barbari Bread Shop. To many Iranians, Rouhani has seemed to be really advancing the ""hope and prudence"" slogan he used during his campaign to become president in June, posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservative thinking that characterized Ahmadinejad. But Rouhani has also met with criticism at home for his diplomatic tone toward the West. Upon his arrival back in Tehran, a detractor threw a shoe in his direction. It is an extremely insulting gesture. Opinion: Be cautious with new, smiley-faced Iran . CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote and reported from Atlanta; Shirzad Bozorgmehr reported from Tehran; CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Michael Martinez and Tom Watkins contributed to this report .","Iran's supreme leader appears to have mixed feelings about president's diplomatic inroads .

"New York (CNN) -- Thousands of revelers in shades of green jammed Manhattan streets to the tune of bagpipes Saturday for the 251st annual St. Patrick's Day parade. The parade marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral, where the landmark building is set to undergo more than $175 million in restorations, considered among the largest renovation projects in its history. Cardinal Timothy Dolan presided there earlier Saturday for a Mass attended by top city officials, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Today is a day to celebrate all things Irish and that means we have a lot to celebrate,"" Bloomberg told reporters. ""The Irish really have been the center of life for three centuries, and if you look around our administration, it is full of people with names like Kelly and Tierney and Gil Hearn and Dougherty and Hanley and Walsh."" Spectators donned sparkling green top hats and waved tiny Irish flags, as a marching band representing New York's finest drummed their way through Gotham. In Boston, which also has a large Irish population, thousands showed up for the city's parade that meandered through South Boston in the afternoon. Officials there have urged restraint in drinking. Photos: Celebrations go green . Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Mayor Thomas Menino issued a joint statement saying Boston police ""will be taking steps to increase patrols, focusing not only on the parade route and calls for service, but also at drinking establishments."" Bars are open until 7 p.m., while liquor stores are required to close at 4 p.m. In Chicago, the Chicago River was once again dyed green to kick off Irish-inspired festivities and a parade. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was on hand for this year's celebrations in The Windy City, sharing the spotlight with Mayor Rahm Emanuel. ""People are letting loose, singing, dancing,"" said Julie Roche, 25, a manager at Chicago's Snuggery pub and sports bar. Scores of patrons filed in as soon as the downtown bar opened at 7 a.m., she said, swelling to larger numbers as the day progressed. President enjoys a pint at the Dubliner pub in D.C. Parade-goers also jammed the streets of Savannah, Georgia, where clover-clad floats carried green-shirted revelers. ""We had a huge crowd here. The weather was incredible,"" said Julian Miller, public affairs administrator for Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police. ""It has been a very well-behaved crowd. We still have tonight."" He said there were only a couple minor arrests as of late Saturday afternoon. One participant in the parade became ill and was taken away by ambulance, Miller said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate WTGS that first responders performed CPR on a member of a marching band. Miller could not provide precise crowd estimates, but said it was probably in the several hundreds of thousands. Even President Barack Obama partook in the March 17 holiday tradition, enjoying a Guinness at a well-known Capitol Hill pub called ""The Dubliner."" Across the pond, huge crowds packed central Dublin, where thousands of spectators waved Irish flags as marchers passed by, carrying banners and singing traditional Irish songs. ""I'll take in more money today than I normally would in a week,"" said John Hoyne, owner of the Brazen Head pub, a converted manor that dates to 1775 and is described as Dublin's oldest pub. ""We are absolutely jammed to capacity."" The 50-year-old pub owner said the Brazen Head has 13 bartenders filling up an average of 500 pints of Guinness per hour. ""It's absolutely electric here,"" he said. Dublin crowds also gathered for the much-anticipated Irish-English six nations rugby match-up, a rivalry perhaps made more intense by Saturday's festivities. Ireland has been reeling from the effects of a banking collapse and the euro zone's debt crisis, battling high unemployment that currently hovers just above 14%. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Huge crowd attends parade in Savannah .

"(CNN) -- A familiar refrain for many football fans is that it's ""the hope that kills you."" Over the last two decades for one of the world's most famous sports teams Liverpool, there's been a lot of hope extinguished as a 121-year-old football institution has failed to recapture its former dominance of English football. Between 1973 and 1990, the English championship was placed in the trophy cabinet at the club's Anfield stadium on 11 occasions. That domestic success was accompanied by continental glory as the European Cup was taken to Merseyside four times between 1977 and 1984. But then came the famine. After sealing a then record 18th English title in 1990, Liverpool has only sporadically shown signs of mounting a genuine Premier League challenge -- until this season as the club makes an unlikely bid to win the league. Like Liverpool fans, one of their outstanding performers this season Daniel Sturridge is dreaming big. ""I think it's important that we just go out there, work as hard as we can as a team in every game and perceive what the future holds,"" Sturridge told CNN ahead of a key league match against Manchester United. ""We hope to have some success, we hope to be successful. There are 10 games to go so we'll see where that takes us."" During that title famine, Liverpudlians had to watch on as great rival United established itself as the preeminent force in English football. In April last year, United beat Aston Villa 3-0 to clinch a 20th league title, meaning it stands alone as the most successful team in English soccer history. The two teams meet on Sunday in a match which is about more than sporting pride. It's a simmering century-old rivalry, shaped by resentment between the two cities -- separated by roughly 30 miles -- that has its roots in industrial history. But for the first time in two decades, the balance has shifted in the battle for power between these two storied clubs. United is floundering in seventh place in the table following a disastrous campaign which has so far seen manager David Moyes struggle to emulate his illustrious predecessor Alex Ferguson. While United are struggling to even qualify for Europe's premier tournament -- the Champions League -- Liverpool is riding high. An exciting, vibrant team built by Northern Irish coach Brendan Rodgers sits second in the Premier League table, seven points behind leaders Chelsea but with a game in hand. The driving force behind Liverpool's rise have been goalscorers Luis Suarez and Sturridge, who have put the team in with a serious chance of ending a 24-year wait for a 19th league title. Uruguay's Suarez and England international Sturridge, dubbed the ""SAS"" by the British media, have scored 24 and 18 Premier League goals respectively, rocketing Liverpool towards the top of the table. ""SAS dynamic and dominant, but everyone contributing and effective,"" tweeted Liverpool's American owner John W Henry, who also owns the Boston Red Sox, after the recent 4-0 drubbing of Merseyside rivals Everton. So with 10 games to go of the 2013-14 season, Liverpool fans are daring to hope. The turnaround in the team's fortunes has been startling. It finished the 2012-13 campaign in seventh position, 28 points behind table-toppers United, 12 points adrift of fourth-place Arsenal and qualification for the lucrative Champions League. Last season Liverpool finished with 61 points, but it has 59 points so far in the 2013-14 campaign with 30 points still to play for. Rodgers' team has already won more matches than it did in the whole of last season -- 18 compared to 16 -- and it's the most in-form team in the Premier League with five wins from its last six games. The team's recent positive results have been a source of encouragement for former Liverpool stalwart Jamie Carragher, who made over 500 appearances for The Reds before calling time on his career at the end of the 2012-13 season. The former defender is even starting to believe that Rodgers' emerging squad is capable of taking the title ahead of mega-rich powerhouses Chelsea and Manchester City. ""The way Brendan has put the team together and the way they're playing at the moment, they're the most in-form team and the best time to be in-form is towards the end of the season,"" Carragher told CNN. ""They've put themselves in with a great chance. You'd still have to fancy Chelsea and Manchester City slightly ahead of them, but both those teams have to play at Anfield. I think it will depend on how they do in those games."" Steve McManaman, who is a former Liverpool teammate of Carragher, has also been impressed by Rodgers' flourishing team. ""Can they win the league? Of course they can, but I still think they're two, three, four players short of having a squad to rival Manchester City and Chelsea,"" said McManaman, who enjoyed two Champions League triumphs with Real Madrid after joining the Spanish club from Liverpool. ""I would always plump for those teams before Liverpool. A great year for Liverpool would be to just get into the Champions League,"" added McManaman. ""The step from finishing seventh last year and so many points behind to winning the league is huge. If they do it, I think it would be a monumental feat, but I think Champions League football would be incredible this year."" Like Carragher, Sturridge predicts two potentially season-defining matches against Chelsea and Manchester City. ""I think they're both favorites and they're both a threat,"" said the 24-year-old of Liverpool's title rivals. ""We're going play them both at Anfield. It's going to be a great occasion for myself and for the fans and my teammates of course. ""But it's important that we go out there and play the Liverpool way and enjoy it."" If Sturridge and Suarez can fire in those two games, Liverpool could well end 24 years of hurt and give its fans renewed hope that the club can return to its former glories.","Liverpool plays Manchester United in the English Premier League on Sunday .

"Sevastopol, Crimea (CNN) -- As I wait in line, staring down at the notes in my iPhone to remember the exact order for two Quarter Pounder with Cheese meals for our engineer and cameraman, I could well be in any McDonald's in the world. The golden arches, the familiar red signs with Ronald McDonald staring straight at me and the menu remain the same wherever you go in the world, such is the long arm of American corporate globalization. This restaurant is certainly a testament to that. However, this isn't New York. Nor is it London. It is Crimea. With a couple of Mercedes sports cars parked on the curb, facing the town's Apple store, this particular McDonald's is doing a roaring trade this Friday lunchtime. Russians reported in Ukraine outside Crimea . It's only two days before the region's people will go to the ballot boxes and vote on whether to stay part of the Ukraine or join Russia. The referendum will be held on Sunday. From what we have seen here, this will be largely symbolic. From what we can see, the majority of Crimeans would rather look toward Moscow than Kiev and the white, blue and red of the Russian flag is already flying through these streets. Our team was asked to come down here to the port of Sevastopol after having spent a week in the heart of the Crimean capital, Simferopol, dodging cossacks with their whips, men with more than a whiff of vodka on their breath and Russian soldiers sporting trendy balaclavas and AK47s. Nestled on the Black Sea, Sevastopol is a party town, prettier than the capital. Luxury yachts are in the port side by side with Russian destroyers. There are many nightclubs and bars. Indeed, the main square has had a concert on every night for the past seven days to celebrate returning back to the ""motherland."" Contrary to what the European foreign ministers say on their official Twitter accounts and what the State Department may read out during their briefings in Washington, the majority of the people we have spoken with here are glad the Russian bear has woken up. And they are happy to roar with it. I mean, in their eyes with the amount of propaganda from billboards with swastikas over the map of Ukraine and rumors of terrorists in Kiev, who wouldn't want to be Russian? In their eyes, it's either that or being a Nazi. The main square here fills up each lunchtime with cossacks, Russian flags and the local pro-Russian militias with their red armbands dressed all in black. The music reminds me of old Soviet propaganda films and these men in their gangs of militias remind me of my history lessons learning about the so-called ""brownshirts"" of Adolf Hitler's SA during the 1930s. The irony not lost that these men who chant ""Putin, Putin, Putin"" and call those who protested in Maidan square fascists look very similar to those real fascists pictured in my old history books. Any dissent here has now been stamped out. We have been in this town for over a week now, and I haven't seen one Ukrainian flag apart from the two on the Ukrainian warships blockaded in the port. It is far too dangerous for any pro-Ukranian voices to speak out. News of abductions and kidnapping are daily here, and as we enjoyed a meal last night, we were asked to give our details to the Ukrainian police officers who detained us there for just under an hour. They are carefully watched over by their new Russian boss. A plainclothed FSB (Russian secret police) officer making sure that the local police now start to monitor the movements of Western journalists properly. An apologetic ""sorry"" was uttered in English after they had finished taking our passport details. No matter how the older generation here roar and chant the Russian President's name, there is a bubble under the surface. The majority of young people here have grown up as Ukrainian, never under the watchful eye of Moscow, and they aren't too pleased. Every time you ask them what they think, you just get a sigh as they say ""What can we do?"" and talk of perhaps one day leaving to Kiev. And so the result of the referendum on Sunday will go one way. There may be two questions posed on the ballot paper, but there is already only one answer. That answer being written in Cyrillic. Yet Monday, before we leave Crimea and take our flights back to London, via Moscow as all other flights to and from other destinations have been canceled, I may well pop in and grab a bite for the road. I am sure that I will still look around in that full restaurant and see the same Ukrainian faces, paying for their meals with Ukrainian currency with a Big Mac in one hand and a Russian flag in the other.

"(CNN) -- From the flat-screen TV and complimentary water bottles to the bedside console with an array of switches that control your tiny hotel room universe, Chinese hotels have a staggering uniformity. The Metro Park Lido Hotel in Beijing might be a cut above the average, but as with many hotels in China, it's a variation on a theme. With its gold and green carpet, faux mahogany fittings and bleak luxury goods stores, it now provides a somber backdrop to the daily briefings on the fate of the missing Malaysian airliner. As the search dragged into its tenth day, ashen-faced relatives trickled out of Sunday's briefing after they were told they should consider returning home. For many of the 500 relatives in Beijing hanging onto any scrap of news, it was taken as a further sign that hopes are fading. For some of the relatives, even speculation the plane might have been hijacked is a best case scenario. READ MORE: Flight 370 hijacking theories: Improbability or best hope? ""Maybe the plane landed on a small island in the Indian Ocean and all the passengers are there. Maybe they are still alive. Maybe they will be back. It's a 50/50 chance,"" Steve Wang, whose mother was aboard Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370, told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Hannah Brencher never planned on starting a worldwide movement. Her life wasn't going as planned so she looked for a way to cope. That's when she started writing. ""I began leaving love letters all over New York City back in October 2010,"" Brencher writes on her personal website, ""as a way to try to fight off my own loneliness and depression."" She took it even further and went on to write over 400 letters to strangers around the world. Her kind words turned into More Love Letters, an international organization that has sent notes of positivity and encouragement to people in all 50 states and 50 countries. Those deserving of letters are nominated, with friends or family explaining why they're deserving of an outpouring of support. Writing volunteers read the nominations and respond to those that move them. Brencher described the organization as the ""best accident"" that ever happened to her. The letters are as unique as the individuals who write them. A quick glance at the More Love Letters website shows some written on embellished stationary while others are written on plain index cards. The messages written in the letters are meant to touch the heart of the reader. ""Dear Friend, Embrace today. You are amazing, beautiful, loved. Brighten a room with your smile,"" states one letter. Another one is more lighthearted. ""I hope today is/was a good hair day and that you felt confident in what you chose to wear."" Whatever the message, these letters make an impact. ""(The More Love Letters team) received an e-mail from a girl who had been riding on the subway and she had just found out that her mother had cancer,"" Brencher said. ""She actually looked down to the side of her and she noticed that there was a love letter sitting there with all the words of encouragement that she could possibly need."" In fact, in addition to sending letters directly to those who are nominated, More Love Letters encourages recipients to pass their messages on, or leave them for others to find. People find the letters in the strangest places. ""I have heard of everything from in the grocery store to in coffee shops,"" Brencher said. ""We've seen a lot of people start to leave love letters in their favorite books."" Brencher said one book in particular seems to be a popular location to leave love letters: ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower."" After receiving a letter, Betina Foreman said she sees the value in paying it forward. ""People always want to complain,"" she said, ""but when somebody does something right, how often does somebody say something?"" As the organization has grown, it has expanded into other ways of sending love. Through its Campus Cursive program, More Love Letters has sent letters to more than 100 college campuses. More Love Letters has also partnered with Cards for Hospitalized Kids. ""We realized that there were a lot of children out there that wanted to write letters and a lot of teachers that wanted to get children involved with the letter-writing process,"" Brencher said. ""So we worked with this organization to partner up, to mail love letters to the Miami Children's Hospital."" Even though it can be tough running an organization, Brencher said she continues to find motivation. ""I've seen through this organization just how good people are and how wonderful people are and how genuinely people want to serve one another.""

"(CNN) -- There will be a Red Bull on the front row of the grid for Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix -- but it's not four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel. The German will be back in 12th place after a dramatic qualifying session on Saturday in which wet weather added to the uncertainty created by the radical design changes for this year's cars. Vettel failed to make it into Q3 for the first time since 2012 as he suffered with engine software problems, but his new teammate Daniel Ricciardo shrugged off the champion team's preseason struggles by being second fastest behind Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton is one of the early favorites for the title, and his Mercedes team lived up to its billing as Nico Rosberg qualified third ahead of McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso. ""Qualifying was a lot harder for everyone with the tricky conditions and it was a real challenge out there,"" said Hamilton, who won the 32nd pole of his career to move up to sixth on the all-time list and match the British record held by Nigel Mansell. ""We were on the edge with the tires and it was difficult to know which way to go at times. It's the first time I've driven the car on the limit in the wet, but it felt great and I'm so happy with the job the team has done,"" added the 2008 world champion, who was also fastest in Friday's practice sessions. Vettel, seeking a record-equaling fifth successive title, took some positives from Red Bull's performance. ""I think we have made a big step forward with the car, but of course I'm not happy that we didn't make it to Q3,"" he said. ""I think the car is quick, but we struggled this afternoon with driveability which, in these conditions, made it even worse. The car seems good and Daniel did a very good job to be on the front row, so congratulations to him."" The Australian has made the step up from Red Bull's feeder team Toro Rosso to replace veteran compatriot Mark Webber. ""It was definitely a really nice first qualifying session with the team,"" said Ricciardo, who had moved ahead of Rosberg to top the timesheets before Hamilton snatched back the lead with a late lap. ""I'm happy for us to have a front row start -- it wasn't looking like this a few weeks ago, so I'm pretty pleased right now."" Magnussen outshined veteran teammate Jenson Button after the 2009 world champion failed to make it to Q3, though he was promoted to 10th after Williams rookie Valtteri Bottas was given a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox. Alonso, the distant runner-up in last year's championship, had the edge on his new Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who won the 2013 race ahead of the Spaniard with Lotus but will start 11th this time. Raikkonen spun off and damaged his front wing, but by that stage had no chance of making the final session. Toro Rosso impressed as French driver Jean-Eric Vergne qualified sixth and Russian 19-year-old Daniil Kvyat was eighth on his debut. Force India's new signing Nico Hulkenberg confirmed his reputation as a canny wet-weather driver as the German qualified seventh, but Mexican teammate Sergio Perez was back in 16th. Former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa will start ninth in his first outing for Williams, while Bottas was relegated to 15th. It was a nightmare day at the back of the field for Lotus, who have lost not only Raikkonen but also team boss Eric Boullier to McLaren. Romain Grosjean, who was seventh overall last year, will start 21st on the grid ahead of teammate Pastor Maldonado -- who couldn't even set a time after coming into Q1 late due to a power unit problem.","Lewis Hamilton will be on pole for the first race of the new Formula One season in Melbourne .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Opening a third week of testimony, a gun dealer said South African Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius had to know gun safety laws before purchasing his firearms and getting his gun licenses. Sean Patrick Rens, who sold guns to Pistorius, said the athlete correctly answered a questionnaire. Rens said Pistorius knew that it's not legal to shoot at unknown person seen breaking into your house, not legal to shoot at them if burglar bars separate you, but it is legal to shoot at them if there's no protection and they approach you with a weapon. For it to be legal to fire, Rens said, ""the attack must be against you, must be against a person, must be unlawful."" These points are important, because the Pistorius defense team must show that not only did he made a mistake but that the mistake was reasonable in order for him to be cleared of killing his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors and the defense are jockeying over whether Pistorius intentionally murdered Steenkamp, or killed her in a terrible but understandable accident. There's no question that he shot her through a bathroom door in his house early on Valentine's Day last year, hitting her with three hollow-tipped bullets, one of which probably killed her almost instantly. But for two weeks in court, his defense team has chipped away at every witness who casts doubt on his story that he thought Steenkamp was a burglar and mistakenly acted in what he believed was self-defense. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has put up witnesses ranging from the pathologist who performed the autopsy, to ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor, who said Pistorius kept a gun by his bed and went to investigate a sound in the night, weapon in hand, at least once while she was dating him. The senior police officer on the scene the night of the killing testified Friday, but it's not clear he did much for the prosecution case. The police investigation sounded in court like a catalog of bumbling, bad judgment, poor memory and petty theft. Former police Col. G.S. van Rensburg described how he found a police ballistics expert handling Pistorius' gun without wearing gloves and reprimanded the officer, who apologized and put a pair on. And he said he was ""furious"" when at least one of the Olympic athlete's valuable wristwatches disappeared from his bedroom as police investigated the crime scene. He ""body searched"" his fellow officers, their bags and their vehicles but was unable to find the watch, which was worth several thousand dollars. He also said he had ordered the bathroom door through which Pistorius shot Steenkamp removed from the house, placed in a body bag and taken to his office, explaining, ""The door is the most valuable evidence because the deceased was behind the door."" Earlier in the week, the defense attacked police handling of the door, implying that the evidence was unreliable because it was contaminated. Van Rensburg resigned from the force in December after three decades, under fire for his handling of the door. Asked what he now did for a living, he choked up and said, ""I am now coaching sports, and sports is my life."" Gory details lend Pistorius trial a 'CSI' flavor . Golden boy turned defendant . He's the 13th witness to testify for the prosecution in the murder trial of Pistorius, once South Africa's golden boy for the stellar track success that made him the first double amputee runner to compete in the Olympics. Pistorius, 27, has pleaded not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges. Steenkamp, a model, was 29 when she was killed. On Friday, Pistorius' lawyer Barry Roux ripped into van Rensburg's chronology of events on the night of the killing, presenting witness statements from three police officers whose accounts differed from van Rensburg's. The former officer was so startled by the statement of police Sgt. Ntome Sebetha that he stared at Roux and said, ""Amazing."" Later, Roux rattled van Rensburg so severely, pointing out clear differences between two pictures that the former officer said were the same, that van Rensburg refused to answer a question about how many keys were in another photograph. ""It's not a trick question,"" Roux said. ""There's one key there."" Gruesome images . The former police colonel first took the stand Thursday and said paramedics were there when he arrived at Pistorius' address about 3:55 a.m., but Steenkamp was dead. As he testified, the prosecution showed more than 100 police photographs taken at Pistorius' house after the killing, including the sprinter's 9 mm handgun, still cocked and ready to fire, on a bloody towel or bathmat on a blood-spattered floor. On Friday, the court was shown a photo of a toilet covered in blood, but only van Rensburg saw photos of Steenkamp's body and closeups of her injuries. Those gruesome pictures were not displayed on courtroom monitors. Even so, Pistorius kept his head down, shielding his eyes with one hand, while prosecutor Nel talked the former police officer quickly through the sheaf of photos on the witness stand. Pistorius vomited several times last week as pathologist Gert Saayman described Steenkamp's fatal wounds, and again when pictures of the injuries were accidentally displayed on monitors in court. Gun at his bedside . The case against Pistorius is largely circumstantial, Nel said in his opening statement last week. Pistorius and Steenkamp were the only people in his house when he killed her. Nel has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of experts, neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night, current and former friends of Pistorius' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots. Many prosecution witnesses' accounts are consistent with Pistorius' version of events: that he got up in the night, went out to his balcony to get a fan, came back inside and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought came from an intruder. He said he took the gun and fired while calling for Steenkamp to call police. When she didn't answer, he realized she could have been the person in the bathroom, he said. Neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired. But the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was Steenkamp screaming in fear for her life was in fact Pistorius when he realized what he had done. And the defense says that the sounds neighbors heard were not the gunshots, but the cricket bat hitting the door as he tried to rescue her. Pistorius and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting, allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years. Pistorius also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. The trial looks set to go on for several more weeks.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius left jail Friday, free on bond eight days after the shooting death of his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Magistrate Desmond Nair said the state had problems with its investigation and had not offered enough proof to keep Pistorius jailed. ""I come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail,"" Nair said, eliciting a celebratory cry of ""Yes!"" from the courtroom. ""We are relieved,"" said Pistorius' uncle, Arnold, speaking on behalf of the family. Pistorius, who wept throughout much of Friday's hearing, remained quiet and reserved after the announcement and did not appear to celebrate. His family hugged quietly. ""As a family, we know Oscar's version of what happened that tragic night. And we know that that is the truth and that will prevail in the coming court cases,"" his uncle said. Pistorius is accused of premeditated murder in the February 14 shooting death of Steenkamp, 29. Prosecutors say Pistorius, 26, killed her after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The sprinter says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home. He says he fired in a fit of terror before realizing Steenkamp was inside. ""I'd like to ask Oscar why he didn't lean over and touch my cousin first...and say 'are you okay?' 'keep quiet,' 'I'm coming now,'"" said Kim Martin, Steenkamp's cousin. In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court . While recounting a litany of ""improbabilities"" in Pistorius' account, Nair said defense attorneys had done enough to prove the ""exceptional circumstances"" required by South African law for the release of a suspect charged with premeditated murder. He said the former chief investigator in the case, Hilton Botha, had made ""several errors and concessions"" in his testimony at the bail hearing, and said prosecutors had failed to prove that Pistorius was a flight risk or had a propensity toward violence. Botha was replaced after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him in a 2011 incident unrelated to Pistorius. Key arguments . During the four-day bail hearing, prosecutors argued that Pistorius had a history of violence and that his account didn't add up. Prosecutors relied heavily on Botha's testimony, including statements from witnesses, who said they heard Pistorius and Steenkamp arguing before the shooting, as well as ballistic evidence that Botha said proved Pistorius was lying about how he had shot into the door. But Botha seemed to buckle under questioning from defense attorney Barry Roux, who got the detective to acknowledge that the bullet evidence wasn't as conclusive as he had initially said and that at least one witness he had spoken to could not say for certain that the sounds he had heard came from Pistorius' house. Nair also said that Botha had failed to exhaustively check cell phone records and chided the investigator for failing to check with Interpol before testifying that Pistorius owned a home in Italy -- raising his profile as a potential flight risk. The source of the information about the house apparently was a magazine article, the judge noted. Roux also said that defense investigators had found a bullet missed by police and that police may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective shoe covers. Police had run out of the covers, Botha testified. Nair said he wasn't convinced by prosecution arguments that Pistorius had a violent nature and was a threat to the public. The prosecution cited an incident in which Pistorius reportedly fired a gun on accident inside a Johannesburg restaurant and another in which he allegedly made violent threats. Finally, Nair said Botha had ""blundered"" in testifying that a substance recovered from Pistorius' home was testosterone. Some outsiders to the case have speculated that steroids or other substances could have played a role in the killing. The defense lawyer told Nair the substance was a legal herbal remedy. Tests are ongoing, authorities said. Too soon to judge . On the other hand, Nair said Pistorius' account is full of ""improbabilities,"" from why he did not know Steenkamp had gotten out of bed to why he would have charged toward the bathroom door -- where he believed he had an intruder cornered -- if he was as scared for his life as he claimed. Nair warned that it is too soon to judge the state's case, and he noted that a wide range of experts beyond Botha had worked on the initial phases of the investigation -- from ballistics experts to specialists in blood spatter. ""The pieces of the puzzle may not yet all be before me,"" he said. Conditions of bail . Pistorius left jail in a Land Rover chased by paparazzi on motorcycles Friday afternoon after posting a cash bond of 100,000 Rand (about $11,200). Another 900,000 Rand (about $100,800) is due by March 1, Nair said. He headed to his uncle's home after his release. He cannot return to the home where the shooting happened, has to give up his passport and can't go near an airport, Nair ruled. He also can't drink alcohol and must report to authorities four times a month. Read more: What's life like in a South African prison? Investigator's removal . The decision comes a day after the South African Police Service moved to remove Botha from the case. Botha, a 22-year detective, is accused of seven counts of attempted murder after allegedly chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk, according to officials. A spokeswoman for South Africa's prosecution service said the accusations would be little more than a ""speed bump"" in the case. Friend reacts . Model Vanessa Haywood, a South African model who is friends with Pistorius, said the murder charge doesn't fit with the kind-spirited man she knows. And she said she can relate to Pistorius' story of being filled with terror at the thought of an intruder. ""It's not the safest place in the world,"" she said of crime-ridden South Africa, where murder and carjacking cases are common. ""My own home is like a prison. His version of events isn't as far-fetched as people think it is."" 'Blade Runner' Pistorius earned the nickname ""Blade Runner"" as he competed on special carbon fiber blades in place of more traditional prosthetic limbs. He was born missing bones in his lower legs, and doctors amputated his legs below the knees when he was 11 months old. Pistorius attained fame as a symbol of triumph over adversity when won a challenge to compete in the London Olympics. While he failed to medal there, he smashed a record to win the men's 400-meter race in the Paralympic Games a few weeks later. He is considered a national hero in South Africa. Pistorius put his career on hold after his arrest, and sponsors Nike and Oakley suspended their contracts with him. Read more: Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- All through the night, limbs fell and transformers blew. Each sent a sharp crack that echoed across the neighborhood. When dawn broke, we could see the culprit -- and the damage: Pines in the park across the street stood naked like telephone poles, stripped of their branches under the weight of ice. Elsewhere, whole trees were felled. And across the city, the power was out, overhead lines brought down by ice, trees and boughs. The city in a forest was in the dark. And so were we. I was 12 when that happened -- in 1973 -- and I spent much of Wednesday waiting for another ""storm of the century"" to hit Atlanta. Snow, sleet and ice pummeled the Southeast, and hundreds of thousands lost power. But it was nothing like the ice storm that walloped the city 41 years ago and plunged the Capital of the New South into seven days of survival. This time, fortunately, most of the area dodged the bullet. That's not to say the storm didn't take a toll. At least two people's deaths were attributed to the weather, and others experienced close calls. But it could have been so much worse. This is the storm that forecasters feared: trees laden with ice bringing a city of 6 million to its knees for a week. I remember it like it was yesterday: . See 1973 footage of the storm from WAGA on YouTube . We lost power almost immediately -- and with it the heat. We had a gas furnace in the basement, but without its electric blower it was useless. Once the shock of what had happened wore off, and before my sister and I were allowed outside to explore the icy wonderland, my parents acted fast. Mom turned on the gas stove in the kitchen while Dad made space in the adjoining den for us to sleep. We were one of the lucky families; my folks hadn't gotten around to remodeling the kitchen in our prewar home with one of those newfangled electric ovens. We still had a source of heat. Dad dragged mattresses from our bedrooms and laid them out next to the pull-out sofa. He and Mom gathered piles of clothes and blankets, while my sister and I rounded up our favorite toys and books from our rooms. And then the doors to the rest of the house were closed. Sealed off. For the next six days, this would be our home: the kitchen, breakfast room and den-turned-bedroom heated by a life-saving gas oven. Candles in Coke bottles illuminated the darkness. Trips to the bathroom on the other side of the house were fast -- and freezing. To me, a space geek who followed all the Gemini and Apollo missions on live TV, our three-room hovel was a survival capsule where four Earthbound astronauts huddled for warmth, much like the three Apollo 13 spacemen who had turned their crippled craft into a makeshift life raft that brought them home alive. Of course our situation wasn't nearly as dire as that scenario, made famous later by Tom Hanks and Ron Howard. But the imagination of a 12-year-old works wonders in fighting the boredom of being cooped up with your parents and younger sister for a week. After a few days, our phone service was restored -- it had gone out with the power; this was decades before wireless technology and cell phones -- and my mother began calling her friends and cousins. One of my favorite cousins lived a few miles away, and the electricity was on at his family's house. They invited us to stay with them immediately. My parents held out hope that our power would be back soon, but after two more days of roughing it and no sign of Georgia Power on our street, they finally relented. We packed up the car and headed over to Herschel's place. His neighborhood was a mess -- trees down everywhere -- and on Saturday morning the men came out of their homes carrying chainsaws and gas cans. We watched in fascination as they ripped through the limbs, snow still on the ground, and turned debris into firewood. After helping haul wood, we were treated with mugs of hot chocolate. And by Sunday night -- a week after the storm started -- we learned that our power, too, was back. Turns out we were one of the last streets the linemen reached. They must have been exhausted. Now school loomed -- after a cold but glorious break -- and Dad would be returning to work. We went home and dismantled our lifeboat, and for the first time in a week spent the night in our own beds. What local reporters were calling the ""storm of the century"" was over. For longtime Atlantans, it was a storm we would never forget -- one that would make future storms a bit more bearable.","41 years ago, major ice storm felled trees, power lines across Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Sara Takanashi was studying ballet and piano, not flying through the air with a pair of skis on her feet. But since she discovered the sport of ski jumping at age 8, the Japanese teen has been poised to make Olympic history. Takanashi will compete in the first-ever women's ski jump event at the Sochi Olympic Games. At 17, she's already made a name for herself in the sport, winning a record 19 World Cups since the women's World Cup series was established in 2011. It's been a long battle for female ski jumpers to see their sport on the global stage. In 2006, the International Olympic Committee rejected a request to include women's ski jumping in the 2010 Vancouver Games. Several high-profile female ski jumpers sued the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC), which ended with a court determining the VANOC had, in fact, committed gender discrimination. However, the ruling did not require the committee to include the sport, and the dream of a 2010 women's competition disintegrated. Now, in Sochi, Takanashi and her fellow competitors will mark a watershed moment, and Takanashi's hometown of Kamikawa is cheering her on. According to the town's mayor, Yoshiji Sato, hundreds of pink banners and flags bearing the name ""SARA"" adorn the city. Her potential victory is important to them for many reasons: she would bridge (or jump?) a gender gap; she would end Japan's long Winter Olympics drought (the country has won only one gold medal since the 1998 Olympics in Nagano); and she would help position Japan as a ski jumping powerhouse. It's a lot of pressure for someone so young, but Takanashi -- and the female ski jumping community -- is ready to win. Takanashi will compete in the women's normal hill event on Tuesday.","Sara Takanashi, 17, traded in ballet shoes for skis at age 8 .

"(CNN) -- Oh, figure skating. Not again. Didn't anyone tell you? The Cold War is over. You are supposed to be reformed. At the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, South Korea's Yuna Kim, a 2010 Olympic gold medalist, skated an ethereally beautiful and outwardly perfect long program in the ladies free skating competition. She then lost gold to Russia's Adelina Sotnikova. Few saw that coming. On paper, Sotnikova had one more triple jump than Kim, including the triple loop, which Kim does not do. Although Sotnikova had an awkward moment on her own double loop, her spins were faster, her jumps higher, and unlike Kim, who looked exhausted at the end of her gorgeous skate, Sotnikova flew across the ice with great speed and then looked like she could do it all again. It should have been a great moment in Olympic sports: champion dethroned by a rising star, an upset, a shocker. Instead, it was controversial water cooler fodder the next day because the results raised so many questions: Did the youngster, a bit rough around the edges, deserve such high marks? Was she really better in just about every element, including her components mark, which was an astonishing 4.81 points higher than at the European championships last month? Setting aside her extreme margin of victory, there are reasons to think the judges got the podium right. Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko, for example, who had always accentuated an aggressive style over artistry, praised the marks, pleased that the judges rewarded Sotnikova's athleticism and degrees of difficulty over Kim's elegance. Figure skating is, after all, a sport. But if it wants to be treated like one, it has to act like one. There is a long history of controversy and scandal that continues to hang over the International Skating Federation, particularly as Russia's first individual female gold medalist (and on home ice, no less) brings familiar echoes of the Cold War. And during the team competition, there were murmurs, to be sure, over Evgeni Plushenko's high marks. It appeared to some that the judges bolstered his score based on his dynamic presence and the sentimental drama of the legendary champion's return to the ice to lead the home team to gold, rather than the difficulty of his program and his execution of it. Further, the sport had changed its scoring system to avoid this very situation. After the controversy that went down in Salt Lake in 2002 over the pairs competition, in which French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne tearfully confessed she had voted for the Russian pair in order to gain an advantage for the French ice dancers, the ISU revamped its scoring system. Gone were the days of the perfect six. With the new system, too, judges are now anonymous, in hopes of relieving the sport of its former biases. Back in 1994, for example, when Oksana Baiul took gold over Nancy Kerrigan, the scores broke down along familiar lines: Judges from Ukraine, China, eastern Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic went for Baiul. Canada, Japan, the United States and Great Britain put Kerrigan first. Although she skated cleanly, Kerrigan had doubled a triple jump; Baiul, considered the superior artist, did a two-footed landing, and performed no triple-triple combination. Four years later, while an East-West split wasn't apparent in the battle between Tara Lipinski's triple loop-triple loop combination and Michelle Kwan's ability to make judges weep, it remained unclear who favored technique and who performed artistry. While few can say they actually comprehend today's scoring system, it was designed to yield more balanced results supported by more intricate math. But the ISU needs to back these efforts with ethical and responsible judges. For the ladies free program, the panel included Russian Alla Shekhovtseva, who is married to the general director of the Russian skating federation, and Ukrainian Yuri Balkov, who had been suspended for attempting to fix the ice dancing competition in Nagano in 1998. And this after rumors had dogged the ice dancing competition, with accusations that the Russians and the Americans (maybe the Cold War is over!) had colluded to shut out Canada. There is likely little truth to the ice dancing gossip, but the ISU has done nothing to make us think otherwise. If the governing body wants us to talk about figure skating as a sport, it needs to ensure that it behaves like one, with credibility and transparency. Because while the ladies podium may have been right, with scoring this complex and judges this questionable, why on earth would we believe it?

"(CNN) -- Twenty years ago last month, the North American Free Trade Agreement was born. The goal of NAFTA was straightforward -- to encourage the free movement of goods and capital between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Few points in history have been as important in forging bonds between our three countries. While NAFTA is a relatively new pact that ties our nations, there are some things that go back far longer that bind us. Like the annual monarch butterfly migration, which started long before the trades, borders or foreign affairs were even an issue. There's no record telling us when monarch butterflies first began their journeys of up to 2,800 miles between southern Canada, the northern U.S., and central Mexico. It's easy to assume that an end date for the migrations is just as elusive, but reality tells a different story. In January, we got grim news from the central mountains of Mexico, the southernmost destination for migrating monarchs and sanctuary for their winter hibernation. According to surveys carried out by World Wildlife Fund, together with Mexico's National Commission on Protected Areas and other partners, the entire hibernating population of monarch butterflies in the 2013-2014 season occupied an area of forest not much bigger than a football field -- a mere 1.6 acres. This is a 44% drop from the previous season, and a continuation of the freefall migrating monarchs have taken since data collection began two decades ago. 2013 was the worst year for these butterflies in recorded history. Now people are talking about the migration disappearing altogether. There are several reasons for the decline, including extreme climate events in the U.S. and Canada as well as deforestation in Mexico. Yet the biggest culprit is likely the widespread extermination of milkweed, a flowering plant critical to monarch butterfly reproduction and development. Across much of the monarch's range, particularly in the midwestern U.S., milkweed has fallen victim en masse to changing land use and the advent of herbicide-resistant crops. In short, the cupboard is bare for monarch caterpillars, and as a result one of North America's most dazzling natural wonders is on the brink of vanishing entirely. If you've been fortunate enough to witness any part of the monarch spectacle, you understand why we can't let this happen. Whether a blanket of orange against a deep blue sky; a forest draped from root to leaf in dormant monarchs; or a single butterfly fluttering past you en route to join the masses, there is nothing quite like it. The proverbial silver lining to this dark news on migratory monarch numbers is that it may have come at an opportune time. Next Wednesday, February 19, U.S. President Obama will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President PeÃ±a Nieto at the North American Leaders' Summit in Toluca, Mexico. Toluca is just a short distance from the monarch's hibernation sites. During the summit, the butterflies will still be in nearby forests, poised to emerge from a four-month siesta that began in early winter. White House officials have said the three leaders will discuss ""a range of issues important to the daily lives of all of North America's people."" What isn't clear is whether the plight of the monarchs will make the agenda, and if the three countries bound by an age-old butterfly migration will together show resolve in making sure this unique connection isn't permanently severed. Whether monarchs flying south from Ontario, across America's heartland to converge on the oyamel fir trees of the Sierra Madre; gray whales hugging the California coast as they migrate from Baja to the Beaufort Sea and back again; or pronghorn antelope clinging to strongholds from the Northern Great Plains to the Sonoran Desert, the natural bonds connecting the U.S., Mexico and Canada stretch back millennia and transcend anything that can be traded or written on paper. They are bonds to take pride in, that unite the countries of North America in unexpected, beautiful ways. Something we simply cannot let disappear. The summit in Toluca may be the last hope we have of saving the monarch migration. President PeÃ±a Nieto himself has been committed to the conservation of the monarch sanctuaries of Estado de Mexico since he served as governor there from 2005 to 2011. He knows firsthand the significant efforts and sacrifices of Mexico's local indigenous communities, authorities and civil society organizations to protect the sanctuaries. He also knows the important contribution the butterflies bring to local social and economic well-being. Only a joint effort from all three countries will turn the tide in favor of the monarch. Our leaders must re-energize efforts to conserve the monarch butterfly, like those under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation that was born alongside NAFTA. This plan must include concrete actions to halt destruction of milkweed in the U.S. and Canada, restore monarch habitat in all three countries, and strengthen law enforcement in Mexico to stop deforestation. If together we could pull off something as big and ambitious as NAFTA, solving the monarch crisis must be within our means. We urge our heads-of-state, on behalf of all the people of North America, to use this opportunity to commit to the long-term preservation of one of our most ancient and spectacular bonds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carter Roberts and Omar Vidal.","President Obama and his counterparts from Canada and Mexico will meet at summit .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The search for an aircraft carrying 18 people, which has been missing in the mountains of western Nepal since Sunday afternoon, continued Monday morning, authorities said. The 40-year-old Canadian-made Twin Otter aircraft in question belongs to state-owned Nepal Airlines. It was flying from the tourist town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Kathmandu, en route to Jumla, a remote town about 600 kilometers (373 miels) northeast of Kathmandu. ""It was supposed to land at 1:45 p.m., but it did not arrive,"" said Bimlesh Karna at the rescue coordination center at Tribhuvan International Airport. The flight usually takes an hour. The plane was flying in inclement weather as it had been raining and snowing across the country for the past few days. Among the 18 on board are three crew members and a Danish national. Of the 17 Nepalese, one is a child, Karna said. Mingma Lama, senior superintendent of police, is heading a 150-member police search team. He said locals have reported that pieces of the aircraft have been found. Bam Bahadur Bhandari, regional police chief in Pokhara, also said locals had seen wreckage. He said a search helicopter had also spotted the wreckage but could not find a place to land. The disappearance of the plane has again raised concern over Nepal's air safety record. There were two fatal air crashes each year from 2010 to 2012 in this Himalayan country.","Authorities say 18 people were aboard an aircraft that's gone missing in Nepal .

"(CNN) -- After Venus Williams beat Caroline Wozniacki at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, it looked as if a first all Williams tennis final in five years was on the cards. But someone forgot to tell Alize Cornet. The Frenchwoman stunned a sluggish Serena Williams in the second semifinal Friday, meaning a Williams versus Williams clash for silverware -- they haven't met in a finale since the year-end championships in 2009 -- will have to wait. It was Serena Williams' first tournament since a back injury hampered the 17-time grand slam champion at the Australian Open, and she accepted a wildcard from organizers to fend off the boredom from just practicing. Perhaps rust was an issue. Serena Williams likened her play against Cornet in the 64 64 reverse to a 'turtle' and gave herself the harshest of grades. ""I started out extremely slow,"" Williams was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. ""I have actually been looking at a turtle every day -- it's a really cute turtle in the hotel. Maybe I was too influenced by it. I need to play better than that if I want to be playing on the professional tour. Maybe I can go to the amateurs. ""I haven't felt good this whole week, to be honest, just from my first match. ""She played really well. I didn't play well. I tried, though. I just kept hitting errors. I don't think I've made that many errors in a match in at least three, maybe four years. I think out of a 10, I was at, like, -283, so... wow."" Cornet, France's No. 1, had lost all three of her previous encounters against Serena Williams and was 0-17 lifetime against the top four, but she served impeccably against the American. She took advantage of Williams' normally strong second serve, winning 62 percent of those points, and did her usual scrambling from the baseline. ""It's my best ever win, but I haven't realized it yet,"" Cornet told reporters. ""I played a very good match. I didn't even realize who I was playing and that's the way I had to be. ""I forgot it was Serena on the other side and just got on with my game."" Venus Williams has been slowed by Sjogren's Syndrome, injuries and age but the elder Williams continues to flourish in Dubai, winning her last 14 matches. The 33-year-old owned a 4-0 record against former world No. 1 Wozniacki -- without losing a set -- prior to the semifinals and once again the Dane was overpowered, losing this time 63 62. ""I feel like I've just gotten so much better since my first round to now, feeling comfortable on the court, feeling comfortable when I'm behind, feeling comfortable when I'm in the lead,"" Williams was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. ""It reminds me of when I first came on tour, just having to learn a lot, and I feel like I'm learning those lessons all over again. ""I had a lot of tough losses, and I realized I had to go through it. Even if I didn't necessarily get the result I wanted, I realized I was getting better. ""For me, and for every player, you just have to keep stepping up to the line and believing in yourself."" If Cornet downs Venus Williams, she would become one of the few players to beat the sisters at the same tournament. Cornet, though, trails Venus Williams 3-0 in their head-to-heads.","Alize Cornet beats world No. 1 Serena Williams in straight sets in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- The sea of signs and flags held with defiant pride may have said ""31"" -- but the history books will note that Juventus clinched a record-extending 29th Italian league title Sunday, with three matches to spare. The ""Calciopoli"" match-fixing scandal which saw the club stripped of its 2005 and 2006 scudettos and relegated to Serie B still looms large in the history of the ""Old Lady"" of Turin, but successes in the last two seasons have restored Juve's fortunes as Italy's top football team. ""It wasn't easy for us to reclaim our title this year,"" said coach Antonio Conte after the 1-0 win over Palermo that ended the hopes of second-placed Napoli and prompted Juve fans to invade the pitch at the Alps stadium to get keepsakes of the day, with some even cutting up the goal nets. Conte has had his own problems, having missed the start of this season after being banned for failing to report an instance of match-fixing while he was the coach of Siena -- the 10-month punishment was later reduced to four on appeal, and he returned to the touchline in December. ""Starting out as favorites doesn't do you any favors and we knew that the Champions League would take it out of us on a physical level,"" said the 43-year-old, whose team reached the quarterfinals of Europe's top club competition. ""However, we've had a triumphant charge to the title, sealing the achievement with three games to spare. The defeat against Inter gave us greater hunger but the loss against Sampdoria affected me even more, I promised it wouldn't happen again and stayed true to my word. ""I dreamt of returning and winning here and that's precisely what has happened. I'm in the right place. We've achieved extraordinary things over the past few years, but you always need to raise the bar in football, taking into account the economic difficulties that Italian football is experiencing. ""So it's only right that I sit down with the club at the end of the season to plan for the future. I'll always be grateful to (president) Andrea Agnelli and owe him a great deal, and that's why I want the situation to be clear. But I want to stay here."" Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal scored the goal that clinched title, netting from the penalty spot after an hour following a foul by Massimo Donati on striker Mirko Vucinic. It was his 10th Serie A goal this season, and 15th overall, making him Juve's top scorer. The victory, which came despite the 83rd-minute red card to Paul Pogba, put Juve 14 points clear of Napoli, who then beat Inter Milan 3-1 later Sunday to reduce the deficit again. Edinson Cavani netted a hat-trick to pass 100 goals for Napoli and extend his league-leading tally to 26 this season, while eighth-placed Inter look likely to miss out on European football next season. AC Milan went four points clear in the battle for third place, beating Torino 1-0 thanks to an 84th-minute goal from striker Mario Balotelli to capitalize on Fiorentina's defeat to fifth-placed Roma on Saturday. Meanwhile, Ajax clinched a third successive Dutch league title on Sunday, beating bottom club Willem II Tilburg 5-0 to earn a 32nd Eredivisie crown overall with one match to play. Coach Frank de Boer emulated the feats of Rinus Michels (1966-68) and Louis van Gaal (1994-96) in winning a treble of titles, having also won five as a player. It kept Ajax four points clear of second-placed PSV Eindhoven, who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-2. Paris Saint-Germain's bid for a first French title since 1994 faltered with a 1-1 draw against Valenciennes that left the capital club seven points clear with three matches to play. PSG had key defender Thiago Silva sent off after Gael Danic put the midtable visitors ahead, but Brazilian Alex netted a late equalizer. Marseille had earlier ensured PSG could not wrap up the title this weekend by beating Bastia 2-1 on Saturday.","Sunday's win over Palermo gives Juventus a 29th Italian league title .

"(CNN) -- When music superstar Enrique Iglesias hits the road for a tour these days he brings along more than just the music. The Latin music crossover sensation has joined forces with a unique organization -- Love Hope Strength, a self-proclaimed ""rock 'n' roll cancer organization"" whose goal is to ""save lives one concert at a time."" Iglesias invited the group on tour with him to set up shop at his concerts and perform bone-marrow donation drives as a part of its ""Get on the List"" campaign to find donors for the National Marrow Registry. ""When you go up on stage and you look at my fans, it's so diverse ethnically, and I thought it would be perfect,"" Iglesias says. ""I thought we would get people of different races to be able to register for this organization, and I thought that would really help."" The diversity of his audience is exactly why the partnership with Iglesias is so vital to the Love Hope Strength Foundation's mission. ""Only 10% of the overall national marrow registry is made up of Hispanic population. So when you're Hispanic looking for a transplant, your chances of finding a match significantly decrease due to the lack of that population on the registry,"" says Executive Director Shannon Henn. ""So by reaching out to a community through someone like Enrique Iglesias, who has such an incredible Hispanic following, we're able to register people to the database that we never could before."" Iglesias is now well-established in the world of entertainment, and he realizes that this is a powerful place that can be used for the benefit of others. ""I think you reach a certain age where you feel responsible. You can communicate with your fans especially nowadays with Twitter, with Facebook, all these ways, and obviously the live shows, so any time I feel like I can do something that's positive and that's good, it's a good thing,"" Iglesias says. The process is simple. The LHS team sets up a table with plenty of information about bone-marrow donation and then asks concert-goers as they pass if they would like to sign up. Once a volunteer ensures they meet the requirements for donation, one of the LHS team members takes a cotton-tipped swab and swabs the inside of the donor's mouth. That's it. That's all it takes, and the donor can carry on to enjoy the show. If a match is found, the donor will then be notified and then possibly help to save a life. ""What I hope to take away from this experience is people realize that it's important, that they can actually make a huge impact. And we've got to register as many people as possible, and there's a lot of people out there, a lot of kids, that need this,"" says Iglesias. Love Hope Strength is an international organization that raises awareness for the needs of cancer patients worldwide. Rock 'n' roll is at the very roots of LHS, as it was co-founded in 2007 by leukemia survivor Mike Peters of the Welsh rock band The Alarm and his friend and fellow survivor James Chippendale. The men created this organization to ensure that awareness, early detection and proper treatment are not a luxury but instead available to all in need worldwide. In addition to the ""Get on the List"" campaign that the group carries out at rock concerts, LHS builds and supports cancer centers all over the globe. LHS purchased the first mammography machine ever in Nepal and funded a mobile unit for cancer screenings in remote parts of Peru. The group also performs concerts in extreme locations like Mt. Everest to raise money for its cause. To learn more, visit LoveHopeStrength.org.","Enrique Iglesias invited Love Hope Strength to perform bone-marrow drives at his concerts .

"(CNN) -- This is all we know for sure: . Kari Bowerman, 27, and Cathy Huynh, 26, were backpacking in Vietnam while on break from their jobs teaching English in South Korea. On July 30, the friends were admitted to Khanh Hoa General Hospital in Nha Trang. Both were vomiting, had difficulty breathing and showed signs of severe dehydration. Huynh was eventually released from the hospital. She returned later that night to hear the devastating news -- three hours after being admitted, Bowerman had gone into respiratory failure and died. Two days later, Huynh was dead. What we don't know for sure is what triggered their deaths. The travelers' stories are just the latest in a string of mysterious tourist deaths in Southeast Asia. Investigators with the World Health Organization suspect poisoning is to blame, but determining the origin has proven difficult. Meanwhile, friends and family are desperate for answers. ""It's been a nightmare trying to get information,"" Bowerman's sister Jennifer Jaques said. ""No hospital reports. No police report. No nothing. Whatever happened to her we need to make sure doesn't happen to somebody else."" Not yet determined . Almost immediately, international media reports began linking the deaths to an incident in Thailand in June in which two Canadian sisters died. A hotel maid found Noemi and Audrey Belanger, 25 and 20, in their room on Phi Phi Island more than 12 hours after their deaths. The sisters were covered in vomit, according to CBC News. In February 2011, New Zealand resident Sarah Carter, 23, died in Chiang Mai, Thailand, after arriving at a local hospital with low blood pressure, difficulty breathing and dehydration from vomiting, according to the New Zealand television network TV3. In the Downtown Inn where Carter had stayed, the Bangkok Post says three other visitors -- a Thai tour guide and an elderly British couple -- died between January and May 2011. Other media reports linked Bowerman's and Huynh's deaths to the 2009 deaths of Jill St. Onge and Julie Bergheim, who had similar symptoms in adjacent rooms at the Laleena Guesthouse on the island of Phi Phi. (The hotel has since changed its name). Speculation on the cause arose with each death -- ranging from alcohol poisoning to something the victims ate. As Bowerman's relatives read story after story, they realized they weren't the only family frustrated and confused. The cause of death in every case was eerily similar to the one written on Kari's death report: ""not yet determined."" Global citizens . Ashley Bowerman says it was ""heartbreaking"" to unzip her sister's backpack. Inside was a big map of Vietnam, a book about the history of the region and a list of historical sites she wanted to visit. Her belongings had been returned home to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where the girls grew up. Fundraisers helped offset the more than $10,000 it cost the family to repatriate her cremated body. Ashley is still in shock. Kari -- beautiful, adventurous, full-of-life Kari -- is dead. Born just a year and 10 days apart, the sisters talked every day, even when Kari was halfway around the world. ""She was the funniest person I know,"" Ashley said. ""She always made me laugh. She never wasted a day ... every weekend she was doing something exciting."" Both Bowerman and Huynh were experienced travelers. Bowerman had applied for the teaching abroad program after graduating from Winona State University in Minnesota. She had already taught for two years in South Korea when the school asked her to come back for a second stint. ""Those kids adored her,"" Jennifer Jaques said. Huynh, originally from Hamilton, Ontario, had vacationed in China, Cuba and the United States, her high school friend Jetty Ly told CNN. Both women had been to Vietnam before and Huynh spoke the language. Among the belongings returned to Huynh's family was detailed information about the Canadian Embassy and emergency contact numbers. ""I encouraged her to follow her dreams, go where her heart wants to go,"" Ly said. ""I wanted to live vicariously through her adventures. But not like this."" When Bowerman's friend Jason Von Seth posted about her death on Facebook, e-mails started flooding in. A frequent traveler himself, Von Seth had a large network of international acquaintances whom had never heard about this series of mysterious deaths and expressed concern. He launched a Facebook page last week called Protected Travels. He said he hopes the site will become a community of global citizens who are eager to educate others on the challenges facing travelers abroad. Five ways to stay healthy while traveling abroad . At the top of the Facebook page is a collection of photos of those who have died in circumstances similar to Huynh and Bowerman. ""All these girls, you see their faces,"" Von Seth said. ""(They're) all young, 20-somethings that just wanted to have a life-changing experience."" Seeking answers . In 2011, TV3 traveled to Chiang Mai, Thailand, to search for evidence in the Sarah Carter case. Show producers spoke with Dr. Ron McDowall, a United Nations toxic chemical consultant, who had reviewed Carter's pathology reports and believed she died of pesticide ingestion. The swabs collected by TV3 in the Downtown Inn showed moderate levels of chlorpyrifos, McDowall told CNN in an email last week. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, chlorpyrifos can cause nausea, dizziness, confusion and, in high levels, respiratory paralysis and death. The chemical is banned for use in homes and hotels in most countries, McDowall said. Yet it's still legal in Thailand and Vietnam, he said, and was included in the pesticide sprayed in the Downtown Inn. ""The level of (chlorpyrifos) in this product is quite low and should not normally cause a problem. However, in my work we have found many sprayer companies 'top up' the level of (chlorpyrifos) when they are battling bedbugs in Asia."" Evidence for the insecticide theory is mounting. Thai police recently announced they found traces of the insect repellent DEET in the Belanger sisters' bodies, according CBC. Investigators believe the DEET was added as an ingredient to a popular cocktail served on the island. The Downtown Inn was torn down this summer after the Thailand Disease Control Department concluded three of the deaths were ""probably connected to the use of pesticides,"" according to the Bangkok Post. The problem is that chemical poisoning is very hard to verify, McDowall says. Chlorpyrifos' half-life -- or the amount of time that passes before half of the original amount disappears -- in humans is about one day. Vietnamese authorities have released very little information about the cause of death for Bowerman and Huynh. Investigators might know more when autopsy results come back in a couple of weeks. But for the survivors, just knowing the answer isn't good enough anymore. They are determined to raise awareness and are searching for the next step, whether that's better education, tougher insecticide regulation or banning these chemicals outright. ""Cathy could have been alive today,"" said Ly. ""I feel like if we can at least let the world know that this is happening ... maybe when a parent's daughter (or) son tells them that they are backpacking in South Asia, it will not be the last goodbye.""","Kari Bowerman, 27, and Cathy Huynh, 26, died in Vietnam on July 30 .

"(CNN) -- Facebook on Monday appeared to have quietly unveiled a new feature designed to let people see which Facebook users are nearby at any given time. By Tuesday, however, the feature seemed to have been pulled from the Internet. The company called the feature ""Find Friends Nearby,"" and on Monday it was available through Facebook's mobile apps and website despite the fact that it hadn't been formally announced. The blog ReadWriteWeb dubbed the feature a ""stalking app"" because it could open people up to potentially awkward or threatening interactions with strangers on the social network who know you're nearby. To test out the feature on Monday, Facebook users could go to fb.com/ffn in a browser, or follow this path in the Facebook's mobile apps: menu > apps > find friends > other tools > Find Friends Nearby. Surprise! Teens are sneaky online . Facebook users had to opt in to the feature by going to that site, otherwise their profiles would not appear in a list of people who are nearby. The blog TechCrunch first reported on the feature Sunday after a non-Facebook developer tipped off the site to the feature's existence. In a comment on that site's post about the new feature, Facebook developer Ryan Patterson, who says he developed Find Friends Nearby, described how he hopes the app will be used: . ""For me, the ideal use case for this product is the one where when you're out with a group of people whom you've recently met and want to stay in contact with. Facebook search might be effective, or sharing your vanity addresses or business cards, but this tool provides a really easy way to exchange contact information with multiple people with minimal friction."" A Facebook spokeswoman declined to provide additional information. ""We are constantly testing new features but have nothing more to share at this time,"" she wrote in an e-mail to CNN. Reactions to the news were mixed in the tech blogosphere. The site Gizmodo found the new feature to be potentially useful -- and dangerous. ""You meet a cute somebody at a concert, you're like, 'Hey, we should be Facebook friends,' and they're like 'OMG, totes!' Then rather than having to spell your names and search around, you've got a much smaller group of people to choose from. I guess that's great, right?"" Brent Rose wrote on that tech news site. But Rose added: ""Sure, it'd be great to easily add a contact quicker, but imagine this: some creeper has been molesting you with his/her eyes all night. She opens the app, can kinda recognize your face from your profile picture, and now said creeper knows (your) name and possibly some of your personal info."" That would be the downside. Others said the app simply isn't ready for prime time. The blog Engadget called the app ""fairly primitive,"" and The Next Web said it amounts to ""nothing more than a parlor trick at this point"" since other location-based friend finders haven't caught on with the general public despite their buzziness in tech circles. Facebook recently acquired a company called Glancee, which did something similar to the Find Friends Nearby feature. So there's speculation that the company's technology may have contributed to the new Facebook feature. Patterson, however, the Facebook developer, wrote on TechCrunch's post that he created the feature during a hackathon. Other similar mobile ""social discovery"" apps include Highlight, Banjo and Sonar. Some of these apps will also show you nearby friends of friends or even strangers who share your interests, based on your social-network profile. It's unclear exactly how much information the Find Friends Nearby feature gave away. On Monday, users had to log into that site intentionally to see a list of people who are nearby, and that list of people appeared to be quite limited. Also to be determined is how large of a radius the feature employed. Did it search for people who are within eyeshot of you? Or within a mile? Let us know what you think in the comments section.

"(CNN) -- Try this for a spine-tingling moment: An immensely popular novelist who specializes in eerie, conspiratorial mysteries portrays an evildoer who is, gulp, an awful lot like yourself. And the word ""popular"" doesn't really come close to describing this novelist, whose every book is launched in multiple languages and shoved into movie production (starring Tom Hanks) before the manuscript is bound in hard copy. It's Dan Brown, whose ""Inferno,"" the latest tale of Robert Langdon, the Harvard iconographer-turned-homicide-hunter, hinges on the deeds of a dastardly biologist who kidnaps the director general of the World Health Organization and compels her to heed his insanity while locked inside the Council on Foreign Relations in Manhattan. I am the only trained biologist working in the New York headquarters of the Council on Foreign Relations, where I am senior fellow for global health. I've never kidnapped WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan, but I have been known to corner her for some whispered one-on-ones. The day after ""Inferno"" was launched with the usual Dan Brown-associated brouhaha, my brother e-mailed ""OMG!"" telling me he was devouring the thing on his e-reader. All day long I received notes from worried friends and family, concerned that Brown's conspiracy-minded readership would turn its sights on the council, or me, and my global health work. Brown's ability to raise this kind of intrigue was demonstrated with his first blockbuster, ""The Da Vinci Code"" which spawned an entire genre of dark Vatican-oriented novels that imagine self-mutilating, power-grabbing monsters lurking in medieval dungeons beneath St. Peter's Basilica. With ""Angels and Demons,"" Brown had millions of readers convinced that an 18th-century group called The Illuminati was secretly pulling strings of power all over the world, the group allegedly (in Internet conspiracy canon) dominated by David Rockefeller and his pals at ... you guessed it, the Council on Foreign Relations. So it was with more than a little trepidation that I opened ""Inferno"" on my Kindle. I can now report that Dan Brown has produced a silly, but interesting and provocative book, delving into biologist Paul Ehrlich's old ""Population Bomb"" ideas, synthetic biology, dual-use research, human genome alteration and even hypothetical germ line mutation of people. Perhaps Brown has grown bored with only castigating Catholicism, for he now chucks his aspersions on science. Of course it's not realistic or accurate science, given the author's penchant for mixing Dante's 14th-century poem ""Inferno"" with 21st-century gene sequencing. Dante's original ""Inferno"" guided readers through the most explicit journey of hell and purgatory ever committed to paper. Brown's ""Inferno"" takes a 21st-century spin through a hell of man-made microbes, pandemics and human overpopulation. The Brown hell is just close enough to the edges of biological reality to make for thriller reading. Biology as a discipline is indeed delving into human-directed evolution and creation of life forms in ways that ought to be scrutinized. And while the real work of science is not dark and genocidal, as Brown portrays, there are risks of accidental release of modified organisms and, less likely, terrorism that merit wider attention. For those who fear Brown's version of inferno might come true, here is some spoiler-alert news from the real world. The private C-130 that ""Inferno"" imagines the WHO owns, jetting about the world to stop disease, is not just a fantasy, it would be impossible. Far from affording its own jet, WHO is in deep financial straits, now facing its third year of painful budget deficits and layoffs, leaving its epidemic response division tapped-out for 2013, Chan has told me. In Brown's imaginings, the European Union's version of the Centers for Disease Control has a huge secret SWAT team of hulking, fully armed, military-trained disease-fighters that swoop into countries, violating all local law with impunity, to stop epidemics. Of course there is no such team, nor does the budget-strained U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have Kevlar-wearing, Uzi-toting microbe hunters. On Brown's version of planet Earth these disease-fighers have such limitless power that prime ministers immediately take their calls, and armies and police forces the world over are at their command. Margaret Chan might dream of having enough clout to command an obstinate national leader to cease covering up his country's epidemic, but in truth her only tools are persuasion, bluffing and the rage of world media. Wouldn't it be sweet if the impoverished WHO actually did have a budget large enough to finance an agency C-130 and rapid response team? The Kindle is switched off. Back to work at the Council on Foreign Relations, trying to create and push policies that spare populations of millions the scourges of disease, malnutrition and climate change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurie Garrett.","Laurie Garrett: Evil character in Dan Brown's ""Inferno"" alarmingly close to her own job .

"New York (CNN) -- A former Army sergeant is facing conspiracy charges in a federal sting operation that focused on a team he allegedly supervised in what the team thought was international drug trafficking and planned killings, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. Joseph Hunter, 48, led a ""security team"" of former soldiers from around the world to assist people he believed were Colombian narcotic traffickers, federal authorities allege. In fact, the ""traffickers"" were U.S. informants, according to federal authorities. Hunter, along with Timothy Vamvakias, 42, an American who also served in the U.S. Army; Dennis Gogel, 27, a German national who served in the German armed forces; and two other men acted as the security team that surveyed the transportation of what they believed to be illegal drugs by Colombian dealers. The men acted as ""contract killers"" who planned to eliminate anyone who threatened the drug trade -- including law enforcement agents, a press release from the U.S. attorney's office said. Specifically, authorities said in a Friday news release that the men planned an assassination in Liberia ""for a six-figure payday,"" targeting a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a person purportedly cooperating with the DEA. The killings apparently never took place. Hunter, Vamvakias and Gogel are each charged with separate counts of conspiracy to murder a law enforcement agent, conspiracy to kill a person to prevent communications to law enforcement, conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, and other drug and gun related charges, according to federal documents. Each count carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. The story as spelled out in a federal indictment starts in early 2012 when Hunter believed he had made contact with Colombian drug traffickers. Hunter recruited a team of four individuals to assist the ""drug traffickers"" he had met, collecting his alleged team members' resumes via e-mail, the indictment said. Hunter told his men that they could expect to see ""tons of cocaine and millions of dollars,"" according to the indictment. The men Hunter thought were Colombian traffickers ""were in fact confidential sources for the DEA,"" according to the indictment. ""Hunter spoke with the (confidential sources) about serving as the head of security for the ... purported Colombian drug trafficking operation, and Hunter provided ... resumes for the individuals he had selected as prospective members of the security team,"" the indictment said. 5 law officers among 70 charged in Arkansas drug trafficking bust . From there, the indictment tells a complex story that Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara compared to the work of a well-known spy novelist. ""The bone-chilling allegations in today's Indictment read like they were ripped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel,"" Bharara said Friday. ""The charges tell a tale of an international band of mercenary marksmen who enlisted their elite military training to serve as hired guns for evil ends."" The indictment details how the defendants traveled to various countries in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean and met with the government's confidential sources -- apparently the same unidentified sources Hunter believed to be Colombian traffickers -- as they allegedly discussed various criminal enterprises. The meetings were recorded by the informants, according to the indictment. There are references to talks among the alleged team members about ""bonus work,"" which Hunter explained meant assassinations, the indictment said. ""Hunter explained that he had in fact previously committed acts of violence for pay -- including, among other things, arranging for the murders of two female real estate agents,"" the indictment said. But the indictment did not elaborate on those purported killings or say where or when they supposedly took place. Bharara said at a news conference Friday that those two killings claimed by Hunter in his talks occurred outside the United States and ""there is corroboration for the allegations in the indictment."" He did not elaborate beyond that statement. The group's work with the confidential informants took them to Thailand, where in late March, according to the indictment, the team provided ""counter-surveillance"" to make sure local officials did not know about boats that were being loaded with what team members believed to be cocaine. A similar scenario played out in the Bahamas in late June, with the team -- again working with the government's informants -- providing surveillance during the loading of an airplane with what they thought was cocaine, according to the indictment. The alleged plan to kill a DEA agent and a ""snitch"" was elaborate, the indictment said, including meetings in multiple countries with the actual killing to take place in Liberia -- chosen so their passports would not be stamped. According to the indictment, the men requested several guns, including submachine guns, pistols and silencers, as well as latex face masks that would make them appear to be of a different race. Hunter was arrested in Thailand and was expected to arrive in New York on Friday evening. He is expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan federal court Saturday. Vamvakias and Gogel, who also were arrested abroad, were brought to New York and were in court Thursday afternoon. The two other men involved in the scheme were arrested on Wednesday in Estonia at the request of the United States. According to the indictment, Hunter served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 2004, attaining the rank of sergeant first class. He led multiple squads, served as a sniper instructor and trained soldiers in marksmanship . Puerto Rico: A forgotten front in America's drug war?

"(CNN) -- Michelle Obama says her call for the country to fight childhood obesity isn't about physical appearances, but rather quality of life. ""Teachers are seeing the challenges that kids with weight issues are having -- not being able to participate in gym, feeling a little more sluggish,"" the first lady told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Tuesday. ""It's not about weight ... it's about fitness and it's about overall nutrition."" Obama earlier Tuesday introduced the Let's Move campaign, which aims to reduce childhood obesity in the United States within a generation. Obama asked parents, teachers, physicians, coaches and kids to get involved and suggested they look at the new Let's Move Web site for helpful tips, strategies and updates on beating obesity in children. The first lady, during the ""Larry King Live"" interview, said a doctor got her own family to take a hard look at its exercise and eating habits, even though she thought she already was doing everything she could to promote healthy lifestyles for her own grade-school daughters. The family, while her husband was campaigning, was eating too much fast food, she said. A pediatrician ""saw a little uptick in the kids' [body mass index], and he kind of pulled me aside,"" she said. ""I was shocked at first because I thought I was doing what I was supposed to do, and I hadn't noticed any changes in my kids, so it was a little bit shocking and a little disorienting,"" Obama said. ""But I went home, and it was kind of a wake-up call, and we made some changes even with busy schedules."" The changes, she said, included smaller portion sizes, more cooked meals, a dessert ban on weekdays and substituting sugary drinks with milk, water and fresh-squeezed juices. ""The point is that small changes made a difference,"" she said. That interview aired hours after she announced the Let's Move initiative at the White House. The program focuses on what families, communities and the public and private sectors can do to help fight childhood obesity, which she and health experts have termed an epidemic in the United States. ""There are more and more kids with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure today than ever before. Things we used to see only in adults,"" she said at the White House. From more farmers markets to increasing physical activity in schools or expanding and modernizing the President's Physical Fitness Challenge, the first lady said the Obama administration will partner with public health professionals and private companies to address the obesity issue. ""About one-third of our children are overweight or obese. None of us want that for our country,"" she said. ""It's time to get moving."" Mayors, doctors, members of the Cabinet, and leaders in sports, entertainment and business joined the first lady for the announcement. Former NFL player Tiki Barber introduced several speakers, including a pediatrician, an urban farmer and mayors from Mississippi and Massachusetts. President Obama signed a memorandum earlier Tuesday morning establishing a federal task force to tackle childhood obesity, calling it ""one of the most urgent health issues that we face in this country."" ""We think that this has enormous promise in improving the health of our children, in giving support to parents to make the kinds of healthy choices that oftentimes are very difficult,"" he said. The task force, according to the memorandum, will have 90 days to craft a plan encouraging ""optimal coordination"" between the federal government and both the private and nonprofit sectors. Several Cabinet members, including the secretaries of Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, will serve on the task force to complement Michelle Obama's public awareness effort. In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the first lady urged America's parents to turn off the television, drink more water and serve smaller portions to curb the growing public health problem. She stressed that parents need the tools to make it easier to understand how to help their kids stay healthy. She said many parents know certain foods are bad for their kids, but don't know the solutions. ""They feel like the deck is stacked against them. They feel guilty,"" she said. ""We need to help them."" The administration, in partnership with public health professionals and private companies, will address these issues in several ways: . First, according to Obama, package labels should be easier to read. By the end of the year, the Food and Drug Administration will begin working with retailers and manufacturers to adopt new nutritionally sound and consumer friendly front-of-package labeling to provide 65 million parents in America and other caregivers with easy access to the information they need to make healthy choices for their children. Talking to tweens about healthy eating . The average soda contains 110 calories, yet many kids drink one or more a day. In an effort to make kids and parents more aware of these calories, the American Beverage Association has voluntarily committed to put calorie labels on the front of its cans, bottles, vending and fountain machines within two years. The label will reflect total calories per container, up to 20 ounces and 12-ounce serving size in multiserve containers. School lunches also will play a big role. According to the White House, on school days, many American children consume more than half their daily calories at school, and more than 30 million of these kids participate in the National School Lunch Program. With this program, students will have access to healthier food in schools through several initiatives: . • The Obama administration is requesting an investment of an additional $10 billion over 10 years, starting in 2011, to improve the quality of the school lunch and breakfast programs, increase the number of kids participating and ensure that schools have the resources they need to make program changes. • With the money, more fruits, vegetables, whole-grain foods and low-fat dairy products will be served in school cafeterias. • Major school food suppliers are to decrease the sugar, fat and salt in school meals over 10 years, and also increase whole grains and produce served within 10 years. Obama also set an ambitious goal to eliminate food deserts, which are areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. ""Let's move to ensure all our families have access to healthy, affordable food in their communities,"" she said. ""We're making a commitment to completely eliminating food deserts in America. And we plan to do that within seven years."" Go to USDA's food environment atlas to get local information on community health and food choices . The Center for Science in the Public Interest applauded Obama for taking on childhood obesity. The ""first lady has the clout and visibility to change that and mobilize the nation's resources to address the problem,"" the nonprofit health advocacy group said. Obama encouraged doctors and parents to work together to help kids stay healthy. In this initiative, the American Academy of Pediatrics will educate its members about obesity to make sure pediatricians regularly measure a child's body mass index and identify a weight problem early. If a child is getting heavy, the physician can write an official prescription for healthy, active living. Body mass index is a number -- calculated from height, weight, age and gender -- that measures body fat. Calculate your BMI . On Tuesday, Dr. Judith Palfrey, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said there are ways to encourage activity -- like making charts recording children's TV time and having children set jump-roping, running and fitness goals. ""This is a long-term commitment to our children's health,"" she said.  ""It will take a concerted effort among all of us -- the whole nation -- to create healthier communities for our children.  We must take on this challenge."" The number of overweight children ages 6 to 19 has tripled since 1970, a 2007 New England Journal of Medicine study found. Obama concluded her statements quoting President Franklin Roosevelt. ""We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future."" CNN's Val Willingham, Suzanne Malveaux, Alan Silverleib and Madison Park contributed to this report.","NEW: Michelle Obama on ""Larry King Live"": Small changes can make a difference .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Africans have expressed their hopes that the next pope will be the first from their continent -- with a majority believing it would mean the Catholic Church becoming more conservative. The survey of 20,000 people, conducted on mobile phones across 11 nations, also exposed big divisions among Africans about the future direction of the church, including faith, homosexuality and race. ""An African pope will bring about more unity on the continent and confidence in Africans,"" said one woman from Zimbabwe, while a young Nigerian man polled said an African pope ""will eradicate immoralities, such as same-sex marriage."" CNN commissioned the survey, partnering with Jana.com, which has pioneered polling in developing countries with fast-growing mobile networks. Jana, meaning 'people' in Sanskrit, rewards participants in their mobile phone surveys with additional air time. Mobile phone use has skyrocketed in Africa, climbing from 9.2 million subscribers in 2000 to more than 648 million subscribers in 2011 -- more users than the U.S. or the European Union, according to the World Bank. More than 80% of those surveyed believe their continent is ready for an African pope, but only 61% thought the rest of the world was too. Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana is viewed by Vatican observers as the top African contender, according to John Allen, CNN analyst and correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. Most respondents (86%) thought an African pope would increase support for Catholicism in Africa, while just over 50% believed the church would become more conservative if that happened. On the other hand, 21% thought that it would become less conservative. CNN also asked respondents what an African pope would mean for them and for Africa. The comments revealed a wide range of views on the church's role. Check out our Wordle of responses to the survey . ""It would help strengthen the faith and belief of all African Catholics,"" said one Ghanaian. ""They will feel a part of the church."" ""Will he stop the ongoing war in some African countries?"" asked a Namibian responder. ""He may be like the rest of them and just stay in the church; anyway they don't make any difference in Africa."" Read full results of the survey carried out for CNN by Jana . A Zimbabwean man surveyed also said he feared that an African pope would not be treated equally to other popes. ""I think at first people might not accept him and it would take a long time for him to blend in, so his impact will not be that great."" Jana conducted the poll between 7-11 March 2013 with mobile phone users from Lesotho, Rwanda, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Uganda, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.","More than 80% of Africans surveyed say Africa is ready for African pope, but fewer believe world is ready .

"(CNN) -- It started in May of last year for Beth Ulibarri, as she would go on the occasional long run. ""I would experience a tingling sensation throughout my lower legs. I described it as feeling like something was tickling my legs from the inside and just figured it was my muscles firing away from the exertion of the run."" Less than a year and many medical tests later, the Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, or MS. ""My biggest struggle has been dealing with the unknown -- questions that do not have answers,"" she said. ""Concern for my children -- will they get this disease as well? Concern for my future. Will I end up in a wheelchair? Concern for how my husband will handle everything to come."" Multiple sclerosis affects about 400,000 Americans and 2 million people worldwide, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. It can damage the protective outer lining of nerve cells, making it difficult to control muscular activity. Ann Romney, scheduled to speak on Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention, has spoken often about her experiences with the disease during the presidential campaign. Jack Osbourne's recent diagnosis has received a lot of attention as well. Ulibarri is one of many who shared their stories of struggle and triumph with the iReport community. She confessed that she worried that the disease would affect her ability to take part in athletic activity. ""One of the first things I did was research athletes who have MS,"" she said. ""I was relieved to find many runners and triathletes who have MS who continue to train and even do amazing things like run marathons and do Ironmans."" Dr. Timothy Vollmer, the director of Neurology Clinical Research at the University of Colorado-Denver, even says that such activity can be beneficial. ""We encourage patients to really think about lifestyle issues, to maximize their activity and exercise, and also to maximize healthy diet, because we now know those things do impact the amount of residual disability people have."" Since she was diagnosed, Ulibarri has completed one marathon and has qualified for the Boston marathon. ""I know that eventually this disease may prevent me from doing things like running marathons, and I will have to accept that as it comes,"" she said. ""For now, I am incredibly grateful for each day I can get out of bed and head out the door."" Beat goes on for music producer diagnosed with MS . As CNN's iReporters showed, no two people afflicted with MS have exactly the same symptoms, and no two people will react to it the same way. While Ulibarri lives her life publicly with MS, others have felt the need to hide their disease. One such person is an Ohio man who wanted to go by the name of Michael Taylor for this story. ""All I want is to build a career (and) a family, work out and golf. Pretty normal for an active and ambitious 25-year-old,"" he said. ""But I find myself attempting to plan for the future and ask questions. I find myself injecting my leg with medication I know little of, and asking questions on a daily basis."" Taylor has had MS for years but only found out about it earlier this month. So far, he has hidden his MS, over worries that it could hurt his career. ""The fact is that most adult Americans know someone with MS, they just don't know they have MS because they keep it quiet,"" Vollmer said. ""The fear is that they will have relapses, they won't be able to work, they're not reliable. That's actually not true for the majority of them."" As for Taylor, he says he has been able to get by with the occasional bout of numbness or loss of strength. ""I just recently completed a rigorous ropes course that many healthy non-MSers could not."" Helen Solinski found herself in the same boat as Taylor in 2003. ""The first few years, I tried to hide my disease and pushed myself as hard as I could, but there was a point when I simply let go,"" said the Saratoga, California, resident. ""I realized I couldn't bear to stand on the sidelines, hoping for better MS drugs."" Solinski left her job in Silicon Valley to work with the Myelin Repair Foundation, an organization searching for a cure for MS. MS drug Gilenya under safety review . ""My goal is to prevent future generations from having to make important life decisions around a chronic disease -- it's not what I want for my son,"" she said. Christina Lamb Sidell of Williston, Vermont, wasn't sure she would be able to have a son. ""I had similar symptoms as Jack Osbourne, but was lucky that my doctor figured out within just a few days of my seeing him that I had MS."" At 35, she was told she could either wait a minimum of two years to have children or have children right away. ""During pregnancy, there is a decrease in having an attack of MS,"" Vollmer said. ""But there's a rebound effect after delivery. There's an increased risk in having a relapse three to six months after delivery. ""If you look at populations with more pregnancies or less pregnancies, the women with less pregnancies actually have more disability. We do not recommend that women delay pregnancy because of MS."" A year and a half later, Sidell's son was born. She and her husband call him their ""free gift with disease."" And yes, ""he is perfect."" Carol Sadrozinske was told she might not be able to raise her son when she was diagnosed while pregnant in 1987, at the age of 23 (many people with MS are diagnosed quite early in life, with the peak of the disease coming at 29 or 30, according to Vollmer). ""I was encouraged to put the child up for adoption, since at the time stress from childbearing and child rearing were thought to be detrimental to the health of a woman with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,"" she explained. She ignored the advice, and by 1996 was a mother of three boys. She has had her ups and downs with the disease, included a devastating fall earlier this year that left her bruised with a broken arm. MS activity may vary with seasons . ""The worst part of the disease is not knowing what each day will bring,"" she said. ""Will I be able to see? Will I be able to walk? Am I making any sense when I speak?"" Even so, her three sons -- now 24, 21 and 19 -- have brought her tremendous joy. ""Their joys, triumphs and struggles make my life worthwhile. Not to mention that their love alone gives me the courage to survive. I believe that the best thing I have done is ignore the advice to not have children!"" On the flip side, Beth McCann's daughter, Molly, just had to share how proud she is of her mother, who has suffered the debilitating effects of MS for 17 years. ""The worst form of MS is primary progressive, and my mother is one away from the worst. You can do the math. She lost her beautiful singing voice and her memory is declining to the point where she is forgetting even my cousins' names."" Now 20, McCann, of Eagan, Minnesota, said that she has had to grow up quickly and gained a sense of independence. ""It's the hardest thing in the world watching the person you love and admire the most in this world slowly, slowly decline to more and more disability and losses in her life. It is like a death sentence of my mother, but in slow motion to me."" Even so, she has always admired how her mother handled it. ""Throughout her progression, she is so positive, never complains, is always joking and refuses to let this disease get the best of her."" Like so many who spoke to CNN, McCann has found that little things can help conquer the disease at the worst moments. ""This is all I've known of my mother. I love her regardless of this disease. Despite being sick, she still loves life; and sees the beauty in all of its challenges. She is the best mother a girl could ask for.""","iReporters share their experiences with multiple sclerosis .

"(CNN) -- When other people suffer misfortunes, we feel sorry for them. Or do we? More than we probably want to admit, we sometimes are secretly pleased. Does a Red Sox fan feel happy to see a Yankee fan miserable over a humiliating loss? Would a Democrat ever tire of watching replays of Mitt Romney's Etch A Sketch moments? Do you find yourself consuming the tabloid news, riveted by coverage of disasters in the gossip columns? The German language has a word for this feeling, schadenfreude, or, pleasure caused by the misfortunes of others. Most people feel uneasy taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Our parents gave us stern, shaming looks if we laughed when others got into trouble. Maybe this is one reason why there is no word for schadenfreude in some languages, such as English. Just because we don't have a label for it in English doesn't mean the feeling doesn't exist. It's very real, and you must have experienced it at some point in your life, or know someone who has. So, why do we feel schadenfreude? One reason comes down to the simple fact that we often gain from other people's misfortunes. Much of life involves competition. Napoleon advised, ""Never interrupt an enemy when he is making a mistake."" Misfortunes happening to rivals can level the competition. Any sympathy we might feel is mixed with the pleasing effects of the benefit that may come our way. Self-interest is a powerful motive, and it is only natural to feel good if we are gaining from an event, even if it is from another person's misfortune. A team of University of Kentucky researchers led by David Combs recently provided good evidence for this in the blood sport of politics. In a series of studies published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, they screened participants for their party allegiance and then asked them to privately give their emotional reactions to news events, some of which were embarrassing to either the Democrat or Republican presidential candidates from the 2006 and 2008 elections. Overall, Democrats were much more pleased than Republicans when a Republican candidate suffered and Republicans were much more pleased than Democrats when a Democratic candidate suffered. These two groups seemed to live in separate parallel universes. Such findings come as no surprise to anyone who follows politics and who feels the effects of the election outcomes in the gut. Comedian Stephen Colbert captured the point during the summer of the most recent presidential campaign, when the economic indicators were looking bad for the incumbent, Obama, ""I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is there's plenty of bad news, which is great news for Mitt Romney."" The studies led by Combs used private reports, but were the participants being completely frank? Did they even know their true feelings? Social neuroscientists Mina Cikara, Matthew Botvinick, and Susan Fiske in a study published in Psychological Science provided more corroborating evidence for schadenfreude using sports fans rather than political junkies. They took advantage of the natural, storied rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, and recruited diehard fans from each group. These fans watched simulated baseball plays while placed in a brain scanner. The plays involved their own team playing against their rival or playing against a neutral team. Pleasure-related brain activation was linked with the rival losing; pain-related activation was linked with their own team losing. Notice that these examples come from intergroup competition. Often, our identity with a group affects our emotions. If our group comes out on top, that gives us a boost. In a classic demonstration, research led by Edward Hirt at Indiana University showed that Big Ten fans felt more optimistic about their own personal abilities (from throwing darts to success in asking attractive people out for a date) after their team won than after it lost. As a long-suffering Red Sox fan, I can attest to the elixir provided by ""our"" defeating the Yankees' in the American League playoff in 2004 and then going on to win the World Series. There is something about intergroup dynamics that brings emotions like schadenfreude out into the open. The tribal, ""us"" vs. ""them"" mindset seems easily evoked, and it is thrilling to win at a rival group's expense. Maybe, we feel less guilty and selfish in our pleasure when it's ""for the team."" Schadenfreude is a natural feeling, and there is little use in berating ourselves over its easy arousal. But let's not encourage it, either. Apparently, those who experience schadenfreude may also express willingness to harm a rival fan or group. So let's keep schadenfreude in check. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard H. Smith.","Richard Smith: When people suffer misfortunes, we feel sorry for them, or do we?
Smith: More than we probably want to admit, we sometimes are secretly pleased .
He says in sports, politics, schadenfreude tend to be brought out into the open .

"(CNN) -- Two months after a nationwide manhunt helped authorities track down kidnapped California teen Hannah Anderson, she's revealing new details about her conversations with the man who allegedly held her hostage and killed her mother and brother. In an interview with NBC's ""Today"" show broadcast Thursday morning, Anderson described the moment she says she realized family friend James DiMaggio was kidnapping her in early August. He had just picked her up from cheerleading practice and took her to his home about an hour east of San Diego -- apparently, she said she'd eventually learn, with her mom and brother hidden somewhere inside. Anderson says DiMaggio sat her down on a couch, handcuffed her, zip-tied her feet and revealed his plan to kidnap her and drive her to Idaho. The day quickly took an even darker turn, Anderson said, when DiMaggio encouraged her to play Russian roulette with him, using a real gun. ""When it was my turn, I started crying and, like, was freaking out,"" Anderson said. ""And he said, 'Do you want to play?' And I said, 'No,' and I started crying, and he's like, 'OK,' and he stopped."" Anderson said DiMaggio told her that her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and her brother Ethan, 8, were elsewhere in the house, alive. Anderson, 16, said that she could hear Ethan. ""I heard him trying to yell upstairs, but he was gagged, so I couldn't do anything to help him,"" Anderson said. ""I was yelling his name. I couldn't do anything."" She said after about two to three hours, DiMaggio drugged her -- with Ambien, she thinks -- and when she woke up, she found herself in Idaho with him. That's when he told her, she said, that her mother and Ethan still were in the house's garage, and that he had set a timer that would ignite a fire at the home, many hours after DiMaggio and Anderson had left. DiMaggio told her that he had left signs that would indicate to responding firefighters -- before the fire reached the garage -- where Christina Anderson and Ethan were, Hannah Anderson told ""Today."" Authorities would eventually find the remains of Christina Anderson in the burned garage and Ethan's body in another part of the home. Christina Anderson was struck at least 12 times in the head; her right arm and both legs were fractured, and she had a cut on her neck, an autopsy revealed. The woman's ankles were bound by a plastic cable tie, and duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth, her autopsy report said. Ethan was burned beyond recognition. It was believed, according to the autopsy, that the boy died because of the fire. After evading authorities for a week, horseback riders spotted DiMaggio and Hannah Anderson in the Idaho wilderness, nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred. Anderson said DiMaggio told her he'd kill the riders if she spoke to them. DiMaggio spoke to them, and they left, she said. But those riders, feeling something was amiss and learning that an Amber Alert had been issued, contacted authorities. When law enforcement teams closed in on the two August 10, DiMaggio was shot dead by an FBI agent and Anderson was taken to a hospital. Recalling the moments before the shooting, Anderson told ""Today"" that she and DiMaggio were by a fire, which she said he'd set in an effort to signal for help. She didn't say why he was trying to signal for assistance. She said she told him that she'd read in a book that firing a gun three times in the air also was a signal for help. So, she said, Anderson fired a gun once in the air, and then a second time -- but with a lowered aim. ""Then a bunch of guns went off. I looked and he fell on the ground,"" she said. ""I kind of looked over, and I was like, 'Are you OK?' And then a bunch of, like, the FBI people came out, telling me to get down."" Anderson said she was told the next day, in the hospital, that her mother, her brother and DiMaggio were dead. With tears, Anderson said she greatly missed her mother and brother. ""Sometimes it's like I wait for them to get home, and then they're not there,"" she said. The nationwide manhunt for DiMaggio drew widespread attention and sparked intense speculation about the case. Now, the author of a new book is criticizing the teen's behavior and claiming there are inconsistencies in her story, CNN affiliate KGTV reported. An Anderson family spokeswoman told CNN the family has no comment on the book. Addressing letters between Anderson and DiMaggio that authorities found in his burned home, Anderson told ""Today"" that she had been writing to DiMaggio, a family friend, because her mother and father had split up. ""Me and my mom really didn't get along a year ago, so when I was having problems with her and I wouldn't have really anyone to talk about it with, me and him, instead of talking face to face if we didn't have time ... we'd just write letters back and forth, talking about, like, the situation and how to get through it,"" she said. Her father, Brett Anderson, told ""Today"" that he and his daughter are working through the ordeal. ""We're getting help and talking with each other and trying to be strong (and) moving forward,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A Mitt Romney campaign app went viral because it urged people to stand ""with Mitt"" for ""A Better Amercia."" An easy typo to make, but, you know, almost all typos are easy to make. There might be some irony here, given the comment Romney made to the American Society of News Editors in April: ""Frankly, in some of the new media, I find myself missing the presence of editors to exercise quality control."" Romney, like so many others, needs a copy editor. And Romney, like so many others, is apparently working without one. People reading newspapers and news sites can empathize. They're seeing lots of typos, as well as errors of grammar, fact and logic â€” many more than they would have seen before news organizations decided that they did not need so many copy editors. No other job classification has suffered so many losses as the news business downsizes (except, perhaps, for classified ad takers, who have been craigsdelisted). Although it is anecdotal that there are more errors, the evidence is certainly there: At the  American Copy Editors Society, Charles Apple blogs regularly about all those who need a copy editor. Sadly, there's no shortage of material, in news reports and beyond. Typos can be funny: Who wouldn't want to graduate from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Pubic Affairs? Though, if the stories are true, his predecessor had a lot more pubic affairs than LBJ did. While we're in the nether regions, look at the second photograph in the gallery above. How about a martini from this Phoenix restaurant? Don't see it? Look closely at the ingredient after ""Apple Pucker."" (All together now: ""Ewwwww!"") Other photos in the gallery show that everyone needs an editor. NBC's Lester Holt needed one when a story about a viral video marriage proposal was identified as ""The Propsal."" Wal-Mart needed one when the information on a box that was supposed to be in Spanish read ""Spanish here"" instead. And, yes, CNN sometimes needs editors, as you can see in a news ticker on a breaking news story that said ""yujyujyujyujyuj..."" And The New York Times, where I worked for 25 years, has copy editors but seems to need them online. ""Mormon"" as ""moron"" in a headline? It happened. Copy editors provide a safety net for a publication, catching most of the problematic stuff dropped from above. They are a curious breed: trivia experts, steeped in popular culture (helpful for pun headlines, none of which Google gets), usually voracious readers, often unappreciated. A copy editor's work is largely invisible, until she misses something, in which case she takes the blame. But most important is that a copy editor stands in for the reader, gingerly reshaping, clarifying and correcting things before the reader can see them and post an excoriating comment. But more and more publications are laying off their copy editors, replacing them with Web designers or more reporters, or with nothing. Or they're consolidating copy editors (and designers) in ""hubs"" far away from their audiences, where they can't catch a reporter who misspells Dan Smyth's name as Smith. Websites, even those of print or broadcast properties, often have no one. One site that specializes in gossip originally had a copy editor but laid her off, one of its editors told me, ""because she just slowed things down."" Sorry, but would the world even know if that story on the pregnancy of (celebrity name here) was posted a minute later because someone had to correct the number of kids already borne by (celebrity name here)? ""Digital first"" often translates as ""show the reader the finger."" So why are so many news organizations giving up on copy editors? Money, of course. Given the choice between having to give up reporters or give up copy editors, reporters will win nearly every time because they provide ""content."" By the way, didn't we once call it ""information""? ""Content"" sounds so ... commercial. Copy editors ""merely"" prepare content, some publishers say, and don't we have Web editors to do that? Yes, but many don't have the training or inclination -- or time -- to pay attention to the content. Their main role is to drive traffic to the site, even if the content is bad. One reason given for eliminating copy editors is that reporters can simply ""proofread"" themselves better. But no one can read something he wrote as well as someone else can. Anyone who's sent off an email beginning ""Dead Bob ..."" knows that. And many reporters simply rely on spell check, witch wont ketch wards spilled rite, butt knot yews wright. Few publications that are laying off editors are training their remaining staffers to edit themselves better. And proofreading is perhaps the least important purpose of copy editing. Another stated reason for not having copy editors is that readers don't care about typos. If that's true, why is there so much ridicule about them? How many comments say things like ""where were the editors?"" Besides, emerging research shows that readers view edited news more positively than they view unedited news. Perhaps the most misguided reason for not having copy editors is ""reader engagement."" After all, readers will spot mistakes, which then can be corrected quickly. Yes, it is a great advantage to be able to correct things quickly, but isn't it a greater advantage to not make the mistake in the first place, rather than have it ricochet around the Internet, and have readers think less of your publication? Can you name one other business whose quality control consists of ""Well, we'll just send it into the market and see who complains""? If another consumer brand did that, there would be lawsuits. Copy editors are the quality control experts. Let them inspect. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Merrill Perlman.","Merrill Perlman: A copy editor would have fixed the ""Amercia"" typo in Romney's app .

"(CNN) -- Tom Crist was enjoying a trip to California, having lunch at a golf course in Palm Springs, when the call that could change his life came. It was officials with the lottery in western Canada, and they were telling him he had won $40 million. But instead of making plans for a big spending spree, Crist immediately decided that every dollar -- every single buck -- was to go to charity to honor his late wife. ""I've been fortunate enough, through my career, 44 years with a company,"" he told the CBC News. ""I did very well for myself. I've done enough that I can look after myself, for my kids, so they can get looked after into the future. I don't really need that money."" OK, fair enough, but that's a really big gesture even if you are already set. Crist, who won the jackpot in May, told the CBC that his wife of 33 years, Jan, died almost two years ago of cancer. The lottery jackpot will be placed in trust and will be donated to charities he and his children pick. Yes, he has children, and they are cool with dad giving all the money to good causes. They only asked why he waited seven months to tell them, he said. He told them he wasn't sure how to handle it. He wanted to remain anonymous but the rules mandate a picture and an announcement. There's a picture of him from the lottery folks wearing a ball cap and sunglasses. The lottery proudly announced that Crist played two games by subscription. That is, he paid in advance, and they paid him when he won something. There was no ticket to check. ""I wasn't even sure which game I'd won on, or what the numbers were,"" Crist said, according to a news release from the lottery. ""I've paid for the subscription when I get the renewal notice every year, and then I just file it. Sometimes I'd get a check for $10 or $20, but I never expected this."" He said he didn't even tell his golf partners that day in May that he had won. Crist retired in September as the president and CEO of an electrical products and services wholesale company. The company was sold in late 2012. Reuters said the deal was for $1.14 billion.","Tom Crist says he made enough money as CEO of an electrical products company .

"(CNN) -- Merrill Newman -- the 85-year-old American detained by North Korean authorities earlier this fall -- returned Saturday to the United States, arriving at San Francisco International Airport. ""It's been a great homecoming,"" said Newman, who was wearing a blue sport coat and khakis. He thanked the U.S. and Swedish diplomats who had helped secure his release, then told reporters, ""I'm tired ... ready to be with my family now. Thank you all for the support we got, very much appreciated."" With that, accompanied by his wife, Lee, and son, Jeff, he walked off. Hours earlier, in the airport in Beijing, video showed him smiling as he walked past a cavalcade of reporters. He felt good, he said, and was looking forward to seeing his wife . ""I'm very glad to be on my way home,"" Newman said. ""And I appreciate the tolerance the DPRK government has given to me to be on my way."" The communist country ""deported"" the veteran of the Korean War, North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported early Saturday. The move coincided with a visit by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden to South Korea, where he laid a wreath in honor of those who died in the war that pitted North against South. A senior administration official said that Newman's release was the result of direct contact between Washington and Pyongyang. The official said the North Koreans had told the Obama administration in a telephone call that they were releasing Newman; no explanation was offered. In Palo Alto, California, Newman's neighbors tied yellow ribbons around objects to welcome him back. ""We are absolutely delighted to confirm that Merrill Newman is on his way home after being released by the DPRK,"" said Jeff Newman, Merrill's son. ""This has been a very difficult ordeal for us as a family and particularly for him,"" said his son. The KCNA report stated that investigators had determined that ""Newman entered the DPRK with a wrong understanding of it and perpetrated a hostile act against it."" ""Taking into consideration his admittance of the act committed by him on the basis of his wrong understanding (and the) apology made by him for it, his sincere repentance of it and his advanced age and health condition, the above-said institution deported him from the country from a humanitarian viewpoint,"" the official North Korean report said. Focus now on Kenneth Bae . Jeff Newman also called for the release of Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea. The State Department repeated its call for the DPRK to pardon Bae and release him, too. The senior administration official said the United States is now paying full-time attention to securing Bae's release. Bae's family said it was pleased to learn of Newman's release. ""We have been praying for him and are very happy that his family will have him at the head of their table for the holidays. We believe that our Kenneth should also come home soon. We are thankful for all who are advocating on Kenneth's behalf and for any ongoing dialogue with the DPRK government. We have faith in our government to bring Kenneth home, and we dearly wish that we will also have joyful holidays with Kenneth,"" the family said in a statement. Biden told reporters in South Korea that he had ""played no direct role"" in the release. He added that his office had offered to let Newman fly home with him on Air Force Two, but State Department officials said he'd take a direct commercial flight to San Francisco. ""It's a positive thing they've done,"" said the vice president, who spoke Saturday morning by phone with Newman. ""But they still have Mr. Bae, who has no reason being held in the North (and) should be released immediately."" ""While the release of Merrill Newman is welcome news indeed, he never should have been detained in the first place,"" said former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who has undertaken private diplomatic efforts with North Korea. ""The North Koreans should also release Kenneth Bae as a humanitarian gesture."" U.S. 'deeply concerned' about citizens held in North Korea . Old resentments . Newman had traveled in October as a tourist to North Korea on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea. Phone calls and postcards he sent indicated that the trip was going well and gave no indication of a problem, Jeff Newman said. The day before Newman was to leave, ""one or two Korean authorities"" met with him and his tour guide, the son added. They talked about Newman's service record, which left ""my dad ... a bit bothered,"" he said. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, Newman was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities. For weeks, the Pyongyang government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman. An explanation came a few days ago, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's ""apology."" The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note -- which was dated November 9 -- Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to that KCNA report. The reported message also touched on his return 60 years later to North Korea, saying that he ""shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers."" His statement ended: ""If I go back to (the) USA, I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading."" Photos show scale of North Korea's repressive prison camps . ""Hostile acts"" This public apology was ""highly scripted political theater,"" said University of California, Berkeley, professor Steve Weber. Some feared Newman could face harsh treatment. Bae was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced last May to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's government found him guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. Pyongyang is regarded by many as one of the world's most repressive states, with its insularity, system of cruel detention camps for political prisoners and sharp restrictions on speech and other freedoms. Its isolation is exacerbated by widespread concern over its nuclear program. The East Asian nation's reported quest to create a nuclear weapon, as well as its resistance to international monitoring of its activities, have resulted in economic sanctions, compounding its difficulties in getting enough energy and food for its people. Merrill's release may serve to relax tensions with the United States. But above all, it will please his wife, who last month told CNN, ""We need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays."" Other detained Americans .

"(CNN) -- Ever since the Montgolfier brothers launched the first manned hot air balloon flight in France in 1783, enterprising balloonists have capitalized on our fascination with open-air flight by offering rides that soar over some of the world's most stunning landscapes. Just watching the graceful globes aloft is mesmerizing, especially when they're en masse. Here's where to catch them or hitch a ride. Quebec, Canada . International Balloon Festival of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (August 11-19): Every August, more than 125 balloonists descend on Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, midway between Montreal and Vermont, for the largest hot-air festival in Canada. Mass balloon launches at dawn and dusk bookend nine days filled with live music performances that range from Canadian folk group Cowboys Fringants to rapper T Pain, and family activities, including Balloon Planet, an inflatable amusement park. Come dark, dozens of tethered balloons are illuminated for ""night suns,"" a multimedia event with music and projections. Reserve your own flight starting at $170. Glen Falls, New York . Adirondack Balloon Festival (September 20-23): This is the 40th anniversary of the Adirondack Balloon Festival, the oldest and largest balloon gathering on the East Coast. Some 100 balloonists, including a slew who man special-shaped airships like dragons and bald eagles, converge on the region's parks and airports to launch against a backdrop of mountains awash in fall foliage. Spectators can arrange flights privately with pilots. ""It's so beautiful seeing the meandering Hudson River, the Adirondacks to the north, the Green Mountains in Vermont and the Catskills to the south,"" says pilot Greg Livadas, a Rochester, New York pilot who has been flying in the festival for more than 30 years. The free event keeps the fun going in the afternoons with live music, aircraft displays, kite flying and meet-and-greets with pilots. Albuquerque, New Mexico . Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta (October 6-14): What started in 1972 as a local radio station promotion to round up the most hot air balloons in one place has become the world's largest ballooning gathering and, boast organizers, the most photographed event anywhere. Fueled by Albuquerque's crisp fall climate and predictable air currents that allow balloonists to control their flights, the Balloon Fiesta attracts some 700 balloons from more than 50 countries. The weeklong festivities include fireworks and concerts and showcase all manner of dazzling displays, from a special shape rodeo to lighted nighttime ""balloon glows,"" but the climax is the handful of spectacular mass ascensions in which all participants take to the sky in two waves. Cappadocia, Turkey . Book a private balloon flight in Cappadocia, Turkey, and you'll get to see lava deposits at Turkey's Mount Erciyes twisted by two millennia of erosion into hundreds of pillars and minarets known as fairy chimneys, making the landscape in the country's central Anatolian region look like a set from Lost in Space. Soak up the spires in all their glory, as well as hand-hewn churches and homes carved from the limestone, from 1,000 feet on a 90-minute balloon flight from Royal Balloon. Napa Valley, California . With a patchwork of vines stretching for miles across gently rolling countryside, Napa Valley's signature landscape is even more breathtaking by air. By late summer, the fog dissipates and you might even spy San Francisco and the bay in the distance. Napa Valley Balloons has been offering sunrise, hourlong flights from Yountville for some 30 years. Passengers enjoy a champagne brunch at the winery after touching down at Domaine Chandon. Luberon, France . From the vineyards of Champagne to the peaks of the Pyrenees, France's diverse topography packs plenty of potential for ballooning. Named for the pastime's French inventors, the more than 25-year-old France Montgolfieres company offers launches from nine sites throughout the country. The newest base, Forcalquier in Haute Provence, has fast become one of the most popular. Nestled between the Alps and the Mediterranean, it's the perfect jumping off point to float over the medieval hilltop villages and lavender country of Provence. Upon landing you'll celebrate with a traditional toast de l'aeronaute. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania . A bird's eye view of unsuspecting wildlife takes safaris to new heights. Serengeti Balloon Safaris offers year-round flights over the Seronera Valley in the vast Serengeti National Park, home to zebra, giraffes, hippos, lions and leopards. The company also offers seasonal flights in other areas of the park during the annual wildebeest migration. Equipped with ""stealth"" burners, the balloons quietly float above the acacia treetops, launching at dawn when winds are favorable and game are most active.","Looking to see the world from a different perspective?

"(CNN) -- Sarah Murnaghan fully understands all she's been through: her lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis that led to her deteriorating lungs, the campaign her parents waged that temporarily changed national policy surrounding organ transplants, and the fact that she came so close to death in the days leading up to her two double lung transplants. ""She said, 'Mommy, I knew I was dying,' "" Janet Murnaghan recalls. ""That was like a very crushing moment for me. And she said 'I just didn't want to tell you I was dying because I didn't want to upset you.' "" Her parents say that was the toughest part. ""She asked, 'If I go to sleep, will I wake up the next morning?' "" remembers her father, Fran Murnaghan. Today, spirits are vastly different than they were two months ago, when Sarah -- who's had cystic fibrosis since birth -- was in dire shape after being on the waiting list for pediatric lungs for 18 months. Her first transplant was a failure. After keeping Sarah alive for days by circulating her blood outside of her body to keep oxygen flowing, she received a second transplant. Aside from a brief scare with pneumonia, this one was a success. Now Sarah and her family are preparing to head home for the first time in half a year. ""I'm very excited,"" Sarah says, with a low, raspy voice, because of the tracheostomy tube that remains in her throat. ""I would like to play with my brothers and sister."" She also has plans to go horseback riding and try her hand on a soccer team. All things, the family now believes, she's very likely to accomplish. Speaking exclusively to CNN for the first time since the surgery, Janet and Fran Murnaghan say 11-year-old Sarah could be discharged from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as early as Tuesday. ""We haven't been a family in a while,"" Janet says. ""It's ... hard to be a family when half the family lives at CHOP (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) and half lives at home."" Sarah's parents say her lung biopsies show 0% rejection of her new lungs, and on Saturday she was officially taken off her oxygen machine. However, she still needs mechanical assistance â€” and will for some time -- until her diaphragm regains its strength. ""The lungs are doing great,"" Fran says, adding that at this stage it's all about rehabilitation of Sarah's muscles. ""What's really exciting is that we know we are on the road to recovery now."" Because she was in a medically induced coma and essentially paralyzed for more than three weeks, Sarah's body needs to relearn many things, including how to walk. Her physical therapy sessions can last for three hours each day and include weightlifting and cardio components. Though the process of recovery will be a long one â€” Janet estimates nine months to a year â€” Sarah is up for the challenge. Asked if she considers herself a tough girl, Sarah says, ""Yes, very."" ""Because every time I faced things that I thought were going to be hard, then I've done them."" Janet says when things get difficult, she and Fran do their best not to let their emotions show, especially around Sarah. But they admit it's happened. ""She'll say, 'Mom what's wrong?' I said, 'It's just hard Sarah. You worked so hard today, and you're obviously so exhausted. I wish life were easier for you.' And she said to me, 'But it's not easy, and that's OK.' "" Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Sarah's story . And that's been Sarah's mantra: ""I'm not going for easy, I'm just going for possible... And what's in front of me right now is possible."" Janet and Fran are quick to call Sarah a fighter, even though anyone who meets her knows it from the start, and these days they have more confidence than they've had in months that they'll be able to see their daughter live out a life that's closer to normal. ""I fully plan to watch her graduate from college and watch her get married someday and do whatever it is she wants to do,"" Janet says. ""I just don't think they're going to be as easy for her to obtain those things as somebody else, but I think she is going to have them."" It isn't lost on anyone in the Murnaghan family that their daughter may not be here today if it weren't for the fierce public battle the two parents waged that started with Facebook and quickly spread to the national media. Janet and Fran's fight has temporarily changed national policy, making children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. ""This is an issue that will always matter to me,"" Janet says, adding that she'll keep fighting because the country needs ""a better plan"" for distributing organs. For now, though, their focus remains on helping Sarah get her strength back. ""I think you'll see Sarah a year from now as a kid going into sixth grade, walking confidently back into school like every other sixth grader,"" Janet says. ""(It's) not going to happen tomorrow, but it will happen."" ""She's going to get what she wants, and we're going to get what we want, which is just a regular kid."" If you'd like to help the Murnaghan family, they've set up a donation page at www.gofundme.com/3c4dh0 to assist in their medical expenses.","Sarah's cystic fibrosis made family think she wouldn't live past 10 .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- In the village of Angolo, in Sudan's South Kordofan state, villagers stand over a deadly and illegal weapon. Nestled in a crater, the Soviet-era cluster bomb failed to detonate. It was dropped a month ago, they say, and they don't dare get any closer. Across rocky outcrops, tennis ball-sized bomblets spilled out of the RBK-500 model bomb and scattered everywhere. Each of them is highly volatile and easily capable of blowing off a limb, or worse. The footage, obtained and verified by CNN, is damning new evidence that the Sudanese government is using cluster munitions in civilian areas. ""Cluster bombs are known to be indiscriminate and unreliable weapons. This is why they have been banned by international law,"" said Laura Cheeseman, the director of the Cluster Munition Coalition. ""It is the humanitarian impact of these weapons that makes it so atrocious that Sudan has used them."" The villagers in this part of South Kordofan say they live in fear of the bombing raids by Sudanese airplanes that seem to happen almost daily. ""Today they bombed with their airplanes. They bombed up there in the mountains and they bombed close to here. Today,"" an Angolo resident said. Civilians in the Nuba Mountains have resorted to hiding in rocky outcrops and caves, and piling stones over makeshift foxholes to take cover from the bombing raids. And cluster bombs present an even greater threat than regular munitions, rights groups say. ""Cluster munitions contain dozens or sometimes hundreds of explosive bomblets, so when they're used, they scatter over a very large area, often the size of several football fields,"" Cheeseman said. Anyone in the strike zone can be killed. And often, the greatest threat comes after the bombs are dropped. About 10% of bomblets in modern cluster weapons usually fail, weapons experts say. But with older munitions like the RBK-500, that percentage can be much higher. The cluster bomblets become a minefield. And while mines are dangerous because they are invisible, volatile cluster bombs are deadly because they lie in plain sight. Often, they attract children. ""[The bombs] can land in fields, in homes, in villages, and of course it poses a risk to civilians,"" said Klaus Ljoerring Pedersen, regional director of the Danish Demining Group, a humanitarian organization that helps solve problems related to leftover ordnance. ""Civilians do not recognize what is a bomblet -- dangerous and highly explosive -- and what is a toy. So you see a lot of curious children after these raids go out and identify these new and exiting objects and blow their hands and heads off."" Sudan is fighting a bitter conflict against the SPLA-North, a rebel group that wants to be part of independent South Sudan. The rebels depend on local villages for food. The Sudanese military strategy seems clear: It aims to terrify and starve the civilians into leaving the area. It appears to be working. Thousands of villagers have fled to camps like Yida, where humanitarian agencies have struggled to feed and shelter them. The U.N. refugee agency says more than 500 arrive every day. This latest evidence of cluster munitions in South Kordofan suggests that the Sudanese military is stepping up its campaign, but a Sudanese army spokesman flatly denied that they use cluster munitions. ""We don't use cluster munitions in South Kordofan, we have no ties to such weapons,"" military spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khalid told CNN. ""There is no need to use these kinds of weapons to begin with, the fighting is in open space, the renegades don't have concrete fortifications."" Khalid added that the footage could have been taken anywhere. But CNN knows that the footage was taken in Angolo village. And this wouldn't be the first time that Sudan has been accused of dropping the highly controversial weapons. The Danish Demining Group says that it still finds Chilean-made PM-1 bomblets throughout South Sudan, particularly in the areas between Juba, the capital, and the Ugandan border. The munitions were dropped during the long civil war between the North and South that ended in 2005. Military analysis and logic suggests that since the SPLA in the South had no significant airpower, and they were unlikely to drop bombs on themselves, the cluster munitions came from Sudanese warplanes . Sudan has frequently denied ever using cluster munitions and has not signed the convention to ban the weapon. The country has promised to sign up ""as soon as possible.""

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- A military prosecutor said Bradley Manning acted as a ""determined insider"" in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and should be locked up for 60 years at least, but the Army private's lawyer contended he can be rehabilitated and should not ""rot in jail."" The two sides delivered their final sentencing arguments to Col. Denise Lind, the judge who convicted Manning at trial and will now determine his punishment. He faces up to 90 years behind bars for the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history. ""There may not be a soldier in the history of the Army who displayed such an extreme disregard"" for his mission as a soldier, Capt. Joe Morrow, the prosecutor, said. His arrogance, according Morrow, meant he ""felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified."" Morrow asked that Manning, 25, serve a minimum sentence of six decades behind bars, saying his actions created grave risk, disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives. Defense attorney David Coombs did not ask for a specific sentence, but said his client was an excellent candidate for rehabilitation, and that he should not be left to ""rot in jail."" ""Perhaps his biggest crime was that he cared about the loss of life that he was seeing and couldn't ignore it."" Coombs said of Manning's decision to turn over the explosive information to WikiLeaks. ""This is a young man capable of being redeemed,"" Coombs said in final remarks. ""The defense requests, after the court considers all the facts, a sentence that allows him to have a life."" Lind recessed the proceedings until Tuesday morning but it is not clear when she will render a decision. Manning was convicted of numerous counts in July, including espionage-related charges. He avoided a potential life sentence when Lind rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy. In addition to prison, prosecutors also want Manning to forfeit pay and benefits and pay a $100,000 fine. Officials indicated a single sentence would cover all of the guilty counts.","Prosecution calls Manning a ""determined insider"" in largest leak of classified information .

"(CNN) -- The dozens of weapons a newspaper says the family of Oscar Pistorius owns are only for ""sport and hunting,"" the family says. The family, in a statement released Tuesday, sought to distance itself from Henke Pistorius, Oscar's father, who said that some of the guns are for protection from crime -- protection he said the African National Congress government is not providing. The family's statement also was at odds with one by Oscar Pistorius, who told the magistrate who granted him bond that he kept the handgun that killed his girlfriend at his bed because he's ""been a victim of violence and of burglaries."" Opinion: Why brutality is ingrained in psyche of South Africa . The ""Pistorius family own weapons purely for sport and hunting purposes,"" the Olympic icon's family said in the statement provided by a spokesman. Beeld, an Afrikaans language newspaper, has reported the Pistorius family owns 55 weapons -- between his father, grandfather and two uncles -- not counting Oscar's six guns. The family's statement came in response to a controversy triggered when Henke Pistorius defended the arsenal by telling a UK newspaper that white South Africans need guns for self-defense because the ANC, which gained control in 1994 with the collapse of South Africa's apartheid system, does a poor job of protecting them. ""Some of the guns are for hunting and some are for protection, the hand guns,"" Henke Pistorius is quoted as telling a Telegraph reporter. ""It speaks to the ANC government -- look at white crime levels, why protection is so poor in this country, it's an aspect of our society."" While he said he's never used any of his four firearms -- two rifles and two handguns -- for self-defense, ""that doesn't mean I haven't been hijacked, attacked."" ""As a family, we value life much too much to produce guns at every opportunity we can use them,"" Henke Pistorius told the Telegraph. ""I have been in positions where I can use a gun but we have been brought up in a way that we value the lives of others very highly."" The ANC immediately attacked Henke Pistorius, saying his statement was not only ""devoid of truth, it is also racist."" ""It is sad that he has chosen to politicize a tragic incident that is still fresh in the minds of those affected and the public,"" ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu said. ""This tragic incident has affected two families that are still trying to come to terms with what happened and this latest racist slur is not assisting these families. We think it is ill-advisable for anyone to start apportioning undue blame."" Oscar Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder in the death of his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutors say the Olympian killed Steenkamp, 29, after a heated argument in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day. The double-amputee sprinter, known as the ""Blade Runner,"" submitted a sworn affidavit to the judge considering his bail request last month saying he kept a 9 mm pistol ""underneath my bed when I went to bed at night"" because he was ""acutely aware of violent crime being committed by intruders entering homes with a view to commit crime, including violent crime."" ""I have received death threats before,"" the affidavit said. ""I have also been a victim of violence and of burglaries before."" The magistrate granted bail, allowing Pistorius to go free eight days after the shooting. The Pistorius family, which hired a ""reputation management"" firm to help with media relations, issued a statement Monday saying, ""Oscar and the rest of the Pistorius family distances itself"" from Henke Pistorius' comments. ""Henke's interview with the newspaper was unapproved by our media liaison team,"" family spokesman Arnold Pistorius, Henke's brother, said. ""The comment doesn't represent the views of Oscar or the rest of the Pistorius family."" Another political party -- the Young Communist League of South Africa -- weighed in on what it called ""reckless remarks."" ""It is actually believed by most South Africans that the wealthy, mostly white people receive preferential treatment and it is for this reason that the Young Communist League cannot take seriously the claims made by Henke Pistorius,"" the party said.

"(EW.com) -- After Rob Thomas launched a Kickstarter campaign to finance the Veronica Mars movie, the Internet went crazy. The $2 million goal was reached in less than a day, more incentives were added for new backers, and the fund continues to grow. EW's Jeff Jensen — who also broke the news — sat down with Thomas, the creator of the cult TV show, to discuss the movie, the implications of using Kickstarter and much more about the Mars universe. Here are 10 things we learned: . Thomas is up for a Veronica Mars book series: . ""I will admit it. I'm probably not interested in sitting down and writing a series of Veronica Mars detective paperbacks, but I could be the Carolyn Keene of Veronica Mars and okay outlines and kind of set up the world for the books to exist in and then bring in writers to do 'em. I'm totally game for that. I would love to see this franchise get some heat and get its due."" He's genuinely surprised by the reaction: . ""I never expected to hit $2 million in however many hours we did — 10? But I probably had similar thoughts to you, that we'd hit our goal at maybe a week or two and then beyond that, I would hope we would keep climbing. Yeah, the tidal wave, I was not prepared for at all."" EW: 'Veronica Mars' movie is a go . He has a magic number in mind for the Kickstarter fund: . ""What I had my heart set on when we've launched, what I hoped to get to, was $5 million. And I figure anything over $5 million, I'm pretty damn happy. Anything under $5 million, I was going to be less happy. That was like my mental happiness point."" The money raised won't all go toward making the movie: . ""We only get to count the money that we have after we fulfill rewards, and the rewards could be expensive because we are giving really good packages, so we're losing a lot off the top. It's not as though you can look at our total, like right now we're at $3.5 [million], and say, ""That's, $3.5 for their production budget."" [Ed. note: At publishing time, the fund sits at just over $3.7 million.] It's going got be significantly less than that once we send out 50,000 t-shirts and all those DVDs and posters and pay to rent the giant theaters for premieres. There's a lot of overhead."" EW: Is the 'Veronica Mars' movie a good thing? Baton Rouge might have to stand in for Neptune: . ""What's going to affect our production budget is the money we raise on Kickstarter, minus the fulfillment, and that's going to affect very specific things. Like, if the money stopped now, I know that we would probably be faking Neptune, Calif., probably somewhere like Baton Rouge, La., and it won't quite look right. We'll do our best to make Baton Rouge look like Southern California, but it won't be quite the same. We're going to need to make some more money. Shooting in Southern California is more expensive than shooting in Louisiana, and I want to shoot in Southern California — the movie will look better. The thing is, we're totally prepared to shoot it somewhere else, but man, suddenly I'll have palm trees in shots and Veronica will be walking along a sandy beach and it will affect the way the movie looks."" They aren't doing this to get paid: . ""For doing the movie, I am taking the guild-minimum. So no one is getting big upfront money. Trust me, Kristen is not getting paid close to her quote, or anywhere near. We're all working for labor of love prices."" Only he and Kristen are signed so far: . ""I want [all the actors] in the movie. The assumption is they'll all be in the movie. We're in negotiations with everyone. It's one of those things where everybody wants to do it, I want everybody in it — just deals need to be made."" He really wants Freaks and Geeks to follow Veronica's lead: . ""If they wanted to Kickstarter a Freaks and Geeks movie, I would be first in line. I want the maximum package. I would pay whatever it took to get a Freaks and Geeks movie, because I love that show."" EW: 25 child stars who made it\ . He's aware of the criticisms about Kickstarter funding a studio-backed film: . ""I'm watching a lot of the buzz on this, and it seems to me that the people who complain the most, and the complaint is, 'Why am I giving money to a studio to make a movie?' as though there's no return on that money. I think that before people look at it, their sense is, 'Hey, I'm just throwing money at something.' They're not understanding that they're getting a product in return. That's where the disconnect is. Those people who are complaining about that, I want to say, 'If you're a Veronica Mars fan, you're getting cool stuff.' You're getting stuff I think you would pay for anyway; you're just pre-buying it, and by pre-buying it, you're showing the studio that there is enough market interested in making this movie worthwhile."" He has high standards for his movie: . ""Who thinks we'd be better off without The Godfather Part II, which by the way, is the bar that I'm setting for the Veronica Mars movie.""

"(CNN) -- Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala won't look at video that appears to capture this week's cargo airplane crash in Afghanistan. DiScala used to be afraid to fly. He got over it by looking at flight safety data, learning that flying is way safer than driving and talking to lots of pilots and flight attendants. Now DiScala flies more than 175,000 miles per year and documents his journeys on his travel website. ""Since I used to be afraid to fly I don't want to risk triggering any of my old emotions,"" he said in an e-mail. ""I just don't need those kind of images in my head."" The fiery images are alarming. U.S.-based cargo carrier National Airlines confirmed that Flight NCR102 had just taken off from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan en route to Dubai when the crash occurred, killing all seven crew members aboard. An approximately three-minute video, which has not been authenticated by CNN, shows what appears to be the Boeing 747-400 jet climbing shortly after takeoff, stalling, rolling from side to side and crashing into the ground. While the video might trigger a fear of flying in usually calm travelers or terrify already fearful passengers, most travelers aren't flying under the kind of conditions faced at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Here are five things to keep in mind as you head for your next commercial flight: . Civilian aircraft don't fly at such a steep angle . The circumstances under which military troops and cargo airplanes fly in and out of a war zone are far from the routines of commercial airlines, says John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and airline mechanic. ""Commercial airplanes climb at about half the angle the military climbs at,"" Goglia says. ""Military aircraft take off at a such a steep angle to get high enough to get away from local arms fire. They need to get over 3,000 feet as quickly as they can."" A commercial airline's cargo hold is small (and full) A military aircraft carrying heavy equipment might not fill an entire cargo airplane, requiring that the cargo be secured to prevent a potentially deadly sudden shift in weight, Goglia says. In contrast, aircraft configured for passengers have much smaller cargo compartments, which are filled with baggage and any cargo that the airline can pack into the belly of their planes. ""Full compartments leave no room for cargo to shift,"" he says. One crash is not a trend . Simply watching a video of a crash isn't a problem, says Julie Pike, a psychologist with the Anxiety Disorders Treatment Center of North Carolina in Durham, North Carolina. It's the interpretations people make after watching a plane crash or other disturbing news events over and over again. ""I will get people up until 4 a.m. watching the Boston bombing story,"" she says. ""They think, 'This happens all the time, which means it could easily happen to me.' "" Monday's plane crash in Afghanistan ""is compelling and very sad,"" she says. ""However, it's very infrequent. Airline travel is the safest form of travel. As Americans, we are very good at overdoing it."" An 'Artist's Way' to calm flying fears . Visuals can pack an intensified punch . Watching such a video can activate a different area of your brain than reading a story, Pike says. The visual stimulation can activate people's fight or flight response, making them think they are in imminent danger. ""Your brain is telling you that a predator is after you,"" Pike says. ""Reading about it doesn't tend to cause the same reaction."" A small percentage of people worldwide suffer from fearful flying to the extent that it impairs them in some way, she says, and some people can become traumatized by watching and fixating on disturbing videos. People overestimate the threat and underestimate their ability to react, she says. CNN.com commenter Peter Gugerell says he usually doesn't suffer from fear of flying. Yet one airplane crash stands out for him. Ever since he watched all the 1996 news coverage about TWA Flight 800, which blew up a few minutes after takeoff, Gugerell wrote via e-mail that he's ""acutely aware"" of the early part of his flights. ""Now, having watched the Bagram crash, I expect my existing takeoff anxiety to increase slightly."" We can come to terms with our fears . Try not to avoid or try to stop your fears, suggests University of Washington psychologist Jonathan Bricker. ""They are hard to stop and they find sneaky ways of reminding you they are there,"" he wrote via e-mail. ""Instead, try to make peace with them."" His suggestions: ""Notice your network of fears. Say the word 'flying' or '747' and notice what else comes to mind in your network of fears. Find the scary words. Let's say the word is 'crash.' Rate your level of anxiety when you say the word aloud. Repeat the word out loud for 90 seconds and notice what happens to the scariness of the word. Re-rate anxiety. Try this exercise three times."" And remind yourself of why you're traveling, Bricker suggests. Whether it's a business trip or a much-anticipated getaway or a trip to see a loved one, the reasons can help you see past your fears. Are you afraid to fly? What do you do to keep calm on an airplane flight? Please share in the comments below.","Flying fears may be intensified by video that appears to capture a cargo plane crash .
Remember that conditions for cargo flight in Afghanistan aren't routine for passenger flights .

"(CNN) -- Several years ago, Martha and Dennis Disberger and their three kids found themselves running desperately through a busy airport. ""Mom, are we late?"" asks one of the children. ""I have no idea, just keep running,"" says Martha. ""But don't lose Dad, because I have no idea what our connecting flight is!"" That family story pretty much sums up the Disbergers of Morton, Illinois, who arguably rank among America's most traveling families. Over the past two decades, the Disbergers have turned the airline getaway into an art form. The three children have virtually grown up as international travelers. Joel was 5 when the family started its flying lifestyle; Kara was a year old and Monica wasn't even born yet. Seriously, how many toddlers have their own frequent flier accounts? While perfecting their travel techniques, [tips below] all this globetrotting has opened their minds, widened their experience and bonded them as a family. Their intangible treasure: a lifetime's worth of indestructible family memories -- like the time they met an Irish ""leprechaun,"" or when one of them got lost in China, or that weekend trip to Australia. Unimpressed? Maybe we should start with some eye-opening stats: . --Since 1990, the Disbergers have journeyed on 243 family trips, including an estimated 850 flight segments for each family member -- traveling more than 7.5 million miles total, according to United Airlines. That averages out to about 11 family trips per year over two decades. --Their destinations have been as far-flung as Moscow, Dubai, Sydney and Bangkok. --Here's a fun fact: In two months, they flew through Japan's Narita airport on six different days. This is a family who ""has grown up and together on our flights,"" says United Airlines' Joe Micucci. ""Some people have a cottage or lake house as a second home, the Disbergers have the world."" 30 hours in Australia . If anybody's to blame for all this it's Dennis Disberger. ""It all started with a simple ad that showed some promotional deals,"" he explained. A $238 ticket offered triple miles on a particular route. ""Boom! We were on the plane -- and we had such a priceless experience we said, 'wow let's do that again.'"" So they did. Again. And again and again -- using their miles for passenger upgrades and to book free trips for extended family members. As the Disbergers racked up frequent flier miles, they were collecting airline ticket stubs for destinations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. In Ireland, at a stoplight between Dublin and the Ring of Kerry, ""this guy comes to my side of the car banging on the window,"" Martha remembers. ""In a way, he reminded us of a little leprechaun, saying, 'are ya goin' to Killarney? Oh follow me I'll show you how to get there.' "" Hopping into a car ahead, ""he was so excited and funny. As we followed him we were trying to figure out his angle."" Faith and begorrah! It turns out the leprechaun's sister owns a bed and breakfast! ""Guess where we stayed that night?"" The Disbergers have even popped across the Pacific to enjoy a weekend in Australia. That's right, 30 hours on the ground in Sydney sandwiched between 50 hours of total flight time. ""We walked around Sydney and we actually did see plenty of stuff,"" says Monica, who is turning 20 this year. ""I felt like I got a fairly good feel of the city, just in that weekend trip. So it didn't feel like a waste. I still enjoyed myself."" The secret to fun family travel, say the Disbergers, is making the best of time at airports and in the air. Monica says, ""We've played Hearts all around the world."" Monica's misadventure in Beijing when she was 10 is another family travel story. She got separated from her parents briefly in one of the city's giant, crowded public squares. Eventually Dennis and Martha found her safe nearby -- with a Chinese family who had become fascinated with her long, blond hair and were busy snapping photos of her. 'You just budget' By now, you may be wondering how a middle-class family affords this jet-setter lifestyle. ""This is something that's within the means of a lot of folks,"" says Dennis, a manager at a company that makes construction and mining equipment. ""You just budget."" Martha's job as a registered nurse offers her a schedule that's flexible for travel. This frugal family watches its spending. They avoid pricey things like new cars. When possible, they keep their travel plans flexible. When their flight is overbooked, they sometimes volunteer to give up their seats in exchange for freebies. Martha offers this bit of advice: ""Excedrin and deep breathing work. Wine helps. No -- I'm teasing."" Monica has another tip for Americans traveling in groups: If your companions start embarrassing you, pretend to be Canadian or Australian. ""Our family can be pretty loud,"" says Monica. ""We don't want America to look bad."" But seriously, here are a few more tips courtesy of the Disbergers: . --Plan for the worst, says Dennis. Have contingencies for missed connections. Then when something happens, execute your options. --If you need to book new flights after missed connections, don't wait in line for an airline counter representative. Use the airline customer phone service. --Always keep your keys and cell phone and charger with you. Don't pack them in your luggage. You might lose them. Disberger tips for traveling with toddlers: . --During flights, air pressure changes can turn kids crabby. Solution: give them lollipops. Toddlers will stay focused on the pops instead of the uncomfortable shifts in air pressure. --Introduce your toddlers to the flight attendants. -- Give toddlers something to look forward to. The Disbergers gave their toddlers gifts when their flights reached the ocean. These ""over-the-water"" gifts have become a beloved Disberger tradition that extended from the kids' childhood into adulthood. Traveling with teens: . --Let them be in charge of some of the decisions, including where to go next, what to do or where to eat, says Dennis. Give them time to enjoy themselves with their iPods or a book. Dennis says he would pay his traveling teens from $2-$5 per each 500 miles to ride in coach. It allowed mom and dad the luxury of first class. It also offered their teens some time alone, while giving them a chance to earn a little money. Saving on hotel rooms: . --Cash in hard on hotel promotions. The Disbergers are loyal customers of Hyatt and Hilton. One promotion offers a free room after checking in two times. ""Stay at hotels in business locations on the weekend when occupancy levels are really low -- and the price is commensurately low,"" says Dennis. Add an AAA discount and then move to another Hyatt Place for night No. 2. After a couple of weekend trips ""you've just earned a couple of free nights in the Park Hyatt Paris."" When Hyatt's not available, ""We do the same thing with Hilton."" --In some markets, a second set of rooms for the kids can be inexpensive. ""When the kids were younger, we used the Hyatt 'family plan' set of connecting rooms,"" says Disberger. ""Then when we check in we offer to let the hotel take back both rooms for a suite upgrade."" Families change and the Disbergers are no exception. As the children move into their 20s, Dennis says they're still as interested as ever in traveling as a family, although college schedules have made travel planning more complicated. And now that Joel has a career of his own as an oil industry field engineer, Dennis says he'll expect ""more participation financially"" from him and his sisters as they advance into their working lives. But hey, thanks to their airborne childhoods, the younger Disbergers already are million-milers getting double miles with lifetime gold airline status. Do you come from a traveling family?

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal is known as an iron man on the tennis tour but even he gets tired. After long semifinal matches in Chennai in 2008, Madrid in 2009 and at the World Tour Finals in London in 2010, fatigue likely played a factor in the Spaniard losing the next day. Nadal was on court for nearly three hours on Saturday against Pablo Andujar at the inaugural Rio Open but this time he recovered to win the finale, defeating tricky Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov 63 76 (3) for a 43rd title on clay and 62nd overall. The latter tally placed him in a tie for seventh with Guillermo Vilas. It was Nadal's first tournament since the Australian Open, having skipped Buenos Aires last week with the back complaint that surfaced in the Melbourne final against Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka. ""Pablo played a great match, playing very aggressive,"" Nadal told the ATP's website. ""I played too short and I gave him the chance to have control of the point. ""Today I was able to play with a little bit more calm, play a little bit longer and go a little bit more for the points. I played a more solid match."" Dolgopolov likely needed a good start to upset the so-called 'King of Clay' but instead trailed 4-1 in about 20 minutes. Having never broken Nadal in four previous matches, there seemed to be no hope for the world No. 54 when the 13-time grand slam winner tried to serve out proceedings in the second set. However, Nadal faltered and was forced into a tiebreak. On this occasion, it was more straightforward than on Saturday, when he saved a pair of match points against countryman Andujar. Dolgopolov -- who stunned French Open finalist David Ferrer in the semifinals -- struck a double fault early and was unable to engineer another comeback. ""As usual, he was spinning his forehand, making a lot of trouble to hit flat and I couldn't really get used to his serve much, only at the end of the match,"" Dolgopolov said. ""But I'm quite happy with the week.""","Rafael Nadal sees off Alexandr Dolgopolov to win the inaugural Rio Open .

"New York (CNN) -- If a way to a man's heart is through his stomach, then what's true in love is true in business too. At least, it is in New York City. With some of the most upscale eateries and trendy downtown diners in the world, where you decide to take a client for lunch can be just as vital as what you talk about between bites in the Big Apple. Indeed, it's widely believed the term ""power lunch"" itself was first coined in a 1979 article by Lee Eisenberg, the then-editor-in-chief of Esquire Magazine, while writing about a new lunch scene that had popped-up in midtown Manhattan. And while the food may have changed, it seems as many deals are brokered over the buffet counter as ever before. Although individuals are generally spending less on eating out, corporate spending is currently the largest driver of growth at fine dining and casual restaurants across New York, according to American Express. Tim Zagat is the co-founder and CEO of the influential Zagat restaurant survey. He says that even during the peak of the financial crisis, lavish power lunches -- involving food bills as outlandish as the transactions on the table -- were still commonplace. ""I could tell you 30 or 40 restaurants in New York off the top of my head, where you would find a full house, and nobody is spending less than $100 for lunch,"" he said. Suffice it to say; the man knows a thing or two about the refined art of power lunching. So from big-spenders to penny-pinchers, here Zagat picks a spot to suit every budget. Watch Richard Quest power-lunching in New York . The Four Seasons . Set away from the bustle of Times Square in Midtown Manhattan, this perennially fashionable restaurant - where a plate of crab-cakes alone can set you back a cool $55 -- gained iconic status among Wall Street big-shots and movie producers in the high-flying days of the 1980s. According to Zagat, it's still the only place to go if money is no object. ""$100 dollars for lunch? It's no big deal if you're trying to make a million dollar deal,"" he reasons. ""If you're talking business and it's going to be paid for by somebody else, really (the price) doesn't make much difference."" But it's not just the expensive fare, modernist dÃ©cor and silver-service that are set to impress, in fact it's your fellow diners who are really the main draw. ""Everybody in the place is somebody your guest will recognise,"" explains Zagat. ""Lunch there is like going through a bunch of front pages of Time magazine."" Jean-Georges . For those without bottomless pockets, New York City has abundance of super-stylish eating establishments offering fine dining at an affordable price. According to Zagat, many of the city's best restaurants are now offering pre-fixed price menus at lunchtime, aimed squarely at business people. Top of the pile, says Zagat, is the three Michelin-starred Jean-Georges, situated near to Central Park in the Trump International Hotel. For a relatively modest $38, aspiring tycoons can scoff a two-course meal of sea trout and oyster scallop Carpaccio and a plate of crispy sweetbreads with spring onion and hibiscus -- to name just a few of the establishment's signature dishes. ""I've eaten more meals here in the last five years than at any other single restaurant,"" reveals Zagat. The Standard Grill . While the midtown restaurants aim for the more established crowd, downtown aims for the upcoming software titans in t-shirts and jeans. This is the ""most funky, fun area in New York,"" says Zagat. At the uber-trendy Standard Grill - where mains run around $15, your client is impressed - and your expense manager even more so. Situated amid the industrial chic of a former meatpacking district, the restaurant serves up a one-page ""American Bistro"" menu where artisanal saucissons and hams comfortably sit alongside the Yankee staples of Ranch burgers and steaks. ""We definitely have a younger clientele - very sexy, fashionista, very cutting edge"" boasts manager Michael Bailey.","New York City is enjoying a resurgence of the 'power lunch', where big deals are brokered over fine food .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Lawrence might be the celebrity muscle of the ""Hunger Games"" sequel ""Catching Fire,"" but viewers will soon find Oahu, Hawaii, to be the superstar of the film. With the next ""Hunger Games"" movie opening today amid a sea of buzz, fans of Suzanne Collins' trilogy are lining up to see Katniss and Peeta battle it out against other victors in the Quarter Quell, the 75th Hunger Games competition. But they may also come away wanting to take a trip to the Aloha State. Although much of the preliminary filming of ""Catching Fire"" took place on the U.S. mainland, the cast and crew spent five weeks in the dense jungles and pristine beaches of the North Shore of Oahu, enjoying the sun, sand and aloha of the 50th state. Now, travelers heading to Hawaii can retrace the stars' footprints along the jungles and beaches that played host to Panem's annual battle-to-the-death match in ""Catching Fire."" North Shore Bay as saltwater lake . Though the North Shore of Oahu might be known for its massive swells, location scouts needed a beach with clear, calm water to act as the saltwater lake in the Quell arena. Honolulu Film Commissioner Walea Constantinau recommended Kawela Bay as the perfect location for a crucial scene when the tributes appear on top of the lake, ready for battle. Kawela Bay is stunning crescent of crystal blue popular with green sea turtles and paddle boarders, a hobby cast members took up in between takes. Access this secluded and sacred beach by walking 30 minutes from Turtle Bay Resort along the coast during low tide. Running through the jungles like Katniss and Peeta . You won't be racing from skin-eating fog or wild monkey-like creatures when exploring the lush North Shore, but you can get swallowed by greenery while hiking through one of Hawaii's most sacred valleys. Many of the film's jungle scenes were filmed in remote locations in the North Shore's Waimea Valley that are off-limits to tourists. However, you can still follow in the footsteps of Katniss and Peeta escaping the blistering fog or hearing jabberjays (likely mynah birds) in this natural wonderland. Those wanting to try racing through the jungles can access Waimea Valley, which is almost 40 miles from Waikiki, via the valley's visitor center east of Haleiwa. Take a short hike through the reconstructed ancient village to spot endangered birds, archeological sites, replicas of ancient sacred structures called heiaus and the 40-foot Waimea Falls, which you can swim under. North Carolina lures 'Hunger Games' fans . Closer to Waikiki, the Manoa Valley Trail system -- which portrayed another part of the movie's Arena jungle -- is a series of strenuous hikes that will test your Katniss-like endurance. The most popular path, the Manoa Falls Trail, skirts through bamboo and along streams and meets up with the 150-foot Manoa Falls. Real adventurers can take a series of trailheads through the dense forest of Manoa Valley and up behind Paradise Park, a former animal performance venue, where scenes from ""Catching Fire"" and the popular television show ""Lost"" were filmed. Luxe it up like the stars . Since much of the filming took place on the North Shore, many of the cast and crew stayed at Turtle Bay Resort, a location also featured in the film ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" Perched atop the edge of Kuilima Cove, the resort offers access to a lovely beach perfect for snorkeling, horseback riding, kayaking and stand up paddle boarding lessons. Cast member and Hawaii resident Woody Harrelson was known to escape to nearby beaches on his breaks from filming to brave the infamous North Shore swells. Actress Jennifer Lawrence was spotted poolside on numerous occasions. They also filmed one day at the hotel's Bay View Beach, steps from the Ocean Villas, where many cast members and their families stayed and celebrated Thanksgiving last year. Cast and crew appreciated the onsite restaurant Ola's and Lei Lei's Bar & Grill. They also reportedly spent many nights at the resort's Surfer, The Bar, run in collaboration with Surfer magazine. This is the place to be on the North Shore, with great cocktails and live music nightly. Oahu resident Jack Johnson recently popped in to play an impromptu set. Hawaii's film legacy . Film buffs who want more than ""the Hunger Game""s version of Hawaii can drive along the Windward Coast of Oahu to Halona Cove, a speck of beach beyond Halona Blowhole; this is where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr had their famed beach kiss in ""From Here to Eternity."" For an in-depth look at Oahu's cinematic history, consider the Kualoa Ranch movie tour. Just 22 miles north of Honolulu, this peaceful 4,000-acre preserve offers guided tours of the dozens of film and TV programs shot throughout the property, including the scene in the first ""Jurassic Park"" when the ostrich-like dinosaurs were escaping the T-Rex. Travelers wanting to revisit ""Lost,"" ""Hawaii Five-0"" and other Oahu film locations can book an off-road vehicle tour of the Windward Coast and Ka'a'awa Valley with Kos Tours. They are rumored to be developing a ""Hunger Games"" tour, so be sure to bring your bow and arrow, and ""may the odds forever be in your favor.""","Hike through the Waimea Valley and enter the Hunger Games' jungle .

"(CNN) -- Canadian authorities are considering criminal charges -- albeit not for a hate crime -- against whomever wrote a stark letter to an Ontario family urging them to either ""move or euthanize"" their autistic son. Prosecutors determined that ""despite the hateful language used,"" the content of the letter ""falls below the threshold for a hate crime,"" the Durham Regional Police Service issued a statement Tuesday. ""However, there are other criminal code issues that are being considered,"" police added. The anonymous letter stirred a far-reaching outcry, as well as prompting neighbors to rally around the targeted 13-year-old, Max Begley, since it became public. The letter -- signed ""one pissed off mother"" -- castigates Begley's family for what they describe as the ""nuisance"" the teen poses. ""That noise he makes when he is outside is DREADFUL! Its (sic) scares the hell out of my normal children!!!!!"" the letter states. ""They should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science."" The writer tells the family to ""go live in a trailer in the woods with your wild animal kid"" and to do ""the right thing and move or euthanize him!"" ""Either way we are all better off."" The message was delivered to Max's grandmother's house, about 15 minutes from the Begley home in Oshawa, a town 40 miles from Toronto. The boy's father, James, explained that he works and has multiple sclerosis, so Max goes to his grandmother's three to four times a week. ""If someone is sick enough to not only have those thoughts, but to write those thoughts out and then to mail them"" James Begley said, then ""they should be considered dangerous. We are all concerned."" The letter writer has not been identified by authorities, and police have asked people to give them any information on the case. As to Max, who is going into the eighth grade this year, his dad said he is not aware exactly of what has happened. ""But he sure is getting a kick out of all of the attention.""","A letter sent to an Ontario woman's house calls her grandson a ""nuisance""

"(CNN) -- The ADE 651 stood for ""Advanced Detection Equipment"". And it certainly looked the part. Sleek black casing. A swivelling antenna that was said to detect everything from bombs to 100 dollar bills. A card that indicated what the device had found. In video recorded by James McCormick, the man behind the skyrocketing sales of ADE 651, police in Niger can be seen using the device searching for explosives by a live minefield. Just one problem: It doesn't work. British police say the ADE 651 is really the ""Gopher"" a novelty golf-ball finder with the label removed. This device, independent tests show, has no better than a random chance at finding a golf ball, much less a bomb. Maker of fake bomb detector gets 10 years in prison . ""These devices contain absolutely nothing inside. There's no laws of science or physics that could make them work,"" Detective Inspector Edward Heath told CNN. ""He is a conman. He uses sleight of hand, absurd sales tactics to actually con governments, officials, private individuals out of money to buy this device."" McCormick spent less than 18 months as an entry level policeman in the Liverpool area before becoming a salesman of radio equipment. With his sales patter and his brief time as a policeman, McCormick was a convincing pitch man. In a training video to potential salesmen in India, McCormick can clearly be heard saying he ""worked with explosives"" during his time with the British police. ""He targeted countries where terrorism and violence was rife,"" Heath said. ""They had such terrible problems with violence and terrorism, they were desperate for any measure to prevent them from happening. The countries that he targeted also didn't have proper testing methods or any scientific laboratories to make sure they worked. They very much took the trust of the person selling it. And James McCormick came across as an honest and reliable businessman. But in fact he was a con man."" It was the 'Made in the UK' label on the ADE 651 that tipped off British police. They found that McCormick had the components made separately in Britain, then assembled them himself at his office in an old dairy farm in Somerset, England. Police investigators believe it cost him less than $60 to make each device. In at least one case, he sold them for as much as $300,000 a piece. He sold the devices to government agencies and private companies around the world. But it wasn't just a good sales line that allowed McCormick, over a 10-year period, to become a millionaire from a fraudulent device. An Iraqi general has been jailed for procuring the ADE 651 through ""unauthorized"" channels. British police believe that McCormick paid off officials to buy the ADE 651 in bulk. Iraq's law enforcement agencies bought 6,000 of the devices to scan for explosives at checkpoints, many of them still in use today, potentially endangering lives. It was a profitable business. His company made between $60 million and Â£80 million. He spent it on property, an $8 million luxurious historic home in Bath -- previously owned by Hollywood star Nicholas Cage -- with a swimming pool in the basement. He also bought a million dollar yacht and holiday homes in Cyprus and Florida. Police are now trying to seize these assets. ""We will do our utmost to make sure that James McCormick never lives off the proceeds of crime,"" Heath said. ""What we intend to do is make sure his assets are confiscated, so that he cannot live a life of luxury off his crime.""","James McCormick is the man behind the ADE 651 bomb detector .

"(CNN) -- Better call Saul? A man who won a contest to meet the cast of ""Breaking Bad"" back in September has been arrested on drug charges, CNN affiliate WBBH reported. Ryan Lee Carroll, 28, was arrested Tuesday following a raid on a home in the San Carlos Park neighborhood in Fort Myers, Florida, the station reported. Carroll, who was reportedly taken into custody on felony charges of alleged possession of synthetic narcotics and a misdemeanor charge of allegedly keeping a shop or vehicle for dangerous drugs, won a national contest to meet the ""Breaking Bad"" actors prior to that hit show's series finale. The TV series centers on a science teacher turned meth dealer. Another character on the show, Saul Goodman, is a slick lawyer who employs questionable methods to help his clients. ""It's just so addicting,"" Carroll told WBBH of ""Breaking Bad"" at the time he won the contest. ""It's such a good show. I think it's addicting because people can relate to the main character."" After the warrant was served on the home, neighbors told the station that the scene was like something out of a Hollywood production, with a swarm of police cars and dozens of officers descending on the neighborhood. According to the Lee County Sheriff's Office's website, as of Thursday morning Carroll remained in custody.","Ryan Lee Carroll won a contest to meet the ""Breaking Bad"" cast .

"(CNN) -- He claimed he won the prize this week, and now it's official: Pedro Quezada of New Jersey is the winner of Saturday's $338 million Powerball jackpot, the New Jersey Lottery said Tuesday. Quezada announced on Monday that he held the winning ticket, but the final word from lottery officials didn't come until Tuesday. ""I felt pure joy, just happiness,"" Quezada, a Dominican immigrant and deli owner, told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. ""It's a gift from God,"" he said. Undoubtedly, his life will change. But the money ""won't change my heart,"" Quezada said. He said he was walking to work Monday and saw a crowd at a liquor store in Passaic, New Jersey. He'd bought his Powerball ticket there, so he thought he should go in to see who won. He had his ticket with him, and showed it to the clerk, who checked it and told him he was the winner. Laughing, he recalled leaving the store and going to ""hide."" He said he was nervous Monday night. ""I couldn't close my eyes,"" the father of five said in Spanish, relying on a translator throughout the news conference. ""I never thought I would win such a prize,"" Quezada said. Quezada chose the up-front cash option, instead of an annuity, when he bought his ticket. The lump sum is $211 million. But after federal and state taxes, he will net about $151 million, Carole Hedinger, executive director of the New Jersey Lottery, has said. For winner, unexpected change can come with those dollars . One reporter asked whether he planned to stay in New Jersey, while others inquired whether he wanted to return to the Dominican Republic to celebrate with family and friends. Quezada said he moved to the United States when he was 19. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""I have to think about it, my mind is not clear yet."" When asked if he plans to keep working, he said no, recalling long days that started at 5 in the morning. And his son who works at the deli won't continue either, Quezada said. ""Of course, my family's a very humble family, and we're going to help each other out,"" he said. Quezada is married and has five children, ages 5-23, and one granddaughter. His wife, who is from Mexico, also spoke at the news conference, saying she didn't have words when her husband first broke the news. Quezada said he might buy a car with part of his winnings. A reporter asked him what kind of car he has now. ""My feet,"" he answered, laughing. He said he wants to help people with his winnings. ""I don't know exactly how, but I will help those in need,"" he said. Quezada's ticket matched all six numbers drawn Saturday night: 17, 29, 31, 52, 53 and the Powerball, 31.

"(CNN) -- Newly revealed photographs of Reeva Steenkamp show the South African beauty as a young aspiring model, and as a star cover girl, just months before her tragic death. One group of images, taken by Reeva's friend Kerry Smith eight years before her death, show the then 21-year-old law student and modeling wannabe posing on the beach at Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where she grew up -- and where her grieving parents scattered her ashes. Her dark hair, freckles and innocent good looks are a world away from the shots of a bikini-clad Reeva featured in glossy magazines which millions around the world are now familiar with. ""That's Reeva in her natural beauty,"" Smith said. ""Not a stitch of makeup on. Hair blowing in the wind with the sea behind her, sun setting behind her."" That's a view of the model shared by another photographer, Gareth Barclay, who took a series of pictures of Reeva in the months before her death. These photos, said to have been commissioned by Steenkamp for an unidentified ""special someone,"" show a Reeva who is -- outwardly at least -- very different: Blonde, confident, worldly and polished. ""Most of the photos that I took of her aren't even edited,"" Barclay said. ""That's just how she is, you know. ""That's just a simple color grading that I put on it to give an effect or a mood, but I mean, her skin was always great, beautiful eyes, beautiful features."" Steenkamp, 29, died last year on February 14 -- Valentine's Day. She was shot dead in the bathroom of the home she shared with Olympic and Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius. Pistorius insists her death was an accident, that he opened fire after mistaking her for an intruder. Prosecutors disagree: his murder trial starts on March 3. His family said the loss of his girlfriend -- and his involvement in her death -- has devastated the athlete. ""It's a terrible, terrible mistake he made,"" his uncle Arnold Pistorius told CNN. ""I can just image the family of Reeva, the grief they've got and most probably anger, and you know this is a traumatic experience for them and I can't even imagine myself being in that position."" Another of Barclay's pictures shows the tattoo on Reeva's neck: The phrase ""Only God will judge me,"" written in Italian. ""It was very personal to her,"" said Barclay. ""She never really spoke about it or anything, she just wanted a personal photo of it, 'cause, you know, she didn't have any photos of it."" For Steenkamp, this tattoo represented something central to her life, something to be defined by. ""That was something that her grandfather had always said, you know,"" explained Smith. ""It was very close to her own heart."" Pistorius, though, will be judged in a Pretoria courtroom. CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this story.","Pictures show Reeva Steenkamp as aspiring model and established cover girl .

"(CNN) -- Five Washington D.C. firefighters all heard that a man had fallen across the street from their firehouse and was in need of medical help, but none went to his aid, an internal report released Friday concludes. The report recommends that all five -- ranging from a probationary firefighter to a lieutenant -- face disciplinary action along with four dispatchers who further botched the city's response by sending an ambulance to the wrong part of the city. The man, Medric Cecil Mills Jr., 77, a 47-year employee of the city's parks department, later died at a hospital. His family said he had suffered a heart attack. The lieutenant announced her retirement days after the incident. The new report largely confirms a troubling account by Mills' daughter, who said her father collapsed as they left a computer store January 25. Mills said passersby shouted and went to Engine House 26 seeking help, but that no one responded. The firehouse is across a wide avenue from the parking lot where Mills collapsed. The report detailed miscommunication and an apparent disregard by those at the station. An internal speaker system in the firehouse, which could have helped spread the word, was turned off, it said. According to the report, word first arrived at the firehouse when a resident came to the station's front door. The probationary officer said the person said he witnessed a man near the liquor store across the street slip on ice. The individual was passed out and in need of help, the probationary firefighter said he was told. The firefighters called the station lieutenant on a public address system, asking her to come to the watch desk. He then opened the apparatus doors, only to discover a car in the driveway, with the driver stating that ""there's a man across the street that needs help."" The firefighter made a second call on the public address system, asking the lieutenant and stating it was urgent, the report said. Of three firefighters sitting in the kitchen, one went to see the probationary officer. After telling the probationary officer that they had not been dispatched, the senior firefighter went to find the lieutenant, told her about the call, and told her what he believed the address to be. The lieutenant later told investigators that she asked the firefighter for an exact address and that he did not return with one. The firefighter said he returned to the kitchen, told his fellow firefighters that he had informed the lieutenant, and then gathered study books from his car and went to the bunk room. When the lieutenant tracked down the firefighter in the bunk room, the firefighter said he understood that an ambulance had been originally dispatched to the wrong address, but ""he thought it was alright since (the communications center) had finally dispatched"" an engine to the correct address. The lieutenant told investigators she then went outside to see what was happening, and saw police officers and ambulances at the scene. The report said it was undetermined whether the lieutenant failed to respond to the public address system calls because the speakers had been turned off, but said ""under no circumstances should the PA speakers (have) been turned off or disabled prior to 10:00 p.m."" The fire department's response was further delayed because of confusion over a 911 call, the report said. A call-taker initially dispatched the ambulance to the wrong quadrant of the city, quickly correcting the mistake when checking it with the caller. But other dispatchers failed to see the correction, and the ambulance was sent to the wrong address. The report recommended that all five firefighters and four dispatchers face discipline, but did not identify them or specify the punishment, which could range from reprimands to dismissal. The city said it was taking a number of steps to prevent another incident.","Firefighters, dispatchers face action from city for not responding adequately to elderly man .

"(CNN) -- When online media first arose, one of the common complaints about it was that it wasn't very portable. Unlike books or magazines, you couldn't easily read your desktop or laptop on the bus or in the bathroom. But mobile digital media hold the promise of a return to convenient portable reading. And new statistics from the popular online reading list service ReadItLater indicate that mobile devices are not only changing where people are reading but when. ReadItLater is a free service that allows internet users to save the full text of articles and other content they encounter online on a personal reading list. It then displays this content in a format that's very friendly to mobile devices. I use ReadItLater (and one of its competitors, Instapaper) to save longer-format content (like 5,000-word Harper's articles) for later digital reading in a way that I find easier on the eyes than extended reading sessions on a Web browser. Almost always, this means reading articles on my Android phone -- usually when I'm on public transit or waiting in line somewhere but often also when I'm lying in bed. According to a recent ReadItLater blog post, users of this service save articles to their lists at a fairly constant pace throughout the day, but they read this content mostly in the evening, from 6 to 9 p.m. But when ReadItLater took a close look at statistics for its iPhone and iPad users, a different trend emerged. For iPhone users, there tended to be four peak reading times: . • 6 a.m.: Early morning, breakfast . • 9 a.m.: Morning commute, start of the workday . • 5-6 p.m.: End of the workday, commute home . • 8-10 p.m.: Couch time, prime time, bedtime . ""In reality, this really is a graph of whitespace time,"" says the post. ""Whitespace is the time between A and B. It's the time on the subway or bus. It's the time standing in line. It's a spare moment."" For iPad users, ReadItLater noticed one especially huge peak reading time: 8 to 10 p.m. ""This time slot is the same one coveted by television. When the majority of people are consuming content it seems perfectly natural that people would use this time to do their reading as well."" ReadItLater also found that ""iPad owners are no longer doing the majority of their reading on their computers."" This makes sense to me, since iPads are primarily media consumption devices while computers and smartphones are better suited for communication and content creation. ReadItLater did not offer statistics for Android devices, but this service does not offer its own Android app. The NewsRoom Android app by Trileet Inc. is supported by the ReadItLater API and is one option for Android users.

"(CNN) -- Despite their second-place status in the 2011 FIFA World Cup Final, the women of the U.S. soccer team hope their success in the tournament -- especially their appearance in the final game before a global audience -- encourages more Americans to get excited about the women's sport. ""I think we did something pretty special for women's soccer here in America,"" said Megan Rapinoe, a midfielder from California. ""Hopefully this has kind of opened people's eyes a little bit to how beautiful the women's game can be."" Playing in a sport that has long labored in the shadow of the men's game, and representing a country where soccer has long fought for attention against football, baseball, basketball and other major-league sports, made the thousands of roaring fans in the final game in Frankfurt, Germany, all the more stimulating for the team.

Japan was considered by many to be the sentimental favorite going into the game, in the aftermath of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami in March.

"(CNN) -- Community activist Tony Lewis Jr. is on a mission to right the wrongs of his father's past. Known as ""Little Tony,"" Lewis Jr. recalls having a ""quintessential"" childhood, often envied by his neighborhood friends. In his household, his parent's love and money were free-flowing. He and his father planned lavish shopping trips and the family frequently vacationed in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. They went to see Michael Jackson in concert, attended the Super Bowl and took in championship boxing matches. He describes this time in his life as an inner city version of the 1980s sitcom ""Silver Spoons."" ""My father would pick me up in a Porsche one day, a Mercedes the next day, a BMW the next. My mother would drive a Mercedes, a Jaguar,"" Lewis Jr. says, ""It was normal to me."" That all changed on December 6, 1989. That's the day his father, Tony Lewis Sr. was convicted of helping to run one of the largest drug rings in the history of the nation's capitol. In the same city where his cocaine operation wreaked havoc, his son now mentors young men who might be lured into a life of crime. Although as a child he knew his father was different from the parents of his Catholic schoolmates, Tony says he was completely unaware of father's illegal activity. ""I never saw my dad with drugs at all. That was something that was never done in our presence."" It wasn't until 1988, when Tony was 8 years old that he realized the truth behind his father's extravagant lifestyle. While watching the local news, Tony saw a report that claimed officials had raided one of the city's largest cocaine distribution networks. He gazed at the TV screen as his father was escorted into police custody, a suspect in the high profile case. After Tony Sr. was arrested, he never came home. ""When my father went to prison, my childhood pretty much ended,"" he says. ""My innocence was taken."" The court found that Tony Lewis Sr. was a partner in a cocaine distribution conspiracy that generated millions of dollars in sales. He is appealing his conviction on four counts including conspiracy to distribute narcotics and racketeering. Tony's father was eventually sentenced to life without parole. Lewis Sr. remembers seeing Little Tony after his guilty verdict. ""I cried. ... I told him that he had to be strong."" Leaving his son was the hardest thing he ever had to do. ""No amount of money I made is worth this,"" he says. Lewis Jr. says he didn't find out his father would never get out of jail until he was 14 years old, while researching on the Internet at school. ""To find out he was going to be locked up forever was very tough to deal with,"" Tony says. ""It crushed me."" In a recent interview with CNN from a federal prison in Maryland, Lewis Sr. told CNN that it was never his dream to be a drug dealer. As the son of a single mother raising six kids on welfare, Lewis Sr. says he started selling drugs at 14 as a way to make ends meet: ""We never had enough to eat. I actually started selling drugs to ... provide for my siblings."" After his dad's downfall, Tony says he went from ""riches to rags."" Along with his mother, Tony moved into his grandmother's row home, located on a city block once known for violence and crime. ""I had to mature very quickly to be able to kind of survive the things that I went through,"" Tony says. Growing up on Washington's Hanover Place in the late '80s and '90s, where drugs and violence were commonplace, Tony recalls losing friends and family members to the streets. Shortly after his father's incarceration, Tony says his mother suffered a mental breakdown, leaving him without the secure family structure he once knew. ""He was left pretty much parentless,"" his father says. During his teen years, Tony admits he was tempted to follow in his father's footsteps: ""The men in my family were bank robbers, and gamblers ... and drug dealers. There was no blueprint for me to succeed."" But, he credits his mother and grandmother, and his father's consistent support from behind bars for motivating him to succeed beyond his circumstances. ""I didn't want to die at 16, 18, 21,"" Tony Jr. says. ""I knew another way of life was possible."" Tony graduated from the University of the District of Columbia in 2003 at the age of 23. Now 32, Tony's goal is to impact the lives of young men growing up without fathers. In 2010, Tony founded a mentoring initiative for children of incarcerated parents called Sons of Life. He was inspired to create the organization during a routine prison visit with his father. Tony noticed a young boy waiting in the visiting area to see his dad. He looked to be about 8 years old, the same age as Tony when his father went away. ""I completely saw myself in that kid,"" he says. ""I prayed he wouldn't have to endure what I endured without my father -- that was the premise for Sons of Life. ... I wanted to help some kids in my situation make it."" Tony, whose day job involves developing job skills for ex-offenders, mentors 10 young men ages 9 to 21 through his program. He organizes field trips to the White House, sporting events, and dinners. He aims to expose the young men to possibility and opportunity. Tony also helps families buy Christmas and birthday gifts and school supplies, stepping in where their fathers can't. In collaboration with his father, who is still in prison in Maryland, Tony has also organized family prison trips for children in need of transportation to detention centers. Tony is like a big brother to Sons of Life participants Xavier and Delfon. ""He goes to our football events, basketball games,"" says 14-year-old Delfon. ""It makes me feel like actually cares."" His brother Xavier, 13, added: ""He can relate to me because he's been through the same thing I'm going through."" According to the boys' mother, who asked that her name not be published, Tony's presence has made a big difference in her sons' lives. ""I see the way my kids' faces light up just because he can relate,"" she explained. ""Most of their peers didn't understand. Just the average peer group didn't work well for them."" According to Joyce Arditti, professor of human development at Virginia Tech and author of ""Parental Incarceration and the Family,"" children of incarcerated parents are unique when compared with those who have endured other forms of parent separation such as divorce or death. Research suggests that children of incarcerated parents are often disadvantaged in many areas of life and at a higher risk of school failure, poor self esteem, delinquent behavior and incarceration themselves, according to Arditti. It's difficult for the remaining parent to find coping resources for children living with the stress of having a parent behind bars, she says, adding that programs like Sons of Life can be effective. ""Insider status is very important,"" she says. ""Therapy that is typically successful for children of incarcerated parents are programs that closely model their day to day experience."" For Tony, leading by example is the best way to inspire others around him. Though he can't turn back the clock, he's trying to restore his father's name in the community. ""One of the biggest things I'm proud of is that I've been able to really change the perception of what my name means in my city."" Today, Tony still lives in the same row house with his grandmother, on the same street where he grew up. ""The kids in my community need to see me,"" Tony says. ""They need to be able to touch me and know that I am not a myth. I want to be an inspiration for them to say yes we can make it out too.""","Tony Lewis Jr. is the son of an infamous former Washington drug dealer .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Two cargo ships collided just outside Tokyo Bay, according to the Japanese Coast Guard. The Panamanian-flagged Beagle III crashed into another vessel, the South Korean-registered Pegasus Prime, causing it to sink. The incident occurred southeast of the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture. Of the 20 crew members -- all of whom are Chinese nationals -- aboard Beagle III, 12 have been found and eight are still missing. Of the rescued crew members, six have slight injuries. The Chief Engineer of he ship was found drifting and seriously injured on Tuesday, He was taken to the nearby Miura City Hospital in a ""state of cardiopulmonary arrest,"" but was confirmed dead Tuesday, the Japan Coast Guard confirmed. The 14 crew aboard the other vessel, Pegasus Prime, are all accounted for, according to the Coast Guard. The two ships collided at 3:20 a.m. Tuesday. Japan's Transportation Safety Board has dispatched five marine accident investigators to look into the cause of the accident. The area the collision occurred is the entrance of Tokyo Bay, a well-known sea route for more than 400 vessels that use the port in Tokyo or Yokohama. Beagle III, a 12,630-ton general cargo ship, last reported its position as just south of the entrance to Tokyo Bay. It is currently reported as ""out of range."" Its last known port was nearby Yokohama. The Coast Guard has confirmed that it had departed Yokohama and was heading to Kobe. The 7,406-ton Pegasus Prime had departed Kunsan, South Korea and was heading to Tokyo. The Chinese Embassy reported that the search and rescue operation is comprised of 10 ships and a helicopter. The statement also indicated that ""emergency mechanisms"" were in place between the Japanese and Chinese authorities in Tokyo to ensure proper cooperation and continued efforts to search for the remaining missing crew members. The Japan Coast Guard is continuing search operations by patrol boats and aircraft, but there have been no clues regarding the missing crew members yet, they said Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound. They were heritage breed birds, Bourbon reds whose numbers had dwindled to dangerously low levels as the broad-breasted white -- the Butterball -- dominated. At the time, the farmers were still a little queasy about slaughtering and selling livestock they'd raised. (One farmer had been a longtime vegetarian.) But by giving these turkeys a productive death, they explained, they were actually helping them survive. If they weren't for dinner, these birds just weren't useful. They were neither cuddly nor well-behaved. They made terrible pets, and weren't well-suited for life in the wilderness. They weren't destined for poultry popularity, either -- maybe your grandparents would recognize their gamey flavor, but it was nothing like the gravy-slathered protein that generations had gobbled down over the holidays. But if they enticed enough Thanksgiving cooks to prepare them, the farmers saw a win for biodiversity and the birds. Give them a reason to exist, and these turkeys could thrive. I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam. Come spring 2016, the essay will be optional. The score scale will return to familiar ol' 1600. The test prep will be free, and delivered via Khan Academy. And, the SAT word will be no more, Coleman said. Just like those old-timey turkeys, it seems there's limited use for the $5 words we've come to expect from the SAT. ""Today, when we say that someone has used an SAT word, it often means a word you have not heard before and are not likely to soon hear again,"" Coleman explained in his announcement. You know these words if you took the test, its preparatory cousin, the PSAT, or almost any college-minded standardized test. You flipped through their definitions on flash cards, or faced them in a spelling bee, if you were that kind of kid. You probably still use a number of them: ""threatened,"" ""vigilant,"" ""predicting,"" ""ousting"" and ""strengthened"" all appeared on an SAT test in 2013. Of course, ""bellicosity,"" ""obduracy"" and ""garrulous"" were on the test, too. After the frenzy and stress of SAT cramming, the words become kind of a parenthetical joke, a chance to finally giggle at the absurdity of it all. Drop ""mellifluous"" or ""loquacious"" into a sentence after the college applications are sent, and you can actually stop to appreciate it -- ""Hey, I just used an SAT word!"" Coleman said he's done indulging tricks and flash cards that promise to beat his test, especially at the expense of deep, analytical reading and understanding. If the college exam tests only obscure vocabulary words, ""students stop reading and start flipping,"" he said. The redesigned SAT will instead focus on words students are likely to use over and over again, he said, like ""synthesis"" and ""empirical."" ""The SAT will honor the best work of our classrooms -- reading widely and learning how words work in their different contexts,"" he said. ""We aim to offer worthy challenges, not artificial obstacles."" But I wondered, if the SAT abandons these words, what will become of ""treacly"" and ""mendacious""? Are they turkeys on the verge of extinction? Hardly, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg explained. The SAT wasn't keeping them alive, he said, and flash cards weren't doing justice to many words, anyway. Sure, those quick definitions did well enough for a multiple choice test. ""You can pick 'em out of a lineup,"" said Nunberg, who teaches in University of California Berkeley's School of Information. ""If you see 'mendacious' and you think 'dishonest,' you've got the main idea."" But ""empirical,"" he said? Now that's a complex word. It's got varied and layered meanings, some buried deep in history, or evolving only now. ""Under the guise of providing more user-friendly, fair tests, they're merely substituting one set of SAT words for another,"" Nunberg said. ""If anything, this calls for more tutoring, and more background than the old words."" He suspects that students might remember more from their SAT study sessions than anybody realizes, but the words are even less forgettable if students learn them through reading instead of flash cards. Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT. And if you don't use it? ""If people don't use the word,"" Nunberg said, ""it's because they don't need the word."" There are no guarantees about the vocabulary of the future SAT. The College Board certainly hasn't released a list of banned words, and it's not as if the passages will suddenly read like ""Fun with Dick and Jane."" It wouldn't be a test, Nunberg said, if everybody could answer all the questions correctly. ""Everything is an SAT word to somebody,"" he said. Consider just one of the changes coming to the SAT in 2016: Each exam will include passages from meaningful historic documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""Letter from Birmingham Jail."" In King's nearly 7,000-word letter, he dropped ""cognizant,"" ""superficial,"" ""moratorium,"" ""unfettered,"" ""ominous,"" ""ordinance,"" ""paternalistically,"" ""incorrigible,"" ""zeitgeist,"" ""sanctimonious,"" ""nullification,"" ""gladiatorial,"" ""scintillating"" and ""existential."" Any of them could be called an ""SAT word."" Any of them could be on the new test. So, word lovers, do not mourn the next generation's vocabulary. Educators, do not celebrate the end of flash cards. The SAT word is dead, long live the SAT word. These turkeys still have a long time to cook. What do you think of the changes to the SAT?

"(CNN) -- Amelie Mauresmo wants a second life -- one away from tennis. After calling time on an illustrious playing career with two grand slams safely tucked away, the Frenchwoman is arguably just as entrenched in the game as she ever was. Mauresmo is currently juggling roles as tournament director in Paris and captain of France's Fed Cup team, alongside coaching and commentating stints. But the 34-year knows there will come a time when she walks away from the court once and for all, hopefully in the direction of her own vineyard. ""To be lucky enough to have lived one passion -- tennis -- is great but to learn many things and meet new people in a completely different area, atmosphere and world, why not?"" she tells CNN's Open Court show. ""I have a high passion that is wine; I am a wine lover, I have a big wine cellar. ""I read a lot of things about wine from around the world and different regions in France. I check sometimes with friends of mine about the wine chateaus that are for sale."" A world away from the tranquil vines associated with France's verdant valleys is the slog of the professional tennis circuit -- Mauresmo's home for well over a decade. As well as clinching those two major championships in 2006 -- the Australian Open and Wimbledon crowns -- she attained the coveted world No. 1 spot on several occasions and won a silver medal the 2004 Olympics. But when injuries began to mount in 2009 and Mauresmo took the decision to quit the court, a whole new world presented itself to her. ""It was the pressure,"" she explains. ""The pressure that came out of my shoulders was huge. I was finally able to live a normal life, let's say, to enjoy the things that I could not enjoy before. ""I also felt that I achieved as a tennis player everything that I could have done, so I think it made it quite easy for me to take the step out of it and to do other things. ""Honestly I was scared. (I thought) 'What am I going to do? Is it going to be exciting enough? How exactly is it going to be?' ""You are going into something and you have no clue what it is ... and I am really happy, I don't regret anything."" Fast forward five years and Mauresmo is still intrinsically linked with tennis. In 2011 she was named tournament director of the GDF Suez Open in Paris, a competition she won three times as a player, before accepting the role of captain of France's national women's team in July 2012. Mauresmo has a special place in her heart for the Fed Cup -- the female equivalent of the Davis Cup -- having won it in 2003, triumphing in all eight of her singles rubbers. Alize Cornet, one of those involved in France's Group II win over Switzerland last month, says Mauresmo is the best captain she has ever played for. She has also had success in her short coaching career, helping propel Marion Bartoli to the 2013 Wimbledon title before her compatriot's shock decision to quit the sport. With 25 career singles titles to her name, and over $15 million accrued in prize money, Mauresmo's name was, and still is, indelibly marked into the fabric of the women's game. ""Tennis was all my life for 20 years,"" she says. ""I owe so much to tennis as a person also because I really grew up and learned many things, I was talking earlier about the relationships with people and the strong connections that you get. ""I love that also to go on this journey but not alone -- really having people next to me, beside me, guiding me, learning from them, listening to them and giving them some things -- the exchange and the connection you have is quite interesting. ""And on the sports side you develop the competitiveness that you have inside of you, you really let it out. It's an obsessive thing to be a professional athlete, it's something you think about all the time. ""It's everything you do, how you eat, how you sleep, what time you go to bed, the activities you do outside. It's all related with your tennis and it's something that is really taking all your life, and I also enjoyed it. ""It was a relief when it stopped but throughout your career it was really fulfilling you, and it's quite interesting."" Given the knowledge and experience she has, tennis will miss Mauresmo when she departs. And when she does, what memory from her playing days will she treasure most? ""Wimbledon in 2006,"" she replies, recalling a final in which she rallied from a set down to beat Justine Henin -- who had denied her Olympic gold in Athens -- and become the first Frenchwoman to win the prestigious title since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925. ""It was really the emotion, the exhilaration the relief, being so proud of what I did,"" Mauresmo adds. ""It was a feeling you really keep in yourself, you are not thinking about it every day in your life but it's something that belongs to you and you cherish. ""Getting a medal in the Olympics is huge, winning the Fed Cup for my country, being number one in the world also is an amazing achievement, all those things but yes I would put Wimbledon on top.""","Amelie Mauresmo is still immersed in world of tennis four years after retirement .

"(CNN) -- Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens are swell and all, but boys and girls from around the world have vastly different interpretations of their ""favorite things,"" according to a new book by Italian photographer Gabriele Galimberti. Galimberti visited more than 50 countries to document children with their most prized playthings for ""Toy Stories: Photos of Children from Around the World and Their Favorite Things,"" which will be released on March 25. The photos prompt readers to reflect on the abundance of possessions that some children enjoy while others live a comparatively pared down existence because of poverty or their cultural values. ""The fewer toys a child had, the less possessive he or she was about them,"" notes London-based writer Ben Machell in the book's introduction. ""Galimberti describes having to spend several hours winning the trust of Western children before they would consent to let him touch their planes, cars, or dolls. 'In poorer countries, they don't care as much. They play in a different way, running around, sharing one ball between them all.' "" Not only are the toys reflective of the children's socioeconomic class but also their parents' aspirations. ""Hopes and ambitions are passed down through the toys parents choose for their children. Children from families boasting musicians invariably receive toy instruments,"" Machell writes, also noting that a cab driver's son had a fleet of toy cars. Galimberti recently chatted with CNN via e-mail about ""Toy Stories."" The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. CNN: Where did you get the idea for the project? Gabriele Galimberti: I started this project almost by chance. The first photo I took of this series was in Tuscany (Alessia, the girl with the cows in the background). She's the daughter of one of my best friends; that friend asked me to photograph her child. [When] I went to their house, and she was playing with the cows, I thought that situation was really nice and I decided to take the photo of her there with the cows and her toys. I really loved the result of that photo, and some months later when I was starting my trip around the world, I decided to take the same kind of photo in every country that I was going to visit. I had the opportunity to travel around the world for more than two years because, at that time, I was working for one of the major Italian magazines ""D-La Repubblica."" I was doing a project about CouchSurfing.org, so I traveled to 58 countries by only using the network. All the children that I have photographed are somehow connected to the couch surfers that hosted me along my long trip. They are their children, their nieces and nephews or simply their neighbors. Picture this: 'Much Loved' teddy bears . CNN: These toys are obviously prized possessions to the boys and girls -- how did you earn the children's trust? Galimberti: I played with them! And, of course, with the help of their parents. Most of the time, it was really easy to get their trust. I always had the photos of the children I photographed before, so sometimes it was just enough to show them the other photos to convince them to pose for me. I was really surprised to see how easy it was for children to understand my project. CNN Photos: Clown 'revolution' lifts refugee kids . CNN: What did you want the project's takeaway to be? Galimberti: I don't want to give any particular message. I just wanted to show how different we are in the world, and how different people live all around the globe. CNN: Did any particular photo shoots stick out? Galimberti: Every child and photo has their own funny anecdote, but one of the most particular is the one I photographed in Zambia: Maudy, the girl with the sunglasses. I was in this little village in the north part of the country, a place where there is almost nothing -- no electricity, no running water and, of course, no toy stores. It is almost impossible to find a child with a toy. Almost all of the children play outside with each other, and they are used to playing with anything they find outside. I was lucky enough to arrive in that village a couple of days after Maudy found a box of sunglasses on the ground along the main road. Her mother told me she thought they had fallen off a truck, but all the children in the village were playing with these glasses. CNN: Did you have a favorite toy growing up that you would have been photographed with if the shoe was on the other foot? Galimberti: Yes, from ages 3 to 6, I had a little [plush] monkey that I called Bongo Bongo. That was for sure my favorite one!","""Toy Stories"" features kids from around the world with their favorite toys .

"(CNN) -- ""When you want to know how things really work, study them when they're coming apart."" That bit of wisdom from Hubertus Bigend, the brilliant Belgian billionaire at the center of sci-fi author, William Gibson's latest novel, ""Zero History."" Bigend (pronounced Bayh-jhan) is the morally ambiguous mastermind behind a global marketing operation, the Google of trend forecasting. He's a ""cool hunter,"" reminiscent of Charles Foster Kane with an Andy Warhol eye for spotting emerging underground trends. Also returning is Hollis Henry, a semi-famous former singer from a 90s indie band, she's been hired by Bigend to uncover the identity of the designer behind the mysterious clothing brand, The Gabriel Hounds. ""Zero History"" is the final chapter in a trilogy that Gibson began with ""Pattern Recognition"" in 2003 and continued in 2007's ""Spook Country."" The London-based caper also involves paramilitary contractors, computer hackers, base-jumping spies, black market jeans dealers and something called the Festo AirPenguin. It's a long way from Gibson's 1984 award-winning debut novel, ""Neuromancer,"" a classic which helped launch the ""cyberpunk"" genre. He's been called a sci-fi prophet, and is credited with coining the term, ""cyberspace"" when the Internet was still largely unknown. Mystical P.I. in 'City of the Dead' More recently, Gibson isn't writing so much science fiction but what he calls, ""speculative fiction of the very recent past."" Instead of an imagined future, in ""Zero History"" Gibson examines the present-day impact of new technologies, the current tension between the cutting edge and the mainstream and how all of it is branded, marketed and manipulated for profit. CNN recently spoke with the author; the following is an edited transcript. CNN: ""Zero History"" seems like it could take place in the very near future or an amplified present. Does the rapid pace at which the world is changing make your job more difficult or just more interesting? Gibson: Actually, it takes place in the year before it was published. Literally in the year in which it was written. A speculative novel of the very recent past. Historically, it will be seen as having taken place before the Murdochalypse/Hackgate era. So Bigend's warning to Hollis, to assume all phones in the UK are tapped, will have a little sheen of prescience. But I'm not really shooting for prescience. I'm trying to realistically describe the inherently fantastic world we live in. CNN: You've written about 21st-century inventions like the Internet, reality TV and guerilla marketing before they became part of everyday life. What new developments or technology trends do you find interesting right now? Gibson: All of those things existed before I wrote about them; they just weren't that big a part of life yet. With reality TV, ""Cops"" was running when I wrote ""Virtual Light,"" and I knew about but hadn't seen the UK's ""Big Brother,"" likewise the Japanese show that had inspired ""Big Brother."" So I was working with something real, but something that struck me as inherently surreal, and trying to imagine it having extremely powerful pop culture legs. Which fortunately it turned out to have. My current stock of things like that is always quite small, so I try not to give them away! CNN: Hubertus Bigend is one of your most memorable characters. For new readers, give us a little background on who he is and what role he plays in ""Zero History."" Gibson: Bigend is the founding genius behind Blue Ant, a global PR/ad firm. I originally assumed he was just a standard walk-on evil figurehead, but the other characters started falling into a weird kind of love-hate with him, and I suppose I did, too. I don't always believe his explanation of our world, and I doubt he does either, but he's definitely been a delight to work with. Fantasy fans ready to 'Dance with Dragons' CNN: You're a frequent user of Twitter, how does it or other social media influence you as a writer or as a culture consumer? Gibson: I only know Twitter. The others seem too socially engineered. Too mall-like. I see Twitter as a virtual extension of ""the street."" You can run into anybody. And it makes breaking news more fun. Hugely more fun. CNN: Anything you're reading, watching or listening to you'd care to recommend? Gibson: I've already entered my pre-book stage, in which I quit reading fiction. If I could magically see anything I want, today, it would be ""Juan of the Dead,"" Cuba's first feature horror film. Zombie plague in Havana, deadpan Cuban comedy. Google the trailer. I recently saw Terry Gilliam's brilliant staging of Berlioz's ""The Damnation of Faust,"" in London. I imagine that was my cultural high point for the year. CNN: What's next for you? Gibson: I'm edging into a new book, not a Bigend one, and my collected nonfiction, ""Distrust That Particular Flavor"" should be out fairly soon.

"(CNN) -- Did Kerry Kennedy realize the morning of a 2012 traffic accident that she mistakenly took a sleeping pill? Is she responsible for what happened next? Those are the sorts of questions the jurors in her DWI trial began deliberating Thursday. In closing arguments, a prosecutor accused Kennedy of lying to police and the public in an effort to protect her legacy. Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, faces a charge of driving while impaired after swerving off the road in her Lexus SUV and careening into a tractor-trailer on a New York interstate in morning rush-hour traffic in July 2012. She testified this week that she grabbed the wrong prescription bottle off her kitchen counter that morning and swallowed 10 milligrams of zolpidem, commonly known by the brand name Ambien, thinking it was her thyroid medication. ""She had a lot on her mind that morning. And she took the wrong pill by mistake,"" prosecutor Doreen Lloyd told jurors. ""However, it also makes no sense whatsoever that at no point did she realize or feel tired or dizzy or drowsy. That makes no sense,"" she said. ""She is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that."" Lloyd told jurors that Kennedy had a responsibility to pull off the road safely when she felt the effect of the drug. Her inconsistent statements about the incident, including the claim that her doctors said she'd had a seizure, were meant as a smokescreen, Lloyd said: ""She knew. She knew right away that she had taken the wrong pill. She felt it. And I submit she was looking for an excuse, to avoid responsibility ... to control her public image."" In his closing arguments, defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt told jurors there's no disputing that Kennedy ingested zolpidem and was ""out of it"" the morning of the crash. ""The dispute is this: Whether the prosecution has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Kennedy operated her vehicle while she was aware that she had ingested zolpidem and, after becoming aware, she continued intentionally to drive. That's what this case is all about."" He continued, ""They're arguing without any evidence that she realized; she says she didn't. There's nothing to the contrary. Reasonable doubt."" A jury of two women and four men began its deliberations Thursday afternoon, after four days of testimony. They stopped for the day without reaching a verdict and will resume deliberations Friday morning. This week, jurors watched police cruiser dashboard camera footage of a disoriented Kennedy failing three sobriety tests after a motorist found her slumped over her steering wheel and called 911. New York State Trooper Bradley Molloy, who evaluated Kennedy three hours after the crash, said he thought she may have a medical condition and recommended that she get checked out. A worried Kennedy asked him for a vial of the blood drawn from her at Northern Westchester Hospital, Molloy said: ""She was concerned, and she wanted to know what happened to her."" Kennedy remained at the hospital overnight for observation. Jurors also heard from Elizabeth Pratt, director of the Westchester County Division of Laboratories and Research, who testified that zolpidem is ""a very potent, fast-acting hypnotic"" that begins to hamper cognitive ability and motor skills within 15 to 45 minutes. Its effect on Kennedy would have peaked about 9 a.m., testified Pratt, roughly the time Kennedy failed the sobriety tests. Lloyd asked Pratt whether zolpidem is a ""knockout pill,"" and she replied that the drug would need time to enter the bloodstream and brain before it takes full effect. A defense expert, clinical pharmacologist and forensic toxicologist David Benjamin, challenged that notion Thursday, saying the disabling influence could be instantaneous and impossible for a person to self-detect, likening it to the effects of a date rape drug. During her testimony, Kennedy emphatically denied feeling the effects of the powerful sleep aid in her system before the erratic driving and told Lloyd she doesn't even know what its symptoms feel like. ""You've taken this pill for 10 years, and you can't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it?"" Lloyd asked incredulously. ""I guess I don't really think about how I'm feeling when I take it,"" Kennedy replied. ""I take it, and then I'm asleep."" The jury is well-aware of the defendant's place in the storied political family. ""Daddy was the attorney general during the civil rights movement and then a senator,"" she testified Wednesday, and said her mother raised the family's 11 children because her father died when she was 8 years old: ""He was assassinated while running for president."" Matriarch Ethel Kennedy, 85, has attended the trial daily, along with several other relatives and family friends. Kennedy is the director of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights and became animated on the stand as she described her work to fight poverty and sexual slavery. She testified that she missed jury selection last week because of a trip to several European nations, including a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry in France and another in Brussels with the president of the European Parliament. In her closing arguments, Lloyd told jurors that Kennedy's humanitarian work and background are irrelevant: ""She is not exempt to the rule of law. She is subject to the rule of law of the state of New York like everybody else."" If convicted, Kennedy could face up to one year in prison.","Kennedy is on trial on a misdemeanor charge of driving while impaired .

To ensure pristine conditions for the most popular yearly event in all of American sport, the National Football League needs to book each of its Super Bowl contests in a stadium covered by (A) a permanent dome or (B) a retractable roof. No place else. Super Bowl XLVIII is scheduled to be played this coming Sunday in an outdoor arena in northern New Jersey. It could snow. It could hail. A game featuring some of the NFL's greatest stars could result in hundreds of millions of TV viewers watching these poor dudes slip, slide and shiver their XL-sized butts off. The defending NFL champion Baltimore Ravens' quarterback, Joe Flacco, put it bluntly in 2013 when asked about holding 2014's Super Bowl outdoors in February in the New York/New Jersey region: ""I think it's stupid. If you want a Super Bowl, put a retractable dome on your stadium. Then you can get one."" Flacco took flak for that. He also had to issue an apology for describing an outdoor Super Bowl on the East Coast as ""retarded,"" but the opinion he was tossing out was right on the money. What a shame to risk ruining the biggest game of the year. No other major U.S. sport -- not baseball, basketball or hockey -- holds its championship fight at a neutral site. Those sports are forced take whatever comes -- if it's rainy in St. Louis or frigid in Detroit or wherever, hey, tough luck. That's the way the World Series ball bounces. Football, however, has the ability to work around this. It chooses its site. It isn't like basketball or hockey, where the team with the best record gets the home-stadium advantage. The NFL selects its Super Bowl sites several years in advance. Well, it selected New York/New Jersey for this one and good luck with that, guys. When this game is over, instead of Gatorade, douse the winning coach with a cooler of hot chicken soup. Peculiar how it's Peyton Manning who must quarterback his team (the Denver Broncos) in what could be some truly unpleasant Super Bowl weather. February 4, 2007: For the first time, Manning took his team (then the Indianapolis Colts) to a Super Bowl game, where everyone would get to see what a skillful, pinpoint passer he was. Oh, and the opponents, the Chicago Bears, had a high-flying offense of their own, scoring the second-most points of any NFL team that season. What a game this would be! There in tropical Miami -- where it rained and rained and rained. The game was a joke. It had eight turnovers. The wet ball squirted out of players' hands. Guys slipped as if on banana peels. A great kicker missed an easy field goal. A holder fumbled the snap on an extra point. During one slapstick sequence, a Bear fumbled the kickoff, then a Colt fumbled on the next play. Miami has been host to many a Super Bowl. It is generally warm there in January and a good time is had by all. But that Super Bowl of 2007 wasn't a game -- it was a monsoon. It put its players, coaches, referees and, worst of all, its paying spectators through four hours of misery and mess. At halftime, even the singer Prince had to sing ""Purple Rain"" in the rain. With a $1,200 face value on a ticket now, is this what the NFL wants its fans to endure in years to come? The possibility of going to a championship game and coming home with the flu? Or the possibility of a final score of Seattle 3, Denver 0 in a blizzard? Super Bowl L -- that's 50, for all you Roman numeral haters -- is booked for 2016 for a field that isn't even operational yet: Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the future home of the San Francisco 49ers. It will undoubtedly be a beautiful place. But it won't have a roof. California is having a drought, and it's not exactly an Amazon rain forest up there. But if that Super Bowl L game ends up being played in a torrential downpour, don't say we didn't warn you. At this time, NFL teams that have a stadium with a roof are the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, New Orleans Saints and St. Louis Rams (domed) and the Arizona Cardinals, Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts (retractable). Arizona will host the 2015 game, Houston the one in 2017. Beyond that, we shall see. A lot of serious thought should be given to making sure that every Super Bowl is played in optimal conditions, so that the players themselves decide the outcome, not the cold, rain or snow. South Florida and Northern California and other nice places want the game -- of course they do. Who wouldn't? But they cannot make a promise on Mother Nature's behalf. They can merely cross their fingers and hope. As for the New York and New Jersey area being host to a game like this in February, wow, whose stupid idea was THIS? New York and New Jersey have some of the smartest, most loyal football fans in the world. Let them watch Jets and Giants games in their stadium week after week in all kinds of weather and all kinds of clothes. Then tell them to please be sure to watch the Super Bowl every year -- on TV.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama should use the breathing space provided by the fiscal-cliff compromise to address some of the issues that he shelved during his last term. One of the most urgent is child farm labor. Perhaps the least protected, underpaid work force in American labor, children are often the go-to workers for farms looking to cut costs. It's easy to see why. The Department of Labor permits farms to pay employees under 20 as little as $4.25 per hour. (By comparison, the federal minimum wage is $7.25.) And unlike their counterparts in retail and service, child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night. The numbers are hard to estimate, but between direct hiring, hiring through labor contractors, and off-the-books work beside parents or for cash, perhaps 400,000 children, some as young as 6, weed and harvest for commercial farms. A Human Rights Watch 2010 study shows that children laboring for hire on farms routinely work more than 10 hours per day. As if this were not bad enough, few labor safety regulations apply. Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school. Children 12 and older can too, as long as their parents agree. Unlike teen retail and service workers, agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours. In addition, Human Rights Watch reports that child farm laborers are exposed to dangerous pesticides; have inadequate access to water and bathrooms; fall ill from heat stroke; suffer sexual harassment; experience repetitive-motion injuries; rarely receive protective equipment like gloves and boots; and usually earn less than the minimum wage. Sometimes they earn nothing. Little is being done to guarantee their safety. In 2011 Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16, but Obama scrapped them just eight months later. Adoption of the new rules would be no guarantee of enforcement, however. According to the 2010 Human Rights Watch report, the Department of Labor employees were spread so thin that, despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide. This lack of oversight has dire, sometimes fatal, consequences. Last July, for instance, 15-year-old Curvin Kropf, an employee at a small family farm near Deer Grove, Illinois, died when he fell off the piece of heavy farm equipment he was operating, and it crushed him. According to the Bureau County Republican, he was the fifth child in fewer than two years to die at work on Sauk Valley farms. If this year follows trends, Curvin will be only one of at least 100 children below the age of 18 killed on American farms, not to mention the 23,000 who will be injured badly enough to require hospital admission. According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention statistics, agriculture is one of the most dangerous industries. It is the most dangerous for children, accounting for about half of child worker deaths annually. The United States has a long tradition of training children in the craft of farming on family farms. At least 500,000 children help to work their families' farms today. Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules. Although children working on their parents' farms would specifically have been exempted from them, it was partly in response to worries about government interference in families and loss of opportunities for children to learn agricultural skills that the Obama administration shelved them. Whatever you think of family farms, however, many child agricultural workers don't work for their parents or acquaintances. Despite exposure to all the hazards, these children never learn the craft of farming, nor do most of them have the legal right to the minimum wage. And until the economy stabilizes, the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work. We have a responsibility for their safety. As one of the first acts of his new term, Obama should reopen the child agricultural labor proposal he shelved in spring of 2012. Surely, farm labor standards for children can be strengthened without killing off 4-H or Future Farmers of America. Second, the Department of Labor must institute age, wage, hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules. Children in agriculture should not be exposed to more risks, longer hours, and lower wages at younger ages than children in other jobs. Finally, the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations. Unenforced rules won't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms. Agriculture is a great American tradition. Let's make sure it's not one our children have to die for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cristina Traina.","Cristina Traina: Obama should strengthen child farm labor standards .

"Singapore (CNN) -- In 2003, the SARS virus epidemic was a wake-up call for Asia, forcing China to increase transparency, fostering closer regional cooperation and bringing human security issues to the fore. The disappearance of MH370 will have a similar transformative effect on regional security, but it will take a different form. In recent years, the focus -- driven by the need to protect the waters of approximately a third of the world's trade, as well as access to energy and resources -- has been on sea lanes, concentrating on reducing piracy and enhancing naval cooperation. The United States, India, Japan and China have all ratcheted up their patrols, buttressed by the smaller naval operations of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. READ MORE: We owe it to the families to solve riddle, says Australian PM . But at times the focus on maritime security in Asia has led to tensions. China has resented the encroachment of other powers into waters it views as its own, while spats have intensified between China and its regional neighbors, particularly over islands in the South China Sea. China's increasingly assertive position has engendered a wariness among countries in the region that has been an undercurrent in the cooperation between neighbors during the current MH370 crisis. Sky security . Post MH370, attention will increasingly turn to the skies. The disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines jet has revealed shortcomings in monitoring air space. That no one even knew the plane had veered off course for seven hours raises serious questions -- even allowing for the fact the jetliner's tracking mechanisms effectively turned off. The contradictions and slow trickle of information from the Malaysian authorities and regional neighbors has highlighted how disjointed, uneven and vulnerable the monitoring of airspace across borders is. Satellite intelligence has increased yet no coordination or mechanism for effective information sharing exists. Many nations are not willing to reveal the technology at their disposal, as seems evident in the delays in sharing data, while some -- particularly in Southeast Asia -- have to turn to others to access satellite technology. Despite the involvement of over 20 countries in the search, trust and capacity is seemingly lacking. The search for MH370 will lead to a rethink of the existing regional architecture, with the need for stronger multilateral ties to secure safer air travel. One option on the table needs to be a credible investigative body to manage air security across the region. Another important step clearly has to involve improved measures to secure transponders for communication. READ MORE: What is a transponder? MH370 has also brought the issue of good governance to center stage. Malaysia's response has raised serious concerns about accountability, transparency and competence. From the get go, the Malaysian authorities were on the back foot, given that more than half of the country's population voted against the current government in a 2013 election marred by allegations of fraud. The government's alleged persecution of political opponents has fostered deep alienation. Hours before he was due to contest in a by-election, a Malaysian court overturned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's acquittal of the charge that he sodomized a former political aide. The de facto leader of the People's Justice Party has repeatedly said he is innocent, calling the case against him an attempt by the government to end his political career -- an assertion it has consistently denied. Days after the plane's disappearance, Anwar's lawyer, Karpal Singh, was charged with sedition in another case viewed by some as politically motivated. Even against this backdrop, many were willing to give the government a chance. But it fell short by failing to learn lessons from the SARS virus: countries need to share information in a timely manner and earn credibility, rather than expect it. Sadly, the international media effectively set the tone for the search for the plane, not the Malaysians. The mystery of what happened to MH370 shows that without the basic practices of good governance, lives can be lost and security put in jeopardy. The MH370 crisis has also revealed that in spite of the rise of China, the U.S. and its allies still have an important security role to play in Asia. When push came to shove, Malaysia's Najib government turned to its Western partners for their investigative skills and search and rescue guidance. China-U.S. tensions . Yet Beijing was been increasingly irked by the rate of progress. With more than 150 of its own citizens on board the Boeing 777-200, China has been frustrated by the delays in information and its inability to effectively protect its own nationals. This frustration recently boiled over into criticism of Malaysia's handling of the investigation. Whatever the outcome the MH370 mystery, China will take steps to enhance efforts to monitor and secure airspace in the region. This in turn will generate greater wariness among its neighbors and possibly bring it into more frequent contact with Western powers -- especially the United States. Unless checked, China-U.S. competition in Asia will deepen with pressure on both to increase their involvement in security in Asia. An important constraint on this great power struggle will be a strong multilateral Asia-led initiative to enhance aviation security -- one that includes the United States but brings in all the key Asian stakeholders. We do not yet know what happened. We may never know. We do know however that security in Asia will never be the same. Now more than ever the burden is on Asia as a whole to better take care of itself, to come together to assure that its citizens and visitors get the protection and security they need. From stronger multilateral ties to good governance, the case of MH370 can bring about the opportunity for a safer region. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bridget Welsh.","Post MH370, attention will increasingly turn to the skies in terms of security, says Welsh .

"(CNN) -- From buying expensive caskets and tailoring new clothes to slaughtering animals and organizing a massive feast, little expense is spared in South Africa's elaborate funeral celebrations. Here, as in other communities across Africa, the financial and social resources invested in funerals are matched by no other rite of passage. ""In the west, marriages are often the biggest life-cycle events. In Africa, it's funerals by far,"" said professor Michael Jindra, co-editor of ""Funerals in Africa: Explorations of a Social Phenomenon."" Jindra explains that such large events, designed to pay respect to the dead and honor one's roots, also provide a kind of ""social glue"" for communities in many African societies: They are at the heart of social and cultural life, with status concerns, succession issues and family bonds also at stake. Yet, honoring those who've passed away can also exact a huge financial toll on the already emotionally vulnerable relatives. In South Africa, bereaved families often have to spend significant amounts to host lavish funerals and burial ceremonies. They are expected to host and feed extended relatives who visit from all over the country and can stay for weeks. Other costs include slaughtering a cow or a goat to honor the dead, renting hearse tents and arranging transportation to the burial ground for mourners. ""In many areas, a lot of people spend a lot of money on funerals. Sometimes, it's out of choice for reasons of status, but other times, it's simply out of the social pressure, and it is certainly putting burdens on people when they don't have a lot of money,"" said Jindra. A 2009 report by economists Anne Case and Alicia Menendez found that the average price tag for an ""honorable"" funeral in South Africa between 2003 and 2005 was about 3,400 rand ($415), which is equivalent to 40% of the average annual household expenditure. The report said that funeral expenses leave surviving family members vulnerable to future hardship, with spending on items such as food and clothes significantly lower following the funeral. Children in households that experienced a death are also less likely to be enrolled in school, while adults are much more likely to report problems such as symptoms of depression and periods of anxiety. ""The costs of food are enormous. The coffins are extremely expensive,"" said Case. ""A family might spend as much money on a coffin as they will spend on their children's school fees for all of the period that their children are at school."" In Ghana, where funerals are often boisterous events of great size and importance, families tend to channel vast amount of resources and time in the memorials. One example is ordering custom-built coffins in just about any design shape that either are symbolic or reflect the deceased's profession. Ghana's incredible coffins: Fish, bananas and buses . In Kenya, a 2004 study published in the Journal of Human Development found that 63% of households that declined into poverty in rural areas cited heavy funeral costs as a reason. In Cameroon, Jindra says, people at times would opt for saving money for a funeral instead of contributing for medical costs while a person is still alive. ""People know that these funerals can be so expensive that they'll actually save money for that and spend it on that rather than health expenses that could actually keep the person alive longer,"" he said. A financial instrument that has evolved in South Africa to help people prepare for funerals are savings clubs or accounts that pay out only upon death. Individuals usually belong to a burial society or pay weekly or monthly installments for insurance that guarantees that some expenses incurred for their funerals will be paid for by the insurer. However, most times, the funds from these plans are not enough, forcing families to turn elsewhere for assistance. ""The households are really left scrambling,"" said Daryl Collins, co-author of ""Portfolios of the Poor: How the World's Poor Live on $2 a Day"" and director at Bankable Frontier Associates. ""The lion's share is paid for by the relatives, but what's hidden underneath that is that, oftentimes, what comes from the relatives is not quite enough, so there's quite a bit of borrowing from either friends or money lenders,"" she added. As a result, nearly a quarter of households have no choice but to borrow money, according to Case and Menendez's study, with money lenders charging exorbitant monthly interest rates of 30% or more. Reuben Naran, who built the Kings and Queens funeral parlor in Johannesburg to help fellow Zimbabweans bury their dead back home, says that funerals are creating a big financial burden for poor households. ""It costs you, you go and borrow money, you have to pay back to repay the money after the funeral, so it means your life will be affected most probably for the whole year for a single death,"" said Naran. Inside his parlor, a relative of a deceased man agrees: ""It is expensive because we have to donate. Each and every member of the family has to donate so that we can manage to take him home.""","Funerals in South Africa create a big financial burden for poor families .

"(CNN) -- The Deep South will be plunged into a deep freeze again this week, this time with ice and snow expected to fall all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters issued a winter storm warning for New Orleans and its suburbs Monday afternoon, warning that the city could see half an inch of snow and ice by Tuesday evening. Parishes further north could see three inches, with temperatures plunging into the single digits on Wednesday, the National Weather Service reported. A wave of arctic air that settled over the Midwest and the Plains is expected to spread into the Southeast late Monday, bringing a chance of snow to several major Southern cities by Tuesday. In New Orleans, where measurable snow has fallen only 17 times in records that date back to the 1880s, French Quarter restaurants made plans to shut down and tourists worried about being stranded at the city's airport. ""This town is shutting down tomorrow,"" cab driver August Delaney told CNN. ""Some bridges are going to shut down. Schools are closed. We are not going to put our kids on school buses."" Mayor Mitch Landrieu declared a state of emergency and warned residents to remember what happened when temperatures dipped toward the freezing mark less than a week ago. ""We had bridges that were frozen over, as you might remember,"" Landrieu said. ""We had accidents on those bridges, a fairly large pile-up on the Green Bridge. Sometime not long ago, when they had a similar event, there were a thousand crashes, and there were fatalities -- and we want to make sure that we avoid all of that."" While the Big Easy prepared for the Big Icy, authorities in neighboring Mississippi warned that the entire state would see temperatures below freezing between Tuesday morning and around lunchtime Thursday. State officials told reporters that up to four inches of snow could fall in the south-central part of the state, and the Gulf Coast could see three-quarters of an inch. Robert Latham, the state's emergency management director, warned residents to expect power outages as well. ""We're looking at a part of the state that has a large number of pine trees,"" Latham said. ""I can tell you that as ice accumulates on pine trees, limbs will break. Trees will fall. Power will be out."" The chill will be a marked contrast to the warm temperatures that prevailed across the region on Monday, when temperatures were largely in the 50s and 60s. In Wilmington, North Carolina, on the Atlantic coast, people were still dining outdoors on Monday night even as public schools announced closures on Tuesday and Wednesday. Atlanta will see the mercury drop into the low 20s overnight, with a 30 to 40% chance of snow Tuesday. In Montgomery, Alabama, there's a 40% chance of snow. Further north, Washington probably won't see snow, but its residents will feel the cold. Temps will drop to 7 degrees Monday night, with the wind chill telling you it's colder -- as in 8 degrees below zero. Tuesday will warm up only a little. ""Welcome to my world,"" the Midwest and Great Plains will say. Much of the northern Plains, Midwest and Northeast will likely shiver through daytime high temperatures 10 to 30 degrees below normal through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Chicago saw a high temperature of 4 below zero Fahrenheit on Monday and is looking at a comparatively balmy 3 above on Tuesday -- though with wind chill values of around minus-30 degrees. In Wisconsin, the state department of transportation urged people to avoid driving if possible. If they must drive, they should carry a fully charged cell phone, have at least half a tank of gasoline and tell somebody where they're going. In Milwaukee, two motorists seconded that advice. ""It's going to be pure ice. It's all fluffy and light snow like this and it's going to melt down â€” going to be a mess,"" Gary Lukowitz told CNN affiliate WITI. ""Even though you see the streets are plowed and it's still slippery out there â€” still a lot of wet snow on the ground, still freezing and cars are still slipping around,"" Adam Bernstein said. And authorities in Minnesota are advising no travel in the southern and western parts of the state, where several roads are closed. In South Dakota, officials said white-out conditions with zero to near zero visibility, icy roads and blowing and drifting snow are making safe travel almost impossible along the I-29 corridor and throughout most of the northeast and eastern part of the state. They have closed Interstate 29 from the I-90 junction at Sioux Falls to Brookings because of blizzard conditions. I-29 was also closed from the South Dakota border to Canada in North Dakota. Whiteout conditions could also be found in Hazleton, Iowa, said CNN iReporter Danny Murphy. He shot a video of the very white weather. ""Rural areas around here are suffering from near whiteout and blizzard conditions causing for very hazardous travel,"" he said. CNN's Chad Myers, Sean Morris, Dave Hennen, Martin Savidge and Jareen Imam contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This town is shutting down tomorrow,"" New Orleans cab driver says .

"(CNN) -- A fire raced through a motel on the New Jersey shore early Friday, killing four people and injuring at least 8 others, authorities said. While authorities said earlier they were trying to determine the whereabouts of about 10 others, all remaining occupants were accounted for by Friday afternoon, fire officials said. Volunteer firefighters found the second floor of the Mariner's Cove Motor Inn in Point Pleasant Beach engulfed in flames shortly after they were called at 5:33 a.m., borough fire chief A.J. Fox said. About 40 people were staying at the motel, and the cause of the blaze wasn't immediately clear, prosecutor Joseph Coronato said. Most of the people who escaped had left the building by the time firefighters arrived, but the firefighters rescued one woman who'd sought refuge in a shower under running water, Fox said. ""One of our firefighters noticed her in a window,"" Fox said. Rescuers broke the window, sprayed water on flames overhead, grabbed the woman and brought her out through the window frame, he said. ""She saved her own life, being in the shower (with the) water running,"" Fox said. The woman was believed to be one of the injured taken to a hospital; her condition wasn't known, Coronato said. The names of the dead and the injured weren't immediately released. Coronato's office initially said three of the injured were critically hurt, but the prosecutor didn't provide any information on conditions at a news conference later Friday morning. They suffered injuries such as burns and smoke inhalation. One sheriff's officer had broken bones, Coronato said without elaborating. The fire was under control by 7:04 a.m., Coronato said. Authorities sifted through debris after the building was deemed safe to enter, Coronato's spokesman, Al Della Fave, said. Firefighters searched the partially collapsed structure for survivors, CNN affiliate WABC reported. Coronato said a task force including members of his office and police arson investigators will look into the fire's cause.","NEW: Death toll from fire is now at four, officials say .

"(CNN) -- As it continued its northward retreat, the arctic blast still held sway over the upper Midwest, where it bore down with below-zero lows early Thursday. This should be its last stand in the United States, as temperatures bump up day by day, the National Weather Service said. Minnesota's coldest spots were forecast to plunge to as low as minus-30 degrees Fahrenheit with a frost-biting wind chill factor near 40 below. Most of the nation should drop below freezing overnight, according to the NWS. Pipe bombs . The polar vortex left behind ticking time bombs of sorts, and as it gives way to warmer weather, they are going off. Pipes that froze and cracked are unfreezing, and plumbers and fire crews are rushing to stop the gushing water leaks, CNN affiliates are reporting. The spurts caused some serious damage to homes and businesses and flooded streets. Leaking pipes that broke during the freeze closed down a 30-story office building in Kansas City, Missouri, after its basement flooded, taking down central electrical circuits, KMBC reported. More than 50 apartments were damaged when pipes broke in a building in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Phones rang hot at plumbing companies from Memphis to Decatur, Alabama. ""Good for business. Bad for sleep,"" Decatur plumber Chris Byrd told WAAY. ""It's about a once-every-10-year event we get something like this."" It's so cold, humor edition . Slippery slopes . The changing weather is laying down thin ice patches from western Tennessee to eastern Kansas and Oklahoma, the weather service warns. As warmer air moves in, it is bringing rain, drizzle and fog, which are bumping up against temperatures still below freezing. The result is what the NWS calls a ""wintry mix"" -- everything from freezing fog to snow. It will ice over streets, but slicken bridges and overpasses in particular and possibly tear down some power lines, the weather service said. It's another nasty leftover from the polar vortex, which authorities have blamed for as many as 23 deaths across six states.","The upper Midwest still sees lows around minus-20 .

"(CNN) -- If you go down to the ""Woods"" today, you're sure of a big surprise -- and if anyone tries to spoil it, my advice would be to shut them up quick. Believe me, you don't want to know. But this is a movie people are going to need to talk about, so if you're at all invested in horror movies -- what they are, what they're for, what they can be -- you best see this one quick, and steer clear of Tumblr until you have. What can I tell you without saying too much? For starters, you have to know that this is the first feature directed by Drew Goddard, a writer from the ""Buffy,"" ""Angel,"" ""Lost"" school, based on a screenplay he co-wrote with the considerably famous ""Buffy"", ""Firefly"", ""Angel"" creator Joss Whedon. Fans of those shows won't be disappointed by these horror hipsters' acidic, postmodern designs on one of the movie industry's hoariest, least respected staples. Whedon also wrote ""Toy Story"" of course -- which may be why the wild, nutso finale seems to owe a debt to another Pixar movie ... but let's not go there. The outline is as crude as the title suggests: Hollywood has been telling us to be afraid of the backwoods at least since ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and ""Deliverance"" (before that, it was the old dark manse on the hill). By now the homespun log cabin is more likely to evoke the evil undead than Honest Abe. But just as the clever poster image puts its own twist on the familiar picture, transforming the house into a kind of spinning Rubik's Cube, Goddard's movie quickly puts its own distinctive kink on horror clichÃ©s. By quickly, I mean from the very first scene, which wittily undercuts the portentous opening music and sets up the movie's first puzzle: how do the casually smug, cynical lab-coated technicians played by Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins relate to the five bright, sexy college kids we see taking off for a cousin's countryside retreat? You could probably figure it out: there are only so many permutations available after all. But then again, you would probably be wrong. ""The Cabin in the Woods"" doesn't just keep us on our toes, it chops them off at the knee with a rusty scythe. How spoiler culture (mostly) spared 'The Cabin in the Woods' Goddard winks at horror's soiled conventions, but doesn't denigrate his characters by resorting to camp (well, except perhaps in the scary fundamentalist redneck the kids encounter when they try to buy gas). One of the questions he wants to explore is how much free will we want to see in a human sacrifice. Or put it another way: If you give a puppet enough rope, will he hang himself? Thus, Kristen Connolly's sympathetic Dana -- not quite a virgin, but clearly the designated ""good girl"" -- is something more than just the sum of her body parts (even if she is upstaged by a dismembered arm in one scene), and Fran Kranz's witty pot-head conspiracy theorist is such an engaging personality the movie risks deflating without him. Yes, they're archetypes, but they're not stereotypes -- the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you'd expect. Maybe -- if we're being picky -- this is all too self-consciously clever to be truly scary on the visceral, soul-gnawing level of the most unforgettable horror films. But there's no question that this is one of the most entertaining and invigorating shockers in recent years. It's also one of the best movies of 2012 so far, in any genre.","""Cabin in the Woods'"" is directed by Drew Goddard and co-written by Joss Whedon .

The woe is over, too, for Arjen Robben, who scored the winner in the 89th minute and set up Mario Mandzukic's opener in the 60th. Ilkay Gundogan's penalty in the 68th had pulled Dortmund level prior to Robben's nifty decider. Robben was labeled a villain by Bayern fans last year, when he missed a penalty and other opportunities in the final against Chelsea. ""I do not know how many times I dreamed about it but I said to many people that tonight was going to be our night,"" Robben told Sky Sports. No wonder he was celebrating wildly at the final whistle. Indeed the euphoria among Bayern players at Wembley was fully understandable, since this was a team that had lost three of its four previous finals, two in agonizing fashion. It began in 1999. Minutes away from beating Manchester United, two injury-time goals from the Red Devils deprived Munich and led to one of the most lasting images in Champions League history -- defender Samuel Kuffour overflowing in tears and pounding the turf at Barcelona's Nou Camp in frustration. Kuffour would later say it was destiny for United. The same, perhaps, could have been uttered when Chelsea inflicted more heartache in 2012 in Bayern Munich's own stadium. With Bayern firmly in control of the game at 1-0, this time a late effort from Chelsea striker Didier Drogba tied proceedings and prompted extra time -- when Robben didn't captalize from the spot -- and then penalties. Paying the price for missed opportunities -- Robben and striker Mario Gomez were particularly guilty -- Chelsea prevailed to give the Blues their first trophy in football's most prestigious club competition. Another English team had gotten the better of Bayern Munich. The heart of Bayern's midfield, Bastian Schweinsteiger, was on that occasion inconsolable, mirroring Kuffour. ""We knew after last season what we needed to do and we have improved,"" Robben said. There was a sense of destiny about Dortmund, since Jurgen Klopp's men scored two injury-time goals in the second leg of the quarterfinals against Malaga to advance. But when Borussia Dortmund couldn't convert its superiority in the first half into goals, Bayern Munich slowly got into the game. Bayern, which won the Bundesliga title by 25 points over Dortmund and crushed Barcelona in the semifinals of the Champions League, now has the chance to emulate the United team of 1999 and achieve the treble. Jupp Heynckes' men will be the heavy favorite in the German Cup final on June 1 against VfB Stuttgart. If not for a tax scandal involving Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness, who was at Wembley, the season could almost be classified as perfect. Some would ask: ""Who needs Pep Guardiola?"" But his arrival next season, replacing Heynckes, potentially heralds an exciting period. He can take advantage of a highly skilled side in implementing his possession based style. Mario Gotze will add to Munich's impressive squad, making the move from Dortmund in the off-season. An awkward scenario in the final was avoided since midfielder Gotze, described as a ""once in a century player"" by German legend Matthias Sammer, missed out due to injury. Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski, whose four goals in the semifinals against Real Madrid bolstered his reputation further, is being linked with a move to Bayern. In short, the future could bring even more trophies. What must Dortmund -- thought of by some as a team of destiny after its injury-time comeback in the quarterfinals against Malaga -- be thinking? It was Dortmund, which nearly went bankrupt in 2005, who made the much brighter start, even though Klopp appeared anxious as he took his spot on the bench. While Dortmund's fans clad in team colors of yellow and black sang in the stands, the usual smile on his face wasn't to be found. Polish international Jakub Blaszczykowski's shot from outside the box might have sailed harmlessly over the bar in the 10th minute, but it signaled the start of an impressive spell. Lewandowski, much sought after, made a fine run inside the box before he ran out of room and was unable to deliver a cross. A minute later, Lewandowski's curled effort from distance was comfortably pushed over the bar by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer. Neuer, the German No. 1, would be busy in the next 10 minutes, stopping Blaszczykowski with his legs from close range -- his best save of the evening -- keeping out Marco Reus' left-footed strike and thwarting Sven Bender. Neuer was unusually busy, since he averaged a mere two saves per game all season. Such was Bayern's frustration that winger Franck Ribery used an arm to cast aside Lewandowski. Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness, an analyst for British television, said Ribery deserved a red card. Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli, however, didn't even show him a yellow. Rizzoli would be in the spotlight later. Bayern finally worked its way into the game midway in the half. Ribery found himself in space on the left and put in an inviting cross for striker Mandzukic -- who started ahead of German international Gomez. His header was tipped over the bar by Roman Weidenfeller. On the ensuing corner, midfielder Javi Martinez leapt the highest, though his header didn't hit the target. Now Weidenfeller was busy. He made himself big to deny Robben and near the end of the half, defender Mats Hummels misjudged a ball in the air to hand the alert Robben a second chance. Weidenfeller utilized his face to keep the match scoreless at the interval. Dortmund didn't start as well in the second half, yet wasn't put under any pressure by Bayern. That changed in the 59th minute, when Mandzukic's header fell straight to Weidenfeller. The shot was tame, but Dortmund's frailty in the air was again exposed. Bayern took the lead a minute later, as Robben finally dealt with Weidenfeller. When Weidenfeller charged off his line, Robben went around the German and sent a low cross to Mandzukic, who had the simplest of tap ins. Bayern was on its way. Or was it? Needing to stay tight at the back for the next 10 minutes, Bayern defender Dante gave Dortmund a lifeline. He completely missed his clearance in the box and kicked Reus in the stomach. Rizzoli awarded Dortmund the penalty, but Dante -- already booked -- didn't receive a second yellow. Stopped three weeks ago by Neuer on a penalty, Lewandowski gave way to IIkay Gundogan. The diminutive midfielder sent Neuer the wrong way in the 68th. Bayern fans must have thought it was dÃ©jÃ  vu, especially when Dortmund defender Neven Subotic made a last-ditch clearance with Robben about to pounce from a yard out. Both teams continued to press forward, and Weidenfeller dived to his left to stop David Alaba. Rizzoli waived play on when Thomas Muller felt he was impeded by Subotic, the last man, but Bayern's angst didn't last long. With Dortmund's defense unable to clear, Robben waltzed into the box and deftly wrong-footed Weidenfeller. It was redemption for Robben and Bayern.","Arjen Robben's late goal gives Bayern Munich the Champions League title .

"Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) -- France's new Socialist government is already causing ripples throughout a Europe struggling to balance government budgets without making ordinary people's lives miserable, but it has created a completely different problem in the Middle East. The prime minister's last name, it turns out, sounds like an Arabic slang word for penis. His name is Jean-Marc Ayrault. Pronounced properly in French, the last name is very much like a moderately rude Lebanese and Palestinian term that is widely understood in the Arabic world. The name has left broadcasters trying to determine if they should pronounce it as the prime minister does -- ""ai-roh"" -- or if they should resort to voicing the ""L"" and ""T"" in the written word. An editor at the pan-Arabic network Al-Arabiya said the network would pronounce the name in the French way. ""We cannot change names, so we have to deal with it and live with it. We have to be professional,"" said the editor, who asked not to be named because of the subject matter. Al-Arabiya is writing the name in Arabic in a way that makes clear it is not the offensive word. CNNArabic decided to pronounce Ayrault's name by voicing the last two letters in the written word. The French Foreign Ministry said it was aware of the issue but had no comment. The office of the French president, sounding amused, referred CNN questions to the prime minister's office, which had no comment. The story echoes reports that two years ago, Pakistan wanted to appoint an ambassador to Saudi Arabia whose name sounds like an even more offensive word for penis in Arabic. But Pakistani diplomat Akbar Zeb denied the story, telling the Globe and Mail in Canada, where he is posted, that there had never been a plan to send him to Riyadh. CNN's Rachel Ramsay contributed to this report.","Jean-Marc Ayrault's last name sounds like a rude word in Arabic slang .

"(CNN) -- A superpower needs a super attention span. Unfortunately, Americans seem to take little interest in the troubles of the world around them, even when those troubles threaten soon to vex Americans themselves. Americans fought two world wars -- and faced nuclear annihilation in a protracted Cold War -- to defend the freedom of Europe. In the thrilling days of 1989-91, four generations of American sacrifice were magnificently vindicated. The communist regimes of central Europe collapsed. The Soviet Union itself broke apart into smaller and less threatening pieces. For four centuries, the rulers of Russia had sought security for themselves by dominating first their own people, then their neighbors, then their neighbors' neighbors, then their neighbors' neighbors' neighbors ... until their power extended from Berlin to the Pacific Ocean. Then, abruptly, that imperial project broke apart. Subject nations regained their freedom. The Russians themselves gained a new opportunity -- perhaps the first in their national existence -- to choose a government that served its people. Ukraine protesters block government offices, call for strike . The former rulers, unfortunately, had other ideas. Democracy did not take root in Russia after 1991. How and why it failed is a long story, with many villains, but let's cut to the end result: A former top officer of the KGB maneuvered his way into the Russian presidency in 1999-2000. Vladimir Putin restored to power the old secret police apparatus. Since then, Putin and his coterie have attempted to reconstitute as much of the old Soviet Union as they could, while plundering Russia's wealth for themselves. One step to that reconstitution of the Soviet Union was absolutely indispensable: Reasserting Moscow's power over Ukraine. No nation suffered more from Soviet communism than the Ukrainians. Ukrainian farmers lost their lands and homes to Soviet collectivization in the 1920s; millions died in the man-made famine that followed in the 1930s. Their language and culture were stunted under Moscow rule; their intellectuals and writers were suppressed, banished, murdered, and defamed. In 1991, Ukrainians seized their chance to build a country of their own. Ukrainian independence liberated not only the Ukrainian people, but all Europe. Russia without the nearly 46 million people and vast natural resources of the Ukraine is a large and powerful country, but it is no superpower. Since Putin's entry into power, Russia minus Ukraine has sought to influence and corrupt the democracies of Europe. A Russia that reintegrated Ukraine would possess the power -- like the Soviet Union of old -- to intimidate and bully democratic Europe. Russia minus Ukraine can aspire to become a normal nation state, a democracy, even a liberal democracy. A Russia that holds Ukraine by force must forever be a militarized authoritarian regime, a menace to its own people as much as to the rest of the European continent and the democratic world. Upholding Ukrainian independence is thus a deep concern, not only to the Ukrainians, but to all the free countries of Europe -- and thus to the United States, free-Europe's security and trading partner. Vladimir Putin understands all this too, and he doesn't like any of it. Since he came to power, he's worked to undermine and subvert Ukrainian independence. He has been successful. Ukraine imports its oil and natural gas from Russia, and Putin has used energy dependency to sway Ukrainian politics and bribe Ukraine's dauntingly corrupt leaders. But every once in a while, Putin goes too far. He went too far in 2004, collaborating with Ukrainian former communists to rig a presidential election. Blatant fraud inspired Ukraine's famous ""Orange Revolution"" -- and a temporary swing in Ukraine's political orientation to the West. Now Putin is trying again -- and again he is meeting massive resistance in the Ukrainian streets. Over the past years, the European Union negotiated a trade pact with Ukraine. The pact would enrich ordinary Ukrainians, today the third poorest people in Europe, after the Kosovars and Moldovans. The pact would lessen Ukraine's economic dependence on Russia -- and prepare the way for Ukraine's own eventual membership in the EU. Under extreme Russian pressure, the Ukrainian president -- the very same man whose election fraud triggered the Orange Revolution nine years ago -- has repudiated his own treaty, and his country's best hopes. Tens of thousands of protesters have filled the streets and squares of the capital, Kiev, two weekends in a row. Police have suppressed the protests brutally, injuring many people. The regime's controlled courts have banned any further public demonstrations until January. German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed disappointment in muted tones after a November 28 summit with the Ukrainian leadership: ""Unfortunately not all expectations have been fulfilled. We will make very clear here that the EU is ready to accept Ukraine as an associate member, to sign the association treaty. Then we will see. We have no hope that it will happen this time, but the door is open."" Don't be fooled by the muted words, however. What's at stake in the streets of Kiev is the future of the European continent -- and American prosperity and security. An inward-looking America is averting its attention from its own most important interests and highest ideals. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Democracy failed in Russia and a top officer of KGB, Vladimir Putin, became president .
Frum: Putin and his coterie want to resurrect Soviet Union and want to keep Ukraine in thrall .

"(CNN) -- Between the bad commercials, Beyonce's halftime gig, the Harbaugh brothers and the action on the field, the jokesters of Twitter had plenty to snicker about during Sunday's Super Bowl. But then the lights went out in the Superdome, and Twitter really heated up. The year's most-watched sporting event, interrupted by a 35-minute delay in the third quarter, may forever be known as the #Blackout Bowl. The bizarre interlude seemed to energize the San Francisco 49ers and the Twitterverse, which until then had been complaining about the one-sided game. Twitter said its volume of chatter spiked during the blackout, reaching 231,500 tweets per minute.

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is set to announce as soon as Wednesday a billion-dollar agreement with Toyota to settle a federal probe of the automaker's handling of customer complaints related to unintended acceleration, people familiar with the deal said. The investigation led by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has examined allegations that the Japanese automotive giant initially misled federal authorities after the complaints became a source of controversy in 2009. Under the settlement, Toyota is expected to avoid criminal charges and is expected to pay about $1 billion, those familiar with the agreement said. ""Toyota has cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in this matter for more than four years,"" a Toyota spokeswoman said. ""During that time, we have made fundamental changes to become a more responsive and customer-focused organization, and we are committed to continued improvements."" The Justice Department didn't comment on the planned announcement. Toyota recalled millions of cars in 2009-10, after years of doing little beyond changing floor mats in response to complaints to federal auto safety regulators about acceleration problems in popular models. Regulators were also criticized for their handling of the matter in the years leading up to the massive recalls. Top company executives came under fire in two congressional hearings during that time in which lawmakers accused Toyota of not doing enough to respond to safety concerns. Stiff safety fines were imposed by the Transportation Department. Toyota has settled similar allegations in agreements with a group of states, and has also paid settlements to some Toyota car owners. The Toyota agreement comes with Bharara's office just starting to look into a safety issue at General Motors. The FBI, which conducted the Toyota probe, is now gathering evidence on the GM complaints. GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month. Experts: Translated Toyota memo shows acceleration concern . CNN Money's Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","Japanese automaker and prosecutors in billion-dollar agreement .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama signed sweeping health care reform legislation into law Tuesday, hailing the moment as the latest example of America facing up to major challenges for the benefit of all its people. The bill constitutes the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees in more than four decades, and its enactment was a giant victory for Obama and Democrats after a brutal legislative battle dating back to the start of his presidency. No Republicans supported the bill in either the House or Senate, and Democratic leaders needed a separate bill that calls for changes in the new law in order to get enough support in the House to pass the measure. The Senate started debate on the accompanying House bill later Tuesday, with Republican opponents promising to use every possible parliamentary tool or technique to undermine it. Obama and Democratic leaders celebrated the new law at the White House signing ceremony, with a crowd packing the East Room repeatedly standing to applaud and cheer the president. ""It's been easy at times to doubt our ability to do such a big thing, such a complicated thing, to wonder if there are limits to what we as a people can still achieve,"" Obama said. ""We are not a nation that scales back its aspirations,"" he continued. ""We are not a nation that falls prey to doubt or mistrust. We don't fall prey to fear."" Rather, ""we are a nation that does what is hard, what is necessary, what is right,"" Obama said. In the end, he said, the bill delivered the ""core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care."" Among those on hand for the signing ceremony was Vicki Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who championed health care reform for decades before his death last year. Also present were several people who wrote Obama in the past year about their personal woes over losing or being unable to get health insurance. Obama had told their stories when campaigning for the health care bill in recent months. Among the private citizens attending Tuesday's ceremony were 11-year-old Marcelas Owens of Washington state and Ryan Smith, a small-business owner from California. And Obama said, ""I'm signing this reform bill into law on behalf of my mother, who argued with insurance companies even as she battled cancer in her final days."" Watch what Obama has to say about his mother and others . Democratic senators and representatives filled the crowd, and all stood to cheer and applaud after Obama used 22 pens to sign the bill. Republicans and social conservatives are vowing to try to repeal the law or have it declared unconstitutional. Attorneys general from 13 states filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the measure, claiming its mandate for people to purchase coverage and the costs it forces states to assume violate the Constitution. Twelve of the 13 attorneys general filing the lawsuit are Republican. A separate lawsuit filed by the Republican attorney general of Virginia makes a similar claim. Watch what Florida's attorney general has to say . Obama's comments at the signing ceremony and a later appearance before staff and supporters at the Department of the Interior focused on the immediate benefits of the new health care law. The president emphasized that this year, some 4 million small-business owners will be able to get tax credits to help cover the cost of providing health insurance to their employees, while insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage for children because of pre-existing medical conditions. Insurance companies also will no longer be allowed to drop people from coverage when they get sick, or to place lifetime or annual limits on the amount of health care people receive, Obama said. In addition, he warned senior citizens to ignore claims by Republicans that the new law will reduce Medicare benefits. Obama will hit the road to sell the measure to a still-skeptical public, giving a speech Thursday in Iowa City, Iowa, where he launched his grass-roots drive for health care reform in May 2007, according to White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. iReport: What will health care reform mean to you? Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a top domestic priority of his presidency. ""I haven't seen the president so happy about anything other than his family since I've known him,"" senior adviser David Axelrod told CNN on Monday, adding that Obama's jubilation when the bill passed exceeded his election victory in November 2008. ""He was excited that night, but not like last night."" Senior Republicans in Congress warned that voters will judge Democrats harshly in November's mid-term elections, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona saying the Democratic-passed bill killed any chance of bipartisan support on legislation for the rest of the year. ""There will be no cooperation for the rest of this year,"" McCain said in an interview Monday with KFYI radio in Arizona. ""They have poisoned the well in what they have done and how they have done it."" Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against the benefits of the health care bill. The overall $940 billion plan is projected to extend insurance coverage to roughly 32 million additional Americans. The compromise package would expand insurance subsidies for middle- and lower-income families, and scale back the bill's taxes on expensive insurance plans. iReport: Share your views on health care reform . Observers warn, however, that the road ahead for health care reform in the Senate may be rocky. Democratic leaders are using a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which will allow the compromise plan to clear the Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. But according to Senate rules, members are still allowed to offer unlimited amendments and challenges. In one of the first of many attempts Republicans say they will make to try to amend or kill the package, GOP aides went to Senate Parliamentarian Alan Frumin on Monday to argue that the compromise bill violates rules of the reconciliation process because of the way it affects Social Security. For that reason, GOP aides said they argued, the bill should not even be allowed to be debated. However, Frumin, according to a senior Republican and a Democratic aide, informed both parties he disagreed with the GOP assessment, and would not block the bill from reaching the Senate floor. House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate. So far, two of the 59 senators in the Democratic caucus -- Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas -- have said they will oppose the compromise package.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In 1968 the Lotus Formula 1 team broke new ground. Rather than racing in a livery related to national flags or emblems, the team took to the circuit with cars in the color-scheme -- and wearing the logo of -- Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand. Lewis Hamilton's helmet bears the ""Striding Man"", symbol of Johnnie Walker for nearly 100 years . Since then Formula 1 and sponsorship have walked hand-in-hand, sponsorship money being a significant -- and in many case major -- source of revenue. But what do sponsors get out of Formula 1? Johnnie Walker, a Scotch whisky brand of Diageo, is in its third season of sponsoring the McLaren Mercedes team. Ben Anderson is Johnnie Walker's Global Brand Director: ""Specifically for us we're looking at doing two things. At a brand level we're trying continually to develop the equity in our brand image. And that's by getting involved with international, stylish events like Formula 1. ""And secondly it's a fantastic vehicle for us to get our responsible drinking message across. When we went into Formula 1 it was on those two bases."" Johnnie Walker is the world's best-selling Scotch whisky (and the world's second-best selling whisky after the Irish whiskey, Jameson). Sold in 180 countries and consumed at a rate of 154 glasses per second (or five bottles per second; nearly 160 million bottles per annum), it is a truly global proposition. ""You can imagine that when we wanted to get into a sponsorship property we needed something that gave us the global scale and global reach and Formula 1 was really the only possible sporting event that we could get this reach,"" continues Anderson ""it's a huge annual event."" With such a global presence, Johnnie Walker doesn't need Formula 1 to grab brand awareness. Rather it piggybacks on Formula 1's appeal -- and the brand appeal of McLaren Mercedes in particular -- to position itself as a youthful and dynamic proposition. ""In terms of which team you go for we analyzed the teams and there was really only one potentially for us to get involved with and that was McLaren,"" says Anderson, ""because we share so many similar characteristics. Both our teams are successful. Since they entered Formula 1, 41 years ago, no team has won more races than McLaren. ""We're the best and biggest global Scotch player, we've won more awards than any other Scotch whisky. So there's a similarity there. Both brands are innovative. That fit of values -- these brands have a kind of status -- Mercedes, McLaren, Johnnie Walker."" But it's not just about presenting the brand. Formula 1 offers Johnnie Walker a chance to entertain its clients in a unique way. ""Ron Dennis says that Formula 1 is one of the last gladiatorial sports -- like chariot racing,"" says Anderson, ""it's exciting, it's something you can get close to and experience in a really authentic way. And we found that it's a great asset to our corporate entertaining calendar. ""We tend to take customers from specific markets to specific races, both in seeing what the brand looks like at its best in a contemporary, fashionable, international setting such as Formula 1 races are. Be they in Monaco, Sao Paolo or Shanghai, having deeper relationships with our customers is one of the benefits we get out of it."" Formula 1 isn't Johnnie Walker's only sporting sponsorship. It also sponsors golf -- a sport that --Tiger Woods aside -- is rarely associated with youth and dynamism. But while its perception in Europe is one of ""a walk in the country ruined"", in the Asia-Pacific market it has the associated glamour and spirit of Formula 1. The Johnnie Walker classic has run in Asia for 17 years now and Johnnie Walker also sponsors the Championship at Gleneagles in Scotland (Gleneagles is also a Diageo property). Anderson relates a piece of Gleneagles trivia: its golf course was designed by a descendant of Johnnie Walker. Key to the brand message that Johnnie Walker -- and Diageo -- is trying to get across is responsible drinking. Diageo runs worldwide campaigns on this message, including the ""Drink Aware"" campaign in the UK and ""Think B4U Drink"" campaign in Australia. But aren't motor sports and drink strange bedfellows? ""Responsible drinking and Formula 1: a lot of people say, can you explain that to me for a second?"" says Anderson, ""I'm always delighted to answer that particular question because responsible drinking is a critical part of Diageo's message."" The message has been reinforced by having formula McLaren world champion, Mika Hakkinen, work as a taxi driver at various Grands Prix. ""Recently I happened to be in Monaco with [Hakkinen]. 'Why are you driving a taxi promoting responsible drinking?' people ask. The very fact that you're putting that question into people's minds is unbelievably powerful."" And then when you explain that a Formula 1 driver is a great athlete who is in control, but that you cannot be in control if you're drinking and driving.

"(CNN) -- Throw a little celebratory glitter for ""Dancing With the Stars."" Despite being in its 18th season, the ABC reality series still managed to make Monday night's premiere feel fresh. Part of that is thanks to Erin Andrews, the Fox Sports personality who's taken over co-hosting duties from Brooke Burke-Charvet, but Monday's episode also debuted a set makeover, a new band and a new twist on voting. Every week, celebrities pair up with their assigned professional ballroom dancers to learn a dance routine to perform for the judges. With a combination of votes from viewers and scores from the judges, each celebrity competing vies to be the star with the highest score weekly so he or she can advance to the next round. Those who land in the bottom are eliminated from the show. But to shake up the process, ""DWTS"" is now allowing viewers to vote for stars to switch pro partners midway through the season. The cast this year includes child stars such as Danika McKellar (aka Winnie from ""The Wonder Years"") and Candace Cameron Bure (D.J. Tanner from ""Full House""), plus ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta's"" NeNe Leakes, comedian-TV host Drew Carey, and champion ice dancers Charlie White and Meryl Davis. White, who's paired with Sharna Burgess, and Bure, who's dancing with Mark Ballas, had the top two routines of the night. (The ""Full House"" actress caught the judges off guard with her skills.) Carey, Leakes and McKellar, whose fox trot got thunderous applause, all earned scores that landed them in the middle. Davis ended up scoring below her ice-dancing partner White, earning just a 24 to White's score of 27. (That difference made at least one viewer wonder if the judges are playing favorites.) The real standout of the night was Billy Dee Williams (as we predicted). The 76-year-old ""Star Wars"" actor not only pulled off a cha-cha with pro partner Emma Slater to the movie's theme music, but he did it with two Stormtroopers and R2-D2. The audience -- which included some Ewoks -- loved it, but the judges thought his routine was lacking energy and gave him the lowest score of the night, a 15. The first elimination in the 18th season of ""Dancing With the Stars"" will take place next week.","""Dancing With the Stars"" gets a makeover for its 18th season premiere .

"(CareerBuilder) -- I recently came across Zack O'Malley Greenburg's book ""Empire State of Mind: How Jay-Z Went from Street Corner to Corner Office."" I have to admit that I didn't know if a hip-hop icon had much to teach me (aka a regular worker) about succeeding in our respective fields. But seeing as career books often begin to sound alike when you read the summaries on the flap, I couldn't pass up this interesting angle. Plus, he's just a good artist. I didn't doubt Jay-Z was a prime example of success. His picture might as well be next to the Wikipedia entry on ""living the dream."" Whether or not you're a fan of his music -- and between ""Empire State of Mind"" and ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.),"" you have to like at least one of his tracks -- you can't deny that the man has been able to achieve and exceed his goals. Jay-Z (née Shawn Corey Carter) has countless hits, co-founded Rocawear clothing, co-owns a basketball team, and was an executive of two different record labels. Oh, and Oprah picked his 2010 autobiography to be one of her favorite things, which is about as coveted an endorsement as you can hope for. But after reading Greenburg's book, I have to admit I understand why he makes a superb guide for your career, even if you are looking to be an investment banker or grocery store manager instead of a hip hop legend. If you look at what Jay-Z has done with his career, you might realize that what made him successful is what makes many great leaders successful. Below are five lessons that I think we can all learn from Jay-Z's career: . 1. Find something your passionate about and make it part of your life . What Jay Z did: Jay-Z is a sports enthusiast. He's a proud Yankees fan and he's been a courtside fixture at NBA games for years for The Cavaliers, Knicks and Lakers. Not content with just being a fan, Jay-Z assembled a team (that included Lebron James) in 2003 to play in Entertainers Basketball Classic (EBC) and then became a co-owner of the New Jersey Nets. What you can do: Many of us are sports fans, but few of us have the bank account and business savvy to own an NBA team. However, we can find a way to make one of our passions part of our everyday life, even if your interest doesn't fit within your current job. For example, if you are obsessed with politics but you work at a clothing store, you should leave your opinion of Congress at home. But that doesn't mean you can't start your own political blog or become a contributor to another one. That way you can immerse yourself in a subject you love and still improve your analytical and writing skills. You never know what will become of your side venture -- maybe a new business opportunity. Maybe nothing will happen beyond gaining readership, but at least you'll have space where you can indulge your passions. 2. Market yourself . What Jay-Z did: One of the other reasons Jay-Z decided to assemble that basketball team in the EBC? He knew it was great marketing. He branded a bus with the image of a sneaker he designed for Reebok, had the team tour in it, all while his music blared. And then they'd celebrate at the club he owned in New York. It was his project from top to bottom and he wasn't afraid to promote it. What you can do: The odds are slim that somebody will walk up to you and say, ""Wow, all that great work you do? Unbelievable! Let me offer you this high-paying job that is perfect for you."" Instead, make sure you let your boss know when you perform well. Don't brag, but forward any positive feedback you get from clients or colleagues . If you're looking for a job, piece together an impressive portfolio or résumé. Think about the awards you've won, leadership positions you've held, and references who will speak glowingly about you. Don't play meek when it comes to finding a new job because employers don't have time to beg you to talk about yourself. Impress them from the beginning. (And if you can afford to plaster your face on the side of a bus, go ahead.) 3. Know when to move on . What Jay-Z did: In 2003, at the peak of his career (up to that point), he decided to retire. Barely 34, Jay-Z felt he couldn't top himself, so he decided to walk away. (That said, he un-retired a few years later, which is something we have criticized before, too. So don't cry ""wolf"" either."") What you can do: Jay-Z retired, but most of us don't have that luxury right now. However, if you're just going through the motions and the excitement and passion you once had are lacking, then don't be afraid to look around. Maybe you need to talk to your boss, find a new job or get into a new industry. Whatever is right for you, make that move. If you're spending 40 hours each week doing a job that bores you, then you're wasting a lot of your life. You'll be so much happier and more productive if you're interested in what you do. 4. Be willing to shake things up . What Jay-Z did: When Jay-Z took over Def Jam records in 2005, he couldn't believe that the business model hadn't changed for decades, and employees had no incentive to work hard. He wanted to see people trying new things -- taking risks and competing to be more innovative than the other. So he held a retreat with the employees, told them what he wanted, and then began to transform the organization. Greenburg notes how people were intrigued by the fact that Jay-Z wanted to learn as much as he could about the business. What you can do: When you're not the boss, you can't revamp the organization. But workers can get the attention of the boss and other leadership by coming forward with new ideas. If you're the person interacting with customers every day, you know when the process can be improved and what would make your job more efficient and maybe bring the company more money. Always be respectful, but don't be afraid to be bold once in a while. It can be the only way you stand out sometimes. 5. Manage your private life . What Jay-Z did: Jay-Z and Beyoncé are basically music royalty, and when they began quietly dating, everybody wanted to know about it. Yet, they wouldn't comment on their romance, and even to this day the married couple is tight-lipped about any personal information. Therefore you hear more about his and her music than about their personal lives, unlike some famous people. What you can do: You don't need to keep your marriage a secret from your manager, unless you want to, but your weekend partying or marital bickering don't belong at work. Often, professionals decide to post Facebook photos of their drunken adventures or get into a big fight with a spouse over the phone so that the entire office hears. Suddenly your personal drama overshadows your hard work. Remember that your professional reputation is a significant factor in promotions, raises and even layoffs. Don't let a killer keg stand undo your years of hard work. Of course, there are a lot of other things Jay-Z's done right in his career, so I suggest checking out ""Empire State of Mind."" It's especially refreshing if you're a music fan and/or someone who's not keen on the typical career guides. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"London (CNN) -- In the early hours of March 22 this year, cruise ship worker Rebecca Coriam made a mysterious phonecall. No one knows who she spoke to, or what the call was about. Minutes later she hung up, walked away -- and apparently vanished without a trace. Six months later, her parents still have no idea what happened to their 24-year-old daughter on board the Disney Wonder ship as it sailed off the coast of California. And like the loved ones of scores of others who have vanished from cruises in international waters, there is little they can do to find out. While millions of people around the world take cruises every year, at least 168 people have vanished from cruise ships and ferries in international waters since 1995, according to the International Cruise Victims Association. Maritime law states that crimes are to be investigated by police in the country where the ship is registered. So while Coriam, who is British, went missing off the coast of California, her case was taken up in the Bahamas, where the Disney Wonder is registered. Coriam's parents, Mike and Ann, were shocked to learn that rather than American or British police boarding the ship to gather evidence, Disney and then Bahamian law enforcement were to handle the investigation. The Coriams flew to Los Angeles where they were shown CCTV footage of their daughter making a phone call in the early hours of the morning she went missing -- the only piece of evidence they've been shown in the investigation into her disappearance, they say. ""We don't know what was in the phonecall and when she finished the call she just walked away,"" Mike told CNN. ""That's all we really know to this day."" A single police officer from the Bahamas flew into town but failed to interview any of the roughly 3,700 passengers and crewon the cruise ship -- and that appears to be the extent of the investigation into their daughter's disappearance, her parents say. Superintendent Paul Rolle of the Bahamas police told the UK newspaper Daily Mail: ""I have been in touch with the family and have no further comment."" ""We get very little information coming back to us as to what the investigation has found out, and that's partly because of the problems of where the ship's registered,"" said Mike. Rebecca's parents are demanding new regulations similar to a new U.S. law which allows the FBI and U.S. Coast Guard to investigate cases of missing U.S. citizens regardless of where the ship is registered. ""The law we want is what President Barack Obama signed up to last year in the U.S.,"" said Mike. ""We want the same in the UK and Europe and elsewhere."" The Coriams have met with UK shipping minister Mike Penning, who has pledged to raise the issue with the International Maritime Organization -- but progress has been slow. ""It's been absolutely awful,"" said Anne. ""We just miss her desperately now -- it's the longest we've ever gone without seeing her, and it's not getting any easier at all."" At the time of her disappearance a Disney spokeswoman said: ""We have been doing everything possible to find Rebecca Coriam including conducting multiple shipboard searches. In addition, we have been working with all of the appropriate authorities. Rebecca's disappearance has been difficult for everyone at Disney Cruise Line."" ""We've been in close contact with the Coriam family, and we're assisting them in any way we can."" Mike blames the culture of cruise ships, and not Disney or the Bahamian police, for the lack of action over Rebecca's disappearance. And with the recent news that the UK cruise line company Cunard is considering moving its ships' registrations to a different country, even more cruise passengers could be exposed to the problems the Coriams have faced. With little more support than that of their own family, the Coriams say they are focused on finding out what happened to their daughter -- and preventing others from going through the same trauma. ""We've got to find out what's happened to her -- you don't just vanish off of a ship with all those people,"" said Anne. ""We'll keep on and keep strong for her until we find answers.""","Rebecca Coriam disappeared from a Disney cruise ship in March .

"(CNN) -- The world received word yesterday that the publishers of Encyclopedia Britannica would stop producing hardbound, paper copies of their venerable reference. Actually, they stopped in 2010 but didn't tell anyone. Now they've disclosed they've been able to sell just 8,000 copies of the collection. The rest are in a warehouse in Chicago, looking for someone who needs historically accurate, out-of-date information. According to the company, they'll continue publishing online and will sell their services to individuals, schools and libraries. In some respects, that's good. The Web is much more easily updated, more interactive, and can deliver motion, sound, and color simultaneously. In other respects, that's not good, particularly for young readers, older folks, immigrants, and technophobes who'd rather read a book. Britannica's decision is, in so many ways, simply a mile marker along the way to the new world of the 21st century. In mid-20th century America, a set of Britannicas on the shelf was a status symbol: a sign that the family had money, taste, some pretense to intellect, or at least a very strong desire to be seen that way. Other families had the World Book, Colliers, or the Encyclopedia Americana (my own family's choice). Annual yearbooks updated entries in science, technology, industrial manufacturing, botany, and more. And, for so many of us who grew up in the 20th century, it was fun just to look through those volumes, read, and wonder about the world. Wikipedia has largely replaced those printed volumes, principally because it's free. Everything on the Web is free (or should be, according to its most passionate users). The fact that it's not written, edited, or monitored by content matter experts seems to be of little concern. Crowd-sourcing has replaced experts and, though not good, the accuracy quotient of Wikipedia articles seems to be improving. This is, however, part of a trend that assumes expertise is overvalued. Today, most technology users value connectivity and experience. Newspapers and magazines are in decline, bloggers and content aggregators are on the ascendant. The problem with crowd-sourcing the answer to any particular question is, of course, that you're as likely to find ideologically driven opinion as hard fact. You also have little in the way of support for judgments about credibility, reliability, and accuracy. Ours is a society that cannot afford to do without a postal service, daily newspapers, and expertly edited sources of public knowledge. The notion that all knowledge is available online within six clicks is both exciting and a bit frightening (have you Googled yourself, your friends, or your children to see what's online, including images?). The disappearance of our printed sources of information poses two serious concerns. First, our antiquated, overtaxed, patchwork power grid is perennially on the verge of collapse. Chinese hackers, aging components, or an F4 tornado could take down large segments of our power supply. No power, no Internet. Second, just two-thirds of all Americans have access to the Internet at work or home. Those of us who live with an iPhone, Blackberry, tablet device (or a desktop computer) seem to think just about everyone is connected. Not so. Online access is far from a given for lower-income people. Wireless handheld devices and municipal WiFi systems look promising, but more than 100 million Americans are not connected to the Internet, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project. Clearly this is a hinge point in history, much like Gutenberg's use of moveable type to operate a printing press, or Marconi's use of wireless communication to transmit the human voice over vast distances. The arrival of video scanning -- which made digital optics possible -- and high-speed data processing have accelerated the rate of change and we're simply going to have to live with it and make the best of it. In the interim, we could think about buying a book or subscribing to a newspaper (just for old time's sake), or we could do something important for that one-third of our neighbors that will serve as an information safety net: Support your local public library. They, too, offer access to the Internet, but they also offer a clean, safe, nicely organized source for each of us to find information that's useful, valuable, interesting, and helpful. Looking forward to the world our children and their children will live in doesn't mean simply abandoning technology that seems anachronistic. It means preserving the best of what we know and making it accessible to everyone. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James S. O'Rourke, IV.","Encyclopedia Britannica announced that it won't print more books .

"(CNN) -- Facebook wants to make sure you don't miss the most important updates, photos, humblebrags and baby announcements from your friends. The company on Tuesday announced a tweak to its News Feed that will take a popular story -- one that's getting lots of comments and likes -- and put it back at the top of your feed to make sure you don't miss it. On a typical day, the average Facebook user is only seeing 20% of the posts from friends and pages that he or she follows. Where are the rest? Filtered out by Facebook, using algorithms it has developed to determine the stories and posts the social network thinks you'll care about most. Now Facebook has decided to shed some light on the mysterious decisions that go into ranking the stories in the news feed. People have grumbled in the past about not having a pure, kitchen-sink feed of all their friends' updates, so the company is explaining a little about how it does what it does. To figure out what posts to show, Facebook looks at a person's most recent everyday actions such as liking, sharing or hiding posts, the amount of interaction they have with people or pages, and a post's popularity among their group of friends. Facebook displayed updates differently in the past. The social media site was once a chronologically ordered feed of all the things posted by friends and pages. But then its number of users soared -- now more than 1 billion -- and over time, most users collected so many connections that their bloated feeds became unwieldy. On an average day, Facebook says you have about 1,500 posts from friends and pages you follow. But only about 300 of those appear in your feed. Facebook thinks showing all 1,500 stories would be overwhelming, and that people would miss important posts in that flood of updates. The company did some tests and found that people read, comment and like fewer posts when faced with the entire unfiltered stream. Even with the shorter, ranked news feeds, people only read an average of 57% of the posts. With the new tweak, older posts can resurface and the amount of stories read jumps to 70%, Facebook said. It also resulted in a 5% increase in likes, comments and shares on the resurrected posts from friends, and 8% increase in the same activity for posts from pages, it said. ""The data suggests that this update does a better job of showing people the stories they want to see, even if they missed them the first time,"" Facebook said in a blog post. For a price, you can ensure that your posts are among the chosen stories in your friends' streams. In an attempt to profit from the system, Facebook launched a feature last year that lets people pay to promote their own posts. The price varies depending on your location and how many people will see the post, but it ensures your link or update won't get buried by an algorithm.","Facebook is tweaking your News Feed to put popular older posts back on top .

"(CNN) -- Search results you can smell, a crowdsourced hunt for pirate booty and paying for vowels on Twitter are some of this year's attempts at tech pranks. Few fooled anymore, but the annual tech ritual is still fun to watch. Every April Fools' Day, tech companies big and small roll out carefully constructed jokes. They're a way for the companies to show they know how to have to have a little fun, while conveniently getting in some free marketing at the same time. Google continues to be the undisputed champion of April Fools' tomfoolery, with elaborate offerings and high-production-value announcement videos across various Google products. Google Maps is following up last year's 8-bit maps overlay with an old-timey treasure map. The real, interactive overlay comes complete with sepia-tinged Street View images and a detailed backstory. It seems the 315-year-old map was found by divers capturing Google Maps underwater street view images. It belonged to pirate William ""Captain"" Kidd and contains hidden clues and symbols. The company invites people to help search for treasure, admire the hand-drawn landmarks and look out for pirates. Google's iconic search page unveiled smellable search results with Google Nose. When you search for certain keywords like durian, campsite, moth balls, grandpa's hat or maple syrup, a description of that object's odor and a big blue ""Smell"" button appear alongside the search results. According to the ""Google Aromabase,"" Abraham Lincoln smells like an old, musty ""remnant of American history."" To experience it for yourself, lean in and press enter. The 15 million-plus sentibytes of data were collected via Android devices and smart vehicles. (There is, of course, a safe-search feature for smells you'd rather not experience.) YouTube announced it was shutting down completely. The past eight years have actually just been a contest to determine the best video ever made. The service has finally collected enough entries and will begin the long reviewing and judging process to select a winner. The process will only take 10 years to sift through 150,000 finalists, the site said. YouTube celebrities such as Charlie of ""Charlie Bit My Finger"" and Antoine ""Hide Your Kids, Hide Your Wife"" Dodson make special appearances in the video announcing the contest. Other Google attempts include Gmail Blue (everything is radically redesigned to be blue), Google+ auto-detecting emoticons, and Google Fiber hotspots attached to utility poles. Twitter announced it was splitting its service into two, with a full, paid version that will charge for vowels ($5/month) and a free version called ""Twttr"" that will allow only consonants. Part-time vowel ""Y"" will continue to be free, and the length of tweets is being expanded to 141 characters. ""We're doing this because we believe that by eliminating vowels, we'll encourage a more efficient and 'dense' form of communication,"" the company announced in its April Fools' blog post. (True story: Twitter founders considered using that vowel-free version for the site's name). Virgin Atlantic unveiled a photo of its new glass-bottom plane, giving everyone a window seat. Nokia announced it was making a touch-screen microwave that integrates eye-tracking technology and automatic food photography. The Nokia 5AM-TH1N6 Constellation will retail for 399 Euros (about $511), though subsidized versions may be available. ""More models, including a mini variant targeted towards people with small appetites, and a 10-inch variant aimed at no one in particular, are also planned,"" the company said in a blog post. Sony unveiled its latest line of headphones and speakers for cats, dogs and even hamsters, called Animalia.","Google leads the pranks with smell searches and a Google Maps treasure hunt .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador's highest court has upheld a conviction and a $40 million judgment against a newspaper in a case that pitted the paper's directors and a former opinion editor against the country's president. The three-judge panel ruled late Wednesday that a lower court's decision to hold the paper accountable for the content of an opinion column that described President Rafael Correa as a dictator was correct. Correa sued El Universo newspaper, arguing the article unjustly claimed he had ordered security forces to open fire at a hospital full of civilians last September. The newspaper and press freedom advocates countered that the president was trying to crack down on critics by restricting the media. ""The truth has shined,"" Correa said after the ruling. ""We have set a precedent. This sentence and this process are historic. They demonstrate that nobody has the right to tarnish the truth,"" the president said. ""Not only is the person who wrote it responsible, but also the directors who allowed the offense and the newspaper where it was printed."" The ruling means that the accused must pay $30 million, and the newspaper must pay $10 million, to Correa. Emilio Palacio, El Universo's former opinion editor and author of the column, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that the court ruling sets the wrong example. ""Of course this sets a precedent: For the first time in the history of Latin America, and I suppose, the world, a president wins $40 million for his pocket by manipulating justice, naming the judges he desired, and using his influence,"" Palacio said. Palacio and the newspaper's directors argued that they were denied the opportunity to properly present their defense during the first trial, and accused Correa of influencing the selection of judges favorable to him on the high court. ""The only thing that was left under these conditions was for the ratification of this shameful conviction,"" Palacio said. The court ruling also calls for three years in prison for Palacio. He resigned from the paper in July and is now living in Miami, where he is seeking asylum. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which concluded in a special report that Ecuador's defamation laws have been systematically used to punish critical journalists, criticized the high court's decision. ""An editor is seeking political asylum, three executives may soon go to jail, and the country's leading paper may go bankrupt solely because President Correa disliked an opinion piece,"" said Carlos Lauria, senior Americas Program coordinator for the organization. ""This shortsighted ruling will only keep Ecuadoran journalists from investigating powerful politicians; it represents a serious setback for democracy in Ecuador.""","Ecuador's highest court upheld a libel conviction against a newspaper .

"(CNN) -- A lion at the Dallas Zoo bit and killed a lioness in their exhibit as visitors watched Sunday afternoon in an attack officials said they couldn't immediately explain. The 5-year-old lioness, Johari, was bitten in the neck by one of the male lions in her pride around 2:15 p.m., the zoo said. Dozens of zoo visitors saw the attack, CNN affiliates WFAA and KTXA reported. ""At first you think they're playing, and then you realize he's killing her, and ... you're watching it and you just can't believe your eyes,"" witness Michael Henshaw told WFAA. ""The male lion that started it just had his mouth over her throat, and everyone thought they were playing at first,"" witness Jim Harvey told WFAA. 'But then they could see she was struggling."" The zoo said Johari died quickly. Witness Dylan Parker told WFAA that the attacking lion held Johari by the neck ""for like 10 minutes ... waiting until it quit moving."" The zoo said its keepers closed the exhibit after the incident and took the attacker and three other lions -- his brother and Johari's two sisters -- off the habitat. Lynn Kramer, a veterinarian and the zoo's vice president of animal operations and welfare, said the attack was a ""very rare and unfortunate occurrence."" ""In my 35 years as a veterinarian in zoos, I've never seen this happen,"" he said. The two surviving lionesses were expected to be put back onto the habitat on Monday, the zoo said. The zoo said the male lions won't be in the exhibit with the lionesses for now, WFAA reported. Zoo staff said it wasn't clear why the attack happened, according to WFAA.

"(CNN) -- One hot mess. That's what you'll see on the front page of any leading e-commerce site in China. There's a maddening array of banner ads, rows upon rows of links, icons touting promotions and discounts. It's a jarring user interface that seems to bring out the worst in Web design. And it was designed that way. ""They want this shopping atmosphere,"" says Yu Gang, chairman and founder of Yihaodian, one of China's leading online retailers. ""Our consumers like a page that is very crowded, busy with a lot of links so they can open lots of windows at the same time."" David Wei, China tech investor and former CEO of e-commerce giant Alibaba, couldn't agree more: ""When I worked for Alibaba, I cleaned the homepage to an international standard. It doesn't work."" Ahead of the upcoming Alibaba IPO, I got the full download from China's e-commerce insiders for CNN's ""On China."" They tell me that in the mad, mad world of mainland e-commerce, the rules of the road from the West simply don't apply. The superlative stats are well known: China has the world's largest online population with over 591 million Internet users. China is the world's second-largest online retailing market, clocking in up to $210 billion in sales in 2012.  Taobao, Alibaba's consumer e-commerce engine, boasts sales bigger than eBay and Amazon combined. The scale of China's e-commerce market is tantalizing. But it's also a tough one to crack due in part to inadequate delivery services throughout the country. ""The logistics industry is very fragmented in China, with the likes of UPS and FedEx in China still unable to provide nationwide coverage and quality service,"" Yu points out. As such, many Chinese e-commerce companies including Yihaodian provide their own last mile delivery to reach customers with a network of mopeds and motorcycles. Another point of distinction is the extremely social nature of their customer base. ""Social media is a big one in China,"" says Oliver Rust, senior vice president at Nielsen. ""Fifty percent of consumers in China are leveraging social media to learn about new products."" ""Retailers need to engage in this social conversation and interact with China's tech-savvy consumers who are increasingly open to boosting e-commerce spending."" And that doesn't just mean opening a branded Weibo account. Online chatting between customers and merchants is the norm with instant messaging embedded in almost every e-commerce platform. But don't let all the friendly shop talk fool you. The business is brutal. When David Wei was at the helm of Alibaba, he led the offensive to undermine and defeat eBay in China. ""When Taobao fought against eBay, we listed the top ten things eBay was doing in China -- and we did it 100% differently,"" he tells me. So while eBay charged for its listing fees, Taobao offered no listing fee at all. While eBay used an auction model to rank its listings, Taobao used a retail model to rank fresher listings at the top. And while eBay limited communication between merchants and customers, Taobao created an instant messaging tool to encourage buyer-seller communication. Ebay eventually shut its main website in China.

"New York (CNN) -- Police have identified the eighth and final victim of a gas explosion in New York's East Harlem last week. Mayumi Nakamura, 34, lived in apartment No. 4 at 1646 Park Ave., according to police, the northernmost of the two buildings leveled by explosion and fire March 12. Her body was recovered from the rubble Thursday night, police said, but identification took longer because her family had to travel from Japan to confirm her identity. The other seven victims have been identified as Carmen Tanco, 67; Alexis ""Jordy"" Salas, 22; Griselde Camacho, 44; Rosaura Hernandez, 21; Andreas Panagopoulos, 43; George Ameado, 44; and Rosaura Barrios, 44. Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said the victims died of smoke inhalation or physical trauma. Meanwhile, a lawsuit has been filed in state Supreme Court in the name of Michelle Nelson, 46, who said she was injured in the blast. The complaint alleges that electric provider Con Edison was aware of potentially unsafe conditions of gas mains on the property and neglected to act. ""This is the first of what will be many more,"" attorney Michael Lamonsoff said. ""You have Con Ed on notice for years that their gas lines are extremely old ... especially in this area."" The lawsuit also names Kaoru Murmatsu, owner and superintendent of the building. ""We're working with the City, the Salvation Army and the Red Cross to assist the affected families with their expenses in the wake of the tragedy. We will review the filing at an appropriate time,"" said Bob McGee, a spokesman for Con Edison. Eric Weiss, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, which has jurisdiction over pipeline accidents, said the agency plans to release an investigative update Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Below ground in central London is a bunker every self-respecting golfer is desperate to find -- even international man of mystery James Bond. Just yards from the plush shopping paradise that is Harrods sits Knightsbridge Golf School, a subterranean sanctum that has been teaching and preaching about the game for over 60 years. It's in the bowels of this grand Georgian building on Lowndes Square that actors as diverse as Sean Connery, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Christopher Lee have honed their swings. But you are just as likely to find taxi drivers and heads of industry popping in for a lesson -- or a brisk round at Augusta or St. Andrews on one of the school's simulators. ""Golfers today, unfortunately, are no better than they were back in 1951 when the school opened,"" Steve Gould, who along with D.J. Wilkinson has more than 35 years of KGS service under his belt, told CNN. ""People don't come here for the location or for the facilities -- they come for the lessons."" Founded by pioneering swing coach Leslie King back in 1951, KGS thrives through word of mouth, welcoming around 300 new disciples each year on the strength of its tutelage. It's this reputation that explains why so many A-list stars have made a pilgrimage to the salubrious district of Knightsbridge, often in a hurry to grasp the basics of the game ahead of a big-screen project. Golf philosophy . It was here the original 007 -- Connery -- came to fine-tune his game before filming ""Goldfinger"" in the mid-1960s, the third in the series charting the intrepid adventures of Britain's dashing secret agent. MI5's finest -- with the help of a few underhand tactics -- gets the better of his nemesis Goldfinger on the golf course, in a famous scene that also includes the decapitation of a statue via the boot of the international jewel thief's menacing butler Oddjob. ""Sean Connery wasn't a golfer before the film and at the time he was seeing a dentist called Ian Caldwell, then an English amateur champion, taught by Leslie King,"" Gould explains. ""He told Connery, 'If you want to look like a golfer in a few short months you should go and learn from King.' "" A golf pro who had identified all the critical components of a successful swing, King believed the game was best taught inside, away from the worst of England's elements. He set up shop in a disused squash court in central London -- miles from any golf course -- and despite next to no advertising, it was soon packed to the rafters. King's method is still the one favored by Gould and Wilkinson, aided by modern technology, and is still as effective in teaching the film stars of today as it was half a century ago. ""We did a similar thing last year for Colin Firth for a film he was making called 'Arthur Newman,' "" Gould adds. ""He was a great pupil, very intense. ""We've been looking online to see if we did any good for Colin in the few lessons he had and we found the trailer. ""In the first clip Colin is playing a shot out of bunker that looks fantastic. It's not a double, it's him. He looks like a golf professional."" Perhaps another reason KGS has endured is its abiding philosophy, breaking what can be a complicated game down into simple, manageable elements. Golf can be a veritable goldmine of misinformation and incomprehensible jargon, but the straight-talking stalwarts of KGS attempt to help chart a path to consistently straight driving. ""The reason people come here is to try to find an end to trial and error golf,"" Gould says. ""Most golfers don't know what they do when they hit a good shot, or a bad shot. ""The only way you can progress is by knowing where you should be at each and every stage of your swing, by mapping out the swing. It's very simple. ""I've been teaching golf for 30 years and I can't understand most of the golf stuff I read. People come here and say, 'I wish I'd done from the start what you've shown me in just a few minutes.' ""The great beauty of the swing we teach here is we look at some of the modern players like (2010 British Open winner) Louis Oosthuizen or (reigning U.S. Open champion) Justin Rose, and all the positions they make are identical to the ones we teach all the time."" Golf addiction . One of KGS' biggest supporters is film star Grant, who has spent hours in Knightsbridge grooving a swing that is regularly put to the test in celebrity golf tournaments around the world. He once said of his love of the game: ""My golf addiction is out of control. I literally want to play from the moment I get up to the time I go to bed."" Gould added: ""Hugh is a great supporter of ours; he's done more for us than anyone. He did the introduction for one of our books, which we can't thank him enough for."" Grant and his father have both regularly been to KGS for lessons, and the actor's testimonial takes pride of place on the company's website. ""It is hard to say which of us came to you the worse golfer, but you have done the impossible and turned us from embarrassing into respectable,"" it reads. Not everyone who walks through the doors of 47 Lowndes Square has what it takes to improve their game, though. One pupil especially still has a cherished place in the school's history, even though his inexperienced wielding of a club nearly took out the head honcho. ""Leslie King once had a guy come in who was the only person he told he couldn't help,"" Gould says. ""It was a Maharajah who came down and said he wanted to play golf. ""Leslie stood opposite him and the guy took the club back and swung it round at head height. Leslie had to duck before his head came clean off. ""When asked to have another go, the guy did exactly the same thing, at which point Leslie took the club off him and said, 'I'm sorry, sir, golf is not for you.' ""","Knightsbridge Golf School has been teaching amateurs and A-listers for over 60 years .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Members of indigenous groups who say they are fed up with violence in southwestern Colombia clashed Tuesday with soldiers in what they said was an attempt to reclaim their territory. CNN affiliate Caracol TV showed swarms of locals surrounding soldiers, charging at them with makeshift clubs. Colombian officials condemned the violence. ""As president of all Colombians, I categorically reject this attitude and make an impassioned plea for the end of hostilities,"" said President Juan Manuel Santos. ""What we are seeing are unacceptable acts that constitute criminal conduct and should be investigated by the authorities,"" Santos said Tuesday. Santos visited the region last week, meeting with indigenous groups in the village of Toribio as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia flexed their muscle by setting up a checkpoint just outside the town. Santos was there to meet with villagers over their demands that both government soldiers and members of the FARC leave the area. Santos was booed as he walked through the town. He has seen his ratings among Colombians drop in recent weeks because of the widespread perception that the security situation has gotten out of control during his leadership. A FARC commander of the Special Forces of the 6th Front told CNN last week that ""Santos' war hasn't helped anyone here in this zone. He wants to increase the army and the police, which will not bring any benefit to the people or Toribio."" The commander said that if the government were to remove its soldiers from the zone, ""FARC would have no reason to remain there,"" but promised the group would remain as long as the military is there. ""We've had enough deaths,"" said Feliciano Valencia, of the Cauca Indigenous Committee, in an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol. ""The humanitarian situation in the north of the department of Cauca is grave."" Given that neither the armed forces nor the FARC guerrillas have been able to solve the problem, ""We have decided to play our cards in this matter,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Adam Scott has extended his lead to seven shots at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida after posting a second round four-under par 68. The Australian couldn't match his course record-equaling opening round of 62 in Friday's second round, but is firmly in the box seat not only to claim a maiden win at the event but also take over from Tiger Woods as the world No.1. A win for the current world No. 2 on Sunday would still leave him fractionally behind Woods in the rankings but he will assume top spot if the 14-time major champion, who is currently injured, doesn't play before next month's Masters at Augusta National. The two-year rolling points system which looks likely to hand defending Masters champion Scott the top ranking spot may not be immediately easy to understand, but the 33-year-old's dominance at Bay Hill is clear for all to see. Scott's two-round 14-under par total ties the 36-hole record at the course and leaves him seven clear of America's J.B. Holmes and Chesson Hadley and Francesco Molinari from Italy. ""I think it was a pretty good way to back up a low round,"" Scott said. ""It's not easy to do that, especially around a tough course. ""And I think the first hole was key in keeping some momentum out of yesterday, making kind of a scrappy par and a good putt on the 1st to feel like I'm heading in the right direction to start the day,"" he added. ""I think you have those days like yesterday where it seems every yardage is perfect and you've got the read on every putt and things just happen. ""And as soon as you don't have that perfect yardage, maybe on the first few holes, the pin's a little tucked and it's not shaping up for you, it all becomes a lot harder."" Elsewhere, Keegan Bradley's five-under 67 was the best of the day and lifted the American to joint fifth on six under with five other players including compatriot Brandt Snedeker and Jamie Donaldson from Wales who both shot second rounds of 71. England's Ian Poulter and Ryo Ishikawa from Japan are two of six players on five-under par. Read more: Woods a doubt for Augusta .

"(CNN) -- Henrik Stenson's accountant must be grinning from ear to ear after the Swedes's incredible winning streak last year. But the world No. 3 isn't getting carried away. ""Like someone said: 'Money is only paper,' right? It's not really going to make you much more happy or extremely sad if you lose a bit,"" Stenson says. Easy to say, perhaps, after netting a cool $20 million in prize money in 2013. But it's not the fiscal peaks that have helped shape the 37-year-old's apparently easy-going attitude to money as much as one spectacular loss. Stenson was a victim of the convicted fraudster Allen Stanford and reportedly lost several million dollars in the Texan's $7 billion Ponzi scheme, which was uncovered in 2009. The Swede said it wasn't so much the scale of the losses but rather the way in which the money went. ""It was probably more about, you know, how you lose something when you think something is a safe investment when it turns out it (isn't),"" Stenson told CNN's Shane O'Donoghue. ""That's got to be more disappointing than taking it to the casino -- you lose, but you know what the risks are. That was probably more what upset me the most about the whole thing. ""I guess I was in a position where I can make up for it in a pretty short space of time. Other people wouldn't be so lucky. For me, it's like a closed chapter. I moved on long ago, but I keep getting reminded of it now and again,"" he says, before breaking into a smile. Getting up and down . He can afford to smile after becoming the first golfer to win both the PGA Tour's FedExCup and the European Tour's Race to Dubai in the same season. Stenson claimed the $10 million prize for winning the FedExCup after winning the season-ending Tour Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club in September before storming to a six-stroke victory in the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai eight weeks later. It was an unprecedented end to a season which saw Stenson return to golf's top table after recovering from a debilitating and prolonged slump. After winning golf's ""fifth major,"" The Players Championship at Sawgrass in May 2009, Stenson looked set to join the sport's elite with strong showings at the U.S. Open (ninth place) and the U.S.PGA Championship (tied sixth) later that season. A tie for third in the Open Championship at St Andrews the following year only seemed to confirm his status as a serious contender for a major title. But things fell apart in the second half of 2010 before completely unraveling in 2011 with a succession of missed cuts and only one top 10 finish all year. As if the loss of form wasn't sickening enough, Stenson then picked up a waterborne parasite on holiday in November 2011 which led to a bout of viral pneumonia. ""He lost what we call the ground force because physically he was poorly,"" says Pete Cowen, Stenson's long-time swing coach. ""If you lose your physical strength you lose all your control."" That lack of power sent Stenson tumbling down the rankings from a career high of world No. 5 in 2009 to 230th. It wasn't the first time Stenson had gone from golden boy to nowhere man. A year after clinching his maiden European Tour victory in 2001 (at the now defunct Benson and Hedges International Open) the Swede missed 14 cuts and won just over â‚¬40,000 ($55,000). ""It was big slump. They were really tough times,"" he recalls. ""I was really lost with my game, I lost my confidence."" On course for recovery . The second, more recent reverse was less to do with any technical deficiencies than with ""frustrations,"" he says at not being able to compete like he used to. ""The most important thing I did with my old sport psychologist (Torsten Hansson) was to start working on the long-term planning. When you are down and out, it's so easy (to go for) short-term solutions,"" Stenson said. ""The quick fixes don't work. I think you've got to put a plan in place and work towards it -- slow but steady progress -- and eventually you will get to the point where you want to get."" With a new physical and psychological regime in place, Stenson started to see the green shoots of recovery with victory at the South African Open in November 2012. ""That was hugely important, especially the way I won it because I held the lead for most of the weekend and then dropped back on Sunday and I managed to come back on the back nine. That was huge for the confidence ... after three-and-a-half years without a win."" Stenson's season-ending victories may have grabbed all the headlines but his comeback year also included his best-ever performance at a major championship -- second to Phil Mickelson in the Open Championship at Muirfield -- backed up by a third- place finish at the U.S.PGA Championship. A major breakthrough? So can he break his duck in 2014 and become Sweden's first major winner? ""If my game is in good shape and it's my week, I definitely think so,"" he says. Cowen can also see his pupil of 13 years clinching that elusive prize. ""He's a complex person,"" says Cowen. ""One day he's up, the next day he's down. When he's up, he's very, very good, but when he's down, you know ... but that's what the best players are like. ""I would think Henrik is one of a few players who can win tournaments on ball striking alone. He's certainly got the game. There are quite a few players who deserve to win majors, but unfortunately you have to win them."" Stenson will get his first chance at Augusta National in April, but before that will be lining up at Dove Mountain, Arizona for the WGC Match Play Championship on February 19 -- a tournament that he won in 2007. Whatever happens this coming week and for the rest of the season, Stenson appears well equipped to deal with what comes his way. ""You know, you are going to have your ups and downs. I might have had two (downs) that were deeper than most, but the belief never went away. ""What we learn is to never give up. If you keep at it, if you keep the belief, you can achieve great things.""

"(CNN) -- Your phone's confiscated. Your fingerprints are taken. You're going to prison. But don't worry, it's just for lunch. The Clink Charity opened its third restaurant this week inside Brixton Prison in south London. The meals are cooked and served by actual prisoners at restaurants located inside prison walls as part of a training and qualification program to help them prepare for life on the outside. The venue is the third to open under the scheme, joining enterprises at Cardiff Prison in Wales and High Down Prison in Surrey. The prison restaurants are open to the public from Monday to Friday, for breakfast and lunch. ""The Clink at HMP Brixton isn't simply a new restaurant opening in London,"" says Chris Moore, chief executive at The Clink Charity. ""We're offering a credible solution to a major skills shortage within the industry as well as tackling the problem of re-offending."" The new London restaurant will serve a compact menu of upscale European food. There are also five meeting rooms for working lunches for up to 24 people. Guest treatment . The career history of the chefs and the prison environs aren't the only unique traits. Booking at one of the Clink Restaurants must be done at least 48 hours in advance and guests must be 18 years or older. Passports or other form of ID is needed to gain entry, and phones, cameras, large bags, laptops and sharp items are prohibited. You're not even allowed to bring in more than $80 in cash -- payment for the meal is done by check or prearranged invoice. You'll have your fingerprints and photo taken and may be subject to ""routine searching."" ""This would be similar to what you might expect in an airport,"" the guidelines and security procedures state. The heavy rules apparently aren't putting people off. Some 18,000 people ate at The Clink Restaurants in Cardiff and High Down last year, according to the organization, paying around $35 per head for three courses and a coffee. How it works . The charity started in 2009 as the brainchild of Alberto Crisci, previously a chef at the Mirabelle restaurant in Mayfair, London (closed since 2008). He's now the brand and training director for the project. High Down Prison is a category B prison (in the UK, category A prisons are most secure, category D facilities are ""open prisons""), and as such requires special measures. Diners need to be approved in advance by the Home Office, the cutlery is plastic and no alcohol is served. In almost every other respect, it's a restaurant comparable to any other in London. Brixton is a category C prison while Cardiff is a category D. The restaurant at Cardiff is attached to the prison, rather than within its walls. Chefs and servers involved in these projects are all prisoners with between six and 18 months of their sentences remaining. Trainees work full-time -- a 40-hour week -- studying toward nationally recognized City & Guilds National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) in food preparation, front-of-house service and industrial cleaning, before returning to their cells in the evening. The Brixton addition is the third of what will eventually be 10 prison restaurants across the UK within the next three years. ""The Clink Charity, in partnership with HMPS, plans to have 10 training sites in operation across the prison estate by 2017,"" says Moore. So far they're working. According to the December 2012 edition of Bromley Briefings Prison Factfile, in 2011 12.5% of graduates of The Clink program re-offended. The national average was 47%. But it's not cheap. Crisci raised more than Â£300,000 ($500,000) in private funding to start the project. And it's not yet profitable. ""Each Clink restaurant operates at a loss of circa Â£150,000 ($250,000) per year due to them being training restaurants and the mentoring work which is provided to the graduates for six to 12 months after their release,"" says Moore. ""We receive financial support from philanthropic individuals, HMPS and the government. ""This, and the money from people dining in the restaurant and the purchasing of Clink products, helps to reduce the deficit."" The food . Locally grown and sourced ingredients are used whenever possible. The meats at Brixton Prison come from a local butcher, for example, while High Downs Prison supplies many of the vegetables used in the project from its own farm. Prisoners at High Down also get to apply to work toward an NVQ in Horticulture and Gardening. Dishes are contemporary and European in provenance, and the menu changes every quarter or for special events. Sample dishes for Brixton Prison include hot crab and smoked mackerel pancake rolls, herb crusted pork chops and woodland wild mushroom and artichoke lasagne. Further rehabilitation projects . Guardian columnist and convicted murderer Erwin James supports the charity. James was released in 2004 after serving 20 years of a life sentence. ""For me, there can never be enough rehabilitative initiatives in our prisons. Rehabilitation means fewer potential victims of released prisoners,"" he tells CNN via email. ""It's just a shame the government relies on charities such as The Clink to provide those initiatives. ""The Clink restaurants vastly increase the likelihood that those who take part will discover, or rediscover, the satisfaction of having a skill to provide a service that makes them feel good about themselves."" There are other charity restaurant schemes in the UK. In 2002, Jamie Oliver opened his first Fifteen restaurant in London to train unemployed young people as apprentice chefs. Fifteen restaurants have subsequently opened in Amsterdam and Cornwall. The Brigade seeks to help those who have experienced or are at risk of homelessness in London. But for some, the cost of running these schemes is too high. The Hoxton Apprentice, opened in London in 2004, closed in 2012 as the charity behind the project went into administration. The Clink Charity has no plans to expand beyond the UK. The Clink Restaurants (Brixton, Cardiff and High Downs) are available for booking at The Clink Charity.","Clink Restaurant Brixton is third and latest prison dining experience to open in UK .

"(CNN) -- A few years ago, Chicago resident Craig Benzine worked as a waiter. Now his day consists of planning, editing and posting a show for a large audience. His sound stage? His home. Benzine is part of a new breed of celebrity: the successful YouTuber. Not only that, he now makes a living just from his videos. Under the name ""Wheezy Waiter,"" Benzine puts on a regular show for 480,000 subscribers. He's part of the community of YouTube users who don't just think of the site as a place for fun videos (and with 1 billion unique users monthly, there are certainly plenty of casual viewers), but actively post to the site, putting a great deal of time and effort into entertaining their audience -- some of whom become ""Internet famous"" in the meantime. Benzine is one of the subjects of a documentary, ""Please Subscribe,"" which examines the hardcore YouTube community, which ran in theaters earlier this year and is now available streaming online. Maintaining YouTube fame and making a living . For a lot of people, the idea of becoming famous -- and even making money -- on YouTube would appear to be something that just happens overnight. But in cases like Tay Zonday - whose song ""Chocolate Rain"" went viral - that's not the whole story. Zonday was already uploading a series of videos to YouTube, when one became wildly popular, increasing his following on the site and leading to more videos. With the number of YouTube subscribers having doubled in the last year, it should come as no surprise that we're seeing more success stories like this as well. ""The people on YouTube are hard-working people, and they make a good living doing it,"" which is something that director Dan Dobi said he wanted to show with ""Please Subscribe."" That living is made through Google's AdSense program, which allows users to open their YouTube accounts to advertisers, after which Google selects the highest bidder. YouTubers get a cut of the profits. Some, according to Socialblade.com, earn millions of dollars a year. Dobi pointed out that most people on YouTube are not ""one-hit wonders."" ""'Wheezy Waiter' uploaded hundreds of videos before getting recognition. To get successful is a hustle."" ""I wish more people took the plunge into it and created an account, and realized it's not just cat videos,"" said Mitchell Davis, another subject of ""Please Subscribe,"" who posts stream of consciousness vidoes as ""LiveLavaLive,"" for his 638,500 subscribers, and then some. The nature of YouTube celebrity . At the same time, the top YouTubers have fans just like other celebrities. ""The Internet celebrity aspect is almost more of a personal thing. They come up to you, they see you on a regular basis,"" said Davis. ""Some YouTubers upload five times a day. It's like 'I know you, I was just with you yesterday.' It's just like seeing a friend."" Benzine remembers being pointed out by a woman on the street once, saying ""It's Wheezy Waiter! I love Wheezy Waiter!"" ""I expected she was going to talk to me, but they walked right past,"" he said. ""It was funny because she treated it as if I was just on her computer screen, not actually there."" Zonday, who was suddenly everywhere in 2007 with his original song ""Chocolate Rain,"" said he has gotten anecdotes from those among the video's 93 million views telling him he changed their lives. ""Their 2-year-old can't stop singing 'Chocolate Rain' at bedtime. Their grandmother loves to hear me sing 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.' They made their boss laugh by playing my 'Old Spice' video and got forgiven for being late. These are the most rewarding [things to hear]."" The Denton, Texas, YouTuber who only goes by the name Laina hit it out of the park with her very first video parodying ""Beliebers."" It made her an Internet meme for what became known as the ""Overly Attached Girlfriend"" face, which earned her more than 844,000 subscribers, a full-time YouTube career that pays her bills, and an invite to appear on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon."" ""It was the most surreal, crazy, fun experience of my entire life. Not only to be on TV, or to be on a late-night talk show, but to be on Jimmy Fallon -- a show I love and watch all the time -- that was crazy."" ""Double Rainbow"" fan Vasquez was invited to appear at a high school in Iceland after his video got 38 million views. ""They toured me around the country, made me a festival where they sang, danced, did a play, made me a mural and a throne to watch it all. The parents came out, they made me protector of the student body, decorated the school in rainbows and after the performance surrounded me, hugging and kissing me like I was a king."" And what of the other benefits? ""AdSense alone pays my phone and Internet bill,"" he said. ""I was a starving artist, for six years, prior to going viral, I made $6,000 a year or less breeding dogs, doing photography, eBay and cutting firewood. When I went viral, money started coming in from TV ads that I was in, the Gregory Bros. 'Double Rainbow' song, (which I still get checks from), licensing my videos, and public appearances."" YouTubing as a business . This experience has taught Benzine about how the business of creativity works. ""Being my own boss gives me a perspective I never had before. I understand that to be creative for a living, especially by yourself and on the Internet, you have to be able to roll with the punches, be versatile, connect with your audience, and be very prolific."" And he wishes that the public at large knew how much work went into making YouTube success happen. ""I used to sit back and critique TV and movies and YouTube much more harshly,"" he said. ""But now I fully understand the process and what it means to come up with stuff on a regular basis, and it's hard work if you want to do it for a living. I actually work more hours a day now than I ever have in my life. Luckily, I love what I do. But that's what you have to do to make this work."" Zonday -- who was posting to YouTube for four months before hitting it big and now has more than 700,000 subscribers -- said, ""I work months on some songs and videos that never see the light of day. There are other videos that take mere minutes, like my reading of Dr. Seuss."" For Laina, comedic YouTube videos come naturally. ""To be honest, most are done in a day,"" she admitted. ""I generally come up with an idea the day before, or maybe not even that early, and I write, record, and edit all in the same day. And to be honest, I've found that that's usually best."" The YouTube community - or something more? Laina draws her inspiration from the ""crazy, awesome thing"" she calls the YouTube community. ""I had no idea before I posted that first video that there was anything even close to it out there. I've met people and made friends that motivate and inspire me to make better, more creative videos every time I get to spend time with them. It's a wonderful thing, really."" Several years and many viral videos into its success though, one has to wonder, why YouTube? What has sustained this community for so many years? ""There's a deeper connection between the creator and the audience than with traditional media,"" Benzine explained. Indeed, one thing all of these YouTubers have in common is a consistent point of view and a conversational tone. ""YouTubers are often talking directly to the camera.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Officials asked workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant to evacuate temporarily Wednesday after a white cloud of smoke rose above the plant and radiation levels spiked. Workers were ""asked to withdraw to a safe area,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. Authorities later allowed them to return after radiation levels dropped, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. Radiation levels at the plant have surged and dropped repeatedly over the past few days. The most recent spike ""probably"" occurred ""because the containment vessel in reactor No. 3 has been damaged,"" a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency later told reporters. Edano said the smoke or vapor above the plant may have been caused by breach in the containment structure around the No. 3 reactor's containment vessel -- the steel and concrete shell that insulates radioactive material inside. It was the second visible sign of trouble at the earthquake-damaged nuclear plant Wednesday. Earlier in the day, firefighters battled a blaze in the plant's No. 4 reactor building -- the latest in a series of setbacks at the plant that have heightened fears about the possibility of widespread radiation contamination. The fire followed a hydrogen explosion Tuesday at the plant's No. 2 reactor. Hydrogen explosions had previously occurred in the plant's No. 1 and No. 3 reactors. Another fire had broken out Tuesday in the No. 4 reactor. While it burned, radiation levels at the plant increased to about 167 times the average dose, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. That dose quickly diminished with distance from the plant, and radiation fell back to levels where it posed no immediate public health threat, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said. But the deteriorating situation and concerns about a potential shift in wind direction that could send radiation toward populated areas prompted authorities to warn people as far as 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) from the plant to stay inside. ""There is still a very high risk of further radioactive material coming out,"" Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday, asking people to remain calm. In all, the plant holds six reactors. At the time of Friday's 9.0 earthquake off northeast Japan and subsequent tsunami, Unit 4 was shut for maintenance and all fuel from the reactor had been moved to its spent fuel pool. Units 5 and 6 were also shut at the time of the quake, but both its reactors are loaded with fuel, the IAEA said. About 200,000 people living within a 12.4-mile (20 kilometer) radius of the plant already had been evacuated. Authorities also banned flights over the area. Between Units 3 and 4, Japanese authorities said they had measured radiation dose rates of up to 400 millisieverts-per-hour, IAEA reported. That's equivalent to about 2,000 chest x-rays per hour, the agency said on its website. ""This is a high dose-level value, but it is a local value at a single location and at a certain point in time,"" it added. As a result of the monitoring of about 150 people from around the Daiichi site, 23 have been decontaminated, IAEA said. The number of nuclear workers who remained on site has been slashed from 800 to 50. ""Their situation is not great,"" said David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University. ""It's pretty clear that they will be getting very high doses of radiation. There's certainly the potential for lethal doses of radiation. They know it, and I think you have to call these people heroes."" Although the plant's three functioning reactors shut down automatically when the quake occurred, the tsunami that followed swamped the diesel generators that provided backup power to the reactor cooling systems. Crews restored backup power, but problems keeping the reactors cool forced plant officials to take the drastic step of flooding them with seawater. Still, pressure buildups, problems with valves and a failure to fill a generator's gas tank led to hydrogen explosions and other problems. Tuesday's events appeared to escalate the situation: Edano said the radiation releases from the explosion and fire were the first that appeared to pose a threat to human health, if only briefly. On Monday, an explosion in the building housing the plant's No. 2 reactor apparently damaged both a water-filled chamber at the base of the reactor and the reactor containment unit itself, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano told reporters Tuesday. Damage to the core involved about 5% of its nuclear fuel, Amano said. It was unclear how much radioactive material may have been emitted, what kind of health threat that could pose or when the danger would end. ""There are enormous quantities of radiation,"" said Dr. Ira Helfand, a member of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which opposes the use of nuclear power. ""The containment is not nearly as good as around the reactor cores themselves.  The potential for a major release of radiation from those sites is very real, as we saw last night with the fire."" Japanese officials told the IAEA that radioactivity had been released ""directly into the atmosphere"" during Tuesday's fire in the No. 4 reactor, the U.N. watchdog organization said. Crews put that fire out, and by Tuesday afternoon, Edano said, radiation readings -- which had reached dangerously high levels at the plant earlier -- had decreased. Still, concerns about radioactive fuel boiling off its coolant and igniting continued Wednesday. Plant operators and government officials initially considered using helicopters to drop water into the cooling pond through the damaged roof of the reactor building, but rejected the idea when they discovered that the spent fuel pond was too far from the hole in the roof, a Kyodo News report said. In addition, Edano said, cooling systems at two other reactors, No. 5 and No. 6, were ""not functioning well."" Plant managers were considering removing panels from the buildings housing those reactors in an effort to prevent the hydrogen buildup that officials believe caused the other explosions, the IAEA said. Edano said earlier that he could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at all three troubled reactors at the plant. A meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods cannot be cooled and melt the steel and concrete structure containing them. In the worst-case scenario, the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread radioactivity through the air and water. That, public health officials say, can cause both immediate and long-term health problems, including radiation poisoning and cancer. If fuel rods inside the reactors are melting, ""the million-dollar question is whether that melting will be contained,"" said James Walsh, a CNN contributor and research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's security studies program. At present, the long-term impact on public health from the crisis appears minimal, Brenner said. ""I think, at this point in time, there's no real evidence that there are health risks to the general population,"" he said. The weather has emerged as a key variable, but on Wednesday morning, winds were blowing out to sea, CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris said. Radiation levels in Tokyo, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of the plant, were twice the usual level on Tuesday. But the concentration -- 0.809 microsieverts per hour -- posed no health threat, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said. CNN's Stan Grant, Steven Jiang, Sabriya Rice and Richard Greene contributed to this report.","Authorities say latest smoke spotted may be caused by containment vessel breach .

"(CNN) -- The 2014 Formula One season may have only just got going, but Ferrari is already playing catch up. That's the view of technical director James Allison, who admits the legendary Italian marque is some way behind early pacesetters Mercedes, labeling Ferrari's performance in Sunday's opening race as ""unacceptable."" While Mercedes enjoyed a fruitful preseason and took the checkered flag at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix through Nico Rosberg, Ferrari struggled by comparison. Double world champion Fernando Alonso was the team's highest-placed driver in fourth position, but the Spaniard finished over 30 seconds behind the victorious Rosberg. ""While we can take some satisfaction from the reliability shown by the F14T, it is clear that we have our work cut out to improve our car in order to compete on equal terms with the Mercedes team,"" Allen told the team's official website. Alonso finished Sunday's race in fifth position, but he was elevated to fourth place after Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo -- who crossed the line in second -- was disqualified for breaching fuel flow regulations. Finland's Kimi Raikkonen, who is starting his second spell as a Ferrari driver after winning the team's last drivers' championship in 2007, finished seventh. Like every team on the grid, Ferrari has had to contend with a raft of regulation changes introduced by the sport's rule makers for the 2014 season -- including the introduction of 1.6-liter V6 hybrid engines. Allison says his team is still coming to terms with the new rules, but he's backed Ferrari to come back stronger than ever. ""With all the new regulations this year, the opportunities to improve the car are legion and we can expect the race to improve the cars to be even more intense than normal,"" he added. ""Our competitiveness was not acceptable in Melbourne, but we intend to fight our way back up the grid with the improvements that we will bring to the car."" Meanwhile the FIA, the body which governs F1, has announced its satisfaction with the fuel-flow meter which prompted Ricciardo's disqualification from the Melbourne race. Ricciardo was disqualified post-race after it was discovered his car had exceeded the maximum fuel-flow rate of 100kg/hour. Allowing fuel to flow faster than permitted rate would give the driver an unfair power advantage over his competitors. The meter's manufacturers Gil Sensors have received ""positive feedback"" from the FIA. If Red Bull wishes to appeal the punishment, it must do so by midday on Thursday. Ricciardo will be back on the track for the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 30.","Ferrari is playing catch up, admits the team's technical director .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a former San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit officer's claim of immunity in the shooting death of Oscar Grant, clearing the way for the 22-year-old's father to sue over the controversial killing on a train platform. Johannes Mehserle was convicted of fatally shooting Grant in the back on New Year's Day in 2009 as he lay on a platform at the Fruitvale BART Station in Oakland, a case that is recounted in the award-winning movie ""Fruitvale Station."" The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Mehserle's claim that ""the facts overwhelmingly show that he was acting consistently within the legitimate law enforcement objective of arresting Grant,"" upholding a lower court ruling that found there was a ""genuine issue"" as to whether the former officer's actions were required for a legitimate law enforcement purpose. Mehserle testified at his 2010 trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun. He was sentenced to two years in prison after his involuntary manslaughter conviction but was released after serving 11 months because of a California law that allowed him to reduce his sentence to nearly a year. The shooting gained national attention in large part because it was captured on an onlooker's cell phone video camera. The video showed Mehserle pulling his gun and shooting Grant in the back as another officer appeared to be kneeling down over the unarmed man. The video was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred months of protests in and around Oakland. Violent protests erupted after Mehserle's sentence was handed down, with at least 150 people arrested by the police. The case has continued to draw interest and questions, with first-time director Ryan Coogler tackling the story in the independent film ""Fruitvale Station"" that was released this year. The film chronicles the last day of Grant's life. The movie made its premiere at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it took home the U.S. Grand Jury Prize and an Audience Award. It went on to win the award for Best First Film at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. Coogler wrote the film, which stars Michael B. Jordan, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Durand and Chad Michael Murray.

"(CNN) -- Family members and friends of billionaire Richard Branson, including actress Kate Winslet, were taking stock of their blessings after their narrow escape from the business magnate's burning Caribbean island home, which had been ignited by a lightning strike. ""I'm just so glad that everyone is safe. And this very easily could not have been the case,"" Winslet said in a news release Wednesday, two days after fire destroyed the house on Necker Island, the 74-acre private island the Virgin Group chairman owns in the British Virgin Islands. Said Winslet: ""I will never forget Richard placing his arms around both my children as we were watching the flames, and saying, 'At the end of the day, what you realize is that all that matters is the people that you love. Everything else is just stuff. And none of that stuff matters.'"" Winslet was one of about 20 people who were in the house when lightning -- from a storm spawned as Hurricane Irene was passing through the Caribbean -- struck the house at around 4 a.m. and set the house ablaze, Branson said in a statement after the incident. Branson said Winslet helped carry his 90-year-old mother to safety. Branson's daughter, Holly, was quoted as saying she awoke that morning to shouting, ""which was hard to hear over the howling hurricane winds and rain, but I knew instantly something was wrong. I went downstairs to be met by my older cousins, Ned and Jack, who were shouting for everyone to get out. I looked down the corridor to see a raging fire in the main room. ""The flames were quickly spreading to where everyone was sleeping, and we knew instantly the urgency to get everyone to safety,"" Holly Branson said. ""Once we knew everyone was out of the house, I ran into the office to call the manager to let him know what was happening. As us Bransons are renowned for practical jokes, he didn't believe me at first."" She said she ""ran as fast as I could barefoot in the winds and rain to get to my mum and dad to let them know we were OK; I hated the thought of them worrying."" Branson's son, Sam, said that all he could see when he woke up ""was a huge ball of flames and a giant orange glow reflecting off the rain."" ""I thought everyone inside was being burned alive,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe my eyes. I ran barefoot over cacti, through the hurricane-force winds, all I could think was I've got to try and save what was left of my family, and did my best not to break down."" He said he found out they were safe, ""but the feeling of shock remained."" Richard Branson, who said he plans to rebuild the house, spoke of an encouraging encounter on Wednesday: . ""The day after the fire, Kate, myself and my children Holly and Sam went up to the ruins of what was the Great House,"" he said. ""To our absolute delight walking across the ashes was Necker's pet tortoise, ET. ... None of us could understand how anything could have survived that inferno, and ET will have pride of place in the new Great House once it's built."" The island had been featured on such TV programs as ""MTV Cribs,"" and TV personalities Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo were recently married on the island.","Branson's home in British Virgin Islands burns down after being struck by lightning .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A foul smell permeating London and parts of England over the past two days is due to farmers on the European continent spreading manure in their fields, forecasters and British farmers said Saturday. Experts say the inescapable farmland smell permeating London will stick around for a couple of days. The agricultural odor is inescapable in central London and smells vaguely of farmland or even garbage. Forecasters said a stiff breeze from the east is carrying the smell across the North Sea from Belgium, the Netherlands and even Germany. They said the smell is likely to hang around through the weekend as the easterly wind continues. ""You can't say it's going to smell for two days, but the wind is coming in from the same direction,"" said Chris Almond, a forecaster with the Met Office, Britain's weather service. ""It's not really until Monday, Tuesday that we'll see a change in the wind direction, with a more marked improvement in air quality."" He said the smell had probably been stagnating in those countries for a few days, resulting in a more pungent aroma once the winds brought it to England. The National Farmers' Union blamed the smell on the muck-spreading by Dutch farmers, who it said are banned from the practice in the winter and are now spreading it ""en masse."" Although the smell may be unusual, the phenomenon of European air spilling its contents over England is not, forecasters have said. ""We quite often get pollution in the form of haze coming over when we've got these winds from [an] easterly direction, particularly when the winds are coming off the near-continent,"" he said. Almond said the smell is in much of central and eastern England, and has reached as far west as Devon, on the southwestern tip of England, where his office is located. London newspapers reported the smell on their front pages Friday afternoon, with one paper branding it ""Le Stink."" The farmers' union used the odor to make its case against a similar winter ban proposed on muck-spreading in Britain. ""This is what happens when farmers are forced to empty their slurry store all in one go at the same time instead of being able to apply it little and often during the winter,"" spokesman Anthony Gibson said. ""While we are obviously very sorry for any unpleasantness caused to people living in the South East, we are grateful to the Dutch farmers for laying on such a pungent demonstration of what could happen every spring here in the UK if the government presses ahead with its ill-conceived proposal to implement a blanket ban on winter slurry spreading across most or all of the country.""

"(CNN) -- After facing a long list of charges including sexual assault, Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair agreed to plead guilty this week to much lesser charges in a case involving sexual misconduct in the military -- one in which politics may have gotten in the way of justice. On display was a military legal system, apparently eager to show it was getting tough on sexual misconduct cases, that instead bungled the case. On Thursday, Sinclair was sentenced. He received a reprimand and has to forfeit some pay. But he got no jail time. His sentence is a mockery of military justice, a slap on the wrist nowhere close to being proportional to his offenses. But the Sinclair case is not typical of most military sexual assault cases. Sinclair had a three-year relationship and allegedly forced sex with a female captain under his command. The prosecution was problematic partly because the accuser may have told lies and partly because senior military officers may have brought harsher than usual charges. We don't want commanders feeling that they need to appear tough on sexual assault by bringing charges that aren't warranted -- just as we don't want them sweeping them under the rug. This is another example of what happens when a system is reliant on people who are not legal experts, rather than on trained independent prosecutors. Despite the problems with this particular case, we need to confront the bigger issue with the military prosecution system in cases of sexual assault and misconduct. There are an estimated 26,000 sexual assaults a year in the military -- but reporting is low, courts-martial are rare and the conviction rate is less than 1%. The vast majority of sexual assault and rape cases in the military show a pattern of suppression, where if a report is made the victim fears retaliation and the loss of his or her job. For example, the scandal at Lackland Air Force Base has seen 33 basic training instructors investigated for misconduct allegations involving 63 recruits and trainees, none of whom reported they were sexually assaulted. Survivors don't report because they fear they won't get justice and that their attackers will go unpunished. Federal law for the military -- the Uniform Code of Military Justice -- was created with the intent of preventing arbitrary punishments by generals and colonels. But leaving sexual assault and rape cases in the hands of commanders to prosecute creates a fundamental conflict of interest that undermines service members' due process rights. Until the decision to prosecute is taken away from commanding officers, the military justice system is simply not credible. For more than three years now I have taken to the House floor and told the stories of the men and women in our armed forces who have been sexually assaulted. Many of these stories involved commanders who undermined investigations, refused to bring a case to court-martial, or overturned a case after a jury had found the perpetrator guilty and a jail sentence was issued. Some opponents of reform continue to claim that commanders must be the sole decision-makers on whether a case moves forward to trial. Keep in mind the countless stories in the press of legitimate cases not making it to trial or sentences being lessened or thrown out completely -- all at the whim of the commander. Of course there is also the fact that the entire military structure rests on the shoulders of individuals with no legal training. Commanders are the linchpin of the military justice system. Just last month, a deluge of sex crime reports in Japan involving American military personnel were revealed thanks to multiple Freedom of Information Act requests made by The Associated Press. The data reveal how broken the military scales of justice truly are, and offer a rare glimpse into how reports of sexual assaults are handled. Of the 1,000 reports, punishments were wildly inconsistent, and of the suspects determined to be guilty, nearly two-thirds spent no time in jail at all. In more than 30 cases, a letter of reprimand was the only punishment. What is clear from these cases is that commanders were part of the problem, not the solution. Commanders often decided to not move forward with courts-martial, but when they did -- even with DNA evidence and tape-recorded confessions of rape -- the predators were typically given mild punishments after pleading to lesser charges. Commanders also lessened numerous punishments unilaterally and in two cases threw out guilty verdicts and punishments completely. My bipartisan legislation, the STOP Act, will take sexual assault and rape cases out of the chain of command and put them into the hands of civilian and military legal experts. This is a system that some are hellbent on protecting. But I intend to fight this year with every fiber of my being to get the House to act on fixing this broken system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jackie Speier.","Jackie Speier: The military legal system bungled the case of Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair .

"(CNN) -- Pizza joints, sushi bars, ""British"" pubs, curry houses and Thai restaurants rule in Cyprus's sprawling resort areas, far outnumbering humble Cypriot places. But you can find true indigenous dining in urban parts such as Limassol, Larnaca or Nicosia if you follow groups of determined-looking Cypriots around lunch or dinnertime. The search is easier if you head for the hills, to smaller villages with fewer visitors. Either way, you'll find menus that blend flavors inherited from Greece, Venice, Turkey and the Middle East. Spices such as cumin, cinnamon and coriander enrich many dishes. Cypriot cooks also use lots of wild and foraged ingredients, including greens such as kapari (wild capers), the tiny snails called karaoli and game including rabbit, hare and partridge. 1. Meze time . A meze meal is a great way to sample the best of Cypriot food at one sitting. Meze isn't unique to Cyprus -- the tradition of serving a generous array of small savory dishes is common all over the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. But many of the individual meze dishes you'll find in Cyprus are peculiar to the island. A typical meze table begins with dips such as tahini, pickles, stuffed vine leaves and cold bean salads. Grilled halloumi cheese will likely follow, along with spicy sausages such as loukanika, often simmered in red wine. Then comes more meat -- grilled on the spit, skewered or barbecued over charcoal. Pork gets top billing, but lamb and chicken play supporting roles. A meze that mixes fish and meat is heresy, so if you have a yen for something maritime, you must seek out a taverna that specializes in seafood. Here, the platters will be piled with fried or grilled red mullet, whitebait, shrimp, fried baby squid and octopus or cuttlefish simmered in red wine and spices. Tip: pacing is essential. It's all too easy to eat your fill from the first round, leaving no room for dishes to follow. A great meze comprises at least 20 dishes -- it should take all evening to polish them off. Top places to spend a meze evening include 7 St George's Tavern (Yeroskepos, Paphos; +357 2696 3176; reservations essential) in Geroskipou, just a few kilometers from downtown Paphos. In Nicosia, many residents say the lountza and haloumi at Mezostrati (Evagorou 31; +357 2266 2727) are the best in town. 2. Karaoli yahni . The tiny wild snails called karaoli emerge in vast numbers with the autumn rains. They're especially common in the Akamas peninsula, the island's wild western tip, where they're gathered by the bucket-load and served simmered in tomato sauce. A good place to try them is at Kouppas Stone Castle (Neo Chorio, Akamas; +357 2632 2526) in the old fashioned stone village of Neo Chorio, five kilometers south of the fishing harbor at Lakki. 3. Koupepia . Tender young vine leaves are at their best in spring, when they're used to wrap minced lamb or pork and rice to make this typical snack, served hot or cold. In winter, cabbage leaves are used instead of vine leaves. 4. Poikilia . A glass of Cypriot wine or zivania (grape spirit) should rarely be served alone. It usually comes accompanied by an assortment of savory dishes -- poikilia. Among the best are cold cuts such as tsamarella (sun-cured goat thigh), hiromeri (pork thigh marinated in wine, then pressed and wood-smoked) or pastourma, Cyprus's take on salt beef. 5. Afelia . Cypriot food isn't all about small plates -- hearty eaters will be more than satisfied. Pork plays a leading role in traditional cuisine, and afelia can claim to be the country's signature dish. Lean chunks of pork are marinated in red wine, flavored with cumin, cinnamon and coriander, then simmered in a clay casserole until meltingly tender. 6. Sheftalia . Sheftalia are herb-flavored sausages of minced pork or lamb, which often anchor a meze platter but are also served as a meaty main course. Esteemed for its sausages is Agrino (Lofos village, 12 kilometers north of Limassol; +357 2581 3777), the gourmet restaurant at Apokryfo, a boutique hotel in a hill village above Limassol. 7. Kolokasi . A dish unique to Cyprus, kolokasi (taro) has been grown here since Roman times. Chunks of taro root are simmered with chicken or pork in a sauce of caramelized tomatoes, onions and celery, spiked with lemon juice and served with olives and radishes. It's also often made without meat for the Lenten fast. 8. Oktapodi krasato . You're never far from the sea in Cyprus and seafood restaurants abound. Many are mediocre, serving farmed and frozen fish to unwary tourists. For something distinctively Cypriot, there are places offering dishes such as oktapodi krasato -- chunks of tenderized octopus spiced with coriander and cumin and simmered in red wine. Zephyros (Piyale Pasa 37, Larnaca; +357 2465 7198), where the seafood comes straight from the little harbor right next door, is a good choice. 9. Vegetarian dishes . The Cypriot menu is meat-heavy, but -- because devout Orthodox Christians eschew meat during Lent -- there are plenty of veggie options, including anthous (courgette flowers stuffed with rice and feta cheese) and louvi me lahana (black eyed beans served cold with wild greens, oil and lemon juice) and dips, such as tahini. Vasiliki (Digeni Akrita 28a, Nicosia; +357 2234 9803; lunch only) has a good array of dips, pulses, salads and other vegetarian dishes. 10. Ravioles . Ravioles are part of the culinary legacy left by the Venetians, who ruled Cyprus from 1489 to 1571. Similar to Italian ravioli, these pasta parcels are stuffed with haloumi cheese, then simmered in chicken broth. Delicious, and filling, they're especially good at Erinias restaurant (Archbishop Kyprianos 64A, Nicosia, +357 224 22860). 11. Pasteli . And so to sweet things. Anogyra is the place to find sticky toffee called pasteli that's still made the old way from the juice pressed from the carob bean. It's known as mavros chrysos (""black gold""). The Pasteli Museum (daily, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.; +357 2522 2357) tells the story of carob growing in Cyprus, and you can sample and buy pasteli and other carob items in the nearby Pasteli Factory (+357 2522 1500).

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old who was stabbed to death in South Africa is the victim of ""corrective rape,"" gay rights activists said Thursday, a crime where men attack lesbians in an attempt to reverse their sexual orientation. Noxolo Nogwaza was attacked late last month after dropping off her girlfriend in Kwa-Thema township near Johannesburg. She was raped, stabbed with broken glass several times and her face pummelled with rocks, Human Rights Watch said. ""A beer bottle, a large rock and used condoms were found on and near her body,"" the rights group said. Earlier this week, the nation's Justice Ministry set up a task force to address hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender South Africans. The task team was set up after activists worldwide signed an online petition demanding the South African government act to halt the attacks. The call to petition intensified after Nogwaza's killing. Police in Gauteng province, where the township is located, said they have not found any evidence of a hate crime and an investigation is under way. But some gay rights activists disagree. ""Her attack is a case of corrective rape,"" said gay rights activist Lydia Kunu. ""Neighbors said they heard her attackers telling her, 'We will take the lesbian out of you. ' They were mocking her and asking her why she acts like a man."" Kunu is a community networking organizer for Ekurhuleni Pride Organizing Committee, where Nogwaza worked as well. The death has sparked renewed calls for action as rights groups warn of escalated homophobic attacks. ""In these cases, killing is the end of the spectrum,"" said Siphokazi Mthathi, the South Africa director for Human Rights Watch. ""It follows a trail of other problems -- rape, violence, problem accessing health care and violation by police."" Mthathi said it is hard to get an overall number of the people subjected to violence because attacks go unreported over the distrust for the judicial system. ""There's a great deal of under-representation because they are going to face secondary victimization,"" she said. ""We've heard of cases where when they report a rape, the police tell them, 'aren't you happy that you got a real man for a change.'"" The use of the term ""corrective rape"" started three years ago after the rape and murder of Eudy Simelane, a well-known soccer player who lived openly as a lesbian. Nogwaza's attack is similar to the soccer player's in some ways: police say they were both raped and stabbed to death. And just like Nogwaza, Simelane's body was dumped in a public place in the same township . Two men were found guilty in the soccer star's death and sentenced to prison terms, but the judges quashed any motions linking her attack to her sexual orientation. ""Nogwaza's death is the latest in a long series of sadistic crimes against lesbians, gay men, and transgender people in South Africa,"" said Dipika Nath, researcher in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights program at Human Rights Watch. ""Police and other South African officials fail to acknowledge that members of the LGBT community are raped, beaten and killed simply because of how they look or identify, and they are attacked by men who then walk freely, boasting of their exploits,"" said Nath. A police spokesman slammed the accusations, and said authorities are working to ensure safety for all. ""It is our responsibility to provide safety, and we take that job seriously,"" said Col. Tshisikhawe Ndou, the provincial spokesman for Gauteng. The spokesman said there have been no arrests in Nogwaza's killing, but investigations are under way. ""We're following some leads, and in this specific case, we'd like to ask anyone with information to contact the police,"" he said. ""They can even do so anonymously if they are scared."" Outspoken gay rights activists have faced harassment and attacks in the nation, Human Rights Watch said. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, based on rules left over from the British colonial era when sodomy laws were introduced. However, the post-apartheid constitution bans prejudice against gays in South Africa, the first African nation to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Despite the law, attacks based on sexual orientation are still going on, rights groups said. The new task force is scheduled to start working in July. It will address issues such as whether police and social workers should undergo sensitivity training, and whether rapists who target sexual minorities should get harsher sentences. Mthathi said having the anti-prejudicial constitution in place is an indicator that the task force alone won't resolve underlying problems. ""South Africa is a very misogynist and homophobic society,"" she said. ""We welcome the task team, but it won't solve social problems. We need to address the culture of accountability in judicial and social institutions, we need to address the attitudes ... disrupt the culture of impunity.""","She is attacked after dropping off her girlfriend in a township near Johannesburg .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's top prosecutor says divers have recovered the remains of five people from the wreckage of an airplane that Italian fashion mogul Vitorrio Missoni was flying in earlier this year. Investigators are still collecting DNA samples and other information necessary to identify the bodies, Attorney General Luisa Ortega told reporters. The plane disappeared on January 4 as it left the Caribbean archipelago of Los Roques for the international airport outside Caracas, about 90 miles away. Missoni, his wife, and four others -- including a pilot and copilot -- were on board. All are presumed dead. Weeks after the small aircraft disappeared, a family spokeswoman said a bag from the plane had been discovered on the Caribbean island of Curacao. Search teams spotted the wreckage in June, 13 nautical miles from Gran Roque island and nearly 250 feet underwater. Crews combed the wreckage site last week in three dives to recover remains and other material from the wreckage, Ortega said. The attorney general met with family members of the Venezuelan victims of the crash on Monday to report on the progress of the investigation. They extracted the remains of five bodies, she said, but could not obtain any samples from the sixth body because it was in a location that was difficult to reach. Crews also recovered flight information, which will be used to determine what caused the plane crash, Ortega said. Missoni, 58, ran the famed Missoni fashion house with his siblings, Luca and Angela. Neither sibling was on the plane. The fashion house, which boasts such celebrity clients as Katie Holmes, Cameron Diaz and Nicole Richie, is a high-end label known for its patterned knitwear and signature zigzag stripe. The private company, based in Milan, Italy, has estimated annual sales of between $75 million and $100 million. The brand, created in 1953 as a knitwear workshop in Gallarte, Italy, has expanded from apparel to housewares, a fragrance line and a chain of hotels. Missoni and his siblings took over the brand in 1996 with an eye toward marketing to a younger consumer. The fashion house partnered with Target in 2011 to produce a more budget-friendly collection for the discount retailer, which caused Target's website to crash because of the high demand.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The snow was here, two weeks ago. With just a smattering of white, it wreaked havoc on the South. But it may have been just an opening round. Now, an ice storm is hitting. And matched with snow, it's the heavyweight of the two. Weather mavens expect up to an inch of ice will give broad swaths of the South a good shellacking. An inch doesn't sound impressive? A foot of snow may look big and bad, but it's a bunch of fluff compared to a solid inch of ice. Here's why: . It's heavier . For starters, ice weighs much, much more. That branch hanging over your roof with a shiny glaze of ice might as well be piled high with nearly three feet of snow. ""Ice increases the weight of branches by about 30 times compared to snow,"" said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri. Got about half an inch of ice on your power lines? Depending upon distance between the telephone poles holding them, it can add about 500 pounds to a line, Javaheri said. How bad will this get? And when laden branches crash down on those wires, a lot of lights go out. That's how more than 500,000 homes lost power in the Storm of 2000, as it's known in the South. And it took days to get them back on line. Given that, what's rolling up on the horizon now does not bode well for the grid. ""When you're talking about that amount of ice we're looking at, it's catastrophic,"" Georgia Power emergency chief Aaron Strickland. ""It's pricey and messy,"" Javaheri said. ""A 1998 ice storm in northern New England caused over a billion dollars in damage."" It's slicker . Ever wonder why we call them ""snow tires"" and not ""ice tires""? People in places that get a lot of snow know this: You can drive on it. ""Snow packs down. It's a little like brittle, it breaks up as you drive on it,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Kurt Van Speybroeck said. ""If you get even a 10th of an inch of ice on a road, it's like a skating rink."" Yes, snow-covered roads kill. But the bigger culprit in any snow storm is ice. As cars travel across the snow, the heat from the tires melts it. When the cold weather refreezes it, the flakes compact into a thin sheet of ice. That's exactly what happened in Atlanta two weeks ago. It wasn't the snow. It was the thin layer of ice that turned a metropolitan area of 6 million into a parking lot. Stir-crazy? How to stay sane . Worse still is freezing rain, which makes for a motorist's arch nemesis -- black ice. You think it's dry road, but it's not. And by the time you notice, it's way too late. It's destructive . Ice on roads also leaves behind scars when it's gone. It flows into cracks and crevices as water -- on and under street surfaces, for example -- and then it freezes hard like stone. Why not put power lines underground? In the process, it expands and can break things. Potholes result. Take the ice storm that hit northern Texas in December. It left hundreds of potholes on roads, highways and interstates. Around the same time, auto body shops in northern Texas also talked of seeing repairs surge -- from wheels tally-whacked out of alignment to busted mufflers. It lingers . Icy danger lingers longer, because ice holds on longer than snow, Javaheri said. Ever notice those piles of snow in yards and parking lots that need days more to melt after the rest of the snow is long gone? Most snow gets dirty after a day or two, which makes it absorb more of the sun's rays and melt quicker, Javaheri said. Ice is solid and hardly takes in dirt. So it reflects much of the sun's rays and, as a result, melts more slowly.","Ice adds much more weight to branches and power lines .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee has launched a review of the Bush administration's controversial interrogation and detention program. Newly appointed CIA Director Leon Panetta says review should not target CIA interrogators. The purpose of the review is to fully understand the program and to help ""shape detention and interrogation policies in the future,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the committee, and Sen. Kit Bond, the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement Thursday. The Senate study will run parallel to one ordered by President Obama shortly after he took office. Obama wants to know whether any of the harsh interrogation methods used against suspected terrorists held by the CIA should be retained. The so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" included waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is considered torture by the new administration. Bush officials repeatedly insisted detainees were not tortured during questioning. The Senate review will look at how the CIA determined detainees knew valuable information and whether the coercive techniques used against them resulted in gaining information that stopped terrorist attacks. The study will also examine whether the agency accurately described the scope of the program to the Office of Legal Counsel and the Senate oversight committee, and if the program was in compliance with legal opinions and policy. The announcement comes the day after the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman called for the establishment of a nonpartisan ""commission of inquiry"" to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against former Bush administration officials in their prosecution of the war on terrorism. Nothing ""did more to damage America's place in the world than the revelation that our great nation stretched the law and the bounds of executive power to authorize torture and cruel treatment,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy said at the start of a committee hearing. CIA Director Leon Panetta said last week he would cooperate with any congressional reviews. ""I think that we have a responsibility to be transparent on these issues and to provide them [congressional committees] that information,"" Panetta said. But Panetta said the reviews should not target the CIA interrogators. ""I would not support, obviously, an investigation or a prosecution of those individuals"" involved in the interrogation program,"" Panetta said. ""They did their job, they did it pursuant to the guidance that was provided them, whether you agreed or disagreed with it."" In a letter to the CIA staff on Thursday, Panetta said Feinstein and Bond made it clear to him the goal of the review is not to punish anyone. ""They assure me that this review is a way for the committee to assess lessons learned from the program while our government devises a new interrogation policy,"" wrote the CIA director. The Senate review is expected to take about a year to complete. No public hearings are planned.","Review will look at how CIA concluded detainees knew valuable information .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the most frightening scenario facing Manchester United is that however bad this season has been, it could get a whole lot worse. Embarrassed by great rival Liverpool on Sunday, light years behind in the race for the English Premier League title and on the cusp of European humiliation, it has been a year to forget for those so used to success. Since Alex Ferguson stepped aside after winning the club's 20th league title, his replacement David Moyes has presided over one of the most painful periods in the club's recent history. On Wednesday, the nadir awaits -- the possibility of exiting the Champions League at the last-16 stage to Greek side Olympiakos. Without a massive turnaround in domestic fortunes, the three-time European champion will not qualify for the continent's top club competition next season unless it wins this year's edition -- a task which looks improbable given recent performances. Not since 1995-96 has United failed to qualify for the Champions League -- but that reality could soon come to fruition. Olympiakos will arrive at Old Trafford in confident mood after winning the first leg 2-0, according to the visiting team's adviser Christian Karembeu. Karembeu, who won the Champions League on two occasions as a player with Real Madrid, says the runaway Greek Super League leader is relishing the opportunity of causing a big upset. ""The first victory was a revolution and everyone was talking about us and it made a big impact,"" the 1998 World Cup winner told CNN. ""For us it is already a big step we have made and we are proud of what we've done. ""I used to tell the team that nothing is easy and it's not done yet because it's going to be tough at Old Trafford. ""It's going to be dangerous but we have to focus on what we've done, what we can do better, and hopefully we can repeat those performances."" United, which has won all three home matches in this year's Champions League, lost in the round of 16 last season after being beaten at Old Trafford by Real Madrid. Olympiakos is aiming to make the last eight for the first time since 1999, and with the domestic title already wrapped up, a foray into the later stages of the Champions League would provide some extra end-of-season excitement. Not that Karembeu is getting ahead of himself -- Olympiakos has never won at Old Trafford and managed just one away victory in qualifying for the knockout stage. ""Manchester United is a big, famous club but that was only the first battle,"" the former France international said. ""The foundation and philosophy is still there but it's normal there are many changes. ""Hopefully United will stay like that but I think they'll come back again.""","Manchester United faces Champions League exit .

"(CNN) -- Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos borrowed from Dr. Evil's master plan for the technology behind his newly announced Kindle Touch e-reader: It uses frickin' laser beams. Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen. It costs $189 for a version with 3G cellular connectivity or $139 with Wi-Fi only. For a version with ads, those prices drop to $149 and $99, respectively. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous Kindle models, saying conventional touch displays produce reflections. A major selling point for the Kindle is that it can be read in direct sunlight like a printed book, an argument Amazon has used in Kindle ads poking fun at tablets. ""The current technology for touch screens -- it's called capacitive touch -- is a layer that goes on top of that display. It adds glare,"" Bezos said in an interview last year on the ""Charlie Rose"" TV talk show. ""We want a device that's uncompromised for reading."" Capacitive touch is what's used in most smartphones and tablets, including virtually all Android devices, the iPhone, iPad and newer BlackBerrys. It's also the technology embedded in Amazon's new $199 Kindle Fire, a multimedia tablet. Applying a capacitive-touch layer to e-ink, the black-and-white display that looks like paper, darkens the screen, said Sriram Peruvemba, an executive for E Ink, the company that makes the popular screens in e-readers, in an interview on Wednesday. For that reason, the Kindle Touch relies on infrared sensors, which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user's finger touches a particular spot on the device's face, an Amazon spokeswoman said. Tapping on most parts of the screen turns pages, rather than clicking a button like on the other Kindles. Amazon says the sensors allow for multitouch usage, meaning people can move multiple fingers at once to manipulate the screen, much like other touchscreen gadgets. Despite its success with the market-leading Kindle, Amazon isn't the first to apply these invisible lasers, commonly used in TV remotes, to reading devices. Barnes & Noble implemented the same technology to bring touch screen capability to its Nook. Sony's recent e-readers, including a new model that will hit stores next month, also have infrared on their bezels. In an interview last month, Phil Lubell, a Sony vice-president, boasted about the company's innovation in that area and said Barnes & Noble had copied it. Amazon's competitors appear committed to this touch screen technology, going so far as to shelve button-operated e-readers. Amazon will continue to sell two versions of the Kindle without touch screens. The base model, called simply Kindle, ranges from $79 to $109 and has only a few buttons. Another, Kindle Keyboard, costs $99 to $139 and looks just like its predecessor, the Kindle 3. Touch features sap a device's battery life, Peruvemba said. Amazon may have accounted for that by including a bigger battery on the Touch because that model lasts for two months, which is double the battery life of the smaller Kindle, according to Amazon's specification page. Bezos is confident a market exists for both his touch screen and keyboard models. ""We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch,"" Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday. ""We're going to sell many millions of these.""","Amazon's Kindle Touch uses infrared sensors to avoid screen glare .
Jeff Bezos had previously said no to touch screen Kindles due to limitations .

"(CNN) -- A man believed to have been exposed to the deadly poison ricin in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Nevada, is out of his coma and is being questioned by authorities, FBI Special Agent David Staretz said Friday. Ricin, guns and an ""anarchist-type textbook"" were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel, police say. Staretz would not comment further on Roger Bergendorff, 57, who authorities said was taken to a hospital February 14 after complaining of breathing difficulties. He is listed in critical condition, said Naomi Jones, spokeswoman for Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas. Bergendorff, an artist who neighbors said had lived in his cousin's basement before moving to Las Vegas, was exposed to the poison in a Las Vegas extended-stay hotel, a law enforcement official said. The Riverton, Utah, home where Bergendorff previously lived belongs to Thomas Tholen, who along with his wife and daughter tested negative for ricin, according to authorities. That home and three storage areas in nearby West Jordan, Utah, were searched for ricin earlier this month and declared safe by authorities. A relative who went to Bergendorff's hotel room after he was sent to the hospital found the substance and alerted police February 27. Ricin is a poison that can be made from waste left over after processing castor beans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can come in the form of a mist or pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid, the agency said. E-mail to a friend .","Roger Bergendorff thought exposed to ricin in Nevada hotel room .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Sunday used his annual commemoration of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, to underscore his administration's repeated argument that the Iranian government is on the wrong side of the popular, pro-democracy movement sweeping across the region. ""We all know that these movements for change are not unique to these last few months,"" stated Obama in a Sunday press release. ""The same forces that swept across Tahrir Square were seen in Azadi Square in June of 2009."" Tehran's Azadi Square was the site of massive anti-government protests following the controversial re-election of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, for whom, opponents claimed, the contest was rigged. Pro-government paramilitary forces violently suppressed the demonstration and dozens of people were killed. Likewise, recent Iranian protests inspired by the Egyptian and Tunisian revolts have been stymied by force. ""Just as the people of the region have insisted that they have a choice in how they are governed, so do the governments of the region have a choice in their response,"" Obama stated. ""So far, the Iranian government has responded by demonstrating that it cares far more about preserving its own power than respecting the rights of the Iranian people."" With the collapse of autocratic governments in Egypt and Tunisia and amid the threat pro-democracy uprisings pose to others, the Obama administration has repeatedly sought to portray Ahmadinejad's government as a hypocritical and meaner sibling of other repressive and dictatorial Middle Eastern regimes. The U.S. has accused the Iranian government of hypocrisy for comparing the Tunisia and Cairo uprisings to Iran's own 1979 Islamic revolution, while crushing its own protesters. In Obama's 2011 Sunday commemoration of Nowruz, the president addressed only the Iranian people and not their government. The message was also specifically aimed at young people. ""You, the young people of Iran -- carry within you both the ancient greatness of Persian civilization, and the power to forge a country that is responsive to your aspirations,"" Obama stated. ""And though times may seem dark, I want you to know that I am with you."" In 2009, Obama told Iran's leaders that his administration was seeking ""engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect."" In 2010, the president chided the Iranian government for its violent suppression of peaceful demonstrators. ""You have refused good-faith proposals from the international community,"" Obama stated in 2010, referring to Iran's aspirations to develop nuclear power. In his 2011 statement, Obama never strayed from referring to the Iranian government in the third person. The president excoriated the Iranian government for waging a campaign of ""intimidation and abuse,"" including jailing hundreds of activists, silencing journalists, torturing women and sentencing children to death. That includes the jailing of human rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh, filmmaker Jaffar Pahahi and journalist Abdolreza Tajik, the president said. Obama also named student Mohammad Valian, who has been sentenced to death ""for throwing three stones,"" he said. ""These choices do not demonstrate strength, they show fear. For it is telling when a government is so afraid of its own citizens that it won't even allow them the freedom to access information or to communicate with each other,"" Obama stated. ""But the future of Iran will not be shaped by fear. The future of Iran belongs to the young people -- the youth who will determine their own destiny."" Nowruz, which literally means ""new day,"" marks the first day of spring and the start of the Iranian year. It is celebrated around the start of the vernal equinox. It is also considered a holiday for Zoroastrians as well as adherents of Sufism and the Baha'i faith. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday also released a statement marking the Persian New Year. ""This year allows us to reflect on recent events in the Middle East. We commend the demonstration of peaceful expressions of human rights and dignity we have seen in much of the region,"" Clinton stated. ""We join the world community in embracing Nowruz's opportunities and in striving to uphold its values. ""May this new year be filled with a renewed sense of hope and a new commitment to the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are our universal birthright,"" Clinton stated.","Obama tells Iranian youth, ""I am with you"" in Nowruz message .

"(CNN) -- It was a promise the castaway made to a dying man: He vowed the man's mother would learn how he perished and hear his last words. Jose Salvador Alvarenga flew from El Salvador to Mexico this week to keep his word -- more than a month after the stunning story of his survival at sea captured international attention. ""It's a promise that we both had made,"" Alvarenga said after landing in Mexico City, ""and now I'm here to fulfill it."" Alvarenga was found in an atoll in the Marshall Islands in late January. He told authorities there he had drifted on a small fishing boat for 13 months all the way from Mexico, more than 6,000 miles away. As some hailed what seemed to be his miraculous survival and others said they doubted his story, there was a tragic side to the tale. His traveling companion, fellow fisherman Ezequiel Cordoba, 23, hadn't made it. Alvarenga said Cordoba had died four weeks into their ordeal because he couldn't manage to drink turtle blood and eat raw fish. While Alvarenga, 37, returned to his native El Salvador last month, Cordoba's family was left demanding answers. This week, they got some. Roselia Diaz, Cordoba's mother, said she was grateful that Alvarenga had traveled to the coastal Mexican town where she lives. ""For me, it would have been sadder if both had died, because I never would have known what happened to my son,"" she said. ""So I'm very happy to see him again."" Alvarenga told reporters that Cordoba often spoke about his mother. ""He told me a lot about her, that she was a very good person with everybody, and that she was very loving,"" he said. Alvarenga also told Cordoba's mother how the two fishermen passed the time while drifting in the open sea. Cordoba, an Evangelical Christian, told the Salvadoran fisherman about his faith as they both clung to the hope of being found alive and rescued in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. ""He taught me how to pray,"" Alvarenga said. ""He taught me to sing."" The castaway said there were some things Cordoba told him that only the dead fisherman's mother must know. ""To reveal them publicly,"" he said, ""would be to betray his memory."" CNN's Nick Parker and Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- The leader of an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria is calling for an end to days of bloody infighting between opposition factions, according to an online message. Abu-Mohammad al-Jolani, leader of the al Qaeda-linked al Nusra Front, called on another al Qaeda franchise -- the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- and moderate rebel groups to implement a cease-fire after more than 270 people were killed in four days of fighting between the two opposition factions, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In a nine-minute audio message, al-Joulani blamed ""the incorrect policies"" of ISIS for ""aggravating the conflict"" between armed opposition factions, and urged a resolution to the conflict by calling for an immediate cease-fire and creating a Sharia council made up of all relevant groups. The criticism of a fellow al Qaeda affiliate by al Nusra Front is part of a longstanding dispute between the two that came to a head last October when al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri called on ISIS to withdraw from Syria, a call the group refused to heed. ""The whole battlefield and all those in it from foreign to local fighters will pay the price for losing a great jihad and the (Syrian) regime will rebound after it was near disappearing,"" al-Joulani warns in the new message posted on online jihadist forums. The call for a diplomatic solution appeared to fall on deaf ears as clashes intensified across Syria between rebel factions and ISIS particularly in the fabled city of Aleppo, where the recently formed Islamic Front spearheaded fighting against the predominately foreign fighting force. ""They (ISIS) have become aggressive and they have crossed the red line from trespassing to assaults to their extremist agenda,"" Islam Aloush, spokesman for the Islamic Front, told CNN Tuesday, referring to ISIS's radical form of Sharia law, public executions, and imprisonment of opponents as key factors that spurred the opposition to take up arms against the al Qaeda-linked group. According to activists and seasoned observers, the backlash against ISIS by more than one rebel faction across multiple provinces overwhelmed the group that claims tens of thousands of fighters among its ranks and just weeks ago appeared the most predominant military force in northern Syria with powerful influence over the majority of population centers. Rebels besieged at least 100 ISIS fighters at a police station used as a base by the group in the key Salheen neighborhood of Aleppo, and elsewhere in the province ISIS surrendered bases and withdrew from towns and villages, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. ""ISIS cannot withstand the losses they are taking and the numbers now held as prisoner of war,""Aloush said, claiming his organization, the Islamic Front, far outnumbered ISIS. The Islamic Front boasts an estimated 40,000 fighters, making it probably the single largest rebel command, according to Aron Lund, editor of the Carnegie Endowment's Syria in Crisis website. In Raqqah, the first provincial capital under rebel control, full-scale fighting resulted in losses for ISIS at dawn Tuesday. Just a day earlier insurgents freed at least 50 people held in an ISIS detention facility, and further to the west in the Zawiya Mountain region, rebels executed at least 34 foreigner jihadists from the group. The infighting fueling a war-within-a-war further complicates matters for international observers such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) which announced Tuesday it could no longer update the death toll for the more-than-three-year civil conflict. ""We have, of course, depended on the full and transparent cooperation and sound working methods of the various groups collecting the data on the ground. Over time there are fewer and fewer such groups still active, which brought us to a point where we felt that we are not able to produce a new detailed report,"" Nenad Vasic a spokesman for the OHCHR said, adding the count had stopped in early December.","The leader of an an Qaeda-linked group tells Syrian rebels to stop infighting .

"(CNN) -- The leader of an apocalyptic New Mexico church who claims to be the Messiah was arrested Tuesday on sex charges, state police said. Wayne Bent, who also goes by the name Michael Travesser, was arrested at the compound that is home to his Lord Our Righteousness Church, called Strong City by members. He was being interviewed, state police spokesman Peter Olson said. The arrests come after three children were removed from the compound late last month. A post on the group's Web site said Bent was arrested Tuesday morning. ""I was told by the agent in charge of the case that the arrest warrant specified charges of three counts of sexual contact with a minor, and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,"" said the post, written by an unnamed follower. ""The bail was set at half a million dollars."" The writer said sect members were questioned at a state police office in Clayton, New Mexico, and promised to update the site with ""a more complete response to these false charges."" The Lord Our Righteousness Church was founded in 1987 by former Seventh-day Adventists, according to the group's Web site. ""Since that time, many have joined who do not have their roots in Adventism."" Bent said on the Web site that God revealed to him in 2000 that he is the Messiah. A post from Monday written by Bent said, ""The current upheaval over me and the present contest is well under way. It was the same for Jesus. Jesus had not committed any crimes, so the authorities had to invent some crimes to crucify him over. ""It is the same for me also,"" Bent wrote. ""I have committed no crimes, but many crimes are being imagined and concocted in the minds of men to try and kill me again. Men are so stupid, though, for they do not know that they cannot kill Spirit."" Last month, authorities removed two girls and a boy from the compound. The reasons for their removal are not publicly known, but the removals gained attention because they came after more than 400 children were removed from the Texas ranch of an offshoot Mormon sect that practices polygamy. Those children remain in state custody. Bent has acknowledged having sex with his followers, but authorities will not divulge who the alleged victims are. A former member of the Lord Our Righteousness Church, however, told CNN affiliate KOAT that he left because Bent wanted to sleep with his daughters. John Sayer said he split with the church after 16 years when Bent told him he was supposed to sleep with seven virgins -- and that two of them were to be Sayer's daughters, then 14 and 15 years old. He said he told Bent that it wasn't right and that he, his wife and his daughters left the compound. Sayer told KOAT that his youngest daughter later returned and was one of the three removed by authorities. In posts on the group's Web site, Bent wrote that the three children were ""abducted.""

"(CNN) -- A 68-year-old California inmate on death row in San Quentin State Prison was found dead hanging in his cell, authorities said Tuesday. Authorities are investigating the suicide of condemned inmate James Lee Crummel and declined to provide the circumstances of the hanging, which happened Sunday afternoon in the rear of his single-occupant cell, said Lt. Sam Robinson of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. A corrections officer had last observed Crummel 15 minutes before he was found dead, Robinson said. The officer was doing an inmate count before dinner when he found Crummel's body, Robinson said. Remains linked to death row inmate identified . Crummel had not been under suicide watch, Robinson said. An autopsy will be conducted, he said. Crummel went to death row shortly after being sentenced to death on July 9, 2004, by a Riverside County jury for the April 13, 1979, kidnapping, sexual abuse and murder of 13-year-old James Wilfred Trotter, who disappeared on his way to school, authorities said.

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- At least 19 people died Saturday when a boat carrying Congolese refugees capsized on Lake Albert, police said. The boat was en route from a settlement camp in western Uganda to the Democratic Republic of Congo when it overturned at about 10:30 a.m., according to police, who said 45 people were rescued as the search continued for 32 missing men, women and children. The boat, which was carrying 96 people, more than twice its capacity, capsized off Ndaiga in Kibale district, police said. Accidents are common among the often overloaded wooden boats that sustain communities along Lake Albert, which lies between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, but police have difficulty enforcing safety standards. Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said the refugees had left from the Kyangwali settlement camp in Hoima district. ""They were leaving the camp to get back to their country, and it is the cheapest transport for them,"" he said.","The boat was en route from a settlement camp in western Uganda to the DRC .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- My friend posted this message as her Facebook status update: Maybe it's just me, but I am extremely uncomfortable with any married man calling me ""just to say hi."" Not good! Respect your wife! My initial response was this has to be a joke ... right? Then the comments started flying with woman after woman not only liking the status update but also telling their own tales of married men trying to befriend single women. The biggest complaint from most women was that lately some married men have been living double lives. In social settings, these married men partied all night long, had lingering conversations and exchanges with single women all under the guise of business for their charity or event. These married men are the ""undercover agents"" of the single scene. They purposely put themselves in situations where they can infiltrate the single female scene all the while wearing their wedding bands to make these women feel safe. One woman said it best on my friend's Facebook comment thread: ""If a married man is trying to cultivate a friendship with me and I don't know his wife, he's out of line and I want nothing to do with him. The last thing I need is a woman looking at me sideways thinking I'm interested in her man. I'm too grown for that kind of drama."" Drama is exactly what you get when a married man tries to befriend a single woman without mentioning his wife, much less an introduction. With that said, I'm declaring it is almost impossible for a married man to be friends with a single women if she doesn't know the wife. I recall attending a number of events organized by a well-known fundraiser in Atlanta. He is incredibly charming, intelligent and always the life of the party. His circle of influence is extensive, including media professionals, politicians and some of the city's ""movers and shakers."" At every event I attended, his wife was never present. Oddly enough, the majority of the women that he knew in attendance were single. Granted, there was a slightly even mix of men and women, but I found it odd that so many of the women were single. Needless to say, the men in attendance were mostly married and had THEIR wives with them. Each time I interacted with this person, I made it a point to ask about his wife. There was always some ""good"" reason that she was not at the event; mostly it was that she was home with the kids. I find it hard to believe that with his amazing ability to fundraiser and organize, he never had a babysitter available on at least one of those nights. A couple of my friends discussed these events at length and wondered could he be an ""undercover agent""? We debated back and forth considering all the possibilities. Maybe his wife did not like attending social events, preferring to stay at home? Is it possible that these events were his outlet, and she trusted him enough to do these events solo? But each time we considered the possibilities, there was the lingering question: Why did he never bring her up in conversation? There was something about his demeanor with the women with that glance at your outfit that lasted just a second too long. It always seemed as if HE were the eligible bachelor in the crowd. So, to avoid these questions, my advice to married men is simple: You are married and cannot enjoy some of the same luxuries as single people. That includes befriending single women under the guise of business ventures without introducing your wife. To single women: If it feels icky, then it more than likely isn't meant to be a business discussion. No one says that married people and single folks can't be friends. But show some respect for your partner -- the one to whom you're married!","Audrey Irvine reports Facebook storm over too-friendly married men .

"(CNN) -- It's been an astonishing year for deception and technology. A famous author in Britain, RJ Ellory, became even more famous when he was discovered reviewing his own work, positively of course, with fake identities online. Prominent journalists were found to have plagiarized the work of others . Fake online reviews were discovered for everything from hotels to Kindle covers to doctors. And I haven't even mentioned the presidential election. Technology is affecting almost all aspects of human life, and deception, one of humankind's most fascinating behaviors, is no exception. Technology is making possible some interesting new forms of deception, like the butler lie, the sock puppet, and the Chinese water army. Butler lies are those little deceptions that we tell one another to avoid social interaction. Examples include the ubiquitous ""on my way"" when in fact we are not on our way, or ""sorry, I just got your text"" when actually we just didn't want to respond right away. Another butler lie is the lost reception explanation (""I'm in a tunnel!""). Butler lies help us manage our social attention in an always-on communication world. They allow us to use the technology as a sort of social buffer to avoid interaction when we're technically always available, while at the same time giving plausible excuses to maintain social relationships we care about. TED.com: Our buggy moral code . Sock puppets are individuals who provide reviews or commentary about their own work, usually highly positive, of course. The Internet allows for this kind of identity deception because people can chose any identity they want. But it can come with a cost when false identities are exposed. In response to the unmasking of Ellory, many authors publicly shamed him and pledged to never engage in sock puppetry. Reviewing one's own work with a false identity isn't exactly new. Walt Whitman was infamous for doing that well before the Internet was invented. But the use of identity deception at scale, with thousands of people doing so in concert, is new. This is the Chinese Water Army phenomenon. The term refers to the large number of Chinese online writers that are paid a small amount of money to write opinions and reviews. In North America this is also commonly referred to as Astroturfing, in which an organization mimics a grass-roots movement by paying people to ""spontaneously"" support their position. It would be easy to assume that technology is growing our lying habits. But this isn't quite right. Let's consider the most important interactions, those with our friends, loved ones, and colleagues. Does technology make us more or less likely to lie to one another? Surprisingly, a lot of research suggests that Internet technology can actually make us more honest. In several of our studies, for example, people lied less in e-mail than face to face. The place where people lie the most? The telephone. TED.com: Why we make bad decisions . We've also looked at social network sites and the claims people make. On LinkedIn, where people post resumÃ© information, we found that people lie less about their past responsibilities and skills than in a traditional paper-based resume. Other work shows that Facebook profiles reflect people's actual personality, rather than some idealized version. Even in online dating, often mocked as a hotbed for lies, we found that yes, people lie, but usually not by that much. Men lie a little about their height, income and education, and women lie a little about their weight and physical appearance. This isn't really that different from meeting someone in a bar, when you think about it. Why might technology make us more honest with each other? One reason is that people view themselves as honest and lying violates that self-concept. This is especially true when talking to people with whom we have a relationship, like our friends and family, or want to have a relationship, like future employers and dates. Being perceived as deceptive can seriously harm reputations and relationships, regardless of the medium. But perhaps the most important reason is that we are in an incredibly fluid era of human social evolution. Consider that humans started talking to each other about 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, and over that time around a trillion humans have lived. The written word, however, only emerged about 5,000 years ago, and until World War II over half the world's population couldn't read or write. So, for most of those trillion humans, every word they ever said just disappeared. Gone. Now the average North American records more words in texts and e-mails in a day than most humans did throughout history. This obviously has important implications for deception. Because of our social evolution we're not wired to automatically remember that our e-mails and texts and blogs and Facebook chats leave a semi-permanent record. Just ask any politician caught in a scandal in the last decade. TED.com: The brain in love . On the plus side, these records give researchers a chance to study all sorts of social behavior that were mostly invisible before. We can use computers to analyze the language in these records and find word patterns that reveal deception, like whether a hotel review was written by someone who actually stayed at the hotel or not (take a look at the end of the TED talk to see if you can tell which hotel review is fake). We're in a crucial change state between the era of ephemeral talk and the era of the digital trace, where everything we do and say creates our own personal record. Deception, whether we want it or not, will no doubt evolve with us as we adapt to this new world of communication. The future of lying, like the future of humanity, is wide open. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Hancock.","In 2012, deception seemed rampant in the news, says Jeffrey Hancock .
He says technology enables or abets some new forms of deception .
Still, studies find that people lie less frequently on LinkedIn and Facebook, he says .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's constitutional court has declared the country's February 2 general election invalid as it breached a law requiring that the polling process be completed on the same day nationwide. The opposition's boycott of the vote and widespread anti-government protests meant that candidates were not fielded in 28 constituencies. It had been expected that voting would take place in those areas at a later date. However, the court's six to three majority verdict cannot be appealed, meaning a new general election must be held across the South East Asian country. Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra called elections in December, in an attempt to end political unrest. Amnesty bill . Yingluck is the brother of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in exile. Yingluck's critics accuse her of being a proxy for her brother, who was convicted of corruption charges in 2008 and sentenced to prison in absentia. Yingluck's government was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in November, sparking a wave of protests. The bill would have nullified Thaksin's corruption conviction and allowed him to return to the country. Anti-government protesters have been demanding that an unelected ""people's council"" be given the power to carry out political and electoral changes in a country where parties affiliated with Thaksin have dominated elections since 2001. The main opposition Democrat Party boycotted the February 2 polls and protesters blocked officials from gathering ballots and obstructed voter registration in many constituencies. That left the outcome of the election inconclusive, without enough results to reopen parliament, and with Yingluck in charge of a caretaker government. Red shirt protest . More than 20 people have been killed and hundreds wounded since the protests erupted, with Yingluck's supporters -- the ""red shirts"" clashing with anti-government protesters. The red shirts have announced they will hold a rally this weekend in Pattaya city, about 90 minutes from Bangkok. CNN's Kocha Olarn says the constitutional court's ruling will likely result in a huge turnout. The conflict has deepened the country's political divide. The anti-government movement draws its support from southern Thailand, Bangkok's middle class and the established elites. Yingluck's base is in the less affluent but more populous regions north and east of the capital. The Bangkok Post reported that the court hearing was held at the request of Thailand's Office of the Ombudsman. It followed the lodging of a complaint by a law lecturer who argued the February vote was unlawful, the paper said. State of emergency . Earlier this week, the Thai government ended a 60-day state of emergency imposed on Bangkok and several surrounding areas in the run-up to the election. The state of emergency had given authorities the power to impose curfews, detain suspects without court permission, censor media and declare parts of the capital off limits. It has been replaced with the Internal Security Act (ISA), which will be in effect until April 30.

"(CNN) -- A 30-year-old Michigan doctor who has been missing for almost a month was accused in September of stalking gospel artist Marvin Sapp, court records show. Teleka Patrick failed to show up for work in Kalamazoo on December 6. The night before, police 100 miles south in Indiana found her car abandoned in a ditch off busy Interstate 94. Sapp, who has been nominated for eight Grammys, filed a personal protection order against her, in which he complains that Patrick ""has claimed him as her husband, had moved from California to Michigan, joined his church, had contacted his children and had been to his home. ""I have at least 400 pages of correspondence from her which I have never responded,"" his complaint reads. Patrick's family recognized that questions have arisen regarding the missing woman's mental health, but said the focus must remain on finding her. ""We are aware of media reports that are beginning to focus on Teleka's mental health, and while we encourage the pursuit of honest journalism and truth, we will not take part in sensationalizing Teleka's disappearance,"" the family said in a statement on Facebook. ""We believe that she has met with foul play and wholeheartedly believe that she is in danger,"" the statement said. So far, investigators have little evidence in the missing person case. Two home videos uploaded to YouTube feature Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown. Patrick's mother told CNN she wasn't aware of any romantic relationship her daughter may have had. But the videos have an intimate feel to them. ""Hi, baby,"" Patrick says in one. ""I am just coming to you to say 'hi' and tell you about my day."" In another video, Patrick shows a table set for two with omelets and pancakes. ""If you were here, this is what would be your plate,"" she coos. The two videos were posted in early November. A third video to surface came from a local hotel in Kalamazoo. That's where Patrick went the night of December 5, just hours before police found her car in the ditch in Indiana. Videos raise more questions about missing doctor . At a little past 7:30 p.m., Patrick, dressed all in black, showed up at a Radisson hotel not far from the hospital where she worked. She spent around 10 minutes talking with employees at the reception desk but ultimately left. There's no audio on the video, and it's not clear why Patrick failed to book a room. But at 7:48 p.m., she strode across the hotel's tiled floors, out the door and onto a hotel shuttle bus. Those images provide the last known picture of Patrick. Her family says Patrick, who had just moved to Michigan, bought a plane ticket to come visit them for the holidays in Florida. Her colleagues called her ""part of our family of medical professionals."" Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary. Police brought out dogs to track Patrick's scent. They led investigators the 30 or so feet out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway. There, the trace went cold.","Court records show Marvin Sapp filed a personal protection order against Teleka Patrick .

"(CNN) -- In the final weeks of his brief life, little Myls Dobson suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence. A New York criminal complaint released Friday at the arraignment of Kryzie King, 27, with whom the 4-year-old had been staying since mid-December, said the boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said. Myls suffered ""horrific injuries sustained over a period of days,"" New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters. King pleaded not guilty at her arraignment in Manhattan criminal court on charges of first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. But Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the court Friday that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder, and likely faced additional charges upon the completion of the autopsy. In a statement, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: ""My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not jump to any conclusions at this time."" Shortly before 11 a.m. on Wednesday, police responding to a 911 call found Myles locked in a bathroom at King's apartment at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury highrise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. He appeared battered, was unconscious and unresponsive on the floor, authorities said. The child was pronounced dead at St. Luke's Hospital at 1:52 p.m. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. The father was arrested in December for alleged bank fraud, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. At a news conference Friday, an adviser to the boy's mother, Ashlee Dobson, said that she lost custody of her son for financial reasons. The mother and the adviser, Tony Herbert, demanded answers from child welfare authorities. ""The city of New York put the child in the care of the father, who they knew was a felon,"" Herbert said. ""You open up a case and then you close it thinking everything is fine? No. That has to be answered. Who did that, who authorized that?"" A call placed to the city Administration for Children's Services was not returned. Dobson lost custody in 2012, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""She was in a shelter, they didn't think it best that she would be in that shelter with a baby, so they gave him to the father,"" Herbert said of child welfare authorities. Dobson told reporters Friday that she was turning her life around in hopes of regaining custody of her son. She had weekly visitation rights but last saw her son in November. In tears, Ashlee Dobson said, ""I love my son. He always loved me. He always gave me kisses."" The complaint portrays the finals weeks of Myls' life as a living hell. King told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said. The next day, she told police, she allegedly struck him about his body five to six times with a belt, leaving bruises and scars. The complaint said King admitted that from December 30 to January 4 she allegedly tied the boy's wrists and feet together with shoe laces and gagged him with a piece of cloth. She told police that resulted in scaring on his wrists and ankles. On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him twelve to thirteen times with a belt. On Tuesday, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said. That same day, she allegedly locked the boy inside a dark bathroom for about three hours. King told authorities that the boy was ""being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food,"" the complaint said. The last time the boy ate or drank anything was on January 3. Aside from her comments about the child not eating well, King gave no indication in the complaint of what might have prompted her purported actions. Since arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office, said an autopsy was performed Thursday but the cause of death is pending further study. CNN's Julia Talanova contributed to this report.","Four-year-old Myls Dobson was burned and beaten to death .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A massive car bomb tore through the heart of a bustling marketplace in Peshawar, Pakistan, Wednesday, killing at least 100 people -- including many women and children -- and injuring at least 200 others, officials said. A vehicle packed with 150 kilograms (330 pounds) of explosives detonated at the Meena Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops popular with women. The impact destroyed buildings, burying people underneath the rubble, and sparked massive fires in the shops, mosques, and homes. In a year of seemingly endless militant attacks in Pakistan, this was the deadliest. Those who survived described a narrow escape: . ""I ducked quickly and when I looked up it was complete darkness,"" said Imdad. ""I couldn't see anyone. The cars and the van were lying upside down."" Are you there? Send your photos and videos to iReport . Fareed Ullah, a student at a nearby mosque, was injured when he fell from the second floor as he tried to escape a fire ignited by the blast at the Meena Bazaar. ""We only saw a red blaze and nothing else,"" he said from his hospital bed. ""My friends and I fell from the second floor. We didn't know where we were."" The remote-controlled detonation killed at least 100 people and injured as many as 200 others, hospital and government officials said. The deaths include 68 males and 32 females, including 10 children, the head of the main hospital in Peshawar said. The car bomb left a 10-foot-wide crater, and the flames spread quickly through stores selling highly flammable fabric. Residents and shopkeepers expressed outrage that militants were able to carry out the attack in broad daylight, the latest in a string of militant attacks targeting civilians in Peshawar. ""What kind of security alert is this? It was an explosives-packed car,"" a middle-aged shopkeeper at Meena Bazaar said. ""Look at the mosque, it ceases to exist anymore. For God's sake, do something!"" ""Increasing chaos"" in Pakistan . The Peshawar car bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on Pakistan since the October 2007 attack on a homecoming rally for former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. More than 135 people were killed in the suicide bombing in Karachi. Bhutto escaped harm, but she was assassinated two months later. Wednesday's bombing happened hours after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, to shore up U.S. support in nuclear-armed Pakistan, as it battles a rising Taliban insurgency. Clinton condemned the strike, and dared the militants who were responsible to put down their arms and appeal to the Pakistani people through the political process. ""If the people behind the attacks were so sure of their beliefs, let them join the political process, let them come forth to the people and make their case that they don't want girls to go to school, that they want women to be kept back, that they believe they have all the answers,"" Clinton said in a joint news conference with her Pakistani counterpart in Islamabad. ""They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is,"" she said of those responsible for the car bombing in Peshawar. Read more about Clinton's comments on blast . Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also condemned the deadly attack, offering his condolences to the victims and their families and directly addressing the attackers. ""We will not buckle, we will fight you because we want stability and peace in Pakistan,"" Qureshi said. ""You are on the run and we know that. We defeated you in Swat and Malakand. You think by attacking innocent people and lives you will shake our determination? No, sir, you will not."" The attack is the deadliest terrorist attack carried out in Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province which has been the site of five militant strikes this month alone. A suicide car bombing on October 9 in Khyber Bazaar killed at least 49 people and injured 135 others. And, just last Friday, a car bomb exploded outside a banquet hall in Peshawar, wounding at least 15 people. The massive casualties in Wednesday's bombing prompted a state of emergency at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, where most of the injured were treated. The hospital appealed to other medical centers -- and to the public -- to donate blood, hospital officials said. North West Frontier Province is bearing the brunt of the massive civilian displacement from Pakistan's military offensive in the neighboring tribal region along the Afghan border. More than 180,000 civilians have fled to North West Frontier Province from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, according to the United Nations. Pakistan's military offensive is currently focused on South Waziristan, where the government believes the Pakistani Taliban has masterminded numerous attacks, including the October 10 siege of Pakistan's army headquarters in Rawalpindi, outside Islamabad. That siege and other attacks outside the tribal region have raised concerns about the ability of government forces to maintain control. President Obama signed legislation this month providing an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years. The White House is working on a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan. Peshawar is a strategic city for both Taliban militants and the U.S. and NATO military, who are waging a battle against Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. Located about 100 miles (167 kilometers) northwest of the capital, Islamabad, Peshawar sits on the main supply route into Afghanistan and is the gateway to Pakistan's ungoverned tribal regions.

"(CNN) -- Russell Bailyn and Jay Gatsby have several things in common: They are both wealthy, live in Long Island, and know how to throw a great 1920s party. Of course, the similarities end there. Bailyn is a wealth manager working in Manhattan, who rented out a 1900s mansion for his 30th birthday last year. Gatsby is a fictional character -- the protagonist of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby,"" known for his lavish and extravagant weekend-long parties. Director Baz Luhrmann's much-anticipated adaptation of ""Gatsby"" hits theaters on May 10. The movie, much like the classic book, is expected to paint a glamorous portrait of the '20s. It's a decade that many have attempted to recreate today through themed parties. 'Unfilmable' novels? No such thing, says Hollywood . Bailyn, who lives and grew up in Great Neck, New York, (the town where Fitzgerald lived and is rumored to have been the basis for the novel's ""West Egg"") said he's enjoyed hosting memorable birthday parties since he turned 16.

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers scoured a widening swath of coastal Florida waters Wednesday for two people missing after a Mexico-based air ambulance crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Fort Lauderdale. Coast Guard crews earlier recovered the bodies of two other people aboard the aircraft, but rescuers continue to hope that missing crew members survived and are clinging to life in the warm south Florida waters. The search will go on at least all day Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. ""In these types of cases, we hope for the best and we search for as long as we can,"" Chief Petty Officer Ryan Doss told reporters Wednesday. Coast Guard crews, divers from the Broward County Sheriff's Office and other rescuers were involved in the search, which spanned up to 24 miles of Florida coastline from Fort Lauderdale to Boynton Beach, Doss said. Currents are carrying the debris north, he said. The Learjet 35 -- carrying a doctor, nurse and two pilots, all of them Mexican citizens -- crashed shortly after one of the pilots reported apparent engine failure shortly after takeoff Tuesday evening from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The crew had just dropped a patient off at the airport and was returning to Mexico when the crash happened, airport spokesman Greg Meyer said. A distress call from one of the pilots came just moments after takeoff. ""We have an engine failure,"" the pilot said. Medical helicopter crashes after taking patient to hospital . An air traffic controller asked him to turn left and keep a certain altitude. ""Not possible,"" the pilot responded. ""We're going to do a 180, and we're going to land."" Seconds later, he said: ""Mayday, mayday, mayday."" Brian Rayner, an investigator for the NTSB said data indicated the plane climbed to about 2,000 feet before descending 1,000 feet. It then began to turn toward shore, Rayner said. He said that he had submitted requests for the plane's maintenance records and information about the pilots and their experience. The two medical staff members worked for Air Evac International, said Albert Carson, the company's director of operations. The pilots worked for a charter company. Authorities have not publicly identified the bodies pending notification of their families. ""We're waiting on pins and needles ... waiting for more information,"" Carson said late Tuesday night. Air Evac International has several bases in Mexican cities that are popular with tourists, as well as in Costa Rica and San Diego.

"New York (CNN) -- New York City agreed in a settlement Tuesday to pay $98 million in back pay and benefits to entry-level firefighters who claim the New York Fire Department used a biased entrance exam that kept African-American and Latinos off the job. The Justice Department sued the city in May 2007, alleging the exams â€” first administered in 1999 â€” both discriminated against minority candidates and didn't properly determine who was qualified for the positions. A U.S. district judge ordered the city to pay $128 million and to hire 293 black and Latino applicants, provided they pass all of the tests in the hiring process. The first groups of these candidates joined the fire department in July 2013 and January, with an additional group expected to join in July. The financial issue had remained a sticking point. However, current Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration did not seem to have former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's desire to continue fighting the suit. ""This administration is fully committed to promoting diversity and equal access in every sector across our five boroughs, and this settlement will move New York City one step closer to this goal,"" de Blasio said in a written statement. Among the steps the city says it will take to increase minority hiring will be the creation of a chief diversity and inclusion officer position within the fire department. Paul Washington, who was president of the Vulcan Society, which represents black firefighters, when the suit was filed, said Tuesday, ""Hopefully, after almost 150 years of blacks being excluded from the best uniformed job in the city, we are witnessing a turning point."" As part of United States of America and Vulcan Society Inc. vs. City of New York, a group of black firefighters alleged the city had intentionally discriminated against them, violating Title VII, the U.S. Constitution and state law. The lawsuit alleged that the exams had little to do with firefighting and instead focused on cognitive and reading skills. Because of the hereditary nature of the fire department, white candidates were recruited and supported throughout the application process by family or neighborhood contacts, and whites consistently passed while minority candidates failed. ""There has been one persistent stain on the Fire Department's record,"" the lawsuit said. ""For decades, black and other minority firefighters have been severely underrepresented in the Department's ranks. ""This pattern of underrepresentation has remained essentially unchanged since at least the 1960s. While the city's other uniformed services have made rapid progress integrating black members into their ranks, the Fire Department has stagnated and at times retrogressed."" The lack of minorities in U.S. fire departments has been the focus of many lawsuits around the nation. However, some big cities have diversified their ranks much faster. More than half of the Philadelphia and Los Angeles fire department members are black or Latino. The settlement still needs to be approved by the district court. ""We look forward to a new era in which African-American and Hispanic firefighters are full and equal participants in the FDNY's proud tradition of protecting and serving the people of the city of New York,"" said Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. CNN's Rose Arce contributed to this report.","Entry-level firefighters to receive a total of $98 million in back pay to settle lawsuit .

"(CNN) -- The search for a plane that was carrying a software company president and members of his family when it disappeared from radar over Idaho was set to resume Wednesday morning after would-be rescuers were forced to suspend their efforts because of nightfall, authorities said. Search and rescue teams detected a weak signal from an emergency locator transmitter that allowed authorities to narrow the search to the area south of Johnson Creek, near Yellow Pine, where the plane is believed to have gone down. ""We've done a ping on the cell phones, and we've narrowed it down to a 4- or 5-square-mile area that we're searching right now,"" Valley County Sheriff's Office Lt. Dan Smith told CNN affiliate KGO. Dale Smith had left Baker City, Oregon, with his son, his son's wife, his daughter and her fiance, said Rand Kriech. He and Smith founded SerialTek, a San Jose, California, company that develops hardware and software data storage tools. Smith's wife and another daughter were in Cascade, Idaho, on Tuesday awaiting news about the search, Kriech said. The Smiths were in Dale Smith's single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza en route to Butte, Montana. About 3 p.m. Sunday, as they were flying over central Idaho at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the 51-year-old executive reported engine trouble and asked controllers in Salt Lake City for the coordinates of the Johnson Creek Air Strip, the sheriff's spokesman said. They never made it. Snow hampered search efforts, carried out Monday by helicopters from the Idaho Army National Guard. Three more planes were expected to join the search on Wednesday, according to Robert Feeley, a spokesman for the Idaho Bureau of Homeland Security. About 40 search and rescue teams, some using ATVs and snowmobiles, combed the area Tuesday and were expected to resume their efforts at first light on Wednesday, authorities said. Repeated attempts to fly into the area of the last known contact, about a mile east of the Johnson Creek Air Strip, were unsuccessful Monday because of poor weather, the Valley County Sheriff's Office said. ""If there is anyone who is able to survive a difficult situation, that would be Dale,"" San Jose Mormon Bishop Jed Dyreng told KGO of his fellow churchgoer. ""When there was Hurricane Katrina, Dale was the first one to get in his plane, grab a bunch of members of his church and go out and help."" ""We are a little bit worried,"" said the bishop's wife, Ann Dyreng, who flew with Smith to Utah in October. ""He's an engineer brain, and he's very meticulous about doing all that. He's meticulous in all things he does."" Smith co-founded SerialTek in 2007, serving as president and chief technologist. It employs 25 people, said Kriech, who described Smith as a religious man who had done humanitarian work with the group Medecins sans Frontieres. ""He's an engineer's engineer,"" Kriech said Tuesday. ""If anyone can get out of this situation, it's Dale. Hopefully, he laid the plane down safely. That's what we are hoping and praying for this morning. He's a good man, and we're hoping to see him back here."" CNN's Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","NEW: Search efforts are set to resume Wednesday morning, authorities said .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican authorities said Sunday they found the wreckage of a small plane that they believe was carrying Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera. Six others, including two pilots, were also thought to be on board the plane, which took off from Monterrey, Mexico, earlier in the day and soon lost contact with air traffic controllers. ""Everything points to that this is the plane,"" Communication and Transportation Minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza told CNN affiliate Foro TV, about a wreckage site in the northern state of Nuevo Leon. His ministry issued a statement saying authorities were working to access the site by land in order to confirm exactly what's there. Alejandro Argudin, director general of Civil Aviation, said he believes no one on board survived the crash. ""The aircraft was destroyed, totally fragmented,"" he told CNN affiliate Televisa. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999, according to her website. She sings traditional Mexican ballads, and was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award in 2002 in the category of ""Best Banda Album."" In October, People en Espanol named Rivera to its list of the 25 most powerful women. Famous for her music, she is also known for her tumultuous personal life. The singer was a single mom at the age of 15 and is the mother of five, her website said. Rivera's ""I Love Jenni"" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year. She is a judge on the popular TV show, ""The Voice, Mexico,"" which was scheduled to air Sunday night. Noting its concern for Rivera, Televisa said it would air a special report on the singer instead. A fellow judge on the show took to Twitter following news of Rivera's disappearance. ""My heart is devastated,"" wrote Beto Cuevas. ""All my prayers are with you, Jenni, and your family."" The private LearJet took off from Monterrey at 3:15 a.m. and lost contact with air traffic controllers about 60 miles away, according to a statement from the transportation ministry. The singer had a concert in the northern Mexican city Saturday night. Two helicopters assisted in the search for the plane, which had as its destination the airport in Toluca, near Mexico City. The cause of the suspected crash was not immediately clear, and the ministry has opened an investigation. Read more on CNN Mexico .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry chastised her guests for being too serious just before the controversial segment about former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's adopted black grandson. A source who was in the studio during the show told CNN that before the offending segment, the comedians were urged off the air to be funnier. The source asked not to be identified. Later in the show, Harris-Perry told viewers the panel of comedians would ""be forced to drink during the commercial so they can get their funny back."" Harris-Perry would tearfully apologize for the jokes a week later. ""My intention was not malicious, but I broke the ground rule that families are off limits, and for that I am sorry,"" Harris-Perry said Saturday. The apology comes weeks after MSNBC host Martin Bashir lost his job because of remarks about former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Controversial comments by journalists about an American politician's family are not new. Harry Truman threatened physical violence against a Washington Post critic who famously wrote in 1950 that the president's daughter ""cannot sing very well."" While Margaret Truman put herself into the public eye with her performance, Romney's grandson Kieran James only sat on his grandfather's lap for a family Christmas card photograph. And this instance involved race. Ridiculing transracial adoption? Harris-Perry asked her panelists to come up with captions for the photo of Romney, his wife and their 21 grandchildren, all white except for Kieran. Comedic actress Pia Glenn sang a Sesame Street song: ""One of These Things Is Not Like the Others."" Comedian Dean Obeidallah joked that the photo ""really sums up the diversity of the Republican Party."" Harris-Perry described the baby as ""gorgeous"" and suggested Kieran could someday marry North West, the daughter of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. ""Can you imagine Mitt Romney and Kanye West as in-laws?"" she joked. Unlike Truman and the critic, Romney quickly forgave Harris-Perry. ""People make mistakes, and the folks at MSNBC made a big mistake and they apologized for it,"" Romney said in an interview on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""They apologized for it. That's all we can ask for."" Daily Beast political columnist Sally Kohn, a guest Sunday on CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" blamed the growing competitiveness and immediacy of media today for the increase in such incidents. ""There's always this incentive to say something that's newsworthy, attention-getting, but it's real easy to cross the line into offensive and stupid,"" Kohn said. ""And that's a split-second judgment sometimes."" The punch lines drew fire from critics who said they disrespected transracial adoptions, which the Department of Health & Human Services says make up 40% of all adoptions in the United States. ""Allow me to apologize to other families formed through transracial adoption because I am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families are in any way funny or deserving of ridicule,"" Harris-Perry said in her Saturday apology. Romney accepts MSNBC host's apology . Harris-Perry, who is a political science professor at Tulane University, was surrounded by four comedians and no professional journalists. The live, unscripted show, which she said was her second annual ""Look Back in Laughter"" edition, seemed more like a night at the improv than a cable news program. ""This is the show where we dispense with the serious and sober coverage of the year in politics,"" she promised viewers. They would look back on ""some of the political absurdity of 2013 with the ridicule and mockery it so rightly deserves."" Harris-Perry delivered an opening monologue loaded with obvious sexual puns about the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal. Comedian Judy Gold joked about Sen. Ted Cruz, saying it was scary that the Texas Republican had daughters. Other comments came about the daughters of ""rich, white Republicans."" The mandate for more punch lines was made clear by Harris-Perry after one somewhat serious segment. Opinion: Lesson of the Romney adoption joke story . ""My comedians are all going to be forced to drink during the commercial so they can get their funny back because they've got real serious about sexism and feminism,"" the host said. ""We are basically ratings whores,"" Harris-Perry added. Politico media reporter Dylan Byers said the MSNBC brand has been damaged by these controversies, considering the channel was ""supposed to elevate the discourse"" with smart, well-educated progressives who ""lean forward."" ""It's leaning backward and it's totally, it's not what MSNBC, I think, was supposed to be about originally, and I think it's doing real, severe damage to the brand,"" Byers said on CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" Boston radio host Callie Crossley told ""Reliable Sources"" that Harris-Perry's brand has been damaged by the controversy as well. ""Her brand is to exactly be on top of the kind of ignorant and other kind of racist commentary."" Blurry ground rules . The Society of Professional Journalists has a code of ethics that says journalists should ""use special sensitivity when dealing with children"" and ""show good taste."" Students learn it in most journalism schools. But the rule book in the rough-and-tumble world of politics and media is an unwritten common law of precedents that evolves partly through apologies, resignations and firings. Harris-Perry's apology makes one rule clear: The kids are off limits. There are exceptions to the rule, such as when politicians decide to use family members to win support. The campaign of New York's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, prominently featured his biracial family in commercials and campaign events. Teenage son Dante appeared in his own ad highlighting his father's stance against ""stop-and-frisk."" Dante and his Afro-style hair became a social media sensation and is credited with helping his father surge to the top of the polls last year. ""His family, just because of the racial mix, represents a big and increasingly large part of the city and speaks to certain sensibilities,"" said Harold Ickes, a veteran Democratic Party operative who advised the campaign and has known de Blasio for two decades. ""The family is very important to Bill. ... From the outside, this family represents a part of the city not represented in city government.""

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka is safely through to the last 16 of the Miami Masters after defeating Edouard Roger-Vasselin of France in straight sets 7-5 6-4. The world No. 3, who battled past Daniel Gimeno-Traver in the previous round, was again made to work hard by his lower-ranked opponent. The first set was heading for a tie-break before Wawrinka broke the Frenchman's serve in the 12th game to close out the set in 45 minutes. The Swiss looked to be running away with the second after opening up a 3-0 lead, but the world No. 43 battled back to 4-4 before Wawrinka broke serve again in the 10th game to take the match. Wawrinka, who has never gone further than the last 16 in Miami, will now face Alexandr Dolgopolov after the No. 22 seed beat Dusan Lajovic 3-6 6-0 7-6 (7/5). The Ukrainian, who shocked Rafael Nadal in the third round at Indian Wells, edged through in a tiebreak after rain halted play for an hour with the score poised at 5-5 in the final set. Canada's Milos Raonic is through to the fourth round in Miami for the first time after a dominant 6-1 6-2 win over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. The No. 12 seed will now face Germany's Benjamin Becker who beat Aljaz Bedene from Slovenia 6-3, 7-5. In the women's draw, Serena Williams is safely through the quarterfinals after defeating compatriot Coco Vandeweghe 6-3 6-1. The No. 1 seed overpowered her opponent ranked 104 in the world hitting 17 winners and making only 11 unforced errors, but said afterwards that the match was far from one-sided. ""It was a much tougher match than the scoreline showed,"" Williams said. ""CoCo has such an amazing serve, so every time I was returning I was like, 'Hopefully I can touch the ball.' But it was really good for me to win this match today. I love playing here in Miami."" The defending champion will meet fifth seed Angelique Kerber who needed all three sets to get past Russia's Ekaterina Makarova. The German won the first set comfortably enough before Makarova fought back to take the second. But it was Kerber who prevailed in the final set to take the match 6-4 1-6 6-3. Maria Sharapova also needed three sets to overcome Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens. The Russian fourth seed lost the opening set, serving five double faults, before battling back strongly to win 3-6 6-4 6-1 and book a place in the quarterfinals. Sharapova, a runner-up in Miami on five previous occasions, is hoping to break her duck this year. ""Of course you want to be able to hold the winner's trophy, but you also know the matches you've got to get through to get to the final stage,"" Sharapova said. ""It's not like I didn't have my opportunities in those finals. I just didn't take them. That's why you come back and hope for another chance.""

"(CNN) -- A college student in Nigeria has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for scamming an Australian woman out of $47,000 online by pretending to be a widowed white businessman desperately in love with her. A court in Ikeja in southwest Nigeria ruled that Lawal Adekunie Nurudeen will also have to pay back the 56-year-old woman, even if it meant selling the two plots of land and the Honda Prelude he bought with her money. Nurudeen was an engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007, said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nigeria's anti-corruption police. The woman lamented that she was looking for a husband but had been disappointed in the men she had met. ""The convict, who is married with three children, instantly applied and told the victim that she had met Mr. Right,"" the commission said in a statement. Nurudeen pretended to be a 57-year-old British engineer working with a multinational company in Nigeria. He told her his wife and only child had died in a road accident in Lagos, the former capital of the country. ""He sent the picture of a white man to the victim to foreclose any suspicions,"" police said. The woman agreed to marry him. A few weeks later, Nurudeen called the woman pretending to be a doctor. He told her that her fiance had been in an accident and needed money for treatment. The woman obliged, the commission said. Nurudeen let two weeks pass. He then called the woman again, thanking her profusely for her kindness and telling her that he would like to visit her in Australia. He asked her for airfare, cash for customs clearance and other incidentals, police said. Authorities did not say how Nurudeen was caught. But he duped the woman of $47,000 before his arrest, the commission said. Scammers in Nigeria have gained a reputation for using the Internet to con foreign nationals out of money. Some of the scams have earned the name ""419"" after the clause in the Nigerian criminal code that deals with obtaining property under false pretense.","Police: Nurudeen was engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- A Harvard University student was named Tuesday in a criminal complaint alleging he was responsible for bomb threats that led school officials to delay some final exams, including his, that had been scheduled for Monday. Eldo Kim, 20, of Cambridge, allegedly e-mailed bomb threats at about 8:30 a.m. Monday to offices associated with Harvard, including the Harvard University Police Department and the Harvard Crimson, the student-run daily newspaper, according to the five-page complaint. The subject line in each of the messages read ""bombs placed around campus"" and cited ""shrapnel bombs"" in four buildings on the school's main campus in Cambridge. ""2/4. guess correctly. be quick or they will go off soon,"" they said. The Harvard police called in the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Secret Service; the Cambridge Police Department and the Boston Police Department along with numerous other first responders, including the Cambridge Fire Department. The buildings were evacuated and swept by bomb technicians and hazmat officers, and access to Harvard Yard was restricted to students with Harvard IDs, according to the Harvard Gazette, the school's official news website. Shortly before 3 p.m., long after Kim's exam had been canceled for the day, officials concluded that the threats were a hoax and reopened the buildings. ""Those who missed their exams due to the evacuation should be in touch with administrators about a makeup date or other arrangement,"" the Gazette said. The e-mail messages had been sent through a service called Guerrilla Mail, which creates temporary and anonymous e-mail messages, according to the complaint. And the person had used a product called TOR, which assigns an anonymous Internet Protocol address that can be used to hide the identity of the sender, it added.

"(CNN) -- A new strain of avian flu that jumped from birds to mammals is responsible for the death of more than 160 seals off the New England coast last year, scientists announced Tuesday. The virus could theoretically pose a threat to human health, they said. Harbor seals -- most of them babies less than 6 months old -- began appearing with severe pneumonia and skin lesions in September of last year, the researchers said. Over the next few months, at least 162 dead seals were recovered along the coast from Maine to Massachusetts, they said. Mutant bird flu would be airborne, scientists say . Testing pointed at a new strain of the H3N8 flu virus being called seal H3N8. ""When initial tests revealed an avian influenza virus, we asked the obvious question: How did this virus jump from birds to seals?"" lead researcher Simon Anthony of Columbia University said. The virus developed the ability to attack mammalian respiratory tracts, scientists learned. It may also have developed enhanced virulence and transmission in mammals, they said, but they need to do more tests to be sure. Avian flu has spread to humans before, most notably H1N1 and H5N1, so the new strain could pose a threat to public health, scientists warned. ""HIV/AIDS, SARS, West Nile, Nipah and influenza are all examples of emerging infectious diseases that originated in animals,"" said W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University. ""Any outbreak of disease in domestic animals or wildlife, while an immediate threat to wildlife conservation, must also be considered potentially hazardous to humans,"" he said. The research is published in the journal mBio. It was carried out by scientists from the Center for Infection & Immunity at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, New England Aquarium, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, SeaWorld and EcoHealth Alliance. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","A new strain of avian flu has mutated and is killing baby seals, scientists say .

"New York (CNN) -- An Ohio man whose wife died in a car accident earlier this year is suing the hospital where she was a nurse, claiming she was ""worked to death,"" and that the hospital knew about it. Jim Jasper's wife, Beth, was killed on March 16 while driving home after a 12-hour shift. The wrongful death lawsuit, filed last week, alleges that from 2011 to the time of her death, Beth Jasper's unit at the Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati was ""regularly understaffed,"" causing some nurses, including Jasper, to work through breaks and pick up additional shifts. Additionally, Jasper was routinely called into work while off duty because she was one of the few nurses qualified to work the unit's dialysis machines, according to the suit. ""It needs to change. These nurses cannot be treated this way,"" Jim Jasper told CNN affiliate WCPO, referring to the conditions he says led to his wife's death. ""They can't continue to work these nurses and expect them to pick up the slack because they don't want to staff the hospitals."" Staff shortages and overextended shifts for nurses are a nationwide issue, according to National Nurses United, the nation's largest union representing registered nurses, with nearly 185,000 members throughout the country. But wrongful death litigation stemming from staffing issues is unusual. ""Chronic understaffing is rampant throughout hospitals around the country,"" said Bonnie Castillo, the union's government relations director. ""It is probably the single biggest issue facing nurses nowadays, and it's not only affecting nurses, but patient health as well."" Jim Jasper's attorney, Eric Deters, said Beth Jasper may have fallen asleep before her car veered off the road, jumped an embankment and struck a tree. During her final shift, according to the lawsuit, Beth Jasper told other nurses she was ""really stressed"" and ""hadn't eaten."" The lawsuit alleges that fatigue from being overworked contributed to the death of the 38-year-old mother of two. ""This is just a tragic situation,"" Deters said Tuesday. ""The hospital clearly did not take care of its own people, and it did so deliberately."" Jasper's lawsuit claims that hospital staffers, including his wife's supervisor, were aware of the staffing problems and alerted the hospital's parent company, Mercy Health Group. Her supervisor expressed concern to superiors that Beth Jasper was being ""worked to death,"" yet the hospital did nothing to deal with the staffing issue, the suit said. Nanette Bentley, a spokeswoman for Mercy Health Group, expressed sympathy for the family, but declined to comment on pending litigation. Castillo, the union representative, said ""safe staffing ratios"" of nurses to patients remain largely unregulated in the United States. California is the only state with safe staffing ratio laws, Castillo said. The law requires nurses on general medical or surgical floors to care for no more than five patients at a time, and nurses in intensive care units to care for no more than two. The law has been in effect since 2004. The union has pushed for safe staffing legislation around the country.

"(CNN) -- English Premier League champions, Manchester City have appointed Ferran Soriano as their new chief executive officer, the club announced Friday. The Spaniard, who was CEO and vice-chairman at Barcelona FC from 2003 to 2008, replaces outgoing CEO Garry Cook. In a statement published on the club's official website, Soriano said: ""I am delighted to take up the position of CEO at Manchester City Football Club. The vision of the owner together with his commitment, and that of the Chairman and the Board, make this opportunity absolutely compelling. ""The Club has incredible potential to be fulfilled both on and off the field. I very much look forward to playing my part to ensure that happens."" Soriano was credited with turning around the fortunes of the Catalan club during his tenure, more than doubling revenues from €123 million ($150 million) to €308 million ($378 million) and turning a €78 million ($95 million) loss into cumulative profits of 88 million ($108 million) within five years, according to Manchester City's official website. City Chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak said the search for Cook's replacement had been a ""far-reaching and exhaustive"" one. ""In Ferran we have our preferred candidate. His experience in football and in the wider commercial world make him exceptionally well equipped to lead Manchester City through its continued evolution,"" Al Mubarak said in a statement. The Abu Dhabi United Group have invested heavily since buying the club in 2008, spending close to $785 million on transfers and reporting a loss of £197 million ($310 million) for the 2010-11 season. With the implementation of UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules -- which can impose penalties on clubs which spend more than they earn -- City will look to Soriano to help balance the books. Blog: Will big football clubs beat Financial Fair Play rules? UEFA started auditing football clubs' financial statements last season, with a two-year lead in for the start of the 2013-14 season when FFP kicks in. Soriano will officially take over on September 1, while City kick-off their season on Sunday against Southampton at the Etihad Stadium.

"(CNN) -- For some, Twitter is a social media platform that enables you to keep up with breaking news, raise political issues or offer amusing thoughts. But for many others, including myself, Twitter has become the new ""Fight Club."" It has in essence become the cyber version of the basement of ""Lou's Bar"" from that 1999 classic film. To those who have not made it onto Twitter yet, let's make something clear: Twitter is not Facebook. Facebook is as dangerous as visiting a P.F. Chang's. Twitter, on the other hand, is the Wild West in the 1800s -- it's new, unsettled and often savage. In ""Fight Club,"" people from all walks of life -- from professionals to blue collar workers -- would nightly shrug off their mundane existence to experience a visceral rush by beating the crap out of each other in the basement of a neighborhood bar. ""Fight Club"" celebrated the duality of life. By day, actor Ed Norton played a mild-mannered, timid insurance adjuster leading the quintessential life ""of quiet desperation."" But by night, Norton became his brash and bold alter ego, Tyler Durden, portrayed by Brad Pitt. The difference between these two characters was succinctly summed up by Tyler Durden while talking to his more staid alter ego: ""I am free in all the ways that you are not. "" This is what Twitter is to many. A place to be free. A place where people from all walks of life are on equal footing to battle each other -- from the rich and powerful to the poor and angry. And on Twitter, you're not required to be polite like you are in the real world. In fact, cutting and snarky remarks are not only accepted, they are glorified. But there's an increasingly dark underbelly to these Twitter fights. What might start out as a disagreement about a political or social issue, at times can escalate into racist, sexist or homophobic rants. In fact, Humboldt University recently created a map entitled ""The Geography of Hate"" which charted the hate filled comments being spewed on Twitter. It's truly alarming. I've experienced it firsthand. Some I've fought with on Twitter have called me ethnic slurs like ""towel head"" because I'm of Arab heritage or a ""stupid guinea"" because I'm also of Italian descent. But these comments are tame when compared to the far more hateful comments launched on Twitter against Blacks, Latinos, gays, and the disabled as noted by the Humboldt study. I know some reading this are asking: Why do you fight at all on Twitter? Why not just ignore those people who challenge you? Sure, you can do that, but as Tyler Durden instructively told us in ""Fight Club"": ""How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight."" So many engage in these battles to test their mettle. There's nothing wrong with the great percentage of Twitter fights. You get a chance to test your opinions on issues of the day. In today's hyperpartisan climate, many just associate with like-minded people and consequently their views on political issues are never challenged. But Twitter provides a forum to debate with others who passionately hold opposing views. True, these battles can become heated and include nasty comments, but for the most part they remain issue-oriented and avoid bigotry. More than once, I've engaged in a fiery battle over an issue and then found common ground on an unrelated subject that has led to a Twitter friendship. After one intense argument with a conservative over President Obama's policies, we both discovered our mutual dislike of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. (I'm a NY Giants fan and he's a Buffalo Bills fan.) That's not to excuse the alarming rise of racist, sexist, homophobic and other hate filled comments on Twitter. And while the Humboldt University report doesn't indicate how many of these comments were made during Twitter fights, I can assure you that is where I have seen them rear their ugly face most often. Here's my plea to my fellow Twitter users: We need to make it clear that there's simply no place for that type of hate on Twitter. You can win a battle on substance -- or even with cutting remarks --- without descending into the realm of racism and bigotry. And the best people to police this are my fellow Twitter users. If enough of us collectively speak out, Twitter can become a social media platform where users share info, joke around and even fight with each other, but all without being subject to hate. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah says Twitter has become a home to sharp exchanges, fights .

"(CNN) -- Zimbabwe will introduce a $1 million note this week as the country tries to ease the effects of hyperinflation, the country's central bank said Monday. A money-changer in Mozambique holds Zimbabwean $10 million and $50 million bills in May. In August, the highest note in the once prosperous southern African country was Z$100 billion.  The country chopped off 10 zeroes, meaning the highest note was temporarily -- and briefly -- Z$10, until Zimbabwe started issuing bigger notes again. The current highest denomination bank note is Z$50,000, not enough to buy half a loaf of bread. Zimbabwe's currency continues to lose value as inflation gallops ahead. The official rate of inflation is 230 million percent, the world's highest, but independent analysts put the figure in billions. ""In the measures under way, the Reserve Bank [of Zimbabwe] plans to introduce a number of new, higher denominations; review the cash withdrawal limits, as well as commence aggressive campaigns for increased usage of alternative means of payment,"" bank governor Gideon Gono said in a statement. Gono said the RBZ intends to introduce Z$100,000, Z$500,000 and Z$1 million (about U.S.$8) bank notes in a bid to help consumers who are battling to make simple purchases and to ease cash shortages that have been prevailing for about two years. President Robert Mugabe's critics blame his policies for Zimbabwe's near decade of economic crisis. A power-sharing agreement between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai that was signed in September has been deadlocked over a distribution of cabinet posts. The power-sharing deal is seen as the only hope to reverse the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the fight against a cholera outbreak in the capital city, Harare, seems to be faltering as more deaths are reported. Official statistics say 10 people have died since last week, but doctors say the disease has killed more than 30. The country is battling to raise foreign currency to import medicine.","Zimbabwe's inflation rate is officially 230 million percent per year .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Shaquille O'Neal may be 7 feet tall and one of the most dominant players in NBA history, but here at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, he's just a big nerd. Shaq has spent the past few days in Austin meeting entrepreneurs, checking out new gadgets and sharing his thoughts on tech, social media, basketball and, well, almost everything else. He spent part of Sunday touring the SXSW trade show, where startups hawk their latest products. ""I thought I was at Toys R Us. I bought stuff I didn't even need,"" he told a capacity crowd at an onstage talk Monday afternoon. ""I'm on my iPad, my computer, every day. I'm the world's tallest geek."" During Shaq's appearance, his first at SXSW, he offered a mix of earnest life lessons and good-natured humor. The 19-year NBA veteran praised the ""dummy-proof"" nature of today's simple-to-use tablets and phones. ""If you don't know how to work technology now, something is really, really wrong with you."" O'Neal has long been a force on Twitter, where he has 6.8 million followers. He said he uses the service ""60% to make you laugh, 30% to inspire you, and 10% to sell stuff. I do a lot of 'your mama' jokes on it."" But Shaq's playful personality masks a potent ambition and a shrewd knack for business. He earned an MBA while playing for the Los Angeles Lakers and later bought a lucrative stake in Google before its IPO in 2004. Currently, he sits on the advisory board for Tout, a social-media startup that lets users make and share 15-second videos. ""I've always tried to partner with people who are way, way smarter than me,"" said the Big Aristotle (one of his many nicknames), who retired from the NBA in 2011. ""I've always been a person ... (who thinks) I don't want you to give me anything. I want to earn it."" Asked by interviewer Brian Solis what he looks for when investing in a tech product, he said, ""Simplicity. I'm looking for something that's very simple ... and that's going to change the world. I look for individuals who are sort of like myself -- big dreamers."" He may have found a few. Before he arrived in Austin, O'Neal and Tout joined up for a ""Pitch Shaq"" contest in which they invited registered SXSW attendees to submit 15-second elevator pitches about their startups. The winner was promised a personal audience with Shaq and possibly an infusion of his cash. At the close of his remarks Monday, Shaq said he had viewed more than 150 pitches and had chosen two winners: Beam, which makes a mobile videoconferencing device that rolls around on wheels like a Segway; and Speakerfy, a social-sound app that lets you wirelessly sync music between different Apple mobile devices. Both startups, when contacted by CNN at their booths inside the Austin Convention Center, were pleasantly stunned by the news. But they don't need Shaq's money. ""We're very flattered. I'd love to figure out how Shaq could use (our device) in his business,"" said Scott Hassan, CEO of Beam. ""We're not really looking for funding right now. We're well funded. But if he really wants to, we could probably work something out."" ""We're very excited, don't get me wrong. We would love to do anything with Shaq. We want his advice,"" said Austin Wright, vice president of operations for Speakerfy. ""But we're good, funding-wise,""he said. ""That's awkward. Do we tell Shaq no?""

"Washington (CNN) -- To understand how messed up Republican politics are these days, examine two votes in Congress this week that demonstrated the level of GOP dysfunction amid the confusing dynamics of an election year in Washington. On Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner and 27 other Republicans voted to allow the federal borrowing limit to increase, joining nearly unanimous Democratic support to pass the debt-ceiling measure over the opposition of the other 199 GOP members. The next day, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 11 GOP colleagues voted with the Democratic majority to reject an attempted filibuster of the same legislation by fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Minutes later, all 12 of the GOP senators who helped defeat the filibuster bid voted with Cruz and the rest of the Senate Republicans against final approval of the debt-ceiling plan, which passed anyway due to unanimous Democratic support. In other words, Republican leaders in Congress sided with Democrats to push through legislation opposed by most of their colleagues. In the Senate, they then voted against the proposal that their earlier support ensured would pass. Senate passes debt-ceiling plan in blow to tea party . Election year politics . Here's the really strange part -- it all makes sense, at least in the context of a divided Republican Party less than nine months before congressional elections in which every House seat and 36 of the 100 Senate seats will be contested. The situations in the House and Senate differed in specifics but shared a common root -- more extreme conservatives foiled plans by GOP leaders to avoid a politically damaging showdown over the debt ceiling while still registering Republican opposition to increased federal borrowing. According to public statements, nobody wanted another debt-ceiling stalemate like those of the past three years that unsettled financial markets and caused the first downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in 2011. A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 54% of respondents would blame congressional Republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling, while 29% would blame President Barack Obama and 12% would blame both. Fresh memories of public blame for the 16-day government shutdown in October also motivated Republican leaders to try to steer clear of another standoff. However, conservative disdain for anything smelling of more federal borrowing -- especially in an election year -- torpedoed Boehner's efforts to forge a compromise that would include some deficit-reduction provisions. Boehner's dilemma . His final attempt was to tack on a politically popular proposal that repealed cuts to military pensions in the recent budget agreement. When Boehner's caucus rejected it, the Ohioan decided to violate his own rule by holding a vote on a ""clean"" debt-ceiling plan with no accompanying spending cuts, which passed on Tuesday because of strong Democratic support. The House result offered McConnell a face-saving chance to avoid any Senate Republicans from having to vote for the debt-ceiling measure. He and other GOP leaders urged their colleagues to let Democrats pass the House version while Republicans opposed it, but Cruz's filibuster bid meant that at least five GOP votes would be needed to prevent another Washington impasse. In a dramatic moment Wednesday on the Senate floor, McConnell and fellow GOP leader Sen. John Cornyn of Texas cast the two votes needed to reach the threshold of 60 to overcome the filibuster attempt. Other GOP colleagues then changed their votes to provide some political cover, but the damage was done. Both McConnell and Cornyn -- longtime conservatives considered Obama's harshest Senate foes -- face primary challenges from further to the right this year. Shortly after Wednesday's votes, the campaign of McConnell's primary opponent in Kentucky, tea party conservative Matt Bevin, highlighted how the senator helped defeat the filibuster against the debt limit measure. Boehner says 'never mind' on immigration . Political pragmatism . Some GOP colleagues praised Boehner and McConnell for putting party welfare ahead of personal political risk. ""It was a very courageous act, especially Sen. McConnell, who we all know is in a very tough race,"" said GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, one of the Republicans who changed his vote to help overcome the filibuster bid. ""He's the elected Republican leader and it's up to him to cast the right vote."" Fellow Republican Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska said the debt-ceiling issue had to be resolved to prevent harmful financial and political fallout. ""That's just the reality,"" he said. ""You can deal with it with 60 votes or a majority, but at the end of the day, you had to deal with it."" Cruz was unapologetic, attacking his fellow Republicans and Democrats as unresponsive to the rising federal debt. ""Today was a classic victory for Washington establishment interests, and the people who lost today were the American people,"" he said. As expected, Democrats offered a different assessment. ""A real civil war"" ""It is encouraging that some of my Republican colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said before Wednesday's votes, while fellow Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri told MSNBC that Republicans have ""a real civil war on their hands."" ""They have rigid ideologues that are pushing a very narrow agenda, a very narrow view of what America is, and then they've got a lot of Republicans that are not that extreme, and they're in a big battle right now,"" she said. ""And you see it every day around here."" To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, Cruz put his own agenda of appealing to the tea party right ahead of the GOP leadership's strategy. She noted he did the same thing to cause last year's government shutdown by trying to link federal spending to efforts to dismantle Obama's signature health care reforms, which conservatives detest. Republicans still smarting from that defeat ""are looking at Ted Cruz today and going, 'Oh my God, didn't you learn the lesson of the government shutdown?'"" Borger said, adding that ""it's about him."" CNN's Dana Bash, Ted Barrett and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Republican leaders seek the best of both worlds in election-year politics .
On the debt ceiling, they wanted to oppose an increase they knew was needed .
The goal was to avoid the ire of conservatives by getting Democrats to pass it .

"(CNN) -- Investigators believe two explosive packages found at airports in Dubai and the United Kingdom on Friday were assembled by the same bomb-maker responsible for the device used in last year's failed Christmas Day ""underwear bomb"" plot. An explosive substance called PETN was found in each of the devices, a source close the investigation has told CNN. What does PETN look like? Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, to give it its full name, is a fine white powder that resembles sugar or salt. It's a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. How easy is it to obtain? The core chemical in PETN is hard to make or get your hands on. How dangerous is PETN? In a controlled explosion carried out last year for CNN by UK explosives expert Sidney Alford, 6 grams (a fifth of an ounce) of PETN punched a large circular dent into a metal plate twice the thickness of an aircraft fuselage. Alford said he would usually expect 6 grams to punch a hole through the plate. He said it failed to happen on this occasion because half of the PETN burnt off before the explosion itself; also thick ice under the plate would have softened the impact of the blast. Alford conducts a controlled explosion of a sample of PETN for CNN . How much PETN was used in the cargo plot devices? Col. Richard Kemp, the former chairman of the British government's Cobra Intelligence Group, told CNN affiliate ITN that the quantity of PETN used in the latest devices was five times the amount which alleged underwear bomber Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab tried to ignite aboard a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit, Michigan on December 25, 2009. Sources familiar with that investigation told CNN the working assumption is that AbdulMutallab may have had some 80 grams of PETN. But Alford told CNN he calculated the latest devices could have contained up to 30 or 40 times the amount allegedly used by AbdulMutallab. ""I calculate the volume to be enough to accommodate between two-and-a-half and three-and-a-half kilos of the stuff,"" Alford said. ""That would be a murderous amount in an airplane."" American and British authorities said the explosive devices found in Dubai and the UK were powerful enough to bring down a large aircraft. How volatile is PETN? Not very. Although it is an explosive, you have to hammer it or ignite it to make it go off. This makes it perfect for transporting long distances, according to Alford. ""It wouldn't go off accidentally,"" Alford told CNN. ""If I was carrying a pocketful of just neat powder in my pocket, it blowing up would be the last of my worries."" How easy is PETN to conceal? Alford said an advantage of PETN for bomb-makers is the fact that it is easily concealed: ""A great potential advantage of powdered PETN is that it could look like a wide range of substances or be disguised as even more -- whereas plastic explosives do look suspiciously like plastic explosives."" Given its appearance and ability to be concealed, PETN is a challenge for airport security officials to detect through usual means such as metal detectors. Investigators say the latest devices were concealed within printer toner cartridges. How sophisticated are the devices found in Dubai and the UK? The device found in Dubai was ""professionally"" loaded and connected using an electric circuit to a mobile phone chip tucked in a printer, police said. The device found at the UK's East Midlands Airport contained a ""manipulated"" toner cartridge and had white powder on it as well as wires and a circuit board, a law enforcement source said. The devices were designed to be detonated by a cell phone, a source close to the investigation told CNN. ""They are getting technically better,"" said Alford, who has seen photographs of the latest devices. ""As the means of initiation appears to have been mobile telephones, they will go off wherever they happen to be when you dial the number."" But he said the circuitry was ""messy,"" and added: ""They are a bit behind the times with explosives."" CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","PETN explosive is a white powder which is hard to ignite but easy to conceal .

"New York (CNN) -- Is Rush Limbaugh becoming a relic, a human version of ""Mad Men,"" except without the style or cool clothes? Has Limbaugh become as dated as Jazzercise or ""Macarena?"" All you need to do is look at the bottom line to see that Limbaugh is in trouble. Limbaugh once raked in the big bucks for his radio syndicator, Cumulus. But last week, Cumulus CEO Lew Dickey made it clear those days are over. Dickey reported that Cumulus had lost millions of dollars in ad sales because many advertisers no longer want to be associated with Limbaugh. According to Dickey, advertisers began to pull away from Limbaugh after his February 2012 comments in which he infamously called law student Sandra Fluke a ""slut"" and a ""prostitute"" after she testified before Congress advocating birth control be covered by health insurance. Limbaugh's despicable comments were met with an avalanche of outrage and calls for corporations to stop advertising on Rush's show. How badly did this advertising boycott hurt Limbaugh's show? Well, according to the radio industry magazine ""Radio Ink,"" 48 of the 50 network advertisers for Cumulus radio have excluded Limbaugh's show from their ad orders. I'm no media expert, but that sounds really bad for Rush. What was Limbaugh's response? Was he contrite or remorseful? Nope. Instead Limbaugh lashed out last week at young women again by asserting that the reason ad sales fell off was because: ""The media buyers at advertising agencies are young women, fresh out of college-liberal feminists who hate conservatism."" Not only is this comment sexist on its face, remarkably Limbaugh apparently doesn't believe that his past antics have contributed to Cumulus' lost ad sales. In fact, a close associate of Limbaugh voiced similar sentiments to Politico last week, arguing that the loss of ad sales is not because of Limbaugh, but because the Cumulus owned radio stations are underperforming when compared with other talk radio stations. How did Limbaugh get to this place? Times have changed. Call it being PC or being more sensitive, no one can dispute that what was once acceptable in our society as humor and commentary is no longer. Sure Rush has a big audience and remains ahead of other talk radio hosts, but the advertisers who abandoned Rush appear to be on to something. Let's take a quick stroll down memory lane of Limbaugh's remarks -- all of which I wish I could have surgically removed from my memory: . 1. ""NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons,"" a comment Limbaugh made while sharing his ""insight"" on professional football. 2. ""He is exaggerating the effects of the disease ... It's purely an act."" -- Limbaugh mocking actor Michael J. Fox's struggles with Parkinson's. 3. Limbaugh claimed that President Barack Obama was disappointed that Hurricane Irene, which killed 40 people, wasn't worse: ""Obama was hoping this was going to be a disaster as another excuse for his failing economy."" 4. ""Forget calling them the NAACP. They are now the R-A-C-I-S-M. NAACP equals racism,"" Limbaugh's comments defending the smear of Shirley Sherrod by right-wing media. There are many, many more examples of these ""Limbaughisms"" through the years. Looking at these comments makes you wonder why it took so long for advertisers to wake up and smell the bigotry. So what happens if Limbaugh is booted from his current syndication deal? Limbaugh will probably find a new home on a lesser terrestrial network or possibly SiriusXM radio. My hope is that Limbaugh ends up as the in-store deejay at a Virgin megastore in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere. But then again, why should those shoppers be subjected to Rush's rants? Regardless where he turns up, Limbaugh will likely not be as relevant to the national media as he is now. All you have to do is look at the career of radio host Don Imus. Imus was fired from CBS radio in 2007 after a national furor erupted over his comments regarding the Rutgers women's basketball team that were almost universally considered racist and sexist. While Imus later found a new radio home, he was no longer the same media mover and shaker. And while Imus is still on five days a week, when is the last time you heard the national media quote Imus? Imus may just be Limbaugh's ""ghost of Christmas future."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Rush Limbaugh and his radio network are at odds .

"(CNN) -- The big winners of this Formula One season could be road drivers rather than F1 racers, according to one former world champion. Jody Scheckter, who took the drivers' title in 1979, hopes a raft of technological changes -- notably smaller, hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency -- will help improve road cars' performance. ""It's very positive for the sport, this is the first time you've seen the sport bring in regulations that really push the envelope of technology for every type of car,"" the South African told CNN. ""They are trying to take efficiency from everywhere they can on a car."" This year's race cars will boast an enhanced Energy Recovery System (ERS) and 1.6-liter V6 engines, compared to the 2.4-liter V8s on show last year. The ERS uses heat generated when braking and thermal energy from exhaust gases to create extra power. The Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) has been used in F1 since 2009, but Scheckter says these latest advancements in the sport will only benefit everyday drivers. ""Wherever there is heat, they turn that into energy,"" added the former Ferrari driver. ""From that point of view, that's what road cars are becoming more and more. ""They've taken this energy from the brakes and these different areas, that's what Formula One has done to a much higher degree than I've ever seen before. I think the technology will flow to road cars very quickly. ""It's very important for the global environment that they can make the technology work practically and then it can move into road cars."" On the track, Scheckter expects an unpredictable start to the championship as teams and drivers wrestle with the new regulations. An encouraging preseason for Mercedes has fueled talk that Lewis Hamilton is the favorite for this weekend's Australian Grand Prix and in pole position to take the title. Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in Bahrain, but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by Felipe Massa of Williams. The Brazilian is a new arrival at the British team following nine years with Ferrari and Scheckter expects Massa and Hamilton to start well, but he stopped short of tipping either to be top of the pile at the end of the season. ""If you're going to follow some of the test results then you have to think that Mercedes and Williams have got an advantage at the beginning,"" he said. ""How long it will take for other teams to catch up, who knows? ""I would've thought after the fourth, fifth race, you might see things settle down. Someone could make a modification and gain one second, two seconds per lap. That is a massive amount. So until things settle down I wouldn't want to back anybody."" The climax of the 2014 season is set to be a dramatic one, with double points set to be awarded to the driver who takes the checkered flag at November's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, with the winner of that race awarded 50 points, rather than the usual 25. It's a move that Scheckter thinks will see the fight for the world championship go down to the wire. ""What they are trying to do is make it so the last race determines the championship,"" he said. ""If somebody is quite far ahead and it looks like he's going to win the championship ... if he doesn't finish and another guy does he wins. ""Is that fair? No it's not, but it makes exciting racing. Or it makes you throw something at the TV!"" Interactive: 10 cars that changed Formula One .","The first race of the 2014 Formula One season takes place in Australia on Sunday .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray's defense team challenged the motives and methods of the prosecution's anesthesiology expert Friday, while the judge threatened to hold the defense propofol expert in contempt for comments he made about the prosecution. Dr. Steven Shafer, the last prosecution witness, will still be on the witness stand when the trial resumes Monday. Shafer testified Thursday that the ""only scenario"" to explain Michael Jackson's death was that he overdosed on propofol infused through an IV drip set up by Dr. Murray. Prosecutors argue that Murray's reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help Jackson sleep led to his death, while the defense contends Jackson self-administered the fatal dose, along with sedatives, without Murray knowing. Shafer, in his testimony Thursday, said the level of propofol in Jackson's blood taken during his autopsy could not have been from either Murray or Jackson injecting the drug, but only from an IV system that was still flowing when his heart stopped. Prosecutors, however, opened the door for one scenario in which Jackson, not Murray, could have triggered the overdose. ""Can you rule out the possibility that Michael Jackson manipulated something to cause it to flow?"" Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked Friday. ""That's a possibility,"" Shafer said. But that is assuming Murray set up the drip and left Jackson's side, he said. Would Shafer's opinion that Murray was responsible for Jackson's death change if he knew Jackson turned the drip on? ""No, if Michael Jackson had reached up, seen the roller clamp and opened it himself, this is a foreseeable consequence of setting up an essentially dangerous way of giving drugs,"" Shafer said. ""It doesn't change things at all. It would still be considered abandonment."" Lead defense lawyer Ed Chernoff decided to conduct Shafer's cross-examination instead of leaving it to Michael Flanagan, the defense team's most knowledgeable lawyer about propofol. Toxicology studies of drugs in Jackson's blood and computer models Shafer used to analyze how he died were overshadowed Friday when Chernoff focused on the personal and professional rivalry between Shafer and Dr. Paul White, the defense expert. The experts first met in 1978 when White was an assistant professor at Stanford University and Shafer was a medical student. They became friends and co-authored research papers, but this trial appears to have changed their friendship. Chernoff accused Shafer of wanting to ""shove it down his (White's) professional throat"" in a question stricken from the record by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor. White was lectured by Judge Pastor about comments about Shafer attributed to him in an online blog. White admitted Friday that he told a reporter that he had changed his opinion of Shafer after hearing his testimony Thursday. ""I was his teacher when he was a medical student,"" E! News Online quoted White as saying. ""The truth will come out. It always does."" White denied calling Shafer ""a scumbag,"" as the website quoted him as saying. Pastor, who imposed a gag order on all parties in the trial, set a contempt of court hearing for White next month. ""You are not in any way shape or form, to comment on your views regarding the state of the evidence, witnesses or your views as to any counsel in this case,"" Pastor said. Chernoff cross-examined Shafer about the assumptions he used to reconstruct an IV drip system he believed Murray set up next to Jackson's bed. Shafer demonstrated the system in his testimony Thursday. Shafer testified that he did not think it was significant that investigators never found a key component of the tubing in the system. ""It's so easy to remove,"" Shafer said. Murray appeared visibly shaken by Shafer's testimony Thursday, especially when he demonstrated his version of the IV drip. Jackson died because Murray failed to notice that his patient had stopped breathing while he was hooked up to an IV drip of propofol, Shafer testified. The doctor should have realized Jackson had stopped breathing about 11:45 a.m. on June 25, 2009, he said. ""When you're there, you see it, you know it,"" Shafer said. Phone records and testimony showed that Murray was on the phone with one of his clinics, a patient, and then a girlfriend about the time that Shafer calculated the oxygen in Jackson's lungs became depleted, causing his heart to stop beating. ""Had Conrad Murray been with Michael Jackson during this period of time, he would have seen the slowed breathing and the compromise in the flow of air into Michael Jackson's lungs, and he could have easily turned off the propofol infusion,"" Shafer said . Murray, accused of involuntary manslaughter, could have then easily cleared Jackson's airways and restored his breathing by lifting his chin, he said. Earlier testimony from paramedics and emergency room doctors said Jackson was clinically dead by the time an ambulance arrived at the pop icon's Los Angeles home nearly a half-hour after Murray realized there was a problem. The last three prosecution experts, all medical experts, focused the Murray trial on the science surrounding Jackson's death, a contrast to earlier testimony from Murray's girlfriends and Jackson employees. Shafer demonstrated how he believed Murray set up the propofol infusion by hanging a 100-milliliter vial from a stand with tubing attached that would have led to a catheter port in Jackson's left leg. ""This is the only scenario that I could generate"" that would produce the high level of propofol found in Jackson's blood during his autopsy, Shafer said. ""This fits all of the data in this case, and I am not aware of any data that is inconsistent with this explanation,"" he said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was caused by a combination of sedatives with the propofol, which Murray admitted in a police interview that he used to help Jackson sleep. The defense contends that Jackson swallowed eight lorazepam tablets, a claim based on testing of lorazepam levels in Jackson's stomach contents. Shafer discredited the defense lab tests, saying a new test showed the equivalent of only ""1/43rd of a tablet"" of the sedative in the stomach. The level of lorazepam in Jackson's blood was far higher than what would be expected based on the dosages Dr. Murray told detectives he gave Jackson in the hours before his death, Shafer said. Murray said he gave Jackson a total of 4 milligrams of lorazepam in two separate doses starting 10 hours before his death. Toxicology results indicated that Jackson was given 40 milligrams -- not four -- in a series of 10 doses, he said. Shafer testified Wednesday that Jackson would be alive now but for 17 ""egregious deviations"" by Murray from the standard of care required of physicians. Murray's use of propofol almost every night for two months to help Jackson sleep was so unusual, there is no documentation on the dangers, Shafer said. ""We are in pharmacological never-neverland here,"" Shafer said, ""something that's only been done to Michael Jackson."" The trial is expected to conclude with the start of jury deliberations possible as soon as the end of next week.","NEW: Defense anesthesiology expert faces a contempt of court hearing .

""If you go back to the original intent of the drafters ... it was never intended to bestow citizenship upon (illegal) aliens,"" said Kavanagh, who also supported Senate Bill 1070 -- the law that gave Arizona authorities expanded immigration enforcement powers.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy had secret orders this week to be ""prepared to act"" to stop a cargo ship carrying Iranian arms destined for Gaza, CNN has learned. Navy vessels in the Middle East received orders to move ""into the proximity of the ship and act if ordered,"" according to a senior U.S. military official familiar with the operation. The scenario included the possibility of boarding the ship, which was eventually stopped in the Red Sea by Israeli naval forces, who authorities said seized a cargo of Iranian rockets and missiles. A second American official confirmed that U.S. intelligence and the Israelis became aware of the effort by Iran to smuggle the weapons several days ago. The United States secretly tracked the shipment as it left Iran by air and then landed in Syria. The weapons were then shipped into Iraq and loaded at a port in southern Iraq. U.S. and Israeli intelligence grew concerned when the cargo ship in the Persian Gulf suddenly diverted from its expected heading to Sudan and suddenly turned north toward Iraq to load up. The United States does not believe the Iraqi government sanctioned the smuggling. American navy ships in the region secretly tracked the cargo down the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea and then to the Red Sea until the Israeli navy boarded the vessel before it reached Sudan, a typical point for unloading smuggled weapons. The Israeli military later showed video of the weapons with markings indicating they were made in Iran. The White House hinted at the scope of the operation, but only after it concluded. ""The White House directed the Department of Defense to monitor the vessel and to develop concepts of operation for a range of options to be prepared to take unilateral steps if necessary,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke Thursday with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon to receive what the Pentagon called a ""briefing"" from the Israelis on the operation. The Pentagon said in a statement both nations ""have been in consistent touch on Israel's interdiction operation, coordinating extensively through military and intelligence channels."" The seizure showed the United States was continuing to hold Iran ""accountable for its destabilizing activities in the region, even as we continue efforts to resolve our concerns over Iran's nuclear program through diplomacy,"" the statement said.","There were secret orders to be ""prepared"" to stop a cargo ship loaded with arms .

"Editor's note: Chris Anderson is the editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine and the author of ""FREE: The Future of a Radical Price"", published by Hyperion on July 7. The book's first printing generated controversy over failing to attribute some passages to Wikipedia, which Anderson said in his blog was a mistake and will be corrected. Chris Anderson says technology allows giants like Google to give away services. (CNN) -- When Christine Varney was confirmed in May as the Obama administration's top antitrust cop, some of her words from last year sent a chill through the Googleplex, the search engine's headquarters in Silicon Valley. During the waning days of the Bush administration, Varney worried that the government would not do enough about Google: ""I think we're going to continually see a problem, potentially, with Google, who I think so far has acquired a monopoly in Internet online advertising lawfully."" Now she's in a position to do something about it. Having a legally obtained monopoly is not a crime, but abusing it to gain unfair advantages in other markets can be. The most recent landmark cases on this in technology have been the decade-long investigations and prosecutions on Microsoft's dominance of PC software. In those cases, competitors complained that the software giant's near-monopoly on operating systems allowed it to get the upper hand in other markets, for example, by gaining an advantage on the Web through bundling Microsoft's Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows. Now Google has Microsoft-like dominance in search and search advertising. What should it not be allowed to do? That question may come to define this era of antitrust law. When Varney was confirmed, she withdrew the Bush administration's report setting relatively conservative standards of antitrust enforcement and declared, ""The Antitrust Division will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition and harm consumers."" How might Google's dominance be harming consumers? Ask makers of such items as books and newspapers and advertisers and all will say they are concerned about Google's clout and ability to act unilaterally because of its dominance. Google, meanwhile, has been on a charm offensive for the past few weeks, emphasizing how easy it is for consumers to switch to other search engines and how small it is compared to other companies that have been in a similar position in the past, such as Microsoft, AT&T and IBM. The Web is still a new territory, with the boundary lines of markets in flux. At least in the Microsoft case, we knew what an ""operating system"" and ""Web browser"" were. But on the Web, where software is a Web site, not something you buy in a box, and everything is just one click away from everything else, core antitrust concepts such as ""lock-in"" and ""barriers to entry"" will have to be redefined. One of the most interesting issues that Varney will have to face is Google's use of free. This is not 20th Century ""free,"" as in ""buy one, get one free"" or ""free gift inside."" Instead, it's really Free (let's dignify it with a capital F), something that's only possible in the digital age, where costs are close to zero. Like many Web companies, Google gives away most of what it does. Its searches are free, as are its e-mail, maps, online word processor and spreadsheet, and nearly 300 other products, from directory assistance (GOOG411) to Google Earth. This use of Free is part of its ""max strategy"" -- it uses Free to get its products in the hands of the greatest number of users, and then figures out some way to get money from them (mostly with ads, but sometimes with ""pro"" versions of the services, in which users can pay for more storage or features, using the ""freemium"" business model). Google can give away so much because the incremental cost of serving one more Web page to one more user is almost nothing -- and falling as technology gets cheaper. This is the difference between the ""bits economy"" and the ""atoms economy."" The marginal cost of production for digital things is so low that Free becomes not just a marketing gimmick but the default price in most markets, driven by economic forces as real online as gravity is in the real world. But companies still have to make money, so there are limits to how much they can provide free. Not a problem for Google. Its core advertising business is so powerful, dominant and profitable that it can subsidize almost everything else the company does, using Free to get customers in new markets. Is that fair, when so many of its competitors don't have a similar golden goose at the core of their operations? The analogy is something like the semiconductor battles of the 1980s, when Japanese companies were accused of ""dumping"" (selling for under cost) memory chips in the U.S. market to drive out U.S. competitors. Any time you are giving away a product, you are by definition selling it for less than cost (even if the cost is just a fraction of a cent). Note that no court or regulator has yet suggested that there's anything remotely like this going on in the use of Free online. But when Varney starts looking at ways that Google is using its search dominance to win new markets, its use of Free is going to have to be one of the things she considers. Could Free be OK for little companies, but not really big ones? How much market share would you have to have in one market to disallow you from using Free in another? As she digs into this, she may find that it takes her back to Microsoft itself. As entrepreneur Alex Iskold has pointed out, Google is using the profits from its search advertising dominance to fund its competition with Microsoft in word processors and spreadsheets (Google Docs). Microsoft, meanwhile, is doing just the opposite: using the profits from its dominance of word processors and spreadsheets (Microsoft Office) to subsidize its competition with Google in search (Microsoft Bing). In each case, the companies are using a highly profitable paid product to make another product free, on the hopes of gaining market share by taking price off the table. The difference this time is that Google is the dominant player, and at least as far as search goes, Microsoft is a struggling upstart. Confused yet? Then spare a thought for Varney. She not only has to figure out what markets need protection, but also how to do that (to say nothing of the poignant irony of Microsoft complaining about unfair monopolies). Tough job. Who would have thought that there was anything not to like about Free? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chris Anderson.","Chris Anderson: Obama's antitrust chief concerned about Google's power .

"(CNN) -- Stalin was to the point. Napoleon went on and on. Hitler did it as if he were writing an employee's job review. ""Evil may walk among us, but that doesn't mean evil never wrote a love letter,"" said John Kirkland, an author who has plundered the depths of cheesy writing throughout history by revered, infamous and just plain awful people. His book ""Love Letters of Great Men"" is mostly filled with leaders acting honorably. But it also features several who had an affection for tyranny. ""I found that almost all powerful people are very passionate, and that naturally can make them over the top in their personal lives,"" Kirkland said. ""Another truth I learned,"" the author said, ""is that it's never a good idea to hook up with a dictator."" Nadya Stalin's family sheltered Joseph Stalin after one of his escapes from Siberian exile during 1911, and the two reconnected later when she worked as a clerk in Vladimir Lenin's office. Their romance began when she was a teenager. When they married in 1919, he was 41. They had a boy, Vasily, and a girl, Svetlana. It's unclear exactly what the brown-eyed young woman saw in the stout and swarthy older man. Perhaps she developed an attachment to him when she was a child, or maybe it was because she too was a diehard Bolshevik. Like Stalin, she had an unpredictable temper and exceptionally bold political ambitions, especially for a woman of her time, rising up eventually through party ranks to pull her own weight. While historians describe her as conservative in dress and manner -- at least publicly -- Stalin wore his heart on his sleeve for his wife. In June 1930, Stalin was busy revamping the Soviet Union's economy, which led to millions of people being deported and exiled and a catastrophic famine. His plans would later lead to the slaughter of millions. He wrote to his wife, using his pet name for her, while she was away having her headaches treated in Germany. ""I miss you so much Tatochka. ... I'm as lonely as a horned owl."" The dictator didn't discuss his job in letters to his wife, Kirkland said. ""I'm not going out of town on business,"" Stalin wrote. ""I'm just finishing up my work and then I'm going to go out of town to the children tomorrow ... so goodbye, don't be too long, come home sooner! My kisses! Your Joseph."" She replied to him by writing, ""I am kissing you passionately."" While Stalin's letters were lengthy in the beginning of their courtship, he sometimes wrote the equivalent of a refrigerator Post-It to his wife. ""I forgot to send the money, but I've now sent it (120 roubles) with colleagues leaving today,"" he wrote. ""Kiss you, Joseph."" Their correspondence flew back and forth quickly, carried by secret police couriers, writes historian Simon Sebag Montifiore, author of ""Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar."" Nadya and Stalin were an explosive match, both quick to anger and not afraid to snap at each other at dinner parties. They had epic fights. In 1926, she took the kids to Leningrad and he begged her to come back, so she did. ""Both were selfish, cold with fiery tempers, though she had none of his cruelty and duplicity,"" Montifiore wrote. The two fought one night at a party. She ended up dead by dawn of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Russian officials told the public she died of illness. Some people believe Stalin killed her. Loving Benito Mussolini ended similarly for Ida Dalser, a beautician who some sources say was his first wife. The Italian tyrant ordered her and their son, Benito Jr., institutionalized. But in the beginning, it was all kisses and sweetness. He called her ""my little friend"" and signed a letter ""your wild friend and lover."" ""My little Ida,"" he wrote, ""I have just arrived after twelve endless hours on a train that left me completely covered in soot. I washed it off as best as I could and my first thought, even before going to dinner, is you. Are you pleased? Will you say, once again, that you alone love me, while I don't love you? I love you too, my dear Ida, even though I haven't been able to prove it to you."" Another letter: ""How happy I would have been to have you with me, today, while the train was racing along under a cloudless sky, through a countryside displaying all of autumn's melancholic seduction, towards this beautiful Rome which appeared before me just as the sunset was setting ablaze the horizon of the seven hills of the Eternal City."" ""When they met, he was pretty much a nobody, enlisting and heading off to World War I,"" said Kirkland. ""After the war, his career takes off. He has his minions declare her insane, locks her and her son up and she dies."" Josephine de Beauharnais was much more in control of her relationship with Napoleon Bonaparte, a notoriously temperamental military commander. Kirkland said that the French emperor seemed to perform better in battle when Josephine returned his smothering affection. ""She wore the pants,"" the author said. ""He was completely in love and obsessed with her."" Shortly after they were married, Napoleon left to command the French army near Italy. Much of his correspondence to Josephine bordered on begging, particularly in April 1796. He wanted her to join him closer to battle so they could have a honeymoon. ""I have your letters of the 16th and 21st. There are many days when you don't write. What do you do, then? No, my darling, I am not jealous, but sometimes worried. Come soon; I warn you, if you delay, you will find me ill. Fatigue and your absence are too much."" ""Your letters are the joy of my days, and my days of happiness are not many,"" he writes, saying that he's racked with ""hopeless sorrow, inconsolable misery, sadness without end."" ""But you are coming, aren't you? You are going to be here beside me, in my arms, on my breast, on my mouth? Take wing and come, come! A kiss on your heart, and one much lower down, much lower!"" Napoleon appears to have written multiple letters on the same day, like a guy who leaves a half dozen increasingly desperate voice mails back to back. ""I am going to bed with my heart full of your adorable image. ... I cannot wait to give you proofs of my ardent love,"" he writes in November 1796. ""... How happy I would be if I could assist you at your undressing, the little firm white breast, the adorable face, the hair tied up in a scarf a la creole. You know that I will never forget the little visits, you know, the little black forest. ... I kiss it a thousand times and wait impatiently for the moment I will be in it. To live within Josephine is to live in the Elysian fields. Kisses on your mouth, your eyes, your breast, everywhere, everywhere."" Most of Napoleon's letters were flowery, as were those of the many other leaders in Kirkland's book. ""Almost everyone was descriptive and seemed to put a lot of care into what they wrote,"" he said. ""Except Hitler."" Eva Braun met Adolf Hitler in Munich when she was a teenager. By every standard, Braun had a terrible experience. She tried to kill herself twice during their relationship. She was married to the Fuhrer for only 40 hours before she bit a capsule of cyanide in his bunker and they both died there in April 1945. There are no surviving letters between the two. But there are accounts, Kirkland said, of what Hitler said about Braun to his inner circle. Braun had a ""calm, intelligent and objective way of being,"" Hitler remarked. ""There's a coldness, like he's evaluating her,"" said Kirkland. ""He controlled everything."" Perhaps the only control Napoleon had over Josephine was that he gave her that name. Her real name was Rose. And Rose lost interest in her French fighter not long after they married. During the First Italian Campaign, according to a PBS documentary, rumors reached Napoleon that Josephine was cheating on him. When he returned to her home in Milan, she wasn't there. Historians believe she might have taken off with her lover. Napoleon waited for nine days for her to come back and wrote, ""I don't love you anymore; on the contrary, I detest you. You are a vile, mean, beastly slut."" No couples therapy could help them. Napoleon grew resentful and took a lover -- and kept taking them -- while Josephine came back to him and tried to persuade him to stay with her. But his ego was trampled and he divorced her, claiming that that was best for France. Napoleon married a 19-year-old who bore him a son. In 1814, a coalition of enemies invaded France. Napoleon went off to war, lost and was exiled. He learned that the love of his life had died of a cold by reading about it in a newspaper. Napoleon locked himself in a room for two days. For the rest of his life he wore a locket around his neck containing tiny violets he gathered in Josephine's garden.","Stalin to his wife: ""I miss you. ... I'm as lonely as a horned owl""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British confectioner Cadbury has recalled all of its Chinese-made candy products over fears that they may be contaminated with the chemical melamine, a company statement said Monday. ""The products that are affected by this withdrawal include a range of Cadbury chocolate products and Choclairs, all produced in our Beijing plant,"" Cadbury said in a statement. Some or all of the products were exported to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, the Pacific island of Nauru and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, according to the company. Cadbury said that it is implementing new food safety and quality checks at its Beijing plant and that fresh candies will be manufactured. The candy maker is the latest company to get caught up in China's tainted-milk scandal. Melamine was first found in powdered infant formula but has since been traced to dozens of other products. Nearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine. Four babies have died, and five Hong Kong children have suffered melamine-related illnesses. Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products.  Watch how scare affects companies outside China » . Chinese police have arrested 40 people in the tainted-milk scandal, including 22 announced Monday in northern China's Hebei province. Nineteen of those were managers of pastures, breeding farms and milk-purchasing stations, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing a panel investigating the case. Authorities say they raided 41 locations in Hebei and seized 490 pounds (222 kilograms) of melamine. Eighteen arrests were announced earlier. They include two brothers who face charges of selling contaminated milk. The brothers could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down, and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants have added it to milk products to make it seem to have a higher protein level. Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year. Health experts say that ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition. The following 11 products are included in the recall, according to Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety: . • Cadbury Dark Chocette, 45 grams. • Cadbury Dark Chocette, 80 grams. • Cadbury Eclairs, 180 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Pumpkin, 150 grams. • Cadbury Dark Chocolate, 40 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dark Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate Bulk Pack, 5 kilograms. • Cadbury Hazelnut Praline Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 312 grams. • Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate (2008 Chinese New Year), 300 grams.","All recalled products produced in Cadbury's Beijing plant .

"(CNN) -- Jeffrey Ian Pollack, who directed the popular 1990s films ""Booty Call"" and ""Above the Rim"" and produced ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" was found dead on Monday police said. He was 54. A spokesperson for the Hermosa Beach Police Department confirmed to CNN on Thursday that an unidentified woman informed authorities that there was a man down on a walking trail in Hermosa Beach, California, early on December 23. Police responding to the scene found Pollack on the ground by the side of the walking/running path near a tree. According to authorities Pollack, who was reportedly an avid runner, was not alive at the time he was discovered. He was found wearing a jogging outfit and with a music player. While the cause of death has not yet been determined, police said they do not suspect foul play. In addition to producing ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" starring actor Will Smith, Pollack was a business partner of superstar manager Benny Medina who was the inspiration for the series. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Pollack and Medina formed a company which became Handprint Entertainment whose management clients included celebs Mariah Carey, Tyra Banks and Jennifer Lopez. The company reportedly folded in 2008. Pollack also worked with Jeff Beacher, the creator of the Beacher's Madhouse variety shows which were performed at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. The show has been revamped for a new version with Miley Cyrus hosting and opening December 27 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. ""He was my best friend and partner for a decade,"" Beacher said in a statement. ""He was my brother and father in one. Words can't describe how I feel right now.""

"(CNN) -- Like many of us, James Logan knows what it's like to forget his phone. From time to time, he leaves his cell phone in the office overnight, which can be irritating in this age of constant communication. ""It was kind of a personal problem for me,"" he said. ""I tend to forget lots of things, and I thought I wasn't the only person having this problem."" But now Logan has come up with what he says is a solution for those lapses: A small gadget called Bringrr. The device, which will go on sale later this month, stays in a car's power port and alerts its owners with a buzzing tone -- ""brrring, brrring!"" -- if they've left their phone behind. Bringrr joins a number of other devices and services that employ more technology to try to help tech-enabled people locate the gadgets they've lost. Apple's MobileMe software and products called Phone Halo and ZOMM are also trying to accomplish similar feats. Some say that because mobile phones are getting relatively expensive, with smartphones retailing for hundreds of dollars, these emerging technologies are more useful or necessary for consumers. ""These phones aren't cheap, and increasingly, our lives are tied to them,"" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, a technology consulting firm. ""Without my cell phone, I'm kind of lost, so leaving it behind is a significant problem for me."" Logan, who also founded Gotuit Media (an internet video company whose clients include Turner, the parent company of CNN), was able to test his hypothesis that other people lost their phones often with a survey last summer. The company polled 205 consumers in office buildings and shopping malls in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. They asked people in the unscientific survey how often they forgot their phones and how much they would pay to be able to stop leaving them behind. Overall, 80 percent of those surveyed said that forgetting their phones was a problem. Thirty percent said they would pay $29 or more to fix it. ""We came back with these results that were quite startling to us,"" said Logan. ""That's when it was full steam ahead."" The benefits of each of these new phone-location products depend on the problem the user is trying to solve, Enderle said. Since Bringrr plugs into a cigarette lighter or power port, it works best for people who drive frequently. The small gadget pairs with your cell phone so that when you start your car, it starts searching for your phone's Bluetooth signal. If Bringrr detects it, it makes a short, ""reassuring"" noise and emits a blue light. But if you've forgotten your phone, Bringrr, which retails for $35, will flash red and sound a warning that reminds you to go back to get your phone. It's a setup that works for Enderle, who says he almost never misplaces his phone but often forgets to bring it with him. ""My problem is that I always forget to pull it out of my charger in the morning and put it in my belt,"" he said. If you need help finding your charger, too, there's also a gadget for that: . A category of Bluetooth-enabled ""phone leashes"" can help users keep tabs on their phones. One, called Phone Halo, combines Bluetooth and GPS technology to keep your phone or other items, including chargers, in a designated range. It can also track misplaced items to help you find them. ""My wife has a habit of leaving the phone around and searching all over the house for it. On vibrate, it can be a real problem,"" said Enderle. ""If you have a habit of leaving things around the house, maybe go with Phone Halo."" Phone Halo costs about $60. Another phone tether, ZOMM, retails for slightly more, at about $80. Users attach ZOMM to their key chains, and the device alerts them if their phone gets too far away from their present location. The gadgets may not be foolproof, though. Bringrr's Logan says the key chain alerts can result in ""false alarms,"" such as when you leave your keys in your jacket pocket while carrying your phone with you to a meeting. Bringrr is less of a leash and more like ""taking attendance at school,"" he said. Like a teacher taking roll, it makes sure that your phone is present in your car. Meanwhile, Bringrr likely won't work for people who take public transit or cabs instead of driving cars. A phone leash such as the Phone Halo or ZOMM, for example, might have prevented Mashable.com writer Christina Warren from losing her iPhone in a taxi cab about four months ago. But Bringrr wouldn't have worked in that situation. As it was, Warren didn't have any of these devices, so she had to buy a new phone for $500, she says. After that, she decided to look into yet another way for people to track their phones -- a location-based software called MobileMe. She purchased MobileMe account from Apple for $99 a year, and she download the companion ""Find My iPhone"" app. The program allows you to track the GPS coordinates of an iPhone after it has been stolen or lost. ""It was one of those peace-of-mind issues,"" said Warren. ""I think that once you go through the experience of losing your phone -- especially if you rely on it for a lot of your communications -- the need [for a reminder device] becomes a lot more clear."" Some of the phone leashes have various additional features. ZOMM includes a speakerphone with a noise-canceling microphone and personal safety device. Bringrr Charge, set to ship in August, will double as a cell phone charger. Bringrr Systems is also working on expanding its catalog. Some consumer electronics make life more complicated instead of simpler, but these phone reminders can reduce stress, according to Enderle. ""Leaving your cell phone behind can be everything from annoying to potentially catastrophic,"" he added. ""If you had an accident or had to call for help and left your phone behind, that's when you would miss a device like this."" Warren points out that today's users store more data on their phones. Find My iPhone allows users not only to track and locate their phone but to lock or remotely wipe the device. ""When you lose [your phone], it's a really horrible experience -- not just when you have to replace it, but when it's gone and you don't know where it is,"" said Warren. ""When you use it for everything, finding your phone becomes really important.""","Bringrr alerts its owners with a buzzing tone if they've left their phone behind .

"(CNN) -- After hours of chewing over how to deal with Russia's annexation of Crimea, EU heads have added a further 12 individuals to their blacklist. The list -- adding to an initial 21 person-one long penned on Monday-- is to be released on day two of their Brussels summit. Its first incarnation, presented to European leaders for discussion on Thursday night, included figures close to the Kremlin, an EU union official said. Notable on the list are Valentina Matvienko, speaker of Russia's upper house, as well as the country's deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, CNN has learned. The inclusion of Rogozin, in particular, the official said, was almost blocked by Cyprus and Slovakia. They were fearful of the fallout from naming one of Russia's top politicians. Yet there was a sense that, as an outspoken critic of the West, Rogozin -- like others targeted -- deserved reprimand, the source said. Malta also expressed concern about an unnamed candidate for sanctions, but withdrew its objection. CNN also understands that family members -- thought to be key to the efficacy of any measures -- were not considered amid questions about the legality of such a move and the viability of placing travel bans on individuals, who in some instances are already residents inside the EU. Those expecting swathes of Russian industry to feel the brunt of Europe's indignation may be disappointed. For sources say that no chief executives of the country's largest companies, like Gazprom, Rosneft and VTB Bank, will feature on the additional file. Russian President Vladimir Putin's chief of staff Sergey Ivanov and his minister of defense Sergey Shoigu were not written into the documentation, prepared for Europe's leaders ahead of their meetings, for fear of sending a bellicose signal to Russia. Though, because of their stature, there was debate about placing them back on, the aide said. Advisers to the Russian president, Vladislav Surkov and Sergey Glazyev, both of whom also face US sanctions, were set to be targeted by the EU as well. Some subject to EU sanctions also find themselves on two lists released by the US this week. Europe has had difficulty in matching America's action against Russia on Ukraine because each move requires ratification by all 28 member states.","EXCLUSIVE: EU blacklist contains senior Russian politicians .

"(CNN) -- A recent wave of violence caused by turf wars between rival drug cartels and security forces in Mexico has kept many American and international tourists away from the United States' neighbor to the south. Recently, the U.S. State Department broaded its travel warning for Mexico, singling out 11 states and warning Americans not to drive at nighttime. But a top Mexican tourism official says the country's major tourists spots are ""perfectly safe."" Mexico Tourism Board's Chief Operating Officer Rodolfo Lopez Negrete recently visited the United States to promote Mexican destinations. In an interview with CNN, he said he is confident that more tourists will visit Mexico this year. CNN: How much was tourism affected by the violence last year? Rodolfo Lopez Negrete: 2010 was a very good year for Mexico. We considered it to be a rebound year. (More than) 22 million tourists visited Mexico last year. CNN: I was recently in Acapulco and I noticed that a lot of the hotels that normally this time of the year receive spring breakers, mainly from the United States, are completely empty. So, some of the things that you're telling me do not correspond to the reality I saw there. Lopez: We're working on a transformation program for Acapulco to rehabilitate Costera Miguel Aleman [the avenue that runs along the bay] which is one of the landmarks of Acapulco. We're working on additional air connectivity out of the U.S. market and international points of origin. CNN: But Mr. Lopez, the main problem in Acapulco is not necessarily infrastructure, but the violence. What are the Mexican government and the Tourism Board doing to solve this problem? Lopez: Mexico is a very large country. When you take into account the distance between Ciudad Juarez [the most violent city in Mexico] and Cancun, you're talking about 1,400 miles of distance. Puerto Vallarta is 1,000 miles away and Los Cabos about 1,600 miles away. That is equivalent to the distance between New York and Houston or New York and Dallas. CNN: But the fact still remains that violence is a serious problem in Mexico. Wouldn't you agree? Lopez: Yes we agree, and we understand the fact that these episodes have created a certain level of perception that is undesirable, but these have occurred in very specific pockets of the country. Opinion: Why Mexico's violence is America's problem . CNN: Your office says that 22.4 million travelers visited Mexico last year. What is the expectation for this year? Lopez: We have a plan that we have put together until the year 2018. Mexico would like to become one of the most popular destinations in the world. And although we already rank among the top 10 in the world, we would like to escalate that number. For 2011 our goal is to increase our business from 22.4 to 26 million tourists. CNN: Are Americans still visiting Mexico? Lopez: Seventy-five percent of the total number of last year's 22.4 million visitors originated in North America. The U.S. remains the number one market, followed by Canada. CNN: What about those traveling specifically by air? Lopez: Out of the 10 million tourists that we get by air into the different Mexican destinations, the United States generates 6.5 million of those 10 million. U.S. warns of travel on Mexican buses . CNN: What do you say to people abroad who watch news about the violence and have concerns about traveling to Mexico? Lopez: We would like to tell the untold story. Although we have experienced violence, it has been concentrated in very specific parts of the country. The major tourism destinations are perfectly safe, whether you talk about sun-and-beach resorts or inland destinations. CNN: What about risks for those traveling into Mexico by land? Lopez: We have 50 million border crossings per year. When you take that into account, the ratio or the number of people that have suffered from violence is really minimal. CNN: Has affordability been affected by the recent wave of violence? Lopez: Mexico is a very diversified country. We believe that the combination of the fantastic sun-and-beach resorts coupled with the wonderful cultural wealth that we offer make it a very attractive destination for summer travel. From a value perspective, the quality of the tourism options in Mexico over the last 10 years has improved dramatically. If you compare that with the price that we're charging right now, it makes it a very attractive proposition for travel.","This week, the U.S. State Department expanded its travel warning for Mexico .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thousands of Thai riot police faced off against anti-government demonstrators in Bangkok Friday as they attempted to seize sites occupied by protesters for months. Security forces only succeeded in narrowing the areas held by protesters in some parts of the city, but vowed to return to continue their efforts Saturday. The stand-offs passed without serious violence, although a journalist sustained minor injuries when a protester near Government House threw a firecracker. Demonstrators opposed to the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra have been camped out since November at sites including Government House -- the office of the prime minister and appointed cabinet ministers -- and the government complex in the Chaengwattana area of Bangkok's suburbs. But Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security chief, told CNN that enough was enough. ""Public sentiment now is 'That's enough.' It has gone beyond peaceful protest,"" he said. The protesters' actions were blocking public access to government services, making intervention by authorities necessary, he said. ""We are going to enforce the law against protesters in certain areas."" While security forces succeeded in seizing only some of the territory held by protesters, he said they would be back tomorrow. ""We have withdrawn our forces and will go back there again tomorrow,"" said Paradon. ""We were there to express our seriousness that we have to retake the area, (or) at least open up the roads for public."" He said he did not expect events to turn violent, saying his approach was to attempt negotiations before sending in teams to retake the area. READ MORE: After disrupting Thailand elections, protesters vow to continue . Protesters have been calling for the ouster of Yingluck, whom they allege is a puppet of her billionaire brother, the deposed, exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The protests were sparked in November by her government's attempt to pass an amnesty bill, that would have paved the way for her brother's return to the political fray in earnest. Yingluck called general elections on February 2 in an attempt to bring an end to the crisis. But the opposition Democrat Party boycotted the polls and protesters blocked officials from gathering ballots and obstructed voter registration in many constituencies. Thailand's Constitutional Court ruled this week that there were insufficient grounds to consider a petition filed by lawyer Wiratana Kalayasiri, a former MP for the Democrat Party, seeking the annulment of the elections.

"(CNN) -- If Kerry Drake missed his connecting flight, he wouldn't get to the hospital in time to say goodbye to his mother. Drake got the news on the morning of January 24 that his mother, who had been ill for years from rheumatoid arthritis and had been especially sick the last four months, was dying. To get to his mother in Lubbock, Texas, the San Francisco resident booked a United Airlines flight, with only 40 minutes between connecting flights in Houston. When his first flight was delayed, Drake thought he would miss his connecting flight to Lubbock, the last one of the day. Sometimes, airlines go the extra mile . He started crying, obviously distraught. The flight attendants brought napkins for his tears, said they would do what they could to help, and most importantly, got his connecting flight information to the captain, he told CNN. When he got off the airport train and was running toward the gate, ""I was still like maybe 20 yards away when I heard the gate agent say, 'Mr. Drake, we've been expecting you,'"" he said. The captain had radioed ahead . With the information from the flight attendants, the captain had radioed ahead about Drake's situation, and the Lubbock crew had delayed departure to get him on board. Until that point, Drake had been rushing on adrenaline to make the flight. Finally sitting on that second airplane, he realized how much had gone into helping him get on that plane. ""I was overcome with emotion,"" he said. Even his luggage arrived on time. The Houston ground crew made sure of it. He made it to the hospital in time to see his mother. ""At one point she opened her eyes, and I think she recognized me,"" said Drake, who spent the night at the hospital.

"(CNN) -- The new Kindle Paperwhite isn't the perfect character. Just like the literary creations that live and die on its screen, it has flaws. It's wise, though it still suffers from memories of its past. But in the great e-reader saga, it's clearly the protagonist, and one worth rooting for. The Paperwhite's screen is brilliant in the literal sense of the word, as it glows. The new Kindle isn't the first e-reader with a screen that lights up: Barnes & Noble beat Amazon to the punch by five months with its Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight. But the light-up screen on the new Kindle surpasses the one on the Nook because it solves most (but not all) of the light uniformity issues evident on the earlier device.. Granted, illuminating an e-ink screen is difficult. The most common solution is to use a nano-printed ""light guide"" â€” the LEDs sit at the bottom of the device, and a thin plastic screen with tiny patterns etched into it carries the light toward the middle and top of the display. The scores gradually disperse the beams, allowing more light to permeate to the top as the nano guides get further form the light source. This creates an even distribution of soft light, and the whole screen gently glows. It's much less fatiguing than a back-lit screen (like a tablet) and is more comfortable during late-night reading sessions. But, like the Nook, the light source creates a problem: blossoms of LED light appear at the bottom of the screen. It's fainter than the light-source bleed found on the Nook, but it's still there. It's only annoying at the bottom of the screen, but it breaks up the flow of an otherwise flawless screen. Fortunately, the attention Amazon has paid to the rest of the screen makes up for these lighting hiccups. Text on the Kindle Paperwhite is darker and crisper than what I've seen on previous-generation Kindles. Also, the background color of the screen is lighter than previous Kindles. It's less ""cardboard"" and more ""coffee with too much milk."" Amazon says the Paperwhite has 25 percent more contrast. Without busting out the contrast spectrometer to test Amazon's claim, I'm going to go with what I can see, and when compared to my last-generation Kindle, it's clear Amazon has indeed increased the contrast of the screen. But this isn't just a screen you look at; it's one you touch. Amazon has added a finish to the capacitive screen that feels like the paper stock used in high-end hardcover books. It's a small detail, and if it were absent, it wouldn't detract from the e-reader. But, it's a nice touch that gives the screen a tactile feel not found on other e-readers. One thing I would've liked to have seen on the Paperwhite: physical page-turn buttons. Touchscreens are great and all, but when you end up losing your place in a book, all the touchy-swipey technology in the world can't sway my belief that sometimes, a physical button is better. Even without buttons, the physical execution of the Paperwhite puts it ahead of the competition. It's light, eminently pocketable, and presents the best electronic reading experience. So the fact that Amazon raised the bar with updates to the Kindle's software feature set is just gravy on the cake. Page turning is simplified. The screen is divided into three sectors. Tap one sector to navigate forward, one to navigate backward, and one to bring up the menu. The ""page forward"" sector gets the largest swath of real estate, encompassing the bottom 80 percent of the screen and 80 percent of the right-hand side. The left 20 percent is reserved to go back a page. This layout make sense, considering most touches are to advance a book. The remaining top 20 percent of the screen is reserved for access to the system menu. After a few missed taps while trying to find the sweet spot, I was able to navigate to the next page while holding the Kindle in my left hand. I'm a big guy with large hands, so reaching over that 20 percent portion of screen with my thumb is easy. Your tapping mileage may vary. The underlying platform is really the true make-it-or-break-it feature of any e-reader, and Amazon has this dialed. Your current location in the book in displayed in the lower left-hand corner. More impressive is the e-reader's ability to learn your reading speed and give you information on how long it will take you to finish a chapter, or the entire book. I used this ""Time to Read"" feature at night to help determine if I should stay up another 45 minutes to finish a chapter or just go to sleep. The X-Ray feature that premiered on the Kindle Fire is also available on the Paperwhite. It's an incredibly helpful way to keep track of the hundreds of characters in fantasy novels (or just the five characters in a regular book). I found it especially helpful when reading multiple books in a series like ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" and I needed help determining which guy was doing the beheading. And it's easy to get trapped reading multiple books at once, thanks to Amazon's ecosystem. Not just the blockbusters (everyone has those), but the Kindle Singles, the sample chapters, the periodicals, the textbooks, the lending services. Nobody can compete with the online retailer's services, or the breadth of its catalog. Amazon Prime subscribers get access to books that can be borrowed for no additional cost. And all of this is accessible from the Kindle's built-in bookstore â€” which is serviceable, though it's still easier to shop on a real computer. The Kindle Paperwhite starts at $120. That's for the Wi-Fi-only, ad-supported model. You can get the ad-free Kindle for $140, but since you never see an ad in-book (only on the sleep screen, or when browsing your library) it doesn't really matter. In fact, my test unit eventually ended up showing me something I wanted to buy. Throw in free worldwide 3G connectivity, and the prices jump to $180 and $200. It's useful if you're buying books while sitting on the beach in Italy. Otherwise, save yourself some money and go Wi-Fi. I should also point out that Barnes & Noble just dropped the light-up Nook's price to $120 â€” and that's without ads. But I'd still recommend the Kindle Paperwhite. It has the better software features, the stellar screen, and the unstoppable ecosystem. It keeps its crown as king of the e-readers.

"(CNN) -- He returned to a hero's welcome but this was a night to forget for Didier Drogba. Feted by all those inside Stamford Bridge, Drogba stood and took in the applause from those in Chelsea blue. One of the greatest player's in the club's history, Drogba's spot kick in Munich, which secured the 2011 Champions League title, will never be forgotten. But once the presentations were over and the mutual love was placed to one side, Drogba's former teammates moved onto a different stratosphere. From the moment Samuel Eto'o gave Chelsea a fourth minute leader, there was only one side which appeared likely to win this contest -- and unfortunately for Drogba, it was not Galatasaray. Gary Cahill smashed home a second just before halftime following some dreadful defending from the visiting side to end any thoughts Drogba may have had of a happy homecoming. Before the game, all the talk had been about the returning Drogba -- a man loved by all at Chelsea, especially by manager, Jose Mourinho. The Ivorian netted 157 goals in 342 appearances during an eight-year spell at Chelsea where he won three Premier League titles and four FA Cups. Mourinho believes Drogba will one day return to west London either in a playing, coaching or ambassadorial position. But any sign of sentimentality was swept away as soon as the first ball was kicked. Following the 1-1 draw in Istanbul, Chelsea wasted little time in asserting its superiority. A weekend defeat in the Premier League by Aston Villa in which Ramires and Willian were both sent off, was shunted aside as Chelsea began at rapid pace. Oscar and Eden Hazard combined to release Eto'o and the forward fired past Fernando Muslera to claim the 30th Champions League goal of his career. Chelsea, which faces Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday, continued to dominate and John Terry volleyed inches over after meeting Frank Lampard's cross. Galatasaray's vulnerability at set-pieces was to prove its undoing just before the interval when Lampard's corner picked out Terry and when the defender's powerful header was saved, Cahill was quickest to react and slam home the rebound. The Turkish side, which showed such defiance in the first leg, failed to threaten any sort of fightback after the break with Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech a mere spectator. Substitute Fernando Torres should have added a third after being played through by Hazard by Muslera pulled off the save. ""It was everything we wanted it to be,"" midfielder Lampard told ITV. ""It was a tough game, we got a decent result out there and they hardly threatened."" The midfielder is now hoping his side receives a favorable draw in the next round with the likes of Bayern Munich and Barcelona lurking. ""I won't make any predictions yet,"" he added. ""There are number of great teams left in it and we'll wait and see who we get drawn . against. ""We're confident at the minute but it's very tough and gets tougher every year. But we're still in it."" Rampant Ronaldo . In the night's other game, Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to give Real Madrid a 3-1 home win over Schalke. Leading 6-1 from the first leg, Ronaldo took his tally to 13 goals in seven Champions League appearances with a classy double.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Michelle Obama turned the campaign trail into a runway this year, sporting eye-catching colors and feminine cuts that sent fashion bloggers buzzing. Future first lady Michelle Obama hugs one of her favorite designers, Maria Pinto. As she coupled chic designer splurges with off-the-rack goodies from J. Crew, H&M, White House/Black Market and Target, fashion spectators say her ability to make a strong statement on a budget sends an important message during tough economic times. ""Michelle Obama can't be too over the top; she has to be recession chic all the way,"" style expert Mary Alice Stephenson said. In a soured economy, the choices she made throughout the campaign show that ""she gets it,"" Stephenson said. And it's inspiring American women to emulate her style. ""What she has worn in the last year has really caused a seismic reaction in the fashion community, and also retailers are depending on her,"" Stephenson said. ""The choices she has made have set fire to slumps in retail that we've seen because of the recession.""  Watch the buzz on Obama fashion and a favorite designer » . There is such a demand for information on Obama's style and outfits that there is a Web site dedicated to that theme: MrsO.org. It promises a regular look at who and what she's wearing. Obama's urban chic wardrobe is a style turn from the sometimes matronly choices made by other first ladies. It's also elevated the status of designers whose clothes she wears, especially Chicago's own Maria Pinto, the woman behind some of Obama's most notable looks. The prices of Pinto's outfits may not fit all recession-squeezed budgets. Her collections are sold at Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys New York and Takashimaya. Her signature scarves sell for $300, and gowns may be priced at $1,200 to $5,000. But her designs have served the future first lady well during historic moments of her husband's campaign. The coat Obama wore in Springfield, Illinois, when her husband announced his candidacy, the purple sheath she donned the night she fist-bumped her husband when he clinched the nomination, the teal number she sported at the Democratic convention in August: all Pinto creations. ""Sometimes I have no idea what she'll be wearing until I see it on television,"" said Pinto, whose 92-year-old mother had to call her to ask, ""is that your dress Michelle is wearing?"" when Obama, wearing a red dress, accompanied the president-elect to the White House to meet President Bush and first lady Laura Bush just days after the election. ""I am very attracted to colors, because I think it really lifts our spirit. It flatters a woman. Even if you're wearing a dark suit, it's important to have color to lift up mood. I try to take into consideration women's needs, and it has to be low-maintenance and still fulfill an element of beauty and longevity. I think wardrobe is an investment, and the pieces that I create have that quality and workmanship that is timeless."" Pinto's been fortunate. She's spent a lifetime building up her brand and attributes her success to understanding a woman's body and adapting to how their needs change. She firmly believes that the woman should be the first thing that walks in the room, not her dress. ""I think we all have our own beauty, but you really need to be true to yourself,"" Pinto said. ""I know it's time-consuming. Especially working women and mothers don't have a lot of time to pay attention to how they're wardrobing themselves ... but there's a certain amount of time we need to give ourselves as women, because it's an expression of who we are. What we put on our backs when we go out in the morning speaks more than what we say or do initially in terms of how people perceive us. It's a little bit of an investment in that we need to make to be able to feel better about ourselves."" Many speculate Pinto is designing Obama's inaugural gown, a big honor because inaugural dresses are put on permanent display in the Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection. Whatever dress Obama chooses to wear, many hope she won't suffer the same fashion embarrassment that first lady Laura Bush almost faced at a White House event in December 2007. She had planned to wear an $8,500 red Oscar de la Renta gown but quickly changed her outfit when three other guests showed up in the same dress. For any ladies fearing that they may show up at one of the celebratory balls in Washington in the same gown as another or, heaven forbid, several other women, there is a Web site where you can register your designer gown. DressRegistry.com states on its site that you can see what other ladies will be wearing so you don't become their fashion twin.","Fashion watchers: Michelle Obama makes strong fashion statement .

"(CNN) -- This list isn't just about soundtracks or great music in the movies -- it is about quintessential movie moments where a song flawlessly complements or enhances the action. Reservoir Dogs: Mr. Blonde tortures a prisoner accompanied by 70s bubblegum pop . A riff or harmony that works so perfectly that the hair on the back of your neck stands on end. Or a classic song at just the right moment to mainline feel good factor. We've compiled a list of 10 of what we think are the best. If you don't agree or think we've missed one, share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. The film: Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper (1969)  The song: Born to be Wild, Steppenwolf  The scene: The opening sequence   From the moment Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper kicked their motorbikes to life and gunned down the dusty highway accompanied by ""Born to be Wild"" almost 40 years ago, audiences were electrified. The lure of escaping onto endless, empty roads still resonates today, even if Steppenwolf has become the food of a million drivetime clichés. 2. The film: Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino (1992)  The song: Stuck in the middle with you, Stealers Wheel  The scene: Mr. Blonde cuts a man's ear off . ""You ever listen to K Billy's Super sounds of the 70's?"" asks Michael Madsen's super-cool psychopath Mr. Blonde as he opens up a cut throat razor. Innocuous -- but then we see a bloody man with a duct-taped mouth. Mr. Blonde tunes the radio, does an eccentric little dance to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" and then brutally cuts the man's ear off. It's the juxtaposition of sadistic violence with bubblegum pop that epitomizes Tarantino's brilliance and has been much aped since. 3. The film: Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese (1990)  The song: Layla, Eric Clapton  The scene: Jimmy's murder spree montage . Scorsese's use of the piano exit from ""Layla"" over a montage showing the ugly demise of a series of gangsters after a heist is simply brilliant. The pink car, the garbage truck, the meat locker: scene after scene of horribly disfigured corpses that Scorsese has somehow imbued with the wistful poetry of the end of an era. 4. Apocalypse Now, Francis Ford Coppola (1979)  The song: The End, The Doors  The scene: Captain Willard waiting for an assignment in Saigon   The Doors' dark epic twists and turns of over the opening scenes of Captain Willard waiting for his next assignment in a humid hotel room in Saigon. It perfectly evokes the stifling claustrophobia he feels stuck alone with nothing but his demons and a bottle for company. 5. The film: Muriel's Wedding, P. J. Hogan (1995)  The song: Waterloo by ABBA  The scene: Muriel and Rhonda triumph at a talent contest . ABBA-obsessed ugly duckling, Muriel performs ""Waterloo"" at the local talent contest and sticks the proverbial two fingers up to the small-town bitches who have been bullying her. Even the white satin jumpsuit straining over her ample figure can't take away from her triumph -- and when the synchronized dancing starts there aren't many film moments that can beat it for feel-good factor. 6. The film: Almost Famous, Cameron Crowe (2000)  The song: Tiny Dancer, Elton John  The scene: On the tourbus the band sing along to Tiny Dancer   1960's rockers, Stillwater, are stuck on the tour bus. No-one is talking and the tension is palpable. ""Tiny Dancer"" comes on the radio and slowly one by one they start singing along. Everyone grins and tensions drain away. Touching without being cheesy, this scene is full of nostalgia for good times had with friends and will stay with you long after watching the film. 7. Say Anything, Cameron Crowe (1989)  The song: In Your Eyes, Peter Gabriel  The scene: Lloyd tries to woo Diane . You have to admire Lloyd's (played by a young John Cusack) style as he stands outside love interest Diane's window holding his boombox aloft blaring ""In Your Eyes"" like a modern day Romeo. Maybe Peter Gabriel's song hasn't quite stood the test of time but if you don't get hung up on the fact that it sounds a bit cringeworthy now, this is a scene of perfect romance -- 80's-style. 8. The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson (2001)  The song: Needle in the Hay, Elliot Smith  The scene: Richie Tenenbaum attempts suicide . Beautifully shot with no ambient noise, just the melancholy ""Needle in the Hay,"" we see Richie -- the tennis prodigy who never realized his potential --methodically cutting off all his hair before, shockingly, slicing his wrists. It's both intimate and appalling. In a dark coincidence, Smith died in 2003 as a result of two stab wounds to the chest, thought to be suicide. 9. Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Stanley Kubrick (1964)  The song: We'll meet again, Vera Lynn  The scene: Nuclear apocalypse . ""We'll meet again, Don't know where, Don't know when,"" warbles a hopeful Vera Lynn as mushroom cloud after mushroom cloud explodes into the sky. It's as preposterous as making a comedy about nuclear armageddon. But with Kubrick at the helm and Peter Sellers playing three of the main characters, this unlikely film -- like its ending -- works very well indeed. The film: Trainspotting, Danny Boyle (1996)  The song: Lust for Life, Iggy Pop  The scene: Choose Life voiceover . The opening drumbeat of ""Lust for Life"" kicks in and Renton deadpans ""Chose life. Choose a career."" -- the beginning of one of the most cynically brilliant monologues in film or literature. It is strangely exhilarating and the fact that Iggy Pop is a punk legend and heroin survivor just adds to the pop culture cool.

"(CNN) -- Ever wanted your own island? This one is a veritable bargain if you have a spare $2.5 million in the bank. With $1.5 million already knocked off the asking price, Ailsa Craig admittedly does come with a certain amount of baggage. The Scottish island once housed a prison before acting as a warning beacon for passing ships -- its lighthouse had a keeper until it became automated in 1990. In fact, no-one lives there anymore, though it is home to thousands of gannets and an increasing number of puffins, introduced to cull an infestation of rats. The upside is that any prospective buyer guarantees themselves a place in Winter Olympics history thanks to the island's unique rock, which is used to make the world's leading curling stones, including all of the 64 in action at this month's Games in Sochi. ""As far as I know, there's nowhere else on the planet with granite like it,"" says Bill Hunter, factory manager at Kays of Scotland, which has exclusive rights to harvest it. ""It's just a natural phenomenon."" The island's sole export has had its fair share of drama over the years. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Turin, one stone in particular became dubbed ""the stone of destiny"" -- its mystique further enhanced by its current position residing on a pedestal within a glass case of a Scottish museum. With the last stone of the final end of the Olympic final, Scottish housewife Rhona Martin slid Great Britain to gold, a rare Games success for the nation and its first gold for 18 years. Four years on, Martin failed to get her team out of the group stages but the final was no less dramatic as Sweden captain Anette Norberg proved victorious with an extra end and a tricky double takeout for the win with her last stone. Last time around in Vancouver in 2010, the women's final reached another climax as Sweden once more won, coming back from 6-4 to win 7-6 when Canadian captain Cheryl Bernard fluffed her final stone. Every one of those can lay claim to being a stone of destiny, and remarkably all of them originate from exactly the same pocket of Ailsa Craig, a 220-acre island 10 miles from mainland Scotland. The name literally translates as fairy rock, but is locally known as Paddy's milestone -- being situated in the Firth of Forth virtually equidistant on the boat journey from Glasgow to Belfast. Created by a volcanic plug of a volcano that was last active 500 million years ago, it was once a haven for Catholics during the 16th-century Reformation, a time when a castle was built there to defend against a possible Spanish invasion. Curling is not its only claim to sporting fame. You can see it in the distance from the Turnberry golf course, which last hosted the British Open in 2009 -- when American Stewart Cink denied countryman Tom Watson the chance to win a sixth Open 26 years after his last and at the age of 59. There are some provisos in buying the island. As well as the lighthouse, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has a bird sanctuary leased until 2050. There is also one other home on the island -- a rundown property bought a few years ago by a man from India -- and the issue of the quarried stone. For Â£26,000 ($43,000) a year, the current owners -- Archibald Kennedy and the eighth Marquess of Ailsa -- allow large slabs of rock to be removed to make the world's finest curling stones. The Sochi batch was extracted back in 2001, and the next 2,000-ton excavation did not happen until last year. The island's stone has a market advantage because it does not contain much quartz, says Hunter, and it does have riebeckite -- a combination that means the stones won't break up in competition conditions. ""As a result it will last you a very long time, a lifetime in fact if you look after it like a baby,"" Hunter explains. ""I wouldn't say we put in more effort with the Sochi stones but we probably double-checked things even more -- maybe an extra 1-2% to make sure it was just right."" The curling stones used in Sochi are made of two types of granite: Ailsa Craig common green and blue hone. The green makes up the main body of the stone, with blue filling the middle and providing the base. ""Blue hone is the hardest granite in the world and it won't wear and tear -- that's the objective,"" Hunter says. ""It will certainly last for many, many years."" The only other place that granite is quarried for curling is North Wales, using trefor, which comes in blue/gray and red/brown shades, and is commonly found in competitions in Canada. It is still an active quarry where blasting is allowed, a process banned on Ailsa Craig due to its bird sanctuary. Following the latest excavation, however, Kays believes it now has enough granite to meet demand until 2020. And regardless of who purchases the island, a lease is in place ensuring that Kays can continue to meet the demands of the World Curling Federation. As things stand, curling's very long-term future looks likely to rest in the hands of a nature conservation body, which wants to remain nameless but has tabled an offer for Ailsa Craig. Farhad Vladi, who runs Vladi Private Islands in Hamburg, Germany, the world's leading private island broker, has tried to use Ailsa Craig's sporting past as a major selling point to prospective buyers. ""How many islands can boast its own Olympic gold medal?"" he asks. As for the future stone production in the very long-term, he adds: ""This discussion is ongoing at the moment with the group looking to buy it. Obviously it's very special stone and it's a chance of an income of about Â£30,000 a year to the owner."" No other buyers look immediately on the horizon -- the World Curling Federation told CNN it will not make a bid. Other wealthy curling fanatics could yet enter the fray, but whatever the outcome, Ailsa Craig will play a key role on the Sochi ice -- with or without another stone of destiny.","An island 10 miles off Scotland is the sole place to supply Olympic curling stones .
It has provided each and every stone for all the climactic finishes to recent Olympics .
The island is for sale for anyone with a cool $2.5 million to spare .

"(AOL Autos) -- The headline of this article illustrates the feeling people get when they encounter small, annoying maladies in their vehicles. Steering/wheel vibrations are some of the most common. Squeaks, rattles, leaks, and vibrations are so irritating to motorists that the carmakers have created a separate category in their labor guides for warranty repair. The average time paid by the manufacturer to track down and repair these annoying gremlins is about a half hour, but most times it actually takes a lot longer than that to identify and make the necessary repair. Squeaks & rattles (S/R) Squeaks & rattles (S/R) usually occur as a result of either two parts rubbing together or as a result of some part that is not quite secure, resulting in a squeak under load. The most common origins of S/R are from inside the dashboard, the vehicle's body, suspension or brakes. Whenever a S/R develops, try to isolate the noise. Does it only happen when braking? Turning? Backing up? Going over a bump? While driving over a bumpy roadway? And where does the sound seem to be coming from? The dash? Under the car? The front or rear wheels? Once you isolate the approximate location of the noise and when it happens, something can be done about it. Air and water leaks . What's leaking? Water or air? There's a different diagnostic procedure for finding these leaks. If you have fresh water coming into the vehicle, than you need to determine if it's coming from outside or inside. If from outside, it could be a leak in the windshield or a body seam. The best way to duplicate this condition is to spray water on the outside of the vehicle in the approximate area where the water is leaking into the vehicle. Have someone inside the vehicle trying to find the origin of entry using a flashlight. Once you find it, seal the leak. This may require re-sealing the windshield, adjusting the door tighter against the doorjamb gasket, adjusting the door glass tighter against the glass squeegee, or sealing a body seam. Whether or not you can repair it yourself depends on your knowledge and access to the necessary equipment. If air is leaking into the vehicle, the best way to duplicate and track down an air leak is to drive the vehicle with another person trying to track down the noise, using either a stethoscope or electronic air leak listening device. Once pinpointed, repair of an air leak may require replacement of a door or glass gasket, or the re-sealing of the windshield or a body seam.  AOL Autos: Top 10 least-polluting cars . Vehicle vibrations . Vehicle vibrations take various forms. The most common forms fall into the following categories: . -- Steering/suspension/wheel/tire . -- Body/chassis . -- Engine . - Drivetrain . Steering/suspension/wheel/tire . This category is by far the most popular form of vehicle vibration. Tires go out of balance or go bad, steering linkage and suspension components wear out, and wheels get bent. All these conditions can result in steering wheel vibration. AOL Autos: Most popular crossover vehicles . Say, for instance, you experience a steering wheel vibration at 55MPH, below or above this speed vibration is not present. In such a case, a tire is probably out of balance. Worn steering linkage often causes vibration of the steering wheel while driving a rough road, usually after hitting a pothole or some sort of bump in the road. This action sets the steering linkage off into a wild side to side dance that is characterized by a vigorous back and forth motion of the steering wheel. AOL Autos: Cars with the best resale values . Suspension wear can cause a similar action. Check the control arm bushings, ball joints, struts and strut bearings. Check the shocks on shock suspensions. Finally, a bent wheel or bad tire causes steering wheel vibration that's always present and intensifies at higher speeds. AOL Autos: Best used luxury cars . Body/chassis . Vibration in the body and chassis can be more difficult to track down because it can originate from a location other than where it shows up. This is called telescoping. The best way to track down a body or chassis vibration is via the use of a special electronic listening device called a ""Chassis Ear."" This is an electronic listening device that uses multiple microphones to amplify vibrations, so that they can be more accurately and efficiently tracked down. AOL Autos: Top 10 cars you may overlook . Engine vibration . Engine vibration can usually be traced to an engine miss from a bad sparkplug or plug wire, vacuum leak, faulty ignition component, mechanical failure of a cylinder (such as a broken valve spring, burnt valve, worn piston rings), and a host of other stuff. A simple engine diagnostic will bring to light the cause of engine vibration. Drivetrain . The final category of the most popular vibration complaint is Drivetrain vibration, which come from the transmission, axles, differentials, transfer cases and all affiliated components. This type of vibration usually expresses itself throughout the whole vehicle. While accelerating or decelerating you can feel it in the seats, floorboards, steering wheel, and doors (essentially throughout the entire vehicle). It usually intensifies with engine acceleration or deceleration. Popular causes of this type of vibration are loose or worn CV or universal joints, bent drive or half shafts, loose transmission output shaft bearings or bushings, or worn differential or transfer case bearings. The next time you hear that annoying squeak or rattle, or feel that irritating vibration, your vehicle is trying to tell you something. Don't put up with it; get it fixed and avoid bigger problems down the road. 'Til next time ... Keep Rollin'","Small car noises and vibrations can be really annoying and hard to fix .

"(CNN) -- You've heard the saying: ""In war, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics."" The political equivalent: ""Amateurs talk ideology -- professionals talk interest groups."" Small but sophisticated interest groups use big political battles to gain special advantages. Health care reform is, of course, the biggest battle of them all, with trillions of dollars at stake. On Saturday night with the House vote in favor of the health reform bill, the trial lawyers sliced themselves a nice little piece of that bonanza. It's Section 2531 of the bill -- to be precise Section 2531(4)b -- and it provides as follows: . The new health bill will empower the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states that reform their medical malpractice systems. There are just two conditions: Those reforms must not ""limit attorneys' fees or impose caps on damages."" Which is like saying that we're going to encourage you to develop a personal weight loss plan that includes neither exercise nor changes in diet. Here's how Section 2531 works. Over the past decade and a half, states have reacted to abusive lawsuits by imposing various restrictions on personal injury awards. In California, pain and suffering damages cannot exceed $250,000. Attorneys may collect no more than 15 percent of malpractice awards over $600,000. The impact of these kinds of reforms can be dramatic. After Texas capped pain and suffering damages at $750,000 in 2003, the number of malpractice lawsuits dropped abruptly. Lawsuits in Harris County (Houston and environs) plunged by 50 percent. Fewer lawsuits meant lower malpractice premiums. Texas' largest malpractice insurance carrier cut costs to doctors by 17 percent. Lower insurance premiums attracted more medical professionals to the state. In the 1990s, Texas ranked low in the nation in the number of doctors per person. In the four years after 2003, the number of doctors in the state jumped by 18 percent. ""It was hard to believe at first, we thought it was a spike,"" the executive director of the states' medical board told the New York Times. Texas' experience is dramatic, but consistent, with other reforming states. States with damage caps gain more doctors than uncapped states -- and the difference is greatest in the most underserved counties within capped states. Capped states have 5.5 percent more OB-GYNs per person in their rural counties than do states without caps. But the money saved by insurers, doctors and their customers is money subtracted from the pockets of trial lawyers -- and those lawyers carry real clout in the Democratic Congress. The trial lawyers' national PAC, the American Association for Justice, was the second-biggest source of PAC dollars for Democratic candidates in the 2006 election year: almost $2.6 million. That same year, Iowa's trial lawyers elected a former president of their association to Congress. Had the National Enquirer been less inquiring, a former trial lawyer named John Edwards might well be serving as attorney general right now. Huey Long once summed up the professional politicians' credo: . ""Those who support me early will have my close attention when I win office. Those who support me late will have my attention when I win office. And those who oppose me --"" and here he'd wink -- ""they'll get good government."" We all know what Long meant by ""close attention,"" and his old party apparently still lives by his rules. On Saturday, House Democrats have delivered some very ""close attention"" to their friends in the trial bar. The question is: who will stand up for good government for the rest of us? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","The House bill passed Saturday night protects the fees of trial lawyers, Frum says .
He says states that have capped fees have seen increase in doctors .
When Texas capped fees, lawsuits fell and doctors moved to the state, he says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan formally denounced on Thursday the Tennessee Republican Party's use of Barack Obama's full name in a recent news release questioning the Illinois senator's commitment to Israel. ""The RNC rejects these kinds of campaign tactics,"" Duncan said in a statement. ""We believe this election needs to be about the critical issues confronting our nation."" The statement in question, which was released Monday, said the state party is joining a ""growing chorus of Americans concerned about the future of the nation of Israel ... if Sen. Barack Hussein Obama is elected president of the United States."" It also included a photograph of Obama from a 2006 trip to Kenya, in which he is dressed in traditional attire. The news release was sparked by recent praise for the senator from Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan, who has made derogatory remarks about Judaism and has indicated his support for Obama. At Tuesday night's MSNBC debate, Obama said he denounced those comments and did not seek Farrakhan's support. On Wednesday night, the party removed both the photo and the reference of ""Hussein"" from the statement after Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander called to express his belief that using them had become a distraction, Tennessee GOP Communications Director Bill Hobbs said. The news release now includes a clarification that reads, ""This release originally referenced a photo of Sen. Obama and incorrectly termed it to be 'Muslim' garb. It is, in fact, Somali tribal garb, hence, we have deleted the photo. Also, in order to diffuse attempts by Democrats and the Left to divert attention from the main point of this release -- that Sen. Obama has surrounded himself with advisers and received endorsements from people who are anti-Semitic and anti-Israel -- we have deleted the use of Barack Obama's middle name."" Hobbs said Thursday that the party will no longer use Obama's middle name in news releases. ""We're not going to be using the middle name now, because apparently, it's become a distraction,"" he said. ""But I would note, not too long ago, I saw a wire story out of the Middle East that talked about how a lot of people there are hungry for Obama to win and, in part, because his middle name gives him a connection, and that story used his middle name, so we're not the first people to notice and use his middle name."" Hobbs denied that the use of Obama's full name carried any racial overtones but said he wasn't surprised the statement has caused such an uproar. ""The left always finds something to pick at other than to describe the issues; we're not surprised at all."" The news release, however, drew a sharp rebuke Wednesday from Tennessee Democratic Party Chairman Gray Sasser, who said it ""amplifies misinformation, discredited tall tales and Internet innuendo to appeal to the worst in people."" Though it was issued Monday, the release came under fresh scrutiny Wednesday after conservative talk radio host Bill Cunningham repeatedly used Obama's full name at a John McCain campaign event in Cincinnati, Ohio, while describing Obama as a ""hack Chicago-style Daley politician"" who had yet to be challenged by the media.

"(CNN) -- Clairvoyance and a poker face are among the qualities British hotelkeepers should cultivate when dealing with foreign guests, according to a guide issued by the country's tourism body. ""Anticipate all of the needs of a Japanese visitor"" but avoid ""exchanging a smile or making eye contact with anyone from France you don't know"" are among a list of peculiar dos and don'ts prepared for the tourist industry by VisitBritain. The guide comes after a similar initiative by the Parisian tourist board last year, which said Brazilians were fond of physical contact and taxis and the Spanish enjoy free things and late dinners, among other things. Basil Fawlty, the hotelkeeper star of the hit British sitcom who constantly referred to World War II among his German guests, appears to have cast a long shadow if the alternately bizarre and blindingly obvious etiquette guide is any indication. ""Don't describe a visitor from Canada as 'American,'"" or ""ask superstitious people from Hong Kong to sleep in a historic property,"" the list, which has been derided in the British press, instructs. ""Indians are amiable but have a tendency to change their minds,"" the advice, clearly unafraid of overgeneralization, goes on. Travel dos and don'ts . Russians: don't cram . Avoid housing Russians -- 'a ""tall nation""' -- in cramped rooms, it says, possibly having missed that Vladimir Putin, surely among the most globe-trotting of his countrymen, measures in at an un-towering 170 centimeters (5'6""). And as for Germans, ""deal promptly with any complaint"" from them, lest they become even more ""rude and aggressive"" than they can already appear. Finally, the guide's clearly well-traveled authors advise, don't mention Belgium or, strictly, ""Don't try to talk to Belgians about their country's politics or language divisions"" -- which must amount to almost the same thing. The following is the full list of do's and don'ts that VisitBritain defended to the Daily Mail, as ""unrivalled ... market intelligence."" Dos and don'ts . Do: Understand that Indians are amiable but have a tendency to change their minds quite frequently. Do: Ensure tourists from Russia -- a ""tall nation"" -- are housed in rooms with high ceilings and doorways. Do: Realize that Australian people are being endearing when they make jokes about ""Poms"" [Aussie slang for British people]. Do: Anticipate all of the needs of a Japanese visitor -- even if they haven't told you what they are. Do: Deal promptly with any complaint from German or Austrian tourists, who can be ""straightforward and demanding"" to the point of ""seeming rude and aggressive."" Don't: Ask superstitious people from Hong Kong to sleep in a historic property or a four-poster bed, because they associate them with ghostly encounters. Don't: Exchange a smile or make eye contact with anyone from France who you do not know. Don't: Describe a visitor from Canada as ""American."" Don't: Try to talk to Belgians about their country's politics or language divisions. Don't: Say ""no"" in a direct way to a Japanese tourist -- instead think of a ""nicer alternative.""
