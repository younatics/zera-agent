"Melbourne (CNN) -- The two hosts of the 2Day FM Sydney radio program will be feeling awful. In seeking to con their way into recording a telephone call with a patient receiving treatment in a hospital they were doing what they thought FM radio hosts do. Everyone else does prank calls so we'll do one too. The position of the radio station is different though. This Sydney radio station has a track record of attempting to garner large ratings through shock tactics. In 2009 on this very same radio station a 14-year-old girl was invited into the studio with her mother. She was wired up to a lie detector and asked personal questions. This was considered a jape. To take that jape just that potential ratings point further, the young girl was asked about her sex life. A reminder: she was 14. Obviously intimidated by the occasion, the fame of the hosts and the setting, she revealed to the vast audience listening at home and in cars that she had been raped when she was 12. The incident was investigated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority which imposed an additional condition on 2Day FM's licence that it increase the protection of children participating in its shows. One of the hosts of that broadcast, who is still employed by the radio station, said that early in his career he was told by the program director to ""do whatever you want, just win,"" according to the transcript of an interview he did with Radio Today. Do whatever you want. But you know what? Actually, you can't do whatever you want. It may come as a surprise to many but there is actually a code of conduct for Australian radio stations and their on air presenters. It is called the Commercial Radio Codes of Practice Code 6 which currently makes compelling reading: . ""The purpose of this Code is to prevent the unauthorized broadcast of statements by identifiable persons. 6.1 A licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless: . (a) that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast; or . (b) in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent to the broadcast of the words."" Jacintha Saldanha was not aware in advance that her words might be broadcast. Of course she wasn't, she thought she was talking to the Queen. And I'll confidently assert that she didn't subsequently consent to her words being broadcast, because if she did we would have heard all about it by now. The CEO of the radio network says, ""nobody could have reasonably foreseen"" that a prank their station pulled on a nurse at the hospital, could have resulted in her suicide. That's probably right. But could they have reasonably foreseen that she would be upset? Personally and professionally embarrassed? Hurt? But the lawyers ran their $750 an hour rulers over it and broadcast it was. So what best describes the relationship between the radio station and Jacintha Saldanha? In 1946 Terence Rattigan wrote a play called The Winslow Boy. An English family of modest means consigns itself to potential penury by securing legal representation for the young son of the family who stands falsely accused of petty theft at his naval academy. The lawyer they retain to defend him, the best in the land, is Sir Robert Morton. In a speech addressing the boy's many doubters and accusers Sir Robert urges them, in considering this case involving a young boy on one side and the British Navy on the other, to remember a famous old dictum: ""you shall not side with the great against the powerless."" In this whole sad and tragic affair Jacintha Saldanha was truly powerless. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"(CNN) -- It's a congested, sprawling transport hub surrounded by 1950s architecture and predominantly used by commuters or tourists to cross the city of Istanbul. But proposed changes to Taksim Square have seen it become the flashpoint for protests that have swept through Turkey in the past week, leaving thousands injured and focusing the world's attention on the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Taksim has been no stranger to violence. In 1977, at least 34 protesters died during May Day clashes with police. May 1 rallies in the square were banned in 1980 and were only allowed to legally resume in 2010. On May Day this year, there were riots after city authorities again refused to grant trade unions and youth groups permission to demonstrate in Taksim, blaming construction work being carried out in the square. Professor Ersin Kalaycioglu, professor of political science at Istanbul's Sabanci University, said significantly, Taksim Square was also known as ""republic square,"" because it was built by the Republic of Turkey's founding fathers to commemorate the war of liberation. ""Taksim Square is connected to Istiklal Caddesi -- Independence Avenue -- and Cumhuriyet Caddesi -- the Avenue of the Republic. So there is a lot of symbolism that has to do with the Turkish Republic,"" he said. Read more: Amid protests, Erdogan returns to Turkey . The Turkish word ""taksim"" translates as ""divide"" and Kalaycioglu said Taksim Square was so-named because the area used to be the site of Istanbul's main reservoir, where the water was divided up. In the 20th Century and earlier, the area was only partially inhabited, he said, housing a military barracks and military training ground and a cemetery running down the slopes and a military hospital that still remains. ""In the 1930s the cemetery was moved to another part of town and the area was opened up for apartment buildings -- and at one point it was one of the 'poshest' parts of the city,"" he said. ""Most of the apartment buildings face the Bosphorus [the strait that connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara],"" he said. ""Because of its majestic view, [Taksim] is an attraction in its own right."" It was estimated that millions of people went through the area to work every day, Kalaycioglu said. Since the protests, however, Taksim has been blocked to traffic. This impromptu pedestrianization inadvertently reflects the authorities' plan to divert all traffic from the square. Kalaycioglu said plans to take the traffic underground included a pedestrian curb but after the tunnel was dug it was discovered that not enough room had been allowed for foot traffic. That was when the government decided to slice off part of Taksim's Gezi Park -- one of the last green spaces in Istanbul's center -- ""which the ecologists and architects of the city started to argue against."" Read more: Is Gezi Park Turkey's Tahrir Square? ""When machines were sent in to take down the trees, the people who had been protesting there tried to stop them and a row intervened between the construction company and the protesters -- and police intervened,"" Kalaycioglu said. But in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mevlut Cavusoglu, the deputy chairman of Erdogan's AK Party said the project for Taksim Square had enjoyed cross-party support. ""This project was actually supported by all the political parties in the city council and it was adapted unanimously at the city council,"" Cavusoglu said. He added that the number of trees in the square would be increased by the project -- with plans to replant 10 of those being removed from Gezi Park. Cavusoglu denied reports that a mall was part of the project. ""The building of a shopping mall has never been considered here in Taksim Square. What is [being] considered is the pedestrian way and putting car traffic under the tunnel and enlarging Taksim Square,"" he said. ""Only old military barracks is considered to rebuild. "" Watch: Turkish politician denies mall was ever planned . Turkey's Ottoman past . The barracks being reconstructed are from the 19th Century, a period when Turkey was still ruled by Ottoman sultans, who declared themselves the ""caliphs"" -- or spiritual leaders -- of the Muslim world. In 1922, first president of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, sent the last sultan into exile and two years later, banned the caliphate and declared Turkey a secular state -- so the ideals of the Republic of Turkey clash with those of the country's Ottoman past. The plans to rebuild Ottoman-era barracks had raised two different issues -- the physical change and the idea behind it, said Benjamin Fortna, professor of Middle Eastern history at SOAS (School of Oriental and African Studies), University of London. ""The idea -- building a replica of a past building - probably suggests to some people that the government's trying to link itself to the Ottoman past. But of course the square does exist from the Ottoman period."" Fortna said many people objected to a ""kind of glorification"" of the Ottoman era, which the early republic had tried to ""ignore and denigrate."" Kalaycioglu said the barracks had also been associated with the massacre of Christian army officers during a major uprising against constitutional rule in 1909. ""In the minds of the people, [the uprising] was the conspiracy of the sultan who tried to get rid of the officers in 1908 by using religious provocation,"" he said. ""That left an indelible mark in the minds of the people that religion could be deployed as a major factor against modernization."" That concept was ""at the very base"" of Erdogan's AK Party, Kalaycioglu said. The plans for Taksim Square also including the building of a mosque, he said. This meant ""anybody objecting to the project would be objecting to a mosque"" and the AKP was presenting objectors as atheist, secular, communist, anti-democratic and anti the people, he said. ""The masses on their side will be conservative and Sunni Muslim,"" he said. The proposed mosque would also overshadow the statues of the major figures of the republic represented on the Monument to the Republic in Taksim Square, Kalaycioglu said. Taksim's lack of religious connotations was ""probably one of the reasons that it was favored by the republic as a modern urban space,"" Fortna said. The plan to build a mosque in Taksim was therefore ""highly controversial and something that those with a secular orientation in the city and the country itself would resist,"" he said. ""The other side would see it as a natural place to have a mosque."" Read more: Why Turks are so angry . The term ""secular"" -- most often understood in the West as referring to the separation of religion and government -- was often applied to Turkey, Fortna said. ""But in Turkey itself they use the French term 'laÃ¯que.' In Turkey you really have the situation that's related to the founding of the republic - that the state will kind of control religion,"" Fortna said. ""So, for example, the Directorate of Religious Affairs is responsible for deciding the text that Muslim clerics can deliver in their Friday sermons. "" Kalaycioglu said the government also planned to demolish the Ataturk Cultural Center. They [Erdogan's government] want to get rid of anything and everything to do with Ataturk,"" he said. Kalaycioglu suggested that another example of this was the government's proposal to close down Ataturk Airport -- Istanbul's main international hub -- and build a new airport in the north. He said this would involve excavating a new channel between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. ""All this to get rid of the name of Ataturk. There's a lot of ideological baggage."" 'Contested space' Fortna said Taksim had long being a contested space and plans to change it would always be likely to cause controversy. ""Because it's such a central location and because of its particular make-up and associations -- whatever happens there will probably be heavily scrutinized and criticized,"" he said. ""Taksim is a place where demonstrators habitually gather. There's always a May Day protest for example. It's a place where people would naturally gravitate -- it's one of the few places where there's a fairly large open space in the city,"" he said. The current demonstrators have demanded Erdogan's resignation, accusing his government of creeping authoritarianism, while the prime minister has said the protests are part of an attempt by opponents who lost to his AK Party to beat it ""by other means."" ""The issue of trees in Gezi Park thing is just the trigger,"" he said on Monday. Kalaycioglu said the number of protesters had surged after evidence emerged of a brutal police response to the initial Taksim demonstration. He said the government had ""started to argue that it was just a group of marauders"" but that a huge majority seemed to be ordinary citizens, from all ages and walks of life and the government had eventually realized this and pulled the police out of the scene. In his interview with Amanpour, Cavusoglu -- Erdogan's deputy -- acknowledged that police had been heavy-handed and said their actions would be investigated but insisted that the government represented the Turkish people. ""At each election the people have been increasing their support for our government and our prime minister,"" he said. ""We are the democratic government and democratically elected parliament."" But Kalaycioglu said the protests had spread spontaneously through Turkey, ""motivated by the same theme."" The government was ""jumping on freedom of expression and freedom of the press,"" he said. ""The big issue there is, is of course freedom of expression and to be treated as stakeholders -- not as cockroaches. More is at stake than just Taksim Square.""","Taksim Square was where Istanbul's water was distributed -- Taksim means divide .
The site is seen as symbolizing the seclar Turkish republic founded by Ataturk .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands lost power due to a potent storm system that extended eastward from the Plains toward the Northeast on Thursday, bringing with it high winds and destructive lightning. Severe thunderstorm watches were in effect at one point Thursday evening for a continuous stretch from Oklahoma through New Jersey. The danger could lurk for several hours longer, with the National Weather Service issuing such warnings in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Kentucky, Virginia, Arkansas and other points in between. Well before then, the system had already packed a punch. In Pennsylvania, a tree crushed a woman in her car as she sought shelter at a campsite, killing her, said Glenn Dunn, the emergency management coordinator for Potter County. A 61-year-old man in Brooklyn, New York, died after lightning struck a church sending a scaffold crashing down on him, authorities said. Share your images of the storm with iReport. Witnesses reported trees in the region buckling under the impact. ""The trees were bending sideways, (and) the sky just went really dark and green,"" said Mark Ventrini, a photographer, of the scene around 7:30 p.m. as he headed toward Belmar, New Jersey. ""Some of the storms were pretty intense."" The weather service had received reports of possible tornadoes touching down in Elmira, New York, and Brookville, Pennsylvania. Emergency managers in Broome County, New York, reported people trapped inside a home because of downed trees in the town of Vestal. Strong storms also caused damage in Binghamton, New York, but the weather service said no injuries or fatalities have been reported. Stunning pictures arise from New York storm . The residual and more widespread damage came in the form of extensive power outages. More than 100,000 First Energy customers in Pennsylvania, for instance, didn't have electricity as of 10 p.m. ET, with other utilities like PECO and PPL reporting tens of thousands of others similarly in the dark. An hour earlier, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a press release stating there were nearly 95,000 customers without power in that state, mostly NYSEG and Central Hudson customers. Cuomo also declared a state of emergency for hard-hit Chemung County in the southwestern part of the state. Many more people took in the impressive lightning storms, with daunting bolts preceding booming claps of thunder in small towns and big cities. ""The brunt of the storm itself was intense but short -- there was very strong rain and wind for about 15 minutes, at which point the rain cleared and the lightning show began,"" said Matthew Burke, a CNN iReporter who photographed lightning sprawling across the New York City skyline. Several states away, tens of thousands also were in the dark, though power was being restored at a fairly fast rate. AEP Ohio, for instance, reported just over 51,000 customers lacking electricity at 6:15 p.m., yet more than 20,000 of those had the lights back on by 10 p.m. CNN's Greg Botelho, Lila King, Julie Cannold and Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","NEW: Storms kill one in New York and one in Pennsylvania .

"(CNN) -- There are few industries that haven't been shaken up by the game-changing potential of 3-D printing, and aviation is no exception. While it may be fun to imagine manufacturers spitting out planes at the touch of a button, the reality is more low key, though no less revolutionary. As is usually the case with aviation, it is all kicking off with a jet engine. Engine maker CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aviation and the French company Snecma, has created the LEAP engine -- an acronym for ""leading edge aviation propulsion"" that the company hopes reflects just how innovative the new aircraft component is. LEAP has many futuristic features, including a 3-D-printed nozzle, the part of the plane responsible for burning fuel. ""This technology is actually enabling us to create designs that wouldn't physically be possible to make with standard conventional machining,"" said Gareth Richards, LEAP's program manager. Read more: Compare taxi fares from the airport to downtown . While GE has been using 3-D printing for years to make plastic prototypes, only recently has the technology matured to the point of creating objects with stronger materials. ""We can do this in almost any metal you care to choose. We can do it in aluminum or nickel or steel. This is not 3-D printing like you might have seen on some tech show where people are making parts from plastic out of their basement. This isn't prototyping, where you have to figure out how to make it for real. This is making fully functioning production parts out of real aerospace materials,"" said Richards. LEAP incorporates another first; the engine's fan blade is made from a material called Ceramic Matrix Composite. Essentially, it is ceramic that is as tough as steel, although unlike metal, it can withstand extreme temperatures. More important, it is lighter than any alloy previously used. The manufacturer says the material used in the fan blades and other components makes a plane 1,000 pounds lighter than normal. ""LEAP reduces fuel burn by 15% over its predecessor engine. That adds up to several million dollars saved per year per plane,"" said GE Aviation spokesman Rick Kennedy. Read more: Airbus A350 XWB unveiled . Thus far, the new engine has been a sexy sell for airlines. CFM hasn't even started ground testing the engine, and they already have 4,500 orders from the likes of Qantas, American Airlines, Virgin and Southwest Airlines. CFM is planning for the engines to go into service by 2016, which means it needs to produce 1,500 engines a year. But the technology makes the goal achievable by cutting manufacturing time. ""For our most complex parts, it's common for the time it takes to be measured not only in weeks, but months or even more than a year,"" said Richards. ""Now, we're talking about going from the computer file to the finished part in hours or days."" Read more: The dawn of driverless cars . Airbus has also started playing with additive manufacturing. Peter Sander, of Airbus's Innovation Cell, imagines that by 2050 the company will be selling commercial planes made almost entirely from 3-D printed parts. For now, Airbus is content with making printed brackets, which will become a standard part of production by 2016. Each component made from 3-D printing, Sander reckons, is 25 percent lighter than the equivalent made from traditional manufacturing. ""Weight reduction is our driving force, because less weight means less fuel,"" says Sander.","A new engine, called LEAP, incorporates a nozzle made by 3-D printing .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of people have died in Pakistan and India's northern Rajasthan state amid flash floods and landslides caused by heavy monsoon rains, officials said Thursday. At least 21 deaths are confirmed in Pakistan, said Maj. Iftikhar Ahmed Taj of the National Disaster Management Authority. Hundreds of homes have been damaged in the flooding, which has hit parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, he said. Rescue workers are seeking to deal with a major landslide in the Kashmiri city of Muzaffarabad, according to the disaster agency. Roads are blocked, some 390 houses have been damaged and an unknown number of people are dead and injured, the agency said. Some families trapped by the landslide have been given emergency food and water supplies. Elsewhere in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, seven people were killed in Bagh by a flash flood and a landslide, while more than 100 houses were damaged in Koti, the disaster agency said. More rainfall is on the way in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, some isolated places in northeast Balochistan, and the country's capital, Islamabad, according to the agency. Clean-up also was under way Thursday in neighboring India, where heavy rain in Rajasthan left 20 dead, the Rajasthan state department told CNN. Ten died in the capital, Jaipur, it said. Relief work is under way to help the hundreds of people made homeless by the flooding, which followed three or four days of heavy rain, the state department said. Rajasthan Gov. Margaret Alva visited the affected area Thursday and spoke with people living in the slums of Madrampura Basti, the local government said in a statement. She directed local authorities to make sure water is pumped out of people's homes and food and drinking water are made available, it said. Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf expressed his regret to those affected by the floods. He released a statement directing government agencies to monitor river levels and take action to prevent any from bursting their banks. The prime minister also instructed authorities to check that the early warning system for people living near rivers is kept up to date, and urged disaster management agencies to ensure they are fully prepared to respond.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods won the World Golf Championship tournament at Doral's Blue Monster course in Florida on Sunday, boosting his comeback just weeks before next month's Masters. Woods, 37, finished Sunday's final round two strokes ahead of runner-up Steve Stricker despite two bogeys in his last three holes.

It is Woods' second tournament win of the young season, adding to the Farmers Insurance Open title he won in January. The hot start is reminiscent of a stretch from 2005 to 2007 when Woods won 21 tournaments and five majors. Woods credits his physical condition and his work with swing coach Sean Foley. ""I'm finally healthy and that has a lot to do with it,"" he said Saturday. The major overhaul to his technique is complete, he said. ""We are just making fine tunes.

"(CNN) -- If your air hostess seem better suited to a fashion runway than an airport runway, it may be because her uniform has a designer label. Recently, there's been a rash of cabin crew going couture. Last month, Japanese carrier Al Nippon Airways tapped Prabal Gurung -- whose designs have graced the backs of celebrities ranging from Michelle Obama to Lady Gaga -- to revitalize the staff apparel. Vivienne Westwood is currently doing the same for Virgin Atlantic (stewardesses will start wearing the uniforms on trial next month). ""It could have something to do with the changing of the airline industry. Everyone is having to approach the business differently, and everyone is having to put an emphasis on look,"" says Australian designer Martin Grant, who in addition to clothing the likes of Emma Stone and Heidi Klum crafted the new uniforms for Qantas Airways last April. High-end airlines put an emphasis on excellence, Grant says, and Qantas is no different. ""They apply the principle to everything: the food, the design of the interiors, the lounges. It's the same with the uniforms,"" he explains. The updated outfits feature a haute take on Qantas' red triangle logo. Grant referenced the graphic in the uniform tops, which are navy blue with ruby red and fuchsia pink diagonal stripes across the shoulder. ""The uniforms have to be identifiable and easily seen. You want to be able to see from afar the staff you're looking for. When you're running around an airport, you're constantly looking for the logo of the aircraft,"" he says. Moreover, Grant's design has an on-trend retro feel to it. The ensemble includes a trilby-style hat made from recycled bottle tops and trench coat. Read more: The man with 1,000 stewardess uniforms . ""Passengers and flight attendants alike say they miss the old world glamor associated with flight,"" says Grant, adding that security controls and low-cost carriers have taken some of the luxury out of the industry. ""[The accessories] very much came from staff feedback. They said, 'we want the glamor back. We want hats, gloves, the whole kitten caboodle.'"" Though Westwood's designs have not been unveiled yet, sketches suggest that the female staff will have gloves. Some of the items will also be made from a polyester yarn made from used plastic bottles. In a statement released by Virgin, Westwood said the uniforms would be in keeping with her ""enduring interest in '40s French couture."" Some airlines have been sporting designer threads for years. British Airways had Julien Macdonald -- previously artistic director of French fashion house Givenchy -- overhaul their uniforms in 2000. Air France staff, meanwhile, have been wearing costumes crafted by Société Christian Lacroix since 2005. ""Because we have 'France' in our name, we're an ambassador for the country,"" explains Sylvie Tarbouriech, the vice president of branding for Air France. ""The idea is that we should give our customers the best France can bring them, and when you're thinking about France, you're thinking about food, you're thinking about wine, and you're thinking about fashion."" Airlines have a long tradition of collaborating with designers. Emilio Pucci notably crafted some space-age-style uniforms in 1965 for the now-defunct Braniff International Airways. Still, Tarbouriech maintains it's actually quite difficult finding people willing to take on such a limiting project. Read more: Airline uniforms recycled to make bags . ""A uniform is the sum of many, many constraints,"" she says. ""It has to be comfortable, it has to be in materials that are not flammable, it has to be flattering to everybody -- blonde, redhead or brunette, thin women and not so thin women. And it has to be in keeping with the brand colors. It's very challenging for a fashion designer to work under these constraints, and that's why it's not always easy to find one willing to do it."" Still, Grant says for him at least, it's long been a fantasy. ""I've loved the essence of flight since I was a child,"" he says. ""I love the idea of groups of people looking smart, looking tailored and being part of a team.""","Al Nippon Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Qantas Airways are just a few carriers who've recently tapped fashion designers to overhaul their uniforms.

"(CNN) -- He is a towering figure in the history of cinema, a colossus who has frightened and thrilled audiences in equal measure. Now King Kong, the famous silverback from the silver screen, is roaring and pounding his way onto the theatrical stage. Merian C. Cooper's 1933 classic fantasy tale of a giant gorilla has become a musical reality at the Regent Theatre, in Melbourne, Australia -- thanks to a six-meter high robotic puppet, and the pioneering work of puppeteer Sonny Tilders. ""It's been amazing. They're not just praising the puppet, they are praising the character. That is so rewarding,"" Tilders told CNN. The animatronics expert leads a 35-strong team at The Creature Technology Company in west Melbourne and has an impressive track record in both film and theater. The 46-year-old has more than two decades' experience making high-tech puppets and counts ""Stars Wars -- Revenge of the Sith"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" among his many movie credits. He was also the robotic brains behind the hugely successful ""Walking with Dinosaurs -- The Arena Spectacular"" stage show, but the scale of King Kong was unlike anything he had attempted before. The rubber and rabbit fur model seen hanging off the Empire State Building swatting bi-planes in the original film was 24 inches tall. The modern stage incarnation of Kong stands six meters high and weighs more than a ton. Read this: Yoda, E.T. and the greatest movie puppets . When the multi-million dollar project started five years ago, Tilders originally set out to create a fully animatronic creature but ended up combining old-fashioned puppetry with modern robotics. ""We were considering having two versions. We were developing other technologies that we would need for animatronic limbs to move,"" he said. ""But to cut a long story short, we were so impressed by what the manned puppet could do that we had a change of heart and said we should do the whole show with marionette puppets. It made much more sense."" Suspended from the ceiling, Kong's limbs are manipulated on stage by 10 specially trained stage circus artists who scurry over and around the puppet, shifting his arms and legs by hand or using ropes. Clad in black from head to toe, these shadowy figures called the ""King's Men,"" work in tandem with three off-stage puppeteers -- the ""voodoo"" operators -- who control the mechanical functions inside Kong. Around 300 meters of electrical wiring are crammed inside the puppet's steel and aluminum shell powering 16 microprocessors and 15 servo motors which move Kong's eyes, eyebrows and eyelids, nose, lips, jaw, neck and shoulders. He also makes sounds -- a vital part of making his movements appear realistic, says Tilders. Marrying the mechanical functions of interior with the organic-looking Lycra and latex exterior is one of the big challenges of animatronics, Tilders says. ""We wanted to create a puppet that was really dynamic on stage. One of the ways to solve that and not kill anyone or destroy the puppet or the stage itself was to make his extremities -- his arms and fists -- in a way that has as little steel as possible."" Read this: Huge mechanical beasts stalk French theme park . From the elbow down, Kong's arms are filled with air, allowing him to furiously pound the floor without causing a minor earthquake. Overlaying the air bags are a series of sculptured muscle bags made from a stretchy nylon material that expands and contracts to mimic the sinewy movements of the real thing. He might not be the largest marionette in the world - that record is held by France's street theater company Royal de Luxe -- but he is, says Tilders, the most articulated. ""Often (big puppets) are quite simple and slow, but what we've developed is a hybrid technology enabling us to do some powerful and specific moves."" The Creature Technology Company's ambitions were aided by UK-based stage automation experts Stage Technologies who provided the four-ton track-and-trolley system suspended above the stage. ""It's a machine that allows Kong to both move around the stage and be raised up and down but also take different positions,"" said Stage Technologies' Group CEO Mark Ager. ""We move his torso with eight winches and that allows us to change the aspect of it. So, for instance, when he walks, his shoulders can roll from side to side. It's basically a big boys version of a wooden cross you see on smaller puppets."" The company, which is currently helping pop star Pink fly around stage on her world tour, has previously assisted Tilders with the Walking with Dinosaurs project, helping create a flying prehistoric bird called an Ornithocheirus. But the complexity of Kong surpassed anything they have previously built, leading to a few nerves as opening night approached. ""Given (Kong) is the main actor it was quite a concern, but it is incredible,"" he said. ""There's an awful lot of engineering that goes into something that looks so effortless. He feels real. I think you have to see inferior robotic incarnations to see quite how clever (Kong) is."" Overall, it's been an extraordinary collaboration of engineering and software expertise with sculptors, artists, musicians and actors creating a unique spectacle. The critics like it too. Many have warmed to the show itself since it opened in June and almost all have heaped lavish praise on Kong himself. It's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of Kong, said Tilders. ""It's definitely going overseas,"" he said. ""The financial model can't rely on 20 million people in Australia. Obviously, we would love to go to Broadway because that's the natural home for the story.""","Giant marionette/animatronic King Kong takes to stage in Melbourne-based musical .

"(CNN) -- The pool is closed in Warrenton, Missouri. Cattle ponds are drying up in Arkansas. Illinois is in danger of losing its corn crop. Even the mighty Mississippi River is feeling low amid what the National Climatic Data Center reported Monday is the largest drought since the 1950s. How the drought could hit your wallet . The center said about 55% of the country was in at least moderate short-term drought in June for the first time since December 1956, when 58% of the country was in a moderate to extreme drought. The hot, dry weather in June, which ranked as the third-driest month nationally in at least 118 years, according to the center, made the problem worse. The portion of the country suffering from severe to extreme short-term drought dramatically expanded in June, up to nearly 33% from 23% the month before. WLUK: Tree farmers battle drought . Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn called it a ""natural disaster of epic proportions."" ""We've never see a drought like this and we have to make sure we do something about it,"" he said, calling on Congress to expedite passage of the farm bill. Quinn said seven more counties will be designated Monday as disaster areas, in addition to 26 already on the list, and farmers can apply for federal relief funds. In Arkansas -- where the National Drought Mitigation Center reported that ranchers are having to haul water for cattle because ponds have dried out and wells can't keep up with demands -- 83-year-old retired farmer Don Hudson said this is about the worst he's ever seen it. ""It's very brown right now, ain't no grass at all,"" he said. ""We're still feeding hay because the cows aren't even going out to graze."" In all, 71% of the country was classified as abnormally dry or worse as of June, the climate agency said, citing data from the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska. That's double one year ago, according to agency statistics. Mayans may offer insight on drought management . The worst-hit areas are the southern to central Rockies, the central Plains states and the Ohio Valley, the National Climatic Data Center said. The hot, dry weather has taken its toll on agriculture, with 38% of the corn planted in the leading 18-corn producing states reported in poor or very poor conditions this week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The numbers are an increase of eight percentage points over last week and dramatically higher than last year at this time when it was just 11%. In Arkansas, where conditions are the driest they've been since 1925, according to one widely used measure of short-term drought, ranchers have been selling off cattle to avoid having to feed and water them, said Arkansas Department of Agriculture spokesman Zach Taylor. ""It's bad,"" he said. ""The week of July 4, we had 17,000 head of cattle sold. That may be a record."" With parts of the country in an epic drought, water levels were also running low in the Mississippi River south of New Orleans, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. That was allowing saltwater to begin working its way upriver, which could threaten some water supplies. WQAD: Heat kills hundreds of Asian Carp in local lake . It's not unprecedented, and there's no current threat to water supplies, but officials are prepared to start building an underwater barrier to block the denser saltwater from moving further upstream, Corps spokesman Ricky Boyett said Friday. The Corps last had to do that in 1999, he said. There's no way of telling how much the current drought will cost U.S. businesses, farmers and consumers. Alex Carter, who farms 3,500 acres of rice and soybean in southern Missouri, told CNN he's been running electric irrigation twice as much as most years because he's only gotten two inches of rain since March. Extreme weather: Get ready to see more of it . Farmers have plenty of water for irrigation from wells, but the expense is a killer. Typically wells run for 12 hours, but they are running continually now, draining power and business accounts. ""A lot of guys have to go back to their banker to ask for more money"" to cover added pumping costs, he said. But they have to keep the pumps going. ""That's the only thing that saves us,"" But drought conditions last summer in the Southern Plains and Southwest alone resulted in an estimated $12 billion in losses, according to the National Climatic Data Center. The 1956 drought brought serious economic repercussions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notes in a report on historic weather conditions. ""Crop yields in some areas dropped as much as 50%,"" according to the agency. ""Excessive temperatures and low rainfall scorched grasslands typically used for grazing. With grass scarce, hay prices became too costly, forcing some ranchers to feed their cattle a mixture of prickly pear cactus and molasses."" WISH: Man paints yard to beat drought's brown grass . The current drought has forced disaster declarations in 26 states and a spate of emergency conservation orders, including in Warrenton, where the city ordered residents to stop watering their lawns, shut down commercial car washes and banned and just about every other non-essential use of water. That includes closing the city swimming pool amid one of the hottest summers on record. ""It's pretty sucky, to put it bluntly,"" said Dana Moore, who lives just a few blocks from the pool. She's resorted to jumping in their very dirty car -- which they can't wash because of the restrictions -- to take her restless kids for a dip in other towns' water parks.

"(CNN) -- Tanker cars involved in the calamitous derailment in Quebec in July were carrying fuel that was improperly described in shipping documents as being less volatile than it actually was, Canadian safety investigators said Wednesday. The train was hauling highly volatile petroleum crude oil, a ""Class 3, Packing Group II"" product. But shipping papers identified the fuel as a less volatile ""Packing Group III"" product, investigator Donald Ross said. The discovery helps explain ""why the fuel ignited so quickly"" after the derailment on July 6 in Lac-Megnatic, Ross said. Forty-seven people were killed in the ensuing explosion and fire that leveled the tiny community's downtown. But investigators did not say whether the shipping error was intentional or inadvertent, and left open the question about whether the error made a difference. Both types of fuel -- Packing Group II and III -- are shipped in the same Class III tank cars, Ross said. Shipments of both classifications of fuel were allowed to travel through the Quebec town. And local firefighters said their emergency response would have been identical, he said. But Ross said the investigation remains open, saying ""Our work's not done."" Investigators say the events were set in motion when a fire was reported on the train. The train's engine was shut down and the fire was extinguished, but a rail employee left the scene without setting enough brakes to keep the train from rolling. It then rolled down a grade into the center of Lac-Megantic. Ross said it was the responsibility of the company receiving the shipment -- Irving Oil -- to properly identify the shipment. Irving Oil, which was shipping the petroleum crude oil from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota to its refinery in St. John, New Brunswick, did not return a call to CNN for comment. Ross also said the board's findings thus far hold significance beyond the Lac-Megnatic tragedy. The incident ""brings into question the adequacy of Class III tank cars"" for transporting large quantities of low flash-point flammable liquids. And, in letters to Canadian and U.S. regulators, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) asked them to check the accuracy of train manifests. ""It's important that dangerous goods in transport be properly described. There are people that may have to handle that, that come in contact with that, and they need to know the hazards of what they're dealing with,"" he said. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said in a statement Wednesday that is issued a safety advisory in August addressing the issue of accurate labeling. The U.S. Department of Transportation also launched an inspection operation to verify that shippers and rail carriers are properly classifying crude oil.","Investigation finds tankers were carrying more volatile fuel than labeling showed .

"(CNN) -- Though Ciudad Real Central Airport sits just 150 miles south of Spain's capital, Madrid, the bankrupt complex is a desolate stretch of concrete. In happier times, it was an expensive symbol of Spain's thriving economy and optimism for the future. Now, it serves as a reminder of the country's financial failings. ""The construction of an airport like this, and of other places that are completely worthless; there were a lot of them -- is responsible for the crisis,"" director Pedro Almodóvar told Slate. Almodóvar is one of several people who have since found a use for the airport, which shut down April last year. He shot his latest film, ""I'm So Excited"", on the empty runways. Almodóvar shot at night. During the day, Lexus Spain used the site to show off their latest model to journalists. ""There are 4.5 kilometers of unused runway -- it's basically the longest in Europe,"" says Jose Antonio Galve, the PR Manager for Lexus Spain. ""When you're on it, it's strange, because there's no sensation of it being a road, and you have no sense of when it will end. It appealed to us because it was a very different experience."" There is little chance that the airport will recover its investment; it cost $1.3 billion to build, and though not in use, it continues to incur maintenance costs. ""Although having that kind of surface would be great for racing, how much are you going to make to justify the cost of acquiring that much land?"" asks Angela Gittens, the director general of Airports Council International. Likely, says Gittens, the owners are simply biding their time until they sell it, piecemeal. ""Typically, there's not a whole lot of instances where someone comes along and buys the whole property,"" says Gittens. ""The facilities, or set of facilities, don't lend themselves to other uses."" At Berlin Bradenburg Willy Brandt Airport, the $5.7 billion travel hub that has yet to open, tourists can tour the empty grounds via bus or bike. According to the airport's spokesman Lars Wagner, its opening has been stalled because of problems with the fire protection system. An airport tour now, he says, gives visitors an opportunity to walk areas that, once opened, will be cordoned off. Mainly, though, he hints it's a chance to market the airport while it waits to open. Situated on the fringes of one of Hong Kong's most densely populated areas, the city's Kai Tak International Airport was renowned as one of the most exciting to land at. Replaced in 1998 by Chek Lap Kok airport (built on a purpose-made island to the west of the city) the Kai Tak site lay largely unused until construction began in 2009 to convert the runway into a new cruise ship terminal. The first ship docked at the site in June and is set to welcome more regular visitors from October. Some former hubs have reinvented themselves for good. In Malmö, Sweden, Bulltofta Airport was converted into a park and entertainment complex. Though one of the old hangars was turned into a school, according to Anders Reisnert, a cultural historian for the city, the area has lost its aeronautic identity. Read more: What are the worst airports for delays? ""I think most people in Malmö have forgotten it used to be an airport,"" he says. The former Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado (once the fifth busiest hub in the U.S. before closing in 1994) is being redeveloped as a mixed-use housing community. The development is slated for completion in 2025 and is more than halfway done -- of 8,000 projected homes, 5,000 have already been constructed and sold. ""The demand is more than anyone could imagine,"" says Thomas Gleason, a spokesperson for the site's developer, Forest City Enterprises, and a former spokesman to Federico Pena, the Denver mayor that launched the project. As for why Forest City took on such a massive undertaking (the decision to sell the $79.4 million site whole was Pena's idea), Gleason maintains it was a no-brainer. Read more: The world's most beautiful airports . ""We're talking about 4,700 acres of land that's a ten minute drive from the downtown area. There was a tremendous opportunity to redevelop land that was underutilized,"" he says. Converting an airport is a tremendous undertaking. Gleason says Forest City had to tear up 1,100 acres of pavement and 4.2 million square feet of aviation buildings, a process he described as ""breathtaking"" in its complexity. In Austin, Texas, real estate developer Catellus is performing a similar feat with the site of now defunct Robert Mueller Municipal Airport. ""We saw 700 acres in the center of Austin, and it was three miles from downtown and two miles from the university in this rising town where great things are happening. It was a great location, and a great opportunity,"" says Gregory Weaver, executive vice president of Catellus. Remnants from the old airports haunt both sites; at Stapleton, the old 12-story control tower looms in the backdrop, while Mueller still boats a World War II-era hangar. In spite of these details, Weaver maintains that some residents have already forgotten the area's original identity. ""I tell people that I live in Mueller, and I'll say, 'you know, the former airport,' and they'll say, 'oh, that used to be an airport?'"" Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Ciudad Real Central Airport as north of Madrid.","Many abandoned, or 'ghost' airports, are finding new uses.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- A suicide bomber dressed in a military uniform set off a blast that killed more than 100 soldiers Monday, authorities said, in what appears to be the deadliest attack ever on troops in Yemen. It left at least 101 dead and more than 220 injured, with some in critical condition, authorities said. ""The war on terror will continue until it is completely destroyed regardless of the sacrifices,"" President Abdrabuh Mansur Hadi said in a statement carried by state news agency Saba. More than an hour after the attack, there were still bodies at the blood-spattered scene, and some ambulances responding to the blast took six or seven victims each, an official said. ""We heard a massive explosion. Minutes later, there were so many emergency vehicles, it seems as if hundreds were injured,"" said resident Ali al-Husseini, who was near the attack. A Yemeni official in Washington said it was too early to know who was responsible but that suicide attacks are ""the hallmark of al Qaeda."" The partially lawless Middle Eastern country has become a central battleground in the fight against al Qaeda, with the terror network's leader calling recently for an uprising against the new president. 21 dead in Yemen al Qaeda clashes . The Yemeni branch of the group calls itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Monday's blast targeted a military parade rehearsal in Sabeen Square in the capital Sanaa, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. The attack took place about 200 meters (218 yards) from the presidential palace. No one immediately claimed responsibility. The country's defense minister, Mohammed Nasser Ahmed, and military chief of staff Ahmed al-Ashwal were in the area but far from the site of the attack itself, and were unharmed, officials said. The president fired top security officials, including a nephew of the former president, after the attack. Official: Ex-Yemeni President Saleh hospitalized . Gen. Ammar Saleh was sacked as director of the National Security Bureau, said a Yemeni official who is not authorized to speak to the media. He is being replaced by Maj. Gen. Mohammed Jameh al-Khadar. Saleh may keep a second and more important post as first deputy for national security. The head of central security, Abdul Malik al-Tayyeb, was fired by presidential decree after the attack. He is being replaced by Fadhl al-Qosi. The soldiers were preparing for Tuesday's National Day of Unification ceremonies when they were attacked. The day celebrates the union of South Yemen and North Yemen on May 22, 1990, to form Yemen. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable. ""The secretary-general calls on all in Yemen to reject the use of violence in all its forms and manifestations, and expects them (to) play a full and constructive role in implementing Yemen's political Transition Agreement,"" a statement from his office said. Abdul Latif al-Zayani, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, called Hadi to express condolences, Saba reported. ""Al-Zayani stressed that the GCC States will spare no effort to back Yemen in order to achieve the desired stability and development,"" Saba said. Monday's attack came a day after three American contractors working with Yemen's coast guard were wounded in a shooting in the port city of Hodeida, two local security officials said. One person has been arrested in the attack, the sources said. Last week, al Qaeda's leader called for the Yemeni people to rise up against the country's new president, portraying him as the stooge of the unpopular former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and the United States. ""So, Ali Abdallah Saleh is gone, and his successor Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has taken over,"" al Qaeda's chief commander Ayman al-Zawahiri said in a video posted on jihadist forums. Saleh, who led Yemen for 30 years, relinquished power last year after an extended popular uprising in a transition agreement that was supported by the United States. Hadi was Saleh's vice president, and al Qaeda has exploited the connection to stir resentment against the new government. Last year, Ansaar al-Sharia, an offshoot of al Qaeda, took over the majority of districts in the southern Abyan province, benefiting from the political turmoil in the country. Numerous military bases were evacuated, making it easier for the militant groups to grow in power and territory. On Sunday, fierce clashes between government troops and al Qaeda fighters left 21 people dead, two local security officials said. The officials said the violence erupted when hundreds of troops attempted to sweep through areas around the district of Jaar, the main stronghold for al Qaeda in Abyan province. Al Qaeda fighters fought back, kicking off clashes that continued for nine hours, the officials said. Fourteen militants and seven troops were killed in the fighting, they said. Government forces have been battling fighters loyal to the local branch of al Qaeda for more than a year, but not made lasting headway. The United States has carried out dozens of drone strikes against militants in Yemen, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in September. U.S. officials said last month they had foiled a plot to bring down a U.S.-bound aircraft with a device that originated in Yemen. The plot was brought to authorities' attention by a mole who infiltrated al Qaeda, a source in the region told CNN. The mole works for Saudi intelligence, which has cooperated with the CIA for years, the source said. Information from the mole also led to a drone strike this month that killed Fahd al Quso, 37, whom the U.S. considered a senior operative of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The naughty step is not working. After the United Nations slapped tougher sanctions on North Korea after its third nuclear test in February this year, Pyongyang screamed in defiance. It canceled its hotline with South Korea, withdrew its workers from the Kaesong industrial complex it jointly operates with Seoul, and carried on with its over-the-top threats. China may have backed those sanctions but the economic lifeline is still there. Trade goes on between North Korea and China. In 2011, before some of these trade embargoes began, China accounted for an estimated 67.2% of North Korea's exports and 61.6% of imports, according to the CIA World Factbook. ""If you talk to officials at the border, there's no change,"" says Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the North Asian head of the International Crisis Group. ""And a lot of that trade is conducted by government trading companies especially on the North Korean side,"" adds the Los Angeles Times' Beijing Bureau Chief Barbara Demick. ""There's a lot more China could do that it has chosen not to."" So why is China not using its economic leverage to rein in the nuclear threat and proliferator next door? In a word -- fear. There's fear of a North Korean collapse that would lead to instability and a refugee crisis along its 1,400 kilometer (880 mile) border with North Korea. And then there's the far greater fear of an all-out conflict that would redraw the geopolitical map. ""Their end goal might be similar in terms of denuclearization, but China is looking at preventing war on the peninsula, which would allow a pro-Western government right on its border,"" says Kleine-Ahlbrandt. And there's something else holding Beijing back -- the historic and symbolic relationship with Pyongyang that is hard to give up. ""The Chinese Communist Party thinks of North Korea as this small state that is in its own image,"" says Demick. ""The structure of the North Korean government is very similar to the Chinese government and, in a way, it's the pure Communist state. ""It's just really hard psychologically to dump North Korea."" ""They treat North Korea a bit like a wayward child,"" adds Kleine-Ahlbrandt. "" You want to be the one to punish your child, but you're not going to turn them over to police."" But for many people in China, enough is enough. ""Their rhetoric is increasing the number of Chinese who feel very, very disgusted by their behavior, their psyche and their regime,"" says Zhu Feng, professor of International Relations at Peking University. ""China's government is seriously under fire because I think the majority of Chinese really, really feel that North Korea's bad behavior will inevitably endanger China."" Beijing has mastered the art of ""scream-free parenting"" with Pyongyang. It has learned to lower its voice and control its emotional reaction with every new threat or missile test. But public opinion is shifting and China's new leadership is recognizing the need to re-evaluate how it manages its troublesome neighbor. In a sign of Beijing's evolving approach toward North Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently offered this veiled criticism: ""No one should be allowed to throw a region and even the whole world into chaos for selfish gains."" The pressure is on for China to spell out -- and carry out -- the consequences for North Korea's bad behavior.","Pyongyang reacted angrily to tougher sanctions after its third nuclear test .

"(CNN) -- Research into the H7N9 virus suggests the risk of contracting serious illness rises with age and that more people may be infected than the 105 cases reported, according to a study by the Hong Kong University. Benjamin Cowling, associate professor at HKU's public health research center, told CNN that a disparity had emerged in data focusing people's exposure to live poultry. ""Essentially there are more exposures to poultry in older adults than in younger adults, but the difference in exposures is not as big as when we look at the differences in age of the number of serious H7N9 infections,"" Cowling said. He said that if age were not a factor in the seriousness of infection, then researchers could expect the pattern of the disease to exactly match the pattern of exposure. ""What we're seeing is that half the serious cases are above 60 years of age,"" he said. Milder symptoms also meant that many more people may be infected with the virus than is currently known because people potentially infected with H7N9 were not seeking medical attention for what seems like a mild cough or fever. Read more: Bird flu puts spotlight on age-old traditions in China . ""One of the reasons that SARS was easier to control was because all of the infections were serious so the patients had to be hospitalized and isolated,"" he said. ""It's easier, then, to reduce onward transmission."" So far, however, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in H7N9. Researchers were struggling to discover why an early strain of bird flu -- H5N1 -- attacked a mainly younger demographic of people in their 20s and 30s. Exactly why influenza strains are more serious in different age groups was still a subject of ongoing investigation, Cowling said. ""It's not completely clear what happened in the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic,"" he said. ""Certainly the burden of severe illnesses fell disproportionately on younger adults."" He said the normal profile of an influenza epidemic was that the highest proportion of infection is with younger children. Read more: China's bird flu mystery . ""That is a classic feature of influenza viruses but it seems from the mortality curves (of Spanish flu), the highest death rate was in young adults and that suggests something unusual."" World Health Organization officials this week visited Shanghai as part of a week-long visit to China to gauge the response to the outbreak. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health security and environment of the WHO told a news conference that there was no ""sustained"" pattern to the H7N9 outbreak that suggested human-to-human contact. Last week, however, a spokesperson from the Chinese Center for Disease Control said that as many 40% of the cases had had no contact with poultry. China's health ministry on Monday confirmed a total of 105 cases, in Shanghai, the capital Beijing and four provinces including Shandong for the first time. A death on Monday night in Shanghai brought the death toll from the epidemic to 21 people.","Research into the H7N9 virus suggests the risk of contracting serious illness rises with age .

"(CNN) -- At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke. The 19-year-old had been pulled over for failure to use his turn signal, but the fact that he is an undocumented immigrant landed him in a detention center in rural Georgia. Hernandez was certain that deportation proceedings would follow soon, and was mulling over it when a guard brought some news: He was being released. ""I was walking and I was thinking, this is a joke. They probably got confused with another guy or something,"" Hernandez said. More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action. The package of forced budget cuts, known as sequestration, will mean $85 billion of government-wide cuts. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) decision to move detainees to less costly supervision options was met with backlash from Republicans who accuse the Obama administration of using scare tactics to win a political battle. ""It's abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said. ""By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives."" But the White House had no input on the plan, spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN. The move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take budget cuts into consideration, the official said. An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as ""several hundred."" The population of immigration detainees is currently about 30,700. Those who have been released are non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories, ICE spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said. ""Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released,"" she said. Another ICE official reiterated that all of those released remain in deportation proceedings, released on an order of supervision. Some of those released will be on intensive supervision, such as ankle monitors, while others will just have weekly check-ins with an ICE officer, the official said. Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can't know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts. But he does fit the category of minor offenders, and was released at the same time as dozens of other detainees. Those being released alongside Hernandez on Sunday were confused about what was happening. Some detainees who had bonds as high as $25,000 were being told they were bonded and released. Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported. Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez. He has been waiting for his court date to be mailed to him. Another congressman, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, wrote a letter to ICE Director John Morton demanding accountability. He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person's detention. ""This decision reflects the lack of resource prioritization within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is indicative of the department's weak stance on national security,"" McCaul said. Planning for the detainee release began last Thursday, a senior administration official told CNN. Hernandez said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. ""I don't know why this affects them -- I'm not a criminal,"" he said. CNN's Jessica Yellin and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","ICE's decision to release immigrant detainees because of budget cuts is being criticized .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik, who admits killing 77 people in Norway last summer, was trying to kill the prime minister and other government ministers by bombing a building in Oslo, he testified Thursday. The blast killed eight people, but Breivik said he considered it a failure because the building did not collapse. Breivik is on trial on charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror in the July 22 attacks. He admits carrying out the Oslo bombing and then shooting 69 people dead on nearby Utoya Island. He boasts of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in Norway. He decided to carry out a gun attack on a Labour Party youth camp on the island of Utoya after his initial plan to target a journalists' conference did not work out, he said. He also hoped to kill former Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and decapitate her with a knife or bayonet, he said. He planned to film the murder on his iPhone and upload the video to the Internet, he said. He concentrated on killing people over the age of 18 on the island, he said, because he thought the killings of younger people would be harshly criticized. Many of the victims were younger than 18, but he said he did not regret what he did. ""I would do it again,"" he said. His attorney, Geir Lippestad, warned in a news conference after the session that Friday -- when testimony will focus on how Breivik carried out the killings on Utoya -- ""is going to be the toughest day."" There was utter silence in the court Thursday as Breivik testified, marked only by the sound of crying from some members of the public. He used the video game ""Modern Warfare 2"" as training for his shooting spree, he testified. Players of the game, one of the ""Call of Duty"" series, work together as soldiers to shoot opponents. Breivik also went through a period of playing the online fantasy game ""World of Warcraft"" up to 16 hours a day, he testified. He initially planned to carry out three bomb attacks followed by a ""gun-based action,"" he told the court, but eventually was only able to make enough explosives for one car bomb. Asked about his intended bombing targets, Breivik said: ""The first two were clear: the government quarter and the Labour Party headquarters. The third, I was not sure."" He said he at first had reservations about hitting the Labour Party headquarters because of the civilians and innocent people in offices around the building. ""But then I thought: There are not many better targets in Norway,"" he said. Breivik said he had also considered bombing the Royal Palace -- but without harming the royal family -- City Hall and Aftenposten, a national newspaper. Breivik joked about the psychiatrists who have labeled him insane and shrugged off a question about how he thinks victims' relatives feel when they see him smile in court. ""I think they react in a natural way,"" he said. As the hearing concluded, prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh asked Breivik: ""How is your empathy?"" Breivik did not answer but asked to have the question put to him again Friday, saying it was important. Lippestad is also expected to tell the court Friday about what were the sources for Breivik's information. His client did not raise his fist in salute when he entered the court Thursday, respecting a request from the families of his victims. The relatives were upset that he had been making the gesture each morning, Lippestad said Wednesday. Breivik said in court Wednesday that he should either get the death penalty or be acquitted, ridiculing the idea that he would be sent to prison or a mental hospital for his actions. Norway does not have the death penalty. The trial is expected to last up to 10 weeks. Breivik boasted Tuesday that he had carried out ""the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II"" when he went on his gun-and-bomb rampage. He planned his killings as a suicide attack, he said. ""I didn't expect to survive that day,"" he said Tuesday. Breivik testified Tuesday and Wednesday after declaring Monday that he had carried out the massacre but was not guilty because the killings had been necessary. Lippestad said it was important to his client that people see him as sane. ""He thinks that it won't have any effect if he is considered insane,"" Lippestad said. Experts have given different opinions about Breivik's sanity, which will be a factor in determining what punishment he receives if convicted. Sentencing options could include imprisonment or confining him to a mental facility. His testimony is not being broadcast due to a court ruling. Most of the victims' relatives did not want Breivik's remarks televised, and presiding Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen rejected Breivik's claim that airing it was a human right. Court papers indicated the five judges hearing the case did not want the trial to become a platform for Breivik to air his political views, or for them to distract from the legal issues involved. Breivik has said his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians. In a 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him, Breivik railed against Muslim immigration and European liberalism -- including the ruling Labour Party, which he said was allowing the ""Islamification of Europe.""

"(CNN) -- In ""Glorious Mission Online,"" China's first online game co-developed by the People's Liberation Army and released to the public, players join the ranks of the country's military to take on the enemy. The game was originally developed by China's military as a training and recruitment tool and featured Chinese forces taking on American soldiers. But the game drew massive nationwide attention because of one level, which pits Chinese soldiers against a different enemy -- Japan. This level is set on an island chain disputed between China and Japan. The game asks players to defend the Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan. Both countries claim sovereignty over the remote, rocky islands, which are near important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits. Japan currently administers the area, but since late last year, China has mounted a concerted campaign to try to change the situation. Chinese and Japanese ships cluster around disputed islands . So popular was the game in stoking nationalism amid growing tension between the East Asian neighbors over the islands, developers have officially changed the name of the island mission level to ""Defending the Diaoyu Islands."" ""The part where we defend the Diaoyu Islands and the aircraft combat were fun! All Chinese should play,"" posted @Gaici2hao. @Haidaoshengmingyue posted: ""We fought with the Japanese yesterday in Shanghai and the Diaoyu Islands, it's cool."" Although interest in the game has centered on the territorial issue, game developer Gu Kai says this was not the intention. ""I think the game has been misinterpreted a little bit,"" says Gu, whose firm Giant Interactive Group, Inc. co-developed the game with the Nanjing Military Area Command of the PLA. Gu says the company never specified the island area as the disputed territory in the first place, and the decision to label the mission was in response to growing public interest over the topic. The idea of using military-themed game to train soldiers or serve as a recruitment tool is not new. The U.S. army has an online game called ""America's Army"" that allows players to go on training missions and fight each other online. According to Gu, ""Glorious Mission"" targets nationalistic youths who are attracted to online games. A press release from Giant Interactive Group claims that the game presents a full picture of the PLA's daily operations and calls upon youths to join the army, defend their country, and strengthen the ""Chinese Dream."" Gu says it is hoped the game will help recruit more recent graduates who are experiencing increasing difficulty in a declining China job market, together with well-educated college graduates. Compared to other countries, China is relatively late in terms of using games as military training and recruitment. ""For a long time, Chinese military has been distant and mysterious to the public, but the game opens a door for young people to learn about the PLA and how the military operates,"" Gu says. ""The game aims to provide players with an authentic experience; even the voices are from real soldiers.""","First online game co-developed by the People's Liberation Army allows players to fight Japan .

"Washington (CNN) -- Stressing the unbreakable ties between their nations, U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Tuesday for direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians while agreeing that the international community is strengthening efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear ambitions. The two leaders spoke to reporters after meeting for more than an hour at the White House, twice shaking hands for the cameras as part of an effort to dispel the notion that relations between the United States and Israel have frayed in recent months. Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is ""unbreakable"" and added that his country remains ""unwavering in our commitment to Israel's security."" Netanyahu chose to paraphrase American humorist Mark Twain by noting that reports of the demise of U.S.-Israeli relations ""aren't just premature, they're just flat wrong."" The meeting, their fifth since Netanyahu took office last spring, focused on revitalizing the Middle East peace process as well as discussing other issues, including efforts to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal. Both Obama and Netanyahu stressed the importance of moving toward direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Presently, Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas aren't talking directly, but communicating through U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell, who serves as a go-between for negotiations. Netanyahu said Tuesday that he is ready for direct talks -- a step he has repeatedly endorsed in the past -- and indicated that progress in the peace process is coming. ""The president and I discussed concrete steps that could be done now -- in the coming days, in the coming weeks -- to move the peace process further along in a very robust way,"" Netanyahu said. Abbas has refused to meet with Netanyahu until Israel promises to stop building settlements, but said last month after meeting with Obama that direct talks were the goal. Israel's settlement policy has become a friction point between Israel and the United States, with relations reaching a low point in March when Israel announced plans during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden to construct more than 1,000 new houses in East Jerusalem. The announcement outraged the Obama administration and led to the Palestinians' withdrawing from agreed-upon indirect negotiations with Israel. In a visit later in March to the United States, Netanyahu was presented with a set of concessions that the White House wanted to see Israel make in an effort to restart the negotiations. Neither government detailed what the exact nature of the concessions were, but sources on both sides said a halt in East Jerusalem construction was among the demands from the Obama administration. Neither leader mentioned settlements in their comments Tuesday or their responses to questions from reporters. However, Obama commended Israel for easing limits on goods going to Gaza, saying there had been ""real progress on the ground"" that was happening ""more quickly and more effectively than many people anticipated."" The president said the United States wants to ""ensure the people of Gaza are able to prosper economically while Israel is able to maintain its legitimate security needs in not allowing missiles and weapons to get to Hamas."" In May, Israel's controversial embargo blocking the flow of goods into Gaza turned deadly when Israeli forces stormed a vessel that was part of a Gaza-bound humanitarian flotilla, resulting in the deaths of nine Turkish activists. Aside from Israeli-Palestinian relations, many Israelis worry about Iran's intentions with its nuclear program. Netanyahu noted that recent sanctions adopted by the U.N. Security Council are helping to delegitimize Iran's nuclear program. The sanctions ""have teeth"" and ""bite,"" Netanyahu asserted, noting that the United States also has adopted more of its own sanctions against Iran. ""How much do you need to bite is something I cannot answer now, but if other nations adopted similar sanctions, that would increase the effect,"" he said. CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Dan Lothian and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: Netanyahu hints at new steps soon on Middle East peace process .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico will not pardon legendary Wild West outlaw Billy the Kid in the death of a law enforcement officer more than a century ago, he said Friday. Richardson made the announcement on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" the same day he leaves office. The issue facing Richardson was whether one of his predecessors, Gov. Lew Wallace, promised about 130 years ago to pardon Billy the Kid -- known more formally as William H. Bonney -- for killing Sheriff William Brady of Lincoln County, New Mexico. Wallace has long been said to have promised a pardon if Bonney testified before a grand jury that was investigating another killing. Wallace did not follow through on that promise, many say, and the reasons are debated. Richardson said he believes that Wallace did promise to pardon Bonney. Yet there is ""historical ambiguity"" about why Wallace did not follow through, Richardson said, and he did not want to second-guess the former governor's decision. ""It was a very close call,"" Richardson said. ""The romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it."" The governor acknowledged a positive side effect of his consideration of a pardon. ""It's good for tourism,"" he said. ""It's gotten great publicity for the state."" Billy the Kid was born Henry McCarty but was also known as Bonney and Henry Antrim.  He died at the hands of Sheriff Pat Garrett 129 years ago. He was 21 at the time of his death. Wallace's great-grandson, William Wallace of Westport, Connecticut, has said there is no proof of an offered pardon. ""Where is the hard, concrete evidence?"" he asked CNN Friday, adding discussion of exactly what happened is full of ""gray areas."" While crediting Richardson for ""the correct rational track"" in his decision, Wallace said ""why the governor commenced this nonsense four months ago remains a mystery."" A pardon would have defamed his ancestor, Wallace said. ""(Lew Wallace) was a heroic figure in the history of the United States in the 19th century."" Some members of the Garrett family opposed a pardon. Besides arguing that Billy the Kid was an incorrigible killer, they wanted to make sure the sheriff was absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing. Jarvis Patrick Garrett, the grandson of the sheriff, cheered the governor's decision Friday. ""Yay!  No pardon!  Looks like it will be a great New Year!"" he said. Richardson had said he would not do anything that cast a cloud on Garrett. Some residents, including Governor-elect Susana Martinez, said there are more pressing issues facing the state. Richardson, a Billy the Kid buff, examined a promise by Wallace, the territorial governor, about 130 years ago to issue the outlaw a pardon. ""A promise is a promise and should be enforced,"" said Albuquerque defense attorney Randi McGinn, who filed the petition for the pardon and volunteered to handle the case for free. Following Richardson's decision, McGinn said in an e-mail, ""We won the battle (acknowledgement of Lew Wallace's broken promise), but lost the war (the pardon). The historic debate will continue and perhaps a future New Mexico governor will grant justice for the Kid."" Garrett killed Billy the Kid on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner, weeks after the outlaw escaped from a jail. The sheriff, legend has it, was hiding in the dark and shot the Kid when he entered a room. Garrett was gunned down in 1908 at age 57. Richardson had stressed that he would decide only the matter of Wallace's promise of a pardon. Wallace -- who had also been a Union general in the Civil War and wrote the novel ""Ben-Hur"" -- had promised to grant Bonney amnesty for the fatal shooting of Brady and other ""misdeeds"" if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder. Bonney cooperated, but the pardon didn't happen. According to Mark Lee Gardner and other historians, Bonney at one point wrote to Wallace, asking him to honor the deal. Garrett's family argues Bonney decided to flee house arrest, making the pardon moot. He eventually was convicted in Brady's death and was sentenced to death, the petition states. But he escaped from jail on April 28, 1881, killing two deputies. ""Still, regardless of Billy's crimes, the motives of Richardson or the hollowness of posthumous justice, it all comes back to Wallace's promise. A deal is a deal, and 129 years doesn't change that. Billy is owed a pardon,"" Gardner wrote earlier this year in the Los Angeles Times.","NEW: Descendant of 19th century governor pleased with decision .

"(CNN) -- What do NSA leaker Edward Snowden and a red panda at the National Zoo in Washington have in common? Absolutely nothing. Except that both mysteriously vanished. And both were the subjects of high-profile searches -- at least for a little while, in the case of the panda. But a little while was all Twitter needed to engage in a flurry of jokes, including the creation of several parody accounts for Rusty, the red panda. There were a few, tenuous parallels. Both are male. Both are relatively young -- Rusty is 1, Snowden is 30. And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China. OK, perhaps that last one is a bit of a stretch. But social media transcends all boundaries. @InvisibleObama tweeted, ""Somewhere, Edward Snowden is stroking a Red Panda laughing at us all."" @BCAppelbaum posted, ""Since China won't hold on to Snowden, we're going to start releasing panda bears."" First reported missing at 8 a.m. Monday, Rusty was finally captured around 2:30 p.m. about a mile away from his enclosure, zoo officials posted to Facebook. The zoo had tweeted several facts about Rusty, warning zoo visitors that he is still a wild animal and would bite if cornered or scared. The search began inside the zoo since red pandas are known to be territorial. For at least a few hours, Rusty's whereabouts proved as intriguing to many as Edward Snowden's. Snowden made news recently for releasing information about secret surveillance programs conducted by the National Security Administration. He initially fled to Hong Kong. Russian officials confirmed he had flown to Moscow over the weekend. Although WikiLeaks claims to know his exact location, no one else seems sure. His reserved seat aboard a plane to Cuba was reportedly empty. The United States has publicly announced it is seeking to extradite Snowden on charges of espionage and theft of government property. No such announcement was made regarding Rusty. ""Operation Rusty: Washington engages in another frantic search,"" read the headline to the Washington Wire post. ""Now Putin has a Super Bowl ring, Ed Snowden AND a red panda,"" tweeted @MicahGrimes. Putin has been accused by the owner of the New England Patriots of taking his Super Bowl ring during a visit. Although parody accounts have come under fire recently as being unnecessary and lacking humor, @RustyThePanda was undeterred. ""Is there bamboo in Ecuador?"" it asked. Its Twitter bio also included being a fan of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the Snowden story. Greenwald, presumably busy with other things, had not tweeted anything panda-related at the time of this writing. Some tweets appeared to confuse red pandas with the black-and-white giant pandas, also called panda bears. Red pandas look more like a cross between a raccoon and a small fox. Both enjoy a good meal of bamboo, however. This isn't the first escaped zoo animal to inspire an attention-getting parody account. In 2011 @BronxZoosCobra chronicled the seven-day imagined adventures of the escaped snake. That account amassed 187,533 followers and still tweets. In response to Rusty's escape it on Monday it posted, ""I have an alibi!"" The @NationalZoo account thanked its fans on Twitter and Facebook for helping recover Rusty. No word if @BarackObama will do the same when Snowden is officially located.","Rusty the Panda went missing from the National Zoo .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners turned out in Falluja Saturday, hours after a powerful Sunni sheikh called on Iraq's Shiite prime minister to hand over soldiers responsible for killing anti-government protesters in Anbar province or face ""losses among their ranks."" The warning came as reports emerged that four soldiers were killed and four were abducted after security forces fired on a Sunni anti-government protest in Falluja, raising fears of retaliations that could ignite sectarian violence. Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, who is credited with rallying Sunni tribal leaders to turn on al Qaeda in Iraq, gave Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government seven days to hand over to Anbar's criminal court those involved in the shootings. ""We warn al-Maliki that the people of Anbar have another choice, if their demand is not met,"" Abu Risha told supporters in a televised statement broadcast by a number of Iraqi news outlets. Abu Risha's words carry weight, as he is head of a 160,000-member clan, a subset of the Dulaim tribe, one of the largest of all Middle East tribes. Provincial health officials said that at least seven people were killed and 47 wounded in the shootings Friday during the demonstration in Falluja in the western Anbar province, a Sunni stronghold where protesters have been denouncing what they call second-class treatment by the Shiite-dominated government. In an interview with Al-Baghdadiya TV, Abu Risha also demanded al-Maliki withdraw troops from Falluja ahead of Saturday morning's funeral procession for those killed. ""They need to go back to their barracks and be stopped, or there may be losses among their ranks or the ranks of the police. With all honesty, Falluja is boiling,"" he said. The funeral procession drew thousands of mourners who shouted, ""God is great, God is great"" and ""al-Maliki is the enemy of God,"" and demanded that al-Maliki be removed from office. ""Al-Maliki is a leader of militias, he is a criminal, he should be fired from his position immediately"" Ahmed Ismaeil, one of the mourners, told CNN. ""Al-Maliki should be tried for crimes he has committed against Iraqi people. This is one of his crimes"" Ismaeil added. 35 killed in Iraq suicide bombing, police say . The caskets bearing the bodies of the dead were carried on the shoulders of mourners and were buried in Falluja's famous Martyr's Cemetery. Abu Risha is head of the Anbar Awakening Council, a group composed primarily of Sunni Arab fighters who turned on al Qaeda in Iraq, which was made up of predominantly Sunni extremists, in late 2006 and who joined forces with the U.S.-led coalition. While a number of the members of the council, also known as the Sons of Iraq, have been integrated into Iraq's security forces, Abu Risha has said he maintains a militia of about 80,000. Al-Maliki's government has put the number at 50,000, according to published reports. Abu Risha took over as head of the province's Awakening Council after his brother Sheikh Abdul Sattar -- also known as Abu Risha -- was assassinated in 2007. Abu Risha's demand that troops withdraw from Falluja was backed by a number of religious leaders in the city. By nightfall Friday, Iraqi soldiers withdrew from several security posts in and around the city and went back to their main military headquarters in Falluja, according to police officials in the city. There were conflicting accounts about what led to the shootings. Witnesses told CNN that Iraqi soldiers opened fire after they ordered the demonstrators to stop filming dozens of Iraqi security forces on the rooftops surrounding al-Etisam Square, while others said Iraqi soldiers fired when protesters started throwing objects at them. Security officials said the shootings occurred when protesters began throwing rocks. When the soldiers opened fire, protesters responded by burning military vehicles and civilian cars. By Friday night, dozens of angry protesters had attacked an army checkpoint in southern Falluja, setting the building on fire and burning an army vehicle, police officials said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were not authorized to release details to the media. Two soldiers were killed in that attack, the officials said. Two more soldiers were killed by snipers on Saturday morning, they said. That was followed Saturday by the abduction of four soldiers from near a military base near Falluja, the officials said. The four, who were in civilian clothing, were on their way home for a short vacation when they were kidnapped, they said. Al-Maliki on Friday said the violence in Falluja doesn't surprise his administration. He cited ""conspiracies"" plotted by regional intelligence services, vestiges of the old regime, al Qaeda and those with sectarian agendas. The government, he said, has warned before about ""those who have hostile agendas against Iraq, its political process and its democracy."" He said dangers are ""increasing day after day in an attempt to blow up the security situation in the country and drag the armed forces into confrontations."" The protest in Falluja was the latest in a series held in predominantly Sunni regions of Iraq. They have been countered by mostly Shiite, pro-government demonstrations, raising fears that the sectarian division could bring violence in the streets. The protests have grown in recent weeks. They began in late December when Sunni demonstrators took to the streets in Anbar province, which borders Jordan and Syria, to protest al-Maliki's order to arrest the bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafaie al-Esawi, a Sunni. The arrest of al-Esawi's bodyguards came just hours after President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who is widely viewed as a stabilizing political force in Iraq, left the country about two weeks after suffering a stroke. The protesters also are demanding the release of detainees they said are held without charges, calling the government corrupt and accusing it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni people. Iraq's Arab Sunnis and Kurds have accused al-Maliki and his Shiite political party of working to consolidate power in Iraq by cutting them out of the political process, an allegation that comes as U.S. lawmakers raise concerns about Iraq strengthening its ties with Shiite-dominated Iran. Sunnis make up about 20% of Iraq's estimated population of more than 27 million, whereas about 60% to 65% are Shiite. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated regime in 2003, Sunnis in Iraq have been largely disaffected. The gulf was widened in 2005 when Sunnis boycotted the country's election, opening the way to a heavily dominated Shiite government. The sectarian divisions translated into violence in the streets in 2006 and 2007, with fighting that nearly ripped the country apart. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad and Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","Four Iraqi soldiers have been killed in clashes in Falluja, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Eight-year-old Tineyi takes my hand and leads me into her mud-thatched hut in my home village of Matau in rural Zimbabwe. There, in a dark corner of the room, is a wooden bookshelf. Carefully crafted by her father, it protects her word-filled treasures from the smoky fire inside the small hut where her mother cooks. I smile, knowing that her father has recognized the value these books will bring to his little bookworm -- a life ahead of her with limitless opportunities. It was not a life intended for many girls in Africa. As a cattle-herding tomboy, I was bound to follow in the footsteps of generations of women before me: early marriage, illiteracy and poverty. Back then, most kids in my village never had a chance to attend pre-school because it didn't exist. Instead, we would spend hours chasing birds and monkeys from our parents' fields. Gold mines and urban factories employed men, while women remained at home to look after their children. The more men could read and write, the better their chances of being employed and able to provide for their family. As a result, families wanted to educate their sons, who became village role models. Without an education, how could girls compete? How could they become role models, too? That was more than 40 years ago. Today, change is happening in my beloved Matau, and all across the long red dirt roads, verdant mountains and open blue skies of Africa. The leaders of African countries have made education more of a priority, even for girls. Now, girls can be role models. Girls like me, a cattle herder who married young, and by age 18 had three children and no high school diploma. But I defied the odds, got an education and came back to build a school. Read this: Zimbabwe's whizz-kid starts university at 14 . Matau parents and villagers are seeing the value of educating girls. Girls can become leaders of our communities and our African nations. Many parents bring their daughters to me and ask: ""Can she be just like you?"" Matau parents are sending their daughters to school like never before. Education is the pathway out of poverty and the road to change for boys and girls alike. Mothers, fathers, teachers, brothers and sisters have come together to feed the minds and cultivate growth in learning among children. Extraordinary things can happen when you put the right tools in the hands of communities. They flourish. They become change makers. It is a road to change that leads to Matau and surrounding communities. Here, through a partnership with the Oprah Winfrey Foundation and Save the Children, Matau children are getting a safer school and a better quality education. The community is partnering with Save the Children, the Rural District Council and the Ministry of Education, Sport, Art and Culture, to prepare young boys and girls for school and help older children improve their reading skills, with promising early results. It is an amazing transformation. Our teachers have been trained to keep up with this growth. Oprah: 'Proud momma' as school girls graduate . Matau Community has become the ripple effect of change. You can see it in change makers like the grandmothers here who volunteered and molded nearly 400,000 bricks for the newly constructed school. Molding and curing bricks is exhausting, back-breaking work but when a community owns the process, nothing can stop it. The community realizes something important is at stake: education for all children. Change makers like Dendaredzi, who built the preschool center in his village, and the 346 volunteers who built preschool playgrounds made of locally available materials, and participated in parenting skills training. Change makers like Veronica and 72 other trained volunteers who are promoting and leading after-school reading camps and creating handmade books. Change makers like gogo (grandmother) Kawocha, who never learned to read or write but now encourages her own grandchildren to read at home. She told me in a text message sent by a village boy, ""Tererai, my daughter could not read and write and died leaving orphans under my care. Now they can read at home and I get to participate in their reading, it has never been heard of until the Matau Project. It's a miracle."" It warms my heart when I picture gogo Kawocha taking part in her grandchildren's education. Read this: Millionaire educating future leaders . But there are many more gogo Kawocha's in Africa who do not even know they can be part of the solution. How can we involve them, and how can we improve our children's education? What more can we do to encourage children to read at home? What more can we do to promote sending all children to school instead of out into the field to work? What more can we do to keep girls in school and out of early marriage? What more can we do to nurture girls as role models? From my tiny village of Matau and all across this mother continent, we -- our communities -- have the power to bring our African children out of the darkness of illiteracy and into the light of learning. It is a light that beams brightly on progress. It is a light that lets African girls like me and Tineyi dream big. Tinogona! It is achievable. Learn more about the Tinogona Foundation and Save the Children's Matau Primary School Project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tererai Trent.","Poverty and cultural traditions kept Tererai Trent out of school for most of her childhood .

"(CNN) -- A teenager who set up a school to educate children in a refugee camp, a youth who built a windmill to generate power for the houses in his community with no access to electricity and a 17-year-old with HIV who founded a charity to help others infected with the virus. These are just a few of the students hand-picked to attend The African Leadership Academy (ALA) -- a prestigious school in Johannesburg, South Africa that aims to create the continent's leaders of tomorrow. The initiative is the brainchild of Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian-born entrepreneur who hopes to instil a new generation with the skills to navigate Africa towards prosperity in future years. ""We get young people from all across the continent, bring them here initially for two years [and] give them this hands-on leadership practice,"" says Swaniker. ""I believe that you don't learn leadership through theory, you learn leadership by leading and so that's what we're trying to replicate here at the academy,"" he adds. Swaniker explains that the ALA tasks students with starting their own businesses and working closely with the local communities situated around the school. They are also taught about the roles of CEOs and CFOs as well as other senior positions within business, politics and industry. This, he says, helps prepare them for a future at the very top of society, whilst equipping them with the skills ""to do something much bigger for the continent"" in the future. From his experience of recruiting across the continent, Swaniker concludes that Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are producing the best students, while schools are weakest in Liberia and South Africa. So far over 400 students have taken part in the ALA's leadership program and over the next 50 years, Swaniker says the school's aim is to create 6,000 new leaders for Africa. Relationships have been set up with over 2,500 educational institutions across the continent to identify the most suitable candidates to fulfill these roles, while the U.N. also helps locate individuals of high potential from various refugee camps. This rigorous selection process is designed to single out not only the brightest students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, but also those who have shown strong tendencies towards initiative, communication and leadership, Swaniker says. ""The best leaders are not necessarily the smartest people,"" he explains. ""At the heart of what we're doing is a belief that the main reason why Africa has not met its full potential today is due to the quality of the leaders that we have,"" he says. ""So this is really an attempt to solve that issue ... the Africa Leadership Academy, is really saying: let's address [this], instead of trying to deal with all the symptoms of bad leadership that we have in Africa."" Swaniker identifies his own formative experiences as a teenager as a key factor in his desire to found the ALA. At just 17 years old -- and on a gap year before beginning university -- he was appointed headmaster of a school in Botswana. He says the practical knowledge he gained in his time there gave him the confidence necessary to achieve success later on in his career, not least in setting up the ALA. ""I firmly believe that a leadership experience that a young person gets in their teens particularly, gives them the foundation to do something much bigger later on in their lives,"" he says. He cites luminaries such as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Nelson Mandela and Richard Branson -- who were all exposed to leadership situations in their youth -- as the type of characters he hopes the ALA will produce. ""We're trying to create leaders in all segments of society, so leaders in science and technology, leaders in business, entrepreneurs who can create the millions of jobs that we need on the continent, political leaders who can create the policies that we need to develop properly,"" he says. ""We really need leaders from all walks of life to solve the diverse challenge that we have in Africa,"" he adds. By equipping the continent's most talented youngsters with the qualities necessary to lead on their own accord, Swaniker has taken the first steps towards creating an Africa more equipped to meet these challenges head on.

"(CNN) -- He was just a young boy -- long before he became one of Africa's all-time football greats and racked up trophies in Europe's top competitions -- when Abedi Ayew first heard people comparing him with arguably the game's best player -- Brazil's Edson Arantes do Nascimento, also known as Pele. Yet, there was just one problem for the young Abedi, who grew up in a poor Ghanaian village and shared a home with his 18 siblings. He didn't know who Pele was. ""You imagine that we don't have access to televisions, we don't have lights in our villages; we were closed in the very small village so we didn't have access to all these things,"" he explains. ""So for me, playing behind our modest windows and any small places we would get, we tried to play football. And then you see people who are a little bit older than you saying, 'oh Pele, he plays like Pele.'"" That nickname followed the attacking midfielder all the way from the red dirt fields in Ghana to some of the world's biggest football stages, including the 1993 Champions League final where he helped lead the French club Olympique de Marseille to its first ever European championship. Read this: Cameroon's outspoken football star . Like his namesake, the Ghanaian ""Pele"" displayed a nimble athleticism on the pitch, dazzling defenders with his spectacular technique and blistering pace. He signed his first contract in 1978 with Ghana's Real Tamale United but it wasn't long before he attracted the attention of foreign scouts, becoming a pioneer for African football at a time when few players from his continent enjoyed major international careers. He spent several years honing his talent abroad -- including spells in teams in Qatar and Benin -- before heading to France to play in the country's second division. In 1987, he made his move to France's top league after being signed by Marseille. But his first spell at the club in the south of France proved to be a short one as Ayew grew frustrated with the racial abuse he suffered from his teammates. ""I started playing with them and three weeks later I called my manager and told my manager 'look, I would like to change club because I wasn't accepted by the players,"" he reveals. ""Any time they see me passing, they spit on the ground... [and say things like] 'go back to where you come from, go back to the bush.'"" Read this: Tiny town breeding champions . The Ghanaian star left Marseille after just one year and began playing for rivals Lille. But his excellent performances in his new team made Marseille's club president realize what he had lost and try to sign him back again. Ayew was initially reluctant to play again for his former club but was eventually convinced by his wife who urged him to ""go and prove to them that you are the best."" So in 1990 he rejoined Marseille, where he enjoyed three golden years, culminating in the 1993 Champions League triumph over mighty Italian giants AC Milan. ""I felt proud because every footballer's dream is to win a Champions League,"" says Ayew. ""Having the opportunity to be one of the first African players to win is huge and I think I was just happy."" A champion in Europe, Ayew was also the heart and soul of Ghana's national team, which he captained for six years, starting in 1990. During his 16-year career with the Black Stars, he scored 33 goals in 67 appearances and played in a record five Africa Cup of Nations. Read this: Teens shoot for U.S. glory . Ayew, who's seen three of his sons following his footsteps by playing professional football, ended his career with Al Ain the United Arab Emirates in 2000. But his passion for football remains unquenched. These days, Ghana's football legend spends his time and money coaching and mentoring young players. Beyond the fundamentals of sport, he also tries to prepare them to face some of the challenges he overcame. ""We just try to ... ensure that they have a better career but it's not easy,"" he says. ""It's not everybody who is going to be a very good footballer or to have a professional career. ""So what we try to do is we teach them how to be in a society and that is very important -- even if you don't succeed in the football pitches, outside you can live within the society and I think that needs a whole lot of respect and discipline.""","Abedi ""Pele"" Ayew is a Ghanaian football legend .

"(CNN) -- Sporadic and intermittent gunfire rang out in Zamboanga City for a fourth day on Thursday as armed forces continued to clash with Muslim Moro National Liberation Front rebels holding as many as 180 hostages on the Philippine island of Mindanao. Lt. Colonel Ramon Zagala, spokesman for the Philippines Armed Forces (AFP), told CNN that government troops currently had ""contained"" an estimated 180 MNLF rebels in five districts of the mainly Christian city. ""Right now we went to ensure that we keep them in those locations so they can't get in and they can't get out,"" he said. ""But unfortunately they are holding between 160 and 180 hostages."" He said their original plan had been to land by sea and march on Zamboanga's city hall and raise the MNLF flag. ""We stopped that but now our immediate concern is the safety and the security of the hostages,"" Zagala said, adding that Philippines troops were under orders to contain the rebels and were not engaged in what he called ""offensive operations."" He said the intermittent gunfire that could be heard across the city was a part of the containment operation. ""Sometimes these elements (rebels) are trying to punch out and they fire at us so we also fire at them,"" Zagala said. He said the condition of the hostages was not known, but crisis managers were concerned about a lack of food and water. Zagala said rebels had killed two government troops -- one during the first encounter at sea and the second was killed by sniper fire on Tuesday -- and wounded 17 more. AFP forces had recovered one rebel body. ""We can't verify the rebel body count because we don't have the bodies but the best figure that we have is that AFP has killed 14 MNLF,"" he said. Almost 13,000 people have been evacuated from the districts of Talon-Talon, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, Kasanyangan, Canela and Mampang in Zamboanga, government sources said. Zamboanga's mayor, Isabelle Climaco Salazar, told a press briefing that she had been in direct contact with the head of the MNLF rebels, Nur Misuari, and the leader of the hostage takers, Habier Malik. ""Last night I was able to talk to Chairman Nur Misuari hoping that it would pave the way for the peaceful end of this crisis,"" Climaco said. ""What is of interest is that Misuari disowned the actions of Habier Malik, the leader of the hostage-takers with whom I communicated separately."" Zagala said that while Misuari had disavowed the actions of Malik, saying that the commanders in the MNLF were free to carry out actions as they wished, he said it was the government's belief that Misuari was behind the current rebel action. The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in this mainly Catholic country, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, though some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on the resource-rich island of Mindanao. Under the agreement signed this year, Muslims will get a 75% share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper. The current stand-off is believed to be linked to the terms of the agreement. Philippine President Benigno Aquino's plan is to achieve lasting peace in the region by 2016 when his term ends. Agreements have yet to be reached on power-sharing and normalization, which means giving up arms. A report published last year by the International Crisis Group warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal, civilian lives.","Sporadic gunfire as troops contain Muslim rebels in Zamboanga City .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Syria's ambassador to the United Nations rejected Tuesday a call for an independent investigation into the killings of hundreds of demonstrators by government forces. ""Syria has a government, has a state,"" Bashar Jaafari told reporters at the world body. ""We can undertake any investigation by our own selves, with full transparency. We have nothing to hide. We regret what is going on, but you should also acknowledge that this unrest and riots, in some of their aspects, have hidden agendas."" Jaafari called President Bashar al-Assad a reformer who has been working to effect change by issuing decrees that, among other things, lifted the decades-old emergency law and allowed peaceful demonstrations. ""If you demonstrate peacefully, you are protected by the government,"" he said. ""If you resort to violence, then any government in the world -- in order to maintain peace and order -- would utilize its forces to stop violence and vandalism and aggression against buildings as well as against innocent civilians."" Syria's own National Investigation Commission has already undertaken an investigation into the violence against civilians and the military, and will issue its findings at a later date, he said. ""So we are doing our homework; we don't need help from anybody."" He urged the Security Council to rely on official reports, not on media reports. Jaafari's remarks came on the same day that the Syrian Human Rights Information Link reported that more than 400 people have died since March 18 in incidents linked to the government crackdown on protesters seeking reform. While the vast majority are apparently civilians, the group's list describes a few of the dead as members of the army or police. The United Nations has said it has information that 76 people were killed last week on Friday alone, apparently during peaceful marches, and that the death toll from that day could be much higher. CNN cannot independently confirm death tolls and witness accounts of the bloody crackdown.  The Syrian government has not granted CNN access to the country. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice called the violence wielded by the government of Syria ""abhorrent and deplorable,"" adding, ""The outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end, and now."" The Syrian government's repeal of its emergency law and allowance for peaceful demonstrations ""were clearly not serious, given the continued violent repression against protesters,"" she said. The United States is pursuing ""a range of possible policy options,"" Rice said, including the imposition of additional sanctions. ""The Syrian people's call for freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly and the ability to choose their leaders freely must be heard,"" she said. Rice accused al-Assad of ""disingenuously blaming outsiders while, at the same time, seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by the Iranian regime."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who called for the investigation, briefed the Security Council on the situation Tuesday. ""I condemn utterly the continuing violence against the peaceful demonstrators,"" Ban told reporters. ""Most particularly, the use of tanks and live fire."" Ban said the Security Council would be briefed more fully on the matter on Wednesday, when it meets in private session. He added that he had discussed the matter ""at least"" twice with al-Assad. ""It goes without saying that Syrian authorities have an obligation to protect civilians and respect international human rights,"" Ban told reporters. ""That includes the right to free expression and peaceful assembly."" Human Rights Watch's U.N. director, Philippe Bolopion, called on the Security Council to ""condemn abuses by the Syrian government, support an international investigation and sanction those ordering the shooting and torture of protesters."" He called Syria's campaign for a seat on the Human Rights Council ""a slap in the face to the victims of the current crackdown, and an embarrassment to those who have supported its candidacy."" In state-run media, al-Assad's regime has described the protesters as ""armed criminal groups"" and said its soldiers and police were working to stop them.  The government has discussed the burials of ""martyrs"" killed by those groups. Anti-government protests or marches occurred Tuesday in Banyas, al-Tal, Amuoda and Zabwani. After witnesses told CNN Monday about thousands of troops and police entering the city of Daraa and firing indiscriminately, killing people in the streets, the Syrian government insisted that the citizens of Daraa had asked for the troops to stop ""terrorist"" groups. At least 35 tanks were in or around the city, said two witnesses who did not want to divulge their names for security reasons in an interview carried out by satellite phone. Water, electricity, telephone and Internet service were not working, they said. Sniper fire has sent a wave of fear through the community and led many to stay inside, leading to a shortage of footstuffs in households, they said. They cited that same fear as the reason that a number of the bodies of sniper victims remained uncollected from the streets where they fell. A doctor who told CNN that 21 people died Monday in the city said army forces had surrounded the hospital, where there was a shortage of medicine. Patients were being treated instead at undisclosed locations. He said he was using his car battery to charge his satellite phone. The doctor said tanks fired Monday into residential areas. Army and security personnel were looting stores in a commercial district, he said. On Tuesday, a witness in the western Syrian city of Jableh said security forces had set up checkpoints and were inspecting identification papers and arresting people.  Businesses and schools in Jableh were closed Tuesday, the witness said. The witness said the bodies of 13 people who died Sunday were discreetly taken to their resting places because people were afraid to walk in the town. Another human rights group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, has said at least 13 civilians were shot dead Sunday in Jableh by security forces. In the Damascus suburb of Douma, one witness compared the city to a ""prison."" Witnesses said security forces were arresting people, including three hospital doctors. A witness in Douma said Tuesday that security forces had set up sandbag barricades around and inside the city. Checkpoints around the city were being manned with heavy machine guns, while those inside the city are manned by lighter weapons, the witness said. He said shops were closed and parents were afraid to send their children to school. A Douma resident who asked to be referred to as Rawwad said that, over the past four days, security personnel had been arresting people they recognized as members of the protest movement. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Tuesday ""the situation in Syria is unacceptable.""  He added that -- as has been the case for the Ivory Coast and Libya --  ""nothing will happen without a resolution from the Security Council."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned ""any violence and killings perpetuated by Syrian security forces."" ""This violent repression must stop,"" Hague said in a statement. ""President Assad should order his authorities to show restraint and to respond to the legitimate demands of his people with immediate and genuine reform, not with brutal repression."" Fawaz Gerges, an analyst on the region with the London School of Economics, said Tuesday the response of the international community ""is very important in terms of the legitimacy, in terms of the isolation of the Syrian regime. But the reality is events in Syria will determine what will happen and the end results. Syrians will determine whether the regime stays or goes. ""Obviously the regime has decided to crush the protesters, to silence the opposition,"" Gerges added.  Al-Assad is ""using now massive force in order to break the will of the protesters. But even if he wins the first round, the situation is far from over ... The reality is President Assad will emerge as a much weakened president after his particular confrontation because he has lost much legitimacy and authority inside Syria."" The Syrian protests -- part of a wave of uprisings in the Arab world -- began in Daraa last month following a crackdown by security forces on peaceful demonstrators protesting the arrests of youths who scribbled anti-government graffiti. Protesters have asked for freedom and regime reform, and public discontent with al-Assad's government has mounted. Activists also want the easing of the ruling Baath Party's power and a law that would permit the establishment of independent political parties. A new Treasury Department executive order targeting senior officials accused of human rights abuses would involve an asset freeze and travel ban, as well as prohibiting them from doing business in the United States. ""The Syrian people's call for freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly and the ability to freely choose their leaders must be heard,"" Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said in a statement Monday. The U.S. State Department also issued a statement Monday urging U.S. citizens to defer any travel to Syria. ""U.S. citizens in Syria are advised to depart while commercial transportation is readily available,"" the statement said. The department also ordered all eligible family members of U.S. government employees as well as certain nonemergency personnel to leave Syria. CNN's Richard Roth, Nata Husseini, Amir Ahmed, Arwa Damon, Rima Maktabi, Elise Labott, Amir Ahmed and Raja Razek contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 35 tanks in and around Daraa, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Rivalry, dislike, even hatred are common emotions in the workplace. Add testosterone and adrenaline to the pot, stir and you have a potentially combustible concoction -- just ask Boris Becker and Michael Stich. In August 1992, Becker and Stich had much to celebrate as the duo became the first German tennis team to win Olympic gold -- beating South Africa to claim the men's doubles title in Spain. The Spanish night was young and Becker had arranged a dinner that night for Stich and a couple of other German athletes, but Becker says his partner preferred to take the first plane out of Barcelona rather than toast their success. Twenty years on, two of Germany's most celebrated tennis players -- whose personal relationship was limited by an intense rivalry -- have still to raise a glass to their historic win. ""When we won, all I remember was just hugging each other, like we were brothers, but believe me -- that would have been impossible a week prior to the tournament,"" Becker told CNN. ""Hopefully, one day we will be mature enough to sit down, have a bottle of red wine and just talk (about it). ""You know, I won it because of him and he won it because of me. It's never going to go away so hopefully, we'll be able to celebrate this great achievement one of these years."" The Olympics had come at the height of the duo's rivalry, says Becker, with the pair not just the best tennis players in Germany but also the world, as they vied with one another for major honors. Only a year earlier, Stich had beaten Becker in the first all-German men's final at Wimbledon. Yet although the partnership's strength was tested on repeated occasions in Spain, with their last three matches all going to five sets, Stich and Becker came through -- a result of single-minded ambition in their two-man team, says a British sports psychologist. ""Research has shown that their rivalry would not necessarily have affected the outcome because they would still have wanted to win for themselves,"" says Dan Abrahams. ""There may have been hostility on a social level but it was only what happened on court -- and coming together to achieve their task -- that mattered."" Becker says it was during the quarterfinal against Spain's Sergio Casal and Emilio Sanchez, who were both higher-ranked and playing at home, that the German team finally put their egos aside, once they realized that only teamwork could pull them through. ""When I'm working with teams as a psychologist, I reinforce the concept that if we are going to set team goals then everyone needs to be working together,"" says Abrahams, who is currently working for Premier League football club Queens Park Rangers. ""It is not the end of the world if players are not friends. Research in sports psychology suggests that players do not have to like each other for a team to be successful."" Down the rabbit hole: Depression in the Premier League . There can be fewer finer examples of that across any discipline than the on-field relationship between former Manchester United strikers Andy Cole and Teddy Sheringham. During their four years at United, the pair formed a fluid forward partnership that contributed to three league titles, one FA Cup and a European Champions League crown. All of this was achieved despite the fact that they never talked to one another, with Cole having taken grave offense to a perceived slight from Sheringham during the former's England debut in 1995. Cole, who is still the Premier League's second highest scorer of all time, said in 2010 that he would rather socialize with a player who broke his leg in two places than ""with Teddy Sheringham, who I've pretty much detested for the past 15 years. ""We played together for years. We scored a lot of goals. I never spoke a single word to him.'"" One reason why Sheringham and Cole could channel their enmity for the good of the team was the influence of Sir Alex Ferguson. The Manchester United manager has handled countless dressing room rows during his time -- and he is not afraid to drop players in a bid to promote competition, as he did last month when benching Wayne Rooney in favor of new signing Robin van Persie. ""Team sports can often be individual sports because each individual is trying to be chosen for the team and garner the manager's attentions, so team sports lend towards some rivalry within the team,"" says Abraham. ""That can be a good thing for management because if you have two players vying for a place, that brings out the best of them in training, their focus and in matches. ""However, it can be detrimental to their performance on the pitch if they are not working cohesively so it can be a double-edged sword."" Football's most poisonous rivalry? Liverpool and Manchester United's tempestuous past . There are a host of examples of teams that have suffered when protagonists have clashed -- with Dutch footballers regularly falling out before suffering premature exits at major international competitions, their French counterparts doing their best to emulate them in recent tournaments while teams in golf's Ryder Cup and Formula 1 have been undone by feuding stars down the years. The 2004 Ryder Cup was a case in point as U.S. captain Hal Sutton made an enormous gamble as he paired two very contrasting figures together, in the hope that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson could set aside their differences to create a ""Dream Team"". A pairing described as making ""oil and water look like a perfect match"" duly lost both their matches as they helped the Europeans retain the trophy in comprehensive fashion. Meanwhile, intra-team rivalries have ruined partnerships in F1, with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost repeatedly at loggerheads during their time together at McLaren in the late 1980s. Although their two years together resulted in a championship apiece, their frequent clashes -- some of which came on the track -- prompted the Frenchman to leave McLaren, no doubt regretting his decision to persuade the stable to sign Senna as he did so. Earlier that decade, when one feuding F1 driver (Argentina's Carlos Reutemann) had suggested to a team colleague (Alan Jones) that they bury the hatchet, the Australian's reply -- ""yeah, in your back"" -- typified the emotions when rivalries run deep. They have of course spilled over into premeditated physical violence before, most notably when American figure skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding clashed in 1994. Three years on from winning medals as teammates at the world championships, Harding's bodyguard and ex-husband hired an assailant to break one of Kerrigan's legs ahead of the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships -- a feat Shane Stant failed to achieve, even if he did inflict enough damage to ensure Kerrigan withdrew from a tournament that Harding went on to win. Despite denying any involvement, Harding was later stripped of her title and banned for life from participating in any further figure-skating events in the United States. Amid all this dressing room tension as players try to be the main man and with enmity between teammates potentially sinking any team, Abrahams warns that strong friendships between players can also bring complications. ""An element of closeness between players can become a problem for a manager in that they won't demand more from each other. You need to be very robust to be best mates with someone but give them a rollicking from time to time. ""My experience suggests that players who are good mates will give each other a grilling, but they need to be better at their style of communication as this can create trouble."" The ""Secret Footballer"", a current player who writes anonymously about life at the top of the English game, is in agreement, saying how he has played ""in teams where it could be argued that some players were too close to each other and so were unable to really deliver a bollocking when the situation called for it."" Behind the scenes with Graf and Agassi . Abrahams believes the individual nature of tennis, where players are so accustomed to winning and losing by themselves, enables them to deal with any hostility when playing doubles better than those who take part in team sports. But he does not discount the players' strength of mind. ""Strong characters like Becker and Stich can deal with an intense rivalry but the less robust cannot,"" says Abrahams. Indeed, the German duo -- who had a grudging respect for one another -- were admirably successful in temporarily shelving their differences as they united to win gold for their nation. ""Because of our rivalry, we were not that close on a private level,"" admits Stich. ""But the good thing was we both had one goal. We wanted to win that medal. ""After we both lost in the singles, that was the only chance we had -- as a team. We wanted to win the medal so we had to do well in doubles and we were professional enough to just go on that path."" 15-love: Top tennis romances .","Boris Becker says he has still to celebrate his 1992 Olympic gold medal with doubles partner Michael Stich .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 17 people and wounded three Sunday in Pakistan's volatile tribal region, Pakistani intelligence officials said. The strike occurred in Babar Ziarat, which borders the Pakistani provinces of North and South Waziristan, near the Afghan border, the officials said. Those killed and injured in the strike were believed to be militants, the officials said. The attack follows two suspected U.S. drone strikes in the same area last week that killed 15 people, including a Taliban commander with ties to the Pakistani military. Taliban commander Mullah Nazir, also known as Maulvi Nazir Wazir, was killed in a strike in South Waziristan, officials said. Nazir was at odds with the Pakistani Taliban over a peace agreement he signed with the Pakistani government in 2007. As part of the deal, he refused to attack the Pakistani government or military targets, though he was believed to be behind a number of attacks that targeted the U.S. military. Nazir narrowly escaped a suicide bomb attack in early December. After the attack, he warned the Mehsud tribe, which includes Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, to vacate South Waziristan or face consequences. Also killed in that strike were two of Nazir's deputies, the officials said. In recent years, the U.S. government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region, widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. U.S. officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare.","The strike occurred in the Babar Ziarat region between Pakistan's North and South Waziristan .

"(CNN) -- Dressed in a pink uniform, midwife Esther Madudu shuffles past rows of beds to check on the five babies she delivered the night before inside a small health center in rural eastern Uganda. Lying underneath a sky blue mosquito net, a newborn girl wrapped in a white sheet tries to stretch her tiny body as Madudu slowly approaches. ""Esther is there,"" says the midwife, pointing to the baby girl resting next to her mother. ""Esther Madudu -- they gave the baby my names, all my names, because yesterday it was born on my birthday,"" she continues, with a smile on her face. ""The mother was too excited because she never expected the baby to be alive so she said: 'these are all your names.' The pain was too much; she walked for a long distance and she thought the baby was dying."" Read this: Flying doctor takes to the skies . Pain medication is a rare luxury in the small village of Atitiri so Madudu had to rely on one special treatment to help the woman bring her baby to life. ""I gave her 'verbocain,'"" says Madudu. ""You know 'verbocain' is the only drug we can give them in Africa,"" she explains ironically. ""'Verbocain' -- you verbally talk to the mother; giving her just consoling words and patting her, rubbing her back, until she gave birth."" 'Stand Up For Mothers' Madudu is well known here as a midwife who has a very good record of saving both mothers and babies during difficult deliveries. But her reputation extends far beyond eastern Uganda. Since 2011, Madudu has become the poster girl for all of Africa's midwives, fronting an international campaign to highlight the plights of mothers and babies on the continent. Called ""Stand Up For African Mothers,"" the initiative by the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) aims to ensure that all pregnant women throughout Africa have access to trained midwives to ensure a reduction in high maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, AMREF says 200,000 women die every year from complications during pregnancy or childbirth -- that's 60% of the global total. ""In Africa, maternal mortality death is really unacceptably high,"" says Abenet Berhanu, AMREF country director for Uganda. Read this: 'Give African women a voice' The group, one of Africa's top health and development research organizations, works together with local authorities to improve education and facilitation of care. It also aims to train 15,000 midwives by 2015 to equip them with the necessary skills to maintain good health and has launched an online petition to symbolically nominate Madudu as a candidate for the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize. ""She really has a passion for her work,"" says Berhanu of Madudu. ""She has been working extra hours; she is passionate in handling mothers,"" he adds. ""This [the nomination] is in recognition for all midwives who have been working under challenging circumstances."" To support the ""Stand Up For African Mothers"" campaign, Madudu has visited different countries giving several speeches to draw attention to the issue of maternal mortality in Africa. ""This campaign is not a political campaign,"" explains Madudu. ""It is just a campaign which is creating awareness that there is death, maternal mortality rate which is high in Africa; mothers are dying; babies are dying. The solution should be, we train midwives,"" she says. Devotion . Like many maternity clinics in rural parts of Africa, the health center in Atitiri is lacking several necessary resources -- shortage of running water, electricity challenges, broken beds and scarcity of medicines all make Madudu's job very difficult. But despite the challenges, the midwife extraordinaire remains devoted to her patients. A mother of two, Madudu has chosen to live hours away from her family to be able to cater to the women that need her. ""I opted to give my children to my mother, not because I don't love them,"" she says.

Madudu can completely identify with the fears of the mothers she helps. Soon after becoming a midwife, she suffered herself the cruel experience of losing a child. ""I am a victim of mortality because I lost my baby during child birth,"" recalls Madudu. ""It was a terrible condition for me; it was psychological torture, because a midwife losing a baby? And yet I'm the one saving other babies,"" she adds. ""It was terrible and I said 'no mother should lose a baby; I'll try my level best, I will improvise, whatever I can, so long as I have the knowledge to save that woman and her baby.'""

"(CNN) -- They played in the U.S. Open final Monday but both Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic were back in action for their countries Friday. They both won, too, overcoming fatigue, jet lag and a change of surface. Nadal, who beat Djokovic in New York to claim his 13th grand slam title, prevailed 6-0 6-0 6-4 over Sergiy Stakhovsky -- Roger Federer's conqueror at Wimbledon -- on his favored clay. He boosted his Davis Cup record in singles to a near invincible 21-1, with his lone reverse coming in his first outing against Jiri Novak in 2004. Nadal hadn't played in the competition since 2011, opting to skip proceedings in 2012 even before his season was ruined by a knee injury. ""Today is another victory after a long year and every victory is important,"" Nadal told the Davis Cup website. With Fernando Verdasco also winning his match in Madrid against Ukraine, it means Spain is on the verge of retaining its spot in next year's world group following an upset loss to Canada in February. Nadal is scheduled for the potential doubles clincher Saturday alongside good pal Marc Lopez. If he does take to the court, it would be his first doubles tussle in the Davis Cup in seven years. ""To play with a good friend like Marc will be a special feeling, first time in the Davis Cup,"" said Nadal. Canada kept on progressing in the Davis Cup and encountered Djokovic's Serbia in its maiden semifinal Friday. But Djokovic was too strong in the opener versus big-serving Vasek Pospisil, cruising 6-2 6-0 6-4 on clay in Belgrade. ""I'm glad the match was short,"" the world No. 1 told reporters. ""I forced him to make mistakes. ""I find additional inspiration playing for my country,"" added Djokovic, whose last loss in Davis Cup singles, not including a retirement, was against Nadal in 2009. Canada, however, leveled the series when Milos Raonic toppled a slumping Janko Tipsarevic 5-7 6-3 3-6 6-3 10-8 in more than four hours. Defending champion the Czech Republic moved closer to another final, leading Argentina 2-0 in their best-of-five contest in Prague. Argentina is playing without Juan Martin del Potro and Davis Cup standout David Nalbandian. Great Britain, aiming to return to the world group for the first time since 2008, is tied 1-1 with Croatia in the playoffs. After Wimbledon champion Andy Murray routed U.S. Open junior titlist Borna Coric on the road, Ivan Dodig defeated Dan Evans in Umag. The only member of the 'Big Four' not to see action this weekend is Switzerland's Federer.

"Cairo (CNN) -- A stern Egyptian court ruling tied to a soccer riot spurred clashes that left at least 30 people dead on Saturday, the latest round of violence in the unsettled North African nation. In addition to those killed, more than 300 were wounded when people in the northeastern city of Port Said clashed with authorities outside a prison where their kin were being held, the head of Port Said hospitals told state-run Nile TV. They were angry because 21 of their relatives had just been sentenced to death for their role in a February 1 riot in a Port Said stadium. That 2012 incident -- during a game between Cairo's prestigious Al-Ahly football club and the host Al-Masry team -- ended with 73 dead. Two months later, Egypt's general prosecutor charged 75 people with ""premeditated murder and attempted murder,"" while three Al-Masry officials and nine police officers were charged with ""assisting the murderers."" According to the prosecutor's office, those in the latter group knew about the assault ahead of time, didn't confiscate weapons in advance, didn't stop them and -- in the case of an electricity engineer who was charged -- turned off the lights directly over the bleachers where the Al-Ahly fans were sitting right after the visiting team wrapped up its 3-1 victory. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs, yet prosecutors claimed the Port Said supporters were also armed with knives and other weapons. Many died after falling from bleachers inside the stadium, while others suffocated. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife sparked the riot, though witnesses said tensions had grown throughout the game with Al-Masry fans throwing bottles and rocks at the opposing players. That violence begat more on Saturday, after some of the defendants' relatives tried to storm the Port Said prison to free their loved ones being held inside, Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Osama Ismail told Nile TV. The reaction was far different in Cairo, where Saturday's verdict was issued due to security concerns. One man cried for joy, feeling that ""justice has been survived"" following the death of his oldest son, the married father of two children. ""I finally felt that I am in a civilized country,"" added a woman in Cairo's capital. ""My son (did) nothing wrong. But my son's legacy will live on, because of the true justice served here."" Egypt embroiled in deadly political unrest . Saturday's Port Said violence comes on the heels of other bloodshed around the nation, which was tied more explicitly to unrest about Egypt's current leadership but nonetheless symptomatic of instability and insecurity two years after longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted. More recently, protesters have focused their anger at current President Mohamed Morsy. The former Muslim Brotherhood leader, who became Egypt's first democratically elected leader last year, has come under fire by some who compared him to Mubarak and said he amassed power for himself and his Islamist allies. He has insisted his moves were necessary to move Egypt forward in the face of pressing issues and persistent obstacles. On Friday -- the anniversary of what some call the January 25 Revolution -- six people were killed in Suez and one in Ismailia, amid clashes involving anti-government protesters and those supportive of Morsy, as well as police. Hundreds more were injured in the unrest nationwide. Opinion: U.S. gets it wrong on Egypt again . Referring to this violence and what happened Saturday in Port Said, Information Minister Salah Abdul Maqsoud read a statement on state TV saying the government was considering implementing a state of emergency in some areas. ""The (National Defense Council) denounces the acts of violence and demands all national and political forces be committed to the peaceful ways to express their opinion,"" Maqsoud said after a meeting led by Morsy. ""(The council) calls for wider national dialogue, led by (prominent) figures, to discuss the issues of political disagreement and reach national accordance."" On Saturday in Suez -- about 90 miles south of Port Said -- the government deployed troops and armored military vehicles in response to the previous day's clashes. Brig. Gen. Adel Refat, the head of security in Suez, asked for the help after declaring the area ""out of control,"" according to state news. Protesters accused Egyptian forces of opening fire during the demonstrations, a claim Refat strongly denied. Meanwhile, in Cairo, clashes extended to areas around the Shura Council, the upper house of parliament. Protesters overnight waged a standoff outside the Nile TV offices, with some tossing Molotov cocktails and police responding with tear gas. Journalist Ramy Francis and CNN's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo; CNN's Amir Ahmed reported Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli air force shot down a drone approaching the nation's coast Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said. An Israeli F-16 shot the drone with air-to-air missiles, an Israeli military official told CNN. It went down five nautical miles off the coast of Haifa, and Israeli naval forces were searching the area while an investigation was initiated, the Israeli military said. ""I view with utmost gravity this attempt to violate our border,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a prepared statement. ""We will continue to do everything necessary to safeguard the security of Israel's citizens."" By the numbers: Drones . Thursday's incident marked the second time an unmanned aircraft had been intercepted in Israeli airspace within the past seven months, the IDF said. In October 2012, Israeli warplanes tracked and eventually shot down a drone over the country's northern Negev Desert. That drone did not carry any weapons or explosives, Israeli officials said at the time. They declined to discuss the drone's route or whether it had approached any sensitive facilities. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for sending the drone, which Israeli officials at the time said appeared to have originated in Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently flies drones over Israel, but the military rarely bothers to shoot them down, Michah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations said at the time.

"(CNN) -- Hope flickered in war-torn Afghanistan on Tuesday as national security forces formally took over security leadership and peace talks with the Taliban are now in the works. NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. The United States and an Afghan government group dedicated to peace and reconciliation will hold talks with the Taliban militant group in Qatar. ""I wish a long-term peace in Afghanistan,"" Afghan President Harmid Karzai told his troops at a handover ceremony in Kabul. But a senior U.S. official said reconciliation is likely to be ""long, complex and messy"" because trust between Afghans and the Taliban is extremely low. The latest moves could portend a hopeful chapter in the long and costly Afghan conflict. What do these developments mean for Afghanistan and the United States? Here are some key questions that will be asked in the coming months: . 1. Are the Afghan troops up to the task? There are certainly doubts. A Pentagon review in December found that only one of 23 Afghan army brigades was capable of functioning on its own. Meanwhile, literacy rates are low, desertion rates are high, and many deserters have joined the insurgency. There also have been a troubling number of ""green-on-blue"" attacks: Afghan troops attacking their American comrades. But then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta spoke positively about the progress Afghans had made in growing their army, reducing violence and becoming more self-sufficient. At the time, Afghan forces were leading nearly 90% of operations across the country. ""We're on the right path to give (Afghanistan) the opportunity to govern itself,"" Panetta said. Karzai has said he welcomes the U.S. troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the Taliban. ""It is exactly our job to deal with it, and we are capable of dealing with it,"" Karzai said during an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. 2. What are the conditions for peace? Karzai seems eager to resume stalled peace talks with the Taliban and include them in the political process. The High Peace Council of Afghanistan -- a government group devoted to reconciliation and peace -- will go to Qatar and participate in talks with the Taliban, Karzai said Tuesday. The United States will have a first formal meeting soon in Doha, Qatar, after the Afghans and Taliban huddle, senior administration officials said. The meetings coincide with the Taliban opening an office in the Gulf nation of Qatar. For their part, the Taliban told reporters in Doha on Tuesday that they want to improve relations with the world. They are calling themselves the ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."" The Taliban back ""supporting a political process and a peaceful resolution that will bring an end to the occupation in Afghanistan and establishing an Islamic and independent government in it"" and forging ""true security,"" a representative said. At the same time, the Taliban representative advocated the idea of political resistance. The United States and Afghanistan have several conditions the Taliban ultimately need to meet for a peace deal -- breaking ties with al Qaeda, ending violence and accepting the Afghan Constitution, including sections on women's rights, senior administration officials told reporters Tuesday. Conditions also were outlined by the High Peace Council, with one senior official saying there was no place for violence while talks are ongoing. ""We are hoping the (number of) Taliban attacks go down or even stop after we start talks,"" the official said. The first meeting between the United States and Taliban is expected to be an exchange of agendas and what each side wants to talk about, followed by another meeting in a week or two. One of the administration officials said foremost on the U.S. mind is hearing how the Taliban are going to cut ties with al Qaeda and urging them to talk seriously with the Afghan government. Exchange of detainees are expected to be on the agenda -- including Bowe Bergdahl -- the U.S. soldier believed to be in militant captivity. ""Peace is not at hand,"" another senior official cautioned, adding there is ""no guarantee this will happen quickly if at all."" 3. How big a threat do the Taliban still pose? The Taliban are still ""resilient and determined,"" according to a recent Pentagon report, and pose a major security threat. The Taliban continue to carry out high-profile attacks in the capital, Kabul, even targeting the Afghan Supreme Court during a suicide attack in June. Another strike targeted a building near Kabul airport. On Tuesday, a suicide bomber attacked the convoy of Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, a member of parliament, killing three people and wounding 21 others. Three bodyguards were among the injured. Mohaqiq -- a Shiite and an ethnic Hazara -- is a member of Afghanistan's political opposition. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan was sheltering al Qaeda when the terror network launched attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. The next month, the United States cranked up military operations that led to the toppling of the Taliban government. Ever since, international forces have been fighting radical Islamic militants in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan. 4. What are the biggest challenges? The main fear among Afghans is that the country could revert to another civil war once the United States withdraws its combat troops. ""Some people we've spoken to sort of take it for granted that there's going to be a civil war when the United States leaves,"" said CNN's Erin Burnett on a trip last year to Afghanistan. ""It happened before when the Soviet Union left (in 1989)."" Above all, Karzai said the Afghan army needs the tools to battle the insurgents, namely more equipment and firepower. He came to the Pentagon in January with a wish list asking for more helicopters, drones and other hardware, according to a senior defense official. ""We need an air force. We need air mobility,"" Karzai told Amanpour. ""We need proper mechanized forces. We need, you know, armored vehicles and tanks and all that."" Retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, once America's top commander in Afghanistan, said the Afghan people are ""terrified because they think they have something to lose."" ""There has been progress made,"" he said. ""But they're afraid that if we completely abandon them in 2014, as they perceive we did in 1989, (things) would all go back."" 5. What support will the United States and allies provide? American forces, now at about 66,000, are expected to dip to 32,000 by the end of the year and further throughout 2014. The plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train Afghans and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed. The size of that force is still being discussed. Gen. John Allen, the former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, recommended between 6,000 and 15,000 troops. But that figure was lowered to a range between 2,500 and 9,000, according to a defense official. The United States and NATO have pledged to continue to support and train Afghan forces in what NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen deems a ""new relationship,"" starting in 2015. Acknowledging that there is still much to do in the interim 18 months, Rasmussen said, ""Today, our shared goal is in sight.""

"(CNN) -- A 7-year-old girl is the latest person to be infected with bird flu in China -- and the first case in the Chinese capital, the country's official Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. The girl is being treated at a hospital in Beijing and is in stable condition, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau said, according to Xinhua. Her case brings to 44 the number of people infected in China with a new variation of bird flu called H7N9. All of the other cases have come from the eastern part of China. Eleven of the 44 have died. While the source of the infection is unknown, poultry markets have become the focus of the investigation by China's health ministry and the World Health Organization, which are closely monitoring the cases. Several cities in eastern China have suspended trading in live poultry in an effort to contain the problem. The father of the 7-year-old girl now infected with the virus is involved in live poultry trading, Xinhua said, citing a spokesman for the municipal health bureau. New bird flu well-adapted to infect people . The WHO said Friday there is no evidence of ""ongoing human-to-human transmission,"" but the international agency and Chinese health officials continue to monitor. ""The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance,"" WHO said. The virus involved, H7N9, is known to affect pigeons but wasn't discovered in humans until a series of cases was reported in China last week. On Wednesday, the Chinese Academy of Sciences said the H7N9 virus probably came from migratory birds from East Asia that mixed with domestic fowl in China's Yangtze River delta region. Hong Kong's Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced Friday that poultry imported from companies in mainland China would be subjected to ""fast tests"" for the H7N9 and H5N1 strains of the virus. Officers will randomly select 30 birds out of every 1,000 and collect swabs and blood samples to detect the H5 and H7 antigen and antibodies, the department said. Results will available within five hours, with cleared poultry then taken to a temporary wholesale market in the city for sale. If any of the birds are infected, all poultry imports will be suspended, said Allen Chan, a senior veterinary officer with the city's health department. The current outbreak has started to take its toll economically. Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC in China, said this week that sales at its restaurants across the country suffered a sharp fall. Xinhua also reported that the price of poultry fell by as much as 50% in some eastern cities in the past week, hurting farmers economically. Shanghai has now completely banned the sale of live poultry. CNN's Pamela Boykoff in Hong Kong and Ke Feng in Beijing contributed to this report.","NEW: A patient from Shanghai becomes the 11th person to die from bird flu .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Father Lorenzo Pasquotti keeps hundreds of cards and letters from the passengers and crew members who survived the wreck of the Costa Concordia cruise liner on a shelf in the rectory of the brick-faced Church of the Madonna of Giglio, just up the narrow street from the island's only port. Many of the letters, handwritten in English, German, French and Italian, are addressed simply to ""Giglio, Italy 58012"" to no one in particular, almost as if the island itself is a person. The writers express gratitude for assistance they received or apologize for the wreck's impact on Giglio. When the postal carrier brings the mail over on the morning ferry from the Italian mainland, he either leaves the new letters with Mayor Sergio Ortelli or at the church with Father Pasquotti. After all, Giglio has always been the type of place where the mailman knows exactly who is around and who is not. INTERACTIVE: How the 952-foot wreck will be raised . At least that's the way it used to be before the Costa Concordia ran aground off Giglio on January 13, 2012, killing 32 passengers and injuring dozens more. But in the last year since the salvage operation began at full tilt, the island has shifted from being a secluded utopia that attracted mainly birdwatchers hoping to spot Corsican seagulls, kestrals and goldcrests, or hikers who wanted to climb its solitary slopes, to what it is now: the epicenter of the largest-ever maritime salvage operation in the world. The island has a winter population of around 1,000 people spread between the port, the village of Castello on top of the island's hill, and the seaside village of Campese on the other side. The population swells considerably during the summer months when hotels and seaside resorts are brimming with sun seekers. But now Giglio's permanent population has been bolstered by a constant crew of at least 500 Titan Salvage and Micoperi workers from 21 nations who have, in many ways, invaded paradise. Many live offshore in a floating dormitory called the Discovery, but they all make their way to the island on a regular basis. A scant few of the new Giglese, as the island's inhabitants are called, are pale engineers, who, despite being on a sunny island for more than a year, still haven't managed a tan. They spend their time in simulated control rooms behind computer screens, working out every potential obstacle in tipping the massive cruise liner, which ran aground off the island in January 2012, to an upright position. One such worker is Jan Walhout, a Dutch engineer who will be one of the eight people in the control room when the Concordia is rotated upright in a delicate procedure called ""parbuckling"" that is scheduled to take place September 16. He lives in an apartment in the port and not on the Discovery, but he still has seen very little of the island. That's not why he's here. ""I am here for a job,"" Walhout told CNN inside a simulated control room attached to the Bahama's Hotel next to Pasquotti's church. ""I know a lot of people on the team who socialize in town, but I am here to concentrate on this job."" The rest of the temporary crew are mostly contracted shift workers who learned their perilous trade in places like west Texas and the British midlands. Salvage jobs are a natural leap for skilled deep-sea drillers and rig constructors looking for lucrative seasonal work, and many of them have taken up with the local girls, completely transforming the social scene at the port. On any given night of the week, the portside bars are filled with men in gray Titan Salvage jumpsuits. An occasional salvage woman joins the mix, but the vast majority are men who come in to port to unwind. Some wear holsters with scissors hanging on them -- a cowboy-esque equivalent of a pistol for deep sea oilrig divers. Others sling their red inflatable Titan-Micoperi life vests over their shoulders or dangle them on the barstools. People are still talking about the night last June when a life vest inflated spontaneously inside the Bar Monti, one of the most popular hangouts for the salvage crew. Matteo Di Mariuz, who runs the popular hangout, doesn't mind the new clientele. Sure he has had to introduce country music and imported beer for the new crowds, but he takes it all in stride. ""They are hard workers who work long hours to move that monster from our waters,"" he told CNN. ""They deserve a little down time."" Mariuz, who took over the bar from his parents two years ago, now stays open during the winter weeknights, something his parents could rarely afford to do because Giglio just didn't produce enough customers. In the morning he, like most of the coffee bars along the port, will serve up American breakfast on request. They've also learned what it takes to make a good cup of tea. All along the port, cafes and bakeries have adapted to the newcomers, some even mastering the art of making BLT's and sarnies for the workers' packed lunches. And even after the Concordia is rotated, the crews will have a lot of work to do to fix the starboard side and refloat the ship sometime next summer, meaning Giglio won't be going to normal any time soon. Most of the restaurateurs and business owners across the island hold nothing against the salvage crews who they feel are the only hope for getting rid of the rotting vessel. Despite an obvious decline in tourism, there is a definite increase in steady customers, especially during the winter months when, prior to the shipwreck, Giglio was a ghost island. Franca Melis, who owns a small enoteca called La Galera in Castello on the top of the island's hill and a dive shop down in the port, says it is hypocritical for islanders to complain that the Concordia has ruined their livelihood -- especially in the port. The economic slump surely has as much to do with a drop in tourists, and anyway, even in good years people were never able to rent their properties year round like they do now to the salvage workers. She even sees a silver lining. She is lobbying other islanders to push to keep the massive platforms Titan-Micoperi installed to stabilize the ship even after the Concordia is towed away. ""It would give us one of the best dive schools in the world,"" she told CNN. ""We can't rewind the clock and pretend none of this happened, instead we have to look at ways to make it work for the island's vitality."" Melis has been a strong voice both to the media and at the islanders' monthly meetings with the salvage managers, environmental experts and Franco Gabrielli, the government's commissioner for the Costa Concordia disaster. She agrees that now, when the removal of the ship is a top priority, may not be the best time to bring up life post-Concordia, but she wants people to start thinking about the future again. Plus, she points out that it could take up to two more years for workers to remove all the salvage implements they've put in place, all the while the port views will be marred with cranes and rigs. ""Leave them,"" she says. ""They offer far more good than harm."" The tragedy has not exactly united the islanders. In some ways, it has created two camps -- those that see an economic advantage to the twist of fate and those who count the days until every trace of the ship is gone. It is not difficult to envision tense days ahead. Melis's main opposition to keeping the platforms is the island's headstrong mayor Sergio Ortelli, who wants Costa Crociere to keep its promise to return his island to exactly the way it was before anyone had ever heard of the Costa Concordia -- and that means both above and below the waterline. Ortelli has a perfect view of the operation from his office window in the port and high-resolution diagrams of every stage of the parbuckling project on his computer, which he is happy to show on an overhead monitor to anyone who asks. He keeps track of the salvage schedule, logging days they've lost to bad weather to make his own estimate about when the ship will finally be gone from his view. ""We need our island back exactly way it was before that terrible day,"" he says. He still recalls how many passengers slept in his office that fateful night, and he says he feels a personal responsibility to the islanders to hold Costa to its promise. ""Everything must go,"" he says. ""Not just the ship."" No matter what happens after the physical remains of the liner are gone, the islanders will never forget how their lives changed the night of Friday, the 13th of January, 2012, when 4,200 people spilled into their quiet port. Father Pasquotti estimates that more than a thousand of the Concordia's passengers have come back to Giglio since the accident. Many came to bring back the blankets and dry clothing that the islanders gave them the night of the disaster. Merchants along the port's main street usually know what belongs to whom by asking around. Giglio still has the feel of a small town. In some ways everything has changed on Giglio, but a few things still remain exactly the same. Despite having one of the most technologically advanced salvage operations every attempted happening in the harbor, it is still impossible to buy an iPhone charger or camera battery anywhere on the island, or read the day's newspapers until the 9:00 a.m. ferry docks -- if someone remembers to send them over from the mainland. No one is ever in a particular hurry and the weather and food are just as wonderful as they were before the Concordia came to shore.","Costa Concordia ran aground off Giglio in January 2012, killing 32 people .

"(CNN) -- Traditionally, Saudi Arabia hasn't had much time for film. The country boasts no cinemas, and until last year, nothing but a handful of shorts had ever even been filmed on Saudi soil. It seems the country is looking to make a change, though. For the first time, Saudi Arabia's Association for Culture and Arts has submitted a film for consideration for an Oscar. This first is especially momentous in light of the fact that the writer-director also happens to be a woman. The film, called ""Wadjda"", is named after its protagonist, a young girl who wants to own a bike. The story, created by Saudi's first female director, Haifaa Al Mansour, is a parable for female independence in a country renowned for setting limits on women's movements and ambitions. ""I tried to create a character that is not passive, that has a huge love of life. She wants to embrace and pursue her dreams. A lot of Saudi girls are like that; they have this huge potential, but give up because the culture is very rigid, and they are afraid to challenge everything,"" Al Mansour says. Video: Saudi film breaks boundaries . Filming as a woman in Saudi Arabia -- a country where women are not allowed out in public without a guardian -- was particularly challenging for Al Mansour, who had to direct from inside, conversing with actors using a walkie-talkie. ""Because Saudi Arabia is a very segregated country, I couldn't be in the streets when we had our shoot,"" she explains. Film, she says, is not always viewed favorably by Saudi culture. ""Film in general is controversial in Saudi, and there will be people who oppose it because it's a story told by a woman and because it's coming from Saudi, and they want to preserve Saudi as this is a very pure place and they think film is corrupt."" While many are celebrating Al Mansour's efforts (it's picked up a fair share of awards on the festival circuit, including three at the Venice Film Festival), she has her critics inside the country. She has even received death threats for her work. ""That doesn't matter to me. Everyone in the media business in Saudi receives death threats,"" she says. Read more: Saudi Arabia launches first anti-domestic violence ad . Still, that the country is eager to showcase the movie shows Saudi Arabia is opening up, both in terms of how they deem film and in regards to women's rights. ""It's time for Saudi Arabia to celebrate art. This shows Saudi Arabia is changing,"" she says. ""It also shows that Saudi Arabia can be known for more than just oil. It can be known for its culture as well.""","Saudi Arabia submitted the country's first feature film Oscar consideration.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live lawyers changed their mind about calling Katherine Jackson as their last witness in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Instead, lawyers for the concert promoter may play a portion of Prince Jackson's video deposition before resting its defense case Wednesday. The five-month-long trial in Los Angeles is nearing an end, an closing arguments could be delivered on Monday. Testimony, which has been on hold for more than a week because of an illness in one juror's family, resumes Wednesday. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending that the concert promoter was liable for the pop icon's death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live argues that Jackson chose and controlled Dr. Conrad Murray and that its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments he was giving the star in his bedroom. Jackson died of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told investigators he used to treat the singer's insomnia so he could rest for comeback concert rehearsals in the summer of 2009. AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam announced in court last week that he intended to call Michael Jackson's elderly mother to question her ""about the absurdity of the damages"" she wants the jury to award if they decide the company is liable. Putnam informed the court and Jackson's lawyers Monday that he had decided not to call her again. A Jackson lawyer argued that AEG Live's ""intent is to show the lawsuit's purpose is greed,"" while the judge suggested that any mother could be expected to say ""there is no amount of money that would substitute for the loss of her son."" Putnam has frequently cited in interviews a ""statement of damages"" letter sent to him by a Jackson lawyer last year capping possible damages at $40 billion, but the judge ruled that he could not refer to it in court because it was not a sworn filing in the case. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle pointed out that the lawsuit complaint only says that damages would be ""according to proof at trial,"" based on testimony by several expert witnesses who have testified. Jackson expert Arthur Erk -- a certified public accountant who has managed and audited the business affairs of many top artists -- testified that he was ""reasonably certain"" that Jackson would have earned at least $1.5 billion from touring, endorsements and sponsorships had he not died from a propofol overdose preparing for his ""This Is It"" tour. ""It is very difficult to assess the value of the King of Pop,"" Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang told the judge Wednesday. ""How do you even do that?"" The non-economic damages suffered because of Michael Jackson's death could be enormous considering ""what happened to Paris Jackson,"" she said. Jackson's 15-year-old daughter attempted suicide in June and remains in a treatment program. Jackson lawyers seemed to welcome the prospect of AEG Live calling their client as their final witness, considering how jurors reacted when she was on the stand in July. Jurors leaned forward and paid close attention during her two days of testimony as the last witness in their case. ""Why are you here?"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked her. ""Because I want to know what really happened to my son,"" she said. ""And that's why I am here."" Panish asked Jackson how it made her feel to be asked probing and personal questions about her family by AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putnam. ""It makes me feel real bad, because my son was a very good person,"" she said. ""He loved everybody. He gave to charity. He was in the Guinness Book of World Records for giving to charity."" If jurors decide that AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, they could award damages based on the loss of the mother's and children's relationship with him and the amount of money he was unable to earn because his life was cut short. After AEG Live rests its case -- which lawyers indicated would happen Wednesday -- the Jackson lawyers would have a chance to call several rebuttal witnesses.","Instead of Katherine Jackson, AEG Live may play clips of Prince Jackson's deposition .

"(CNN) -- A former star college quarterback was found dead in northern Michigan on Tuesday night, two days after he went missing while on a fishing excursion, his former university said. Grand Valley State University tweeted around 9:15 p.m. (10:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday that the body of Cullen Finnerty had been found near Baldwin, Michigan. This came after an intensive search by police, firefighters and ex-teammates on Tuesday. ""The Grand Valley community is saddened to learn of the death of former Laker quarterback Cullen Finnerty,"" the school said. Finnerty, who spent time with the NFL's Baltimore Ravens, set off Sunday to fish in Lake County -- which is between Traverse City and Grand Rapids -- but hadn't been heard from since, Sheriff Robert Hilts said Tuesday. A flier posted on MissingCases.com/Facebook indicated Finnerty was last heard from Sunday evening. The family of the ex-football standout has a cabin close to a campground near where he disappeared. The only solid lead on Finnerty's whereabouts had been the discovery of a small pontoon boat he had been using in Bray Creek, near the Baldwin River, Hilts said. Video from CNN affiliate WTOM showed the boat perched on the waterway's rocky shore. No foul play was suspected in the 30-year-old's disappearance, the sheriff said before Finnerty's body was found. Searchers -- including members of the Lake County Sheriff's Office, area fire departments and state police -- worked with Finnerty's family to coordinate resources. They were joined by alumni including former football players, current students and staff at Grand Valley State University, where Finnerty starred in football between 2003 and 2006. The school is just west of Grand Rapids. Head football coach Matt Mitchell said Lakers players also joined the hunt on Tuesday. ""He's a big character kid and had a lot of friendships,"" Mitchell said in a video posted on Grand Valley State's website. ""I think that's the only reason why so many people are coming to his aid."" The Brighton, Michigan, native played four seasons at Grand Valley State, which traditionally has one of the premier programs in Division II college football. Finnerty compiled a 36-4 record in his time at the school, winning national championships in three seasons. (His first coach there was Brian Kelly, who now coaches at Notre Dame.) According to a news release after the Lakers' 17-14 championship win, he ended his collegiate career having won 28 straight games and having been ranked No. 1 in 23 consecutive polls of Division II football. D2football.com, a website focused on Division II football, named Finnerty its player of the decade for the 2000s. After his graduation, he joined the Ravens. Finnerty never got into a regular season game, though -- as the Baltimore Sun reported -- he was called up from the practice squad and put on the Ravens' active roster in December 2007. The Denver Post reported Finnerty was briefly with the Denver Broncos the next year. Finnerty was married with two young children, Grand Valley State assistant football coach Jim Schaak, who was among those taking part in Tuesday's search, told WTOM.","NEW: Cullen Finnerty's body has been found, his alma mater tweets .

"(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday morning arrested a 62-year-old man who, they say, tried to extort Paula Deen by threatening to divulge ""true and damning"" information about the embattled celebrity chef -- unless he was paid to keep quiet. Thomas George Paculis was taken into custody without incident in Ithaca, New York, by FBI agents and deputies from the Tompkins County Sheriff's Office, the FBI said in a press release. There was no answer later Friday to a phone number linked to him in the FBI's criminal complaint, nor was there an immediate response from an e-mail address in that same document. The former Augusta and Savannah, Georgia, resident appeared before a federal judge Friday in New York before being released on bond at about noon, said Stephen Emmett with the FBI's Atlanta office. He is scheduled to appear the morning of July 16 at a federal court in Savannah, where the criminal complaint was filed. That coastal Georgia city is also where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. But she's been on her heels in recent weeks after admitting, in a deposition related to a lawsuit brought by a former employee, that she's used the ""N word"" in the past. Chat: Comfort food, uncomfortable topics . Lisa Jackson alleged Deen and her brother Bubba Hier committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at The Lady and Sons and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House, two Savannah restaurants run by Deen and her family. In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost at least nine lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. So how does Paculis fit in? According to a criminal complaint, he interjected himself on June 24, five days after details of Deen's deposition became public. On that day, he sent an e-mail to Deen's lawyer vowing that he was ""about to go public"" with information about the chef's use of the ""N word"" at Lady and Sons, according to a copy of the e-mail cited in the criminal complaint. Deen's accuser: 'This has never been about the N-word' ""The statements are true and damning enough that the case for Jackson will be won on it's merit alone,"" Paculis wrote, according to the FBI. ""As always ... there is a price for such confirmation. ""You can contact me here if you feel it is necessary,"" he said, referring to his e-mail address, the criminal complaint states. ""Or I can go public and we will see what happens then."" Greg Hodges, Deen's lawyer, exchanged e-mails with Paculis and the two talked over the phone two days later, according to the FBI. It was then that Paculis allegedly asked for $250,000 ""net"" -- or total, with taxes having already been paid -- in exchange for not talking, the criminal complaint states. The two conversed a second time by phone June 27 when, ""at the direction of the FBI,"" Hodges negotiated the hush money payment down to $200,000. The next day, Deen told FBI agents that she didn't recognize Paculis's name or face, based on photographs. Hodges declined comment on the alleged extortion arrest. Nancy Aldridge, who was married to Paculis for four months around 1986, told CNN on Friday that he once had his own restaurant in Savannah though she hasn't had much direct contact with him in recent years. Meanwhile, according to the FBI's criminal complaint, Paculis had also reached out to Jackson's lawyer. In fact, the agency alleges that the 62-year-old first reached out to Matt Billips by e-mail and phone on the same day -- June 24 -- that he contacted Deen's lawyer. Billips said his staff conducted its own investigation of Paculis. Paculis asked Jackson's lawyer how much he'd pay for derogatory information about Deen, the complaint claims. ""I have pushed the opposing firm to (give) me an amount of money, in cash to never been heard of again and to never utter Paula Deen's name in public or private ever again,"" Paculis allegedly wrote, according to an e-mail to Billips excerpted in the FBI complaint. ""Now the burning question is,"" he purportedly added, ""do you want in."" Deen invokes same-sex marriage ruling in lawsuit defense .

"Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Rescue workers -- who had suspended their underwater search of the Costa Concordia after the cruise ship moved, making it too risky for divers to operate -- resumed searching Friday night on the upper part of the ship, the Italian coast guard said. Rescue workers previously suspended their search when sensors on board the vessel measured movement, Massimo Maccheroni, of the Coast Guard general command, told CNN. ""When this happens all rescue forces have to leave the ship, (so as) not to put their lives in danger,"" he said. Underwater searches will not resume until Saturday, the Italian coast guard said. The authorities are now assessing their options. One possibility being considered is an attempt to anchor the vessel to the rocks off Giglio island using chains. But, warned Maccheroni, ""It's very difficult. The Concordia weighs 110,000 tons and it's like a 300 meter-high skyscraper in an horizontal position."" Italian authorities are considering when to call off the search for survivors and start the recovery operation, which would mean salvage workers can start emptying the ship's huge fuel tanks. Coast Guard Captain Cosimo Nicastro said that preparation for the fuel removal operation is underway, though it has not started yet. A vessel with a huge tank still needs to come to the island to store the fuel. This will happen in the coming days, he said. At least 11 people are known to have died in the disaster, and 21 are still missing, according to the Italian Crisis Unit. A week after the ship ran aground off the Tuscan coast, it appeared increasingly unlikely that any survivors will still be found aboard the ship. On Friday, more relatives of the missing passengers arrived on the island. ""It's terrible, we spend all day with relatives of those that have someone still missing and of those that have been identified,"" Giglio Vice Mayor Marco Pellegrini said. A little bar located on the harbor was drawing a bit of business selling hot drinks and coffee. A private boat carrying French, Italian and Peruvian relatives of the dead and missing, chartered by the Italian authorities, sailed from Porto Santo Stefano on the mainland Friday lunchtime, to Giglio. Cook: Captain ordered dinner after crash . A spokesman for the mayor of Giglio said the families had scattered flowers on the water by the wreck site. Also on the boat was Susy Albertini, the mother of a missing 5-year-old Italian girl, Dayana Arlotti. The girl's father, Albertini's ex-husband, William Arlotti, is also unaccounted for. ""Dayana was very happy and excited for this trip,"" said Davide Veschi, lawyer for Susy Albertini. ""She packed all her nicest clothes last Thursday. We know from other passengers that she was wearing a life vest but her father no. They are not experienced swimmers. Susy tried to reach the father's mobile many times that night, but nobody answered."" Eight of the dead have so far been named -- four French passengers, a Spanish passenger, and Italian and one crew member each from Hungary and Peru. Criticism from both Costa Cruises and the authorities has focused so far on Capt. Francesco Schettino, who is under house arrest and facing possible charges of manslaughter, shipwreck and abandoning ship. His lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, spoke to Sky Tg24 on Friday, urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts. ""Obviously, before we can talk about responsibilities, we need to make sure that there is a series of facts that are corroborated. Until now we only have one fact: the fact that the ship Concordia hit a rock. What were the causes of the collision: a wrong maneuver? A missing sign on the sea maps? High speed? A sudden change of route? Improvised route? I am not able to determine this,"" Leporatti told the Italian news channel. ""It will be the technical examinations that will in their entirety clarify the dynamic of the events,"" Leporatti reportedly said. Further doubt was cast on Schettino's leadership late Thursday when a cook from the ship told a Filipino television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m., less than an hour after the collision. ""We wondered what was going on,"" cook Rogelio Barista told GMA Network. ""At that time, we really felt something was wrong. ... The stuff in the kitchen was falling off shelves and we realized how grave the situation was."" However, a Moldovan woman Domnica Cemortan, 25, who also works for the Costa cruise line but said she was on the Concordia as a passenger, defended the captain in a TV interview. ""I've heard in Russian media that the captain left the ship first, or among the first. But this is not true,"" she said. ""I'm a witness -- I don't know if I'm invited to testify in the court or not, but as a witness I can say that I left the deck at 11:50 p.m. following an order from the captain who told me to go to the third deck to get into a lifeboat that could take more people."" Cemortan said she had gone to the deck to help translate the captain's orders after hearing a coded announcement that raised the alarm for crew members. Coast guard records published Thursday by an Italian newspaper added to the pressure on Schettino and his officers, suggesting authorities first became aware of the crash from a friend of the mother of a passenger about 15 minutes after the ship hit rocks. The Coast Guard identified the ship in trouble and contacted it, asking if there were problems on board, at 10:14 p.m. -- more than half an hour after the 9:41 p.m. collision -- according to a Coast Guard log published in the newspaper La Repubblica. The ship responded that it was experiencing a ""black out,"" according to the log and said the crew believed it could solve the problem in a short time. The log does not indicate which crew member was speaking. What appears to be the audio of that first radio call between the Costa Concordia and the Coast Guard was broadcast on Italian media Thursday. A Coast Guard official is heard to ask: ""What kind of a problem is it? Just something with the generator? The police of Prato have received a phone call from the relatives of a sailor who said that during the dinner everything was falling on his head."" The unidentified crew member responds: ""We have a black out and we are checking the conditions on board."" ""The passengers say they have been told to put on the life vests, is this correct?"" the Coast Guard then asks, to which the crew member repeats the same answer, before promising to keep the Coast Guard updated. In Schettino's hometown of Meta di Sorrento, residents were standing by the cruise ship captain. A spray-painted sheet left hanging outside the home where Schettino is under house arrest says, ""Captain, don't give up."" ""It looks like the only one responsible is the captain. That's what everyone on the outside think,"" Mayor Paolo Trapani said. ""But in this village, people know he cannot be responsible for everything. It's not like journalists want to portray it."" The decision to give up the search for survivors is expected to come by the weekend, when the weather is forecast to deteriorate. Declaring the operation to be recovery rather than rescue would allow salvage experts to start pumping fuel out of the ship, potentially averting an environmental catastrophe. The ship was carrying about 2,300 tons of fuel when it hit rocks. Prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers, causing the shipwreck, according to legal papers. Judge Valeria Montesarchio's initial ruling found Schettino changed the ship's course, steering too close to shore and causing the ship to hit a rock. Costa Cruises chairman Pier Luigi Foschi earlier this week placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes. There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea on Thursday warned North Korea of serious consequences if it rejects an offer to hold talks about the dire situation at their shared manufacturing zone where Pyongyang has halted activity amid recent tensions. The South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Hyung-seok urged the North to respond to the offer of talks over the zone, the Kaesong Industrial Complex, by noon on Friday. Kim said that if Pyongyang turns down the offer, Seoul would have no choice but to take ""grave"" measures. He did not specify what those measures might involve. Seen as the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries, the Kaesong complex is a joint economic zone on the North's side of the border that houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. Earlier this month, during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at South Korea and the United States, the North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border. It then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. Since the North started preventing people from entering the zone from the South Korean side, the number of non-North Koreans in there has steadily dwindled from more than 800 before the crisis began. As of Wednesday, 176 South Koreans and one Chinese person remained in the Kaesong complex, according to South Korean authorities. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","South Korea calls on North to respond to offer of talks by noon on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador is calling for British authorities to help investigate after officials found a secret recording device planted inside the South American country's embassy in London. A ""spy microphone"" was found inside the Ecuadorian ambassador's office on June 14, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino told reporters Wednesday. It was hidden inside a small white box inside an electrical outlet, partially covered by a bookshelf, he said. The discovery, Patino said, ""very seriously concerns us."" ""We are requesting backing from the British government to continue with the investigation of the device found,"" he said. The device, he said, contained a SIM card and was designed to transmit private conversations occurring inside the embassy. Ecuadorian authorities believe it had been in place for weeks. It was found two days before Patino was scheduled to arrive at the embassy, he said. Patino said authorities have ""founded suspicions"" that indicate a private British surveillance company was involved, but he did not provide additional details. The company did not immediately respond to a request from CNN to comment. In addition to serving as an office for Ecuadorian officials abroad, the embassy has also been home for more than a year to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who received asylum from Ecuador in August and risks arrest if he leaves the property. The revelation comes amid worldwide debate over U.S. surveillance, including reports that the National Security Agency planted bugs in diplomatic offices. It also comes as Ecuador plays a key role in the global guessing game over the next steps for Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who is on the run after admitting that he leaked classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs. Snowden has asked for asylum from Ecuador and 20 other countries. Patino said on Wednesday that his country was still evaluating the request. Asked whether Assange's presence inside the Ecuadorian Embassy had opened the building to more risks, Patino acknowledged that the WikiLeaks founder's presence had brought greater attention to the embassy. ""Surely, there are risks, yes ... but we are willing to run them when it comes to defending rights,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Seventeen-year-old women should be able to buy the ""morning-after pill"" without a prescription within a few weeks, a government spokesman said Thursday. Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that the contraceptive will be available over the counter to 17-year-olds, as it currently is for women 18 and older. Agency spokesman George Strait said Thursday the approval process for the change will not take long. ""It's likely to be weeks, rather than months or years before it's approved,"" he said. The FDA just needs to review the label changes from the drug's maker, Duramed, Strait said. Once that's done, the approval will be complete. On March 23, a federal court ordered that Plan B, an emergency contraception pill, be made available over the counter to those 17 and older, the agency said in a statement on its Web site. The agency will not appeal that order, the statement said. In the order, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman also asked the agency to consider whether the pill should be available to women of all ages without a prescription, saying that such a determination is best left to the expertise of the FDA rather than a federal district judge.  Watch more on the Plan B controversy » . And he rebuked the FDA for apparently departing from its own procedures with respect to making decisions on the pill's over-the-counter status, noting the ""unusual involvement of the White House in the Plan B decision-making process."" The plaintiffs in the case presented ""unrebutted evidence of the FDA's lack of good faith"" toward the application to switch Plan B from prescription to non-prescription use, the judge wrote. ""This lack of good faith is evidenced by, among other things, (1) repeated and unreasonable delays, pressure emanating from the White House, and the obvious connection between the confirmation process of two FDA commissioners and the timing of the FDA's decisions; and (2) significant departures from the FDA's normal procedures and policies ... as compared to the review of other switch applications in the past 10 years,"" Korman wrote. In August 2006, the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older, but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it. But, the agency said in Wednesday's statement, ""in accordance with the court's order, and consistent with the scientific findings since 2005 by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA sent a letter to the manufacturer of Plan B that the company may, upon submission and approval of an appropriate application, market Plan B without a prescription to women 17 years of age and older."" ""No useful purpose would be served by continuing to deprive 17-year-olds access to Plan B without a prescription,"" Korman wrote in his order. ""Indeed, the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription. The FDA's justification for this age restriction, that pharmacists would be unable to enforce the prescription requirement if the cutoff were age 17, rather than 18, lacks all credibility.""  Watch bloggers debate the merits of Plan B » . Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said in a statement that the FDA's announcement is ""a strong statement to American women that their health comes before politics. And that's the way it should be. This decision is common-sense policy that will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and protect the health and safety of all women."" The morning-after pill -- made by Duramed, a subsidiary of Barr Pharmaceuticals -- is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. It works by stopping ovulation and decreasing the chances that a fertilized egg will attach to the uterus. When used within 72 hours of unprotected sex, it can lower the risk of pregnancy by almost 90 percent, the maker says. Some critics charge that the drug's action amounts to an abortion, and opposed making it available over the counter. Others expressed health concerns. ""Plan B is a high dose of birth control pills. ... The FDA violated its standards when it made the high-dose Plan B available nonprescription to adults. But now the FDA is making the drug available to minors without parental consent,"" the Concerned Women for America, a Washington-based conservative Christian group, said Wednesday. ""Parents should be furious that the FDA is putting their minor daughters at risk,"" the group said.","Judge asks FDA to weigh availability to women of all ages .

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- Concern about the possibility of broader war in the Middle East grew Monday after reported airstrikes on Syrian military installations. The reported strikes killed 42 Syrian soldiers, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday, citing medical sources. It said 100 people remained missing. The Syrian government warned Sunday's apparent strikes -- which followed one last week that Syria also blames on Israel -- ""opens the door wide for all the possibilities."" Syrian ally Iran warned of a ""crushing response"" while Russia called reports of Israeli involvement ""very worrying."" But an Israeli general who commands forces on the Syrian border said ""there are no winds of war,"" according to the Israel Defense Forces website. The heightened tensions come amid questions over possible chemical weapon use in Syria and international debate over how to respond to the country's bloody civil war, in which more than 70,000 people have died in more than two years of fighting. On Monday, a U.N. official spoke of strong suspicions that rebels, not Syrian government forces, have used chemical weapons. Details of reported strikes . Syria claimed Israeli missiles struck at its military facilities on Sunday. According to the state-run SANA news agency, Israeli missiles struck a research center in Jamraya, a facility in Maysaloun and what the news agency described as a ""paragliding airport"" near Damascus. ""The Israeli terrorist aggressions on the Syrian territories have left no room for hesitation, weakness, self-dissociation or silence as Syria would not forgive us all if we hesitated in defending it,"" SANA reported Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi as saying. The blasts prompted terrified residents nearby to run for cover. ""Everything kept exploding over and over again,"" said Anna Deeb, whose family lives just over a mile away. ""We could hear gunshots, we could hear people screaming. ... We didn't know what to do, and there was a problem with us breathing because the smoke was too much."" Syria says the attack followed another Israeli airstrike late last week. Israel has not confirmed or denied that its forces were involved in any attacks inside Syria, but a U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr on Monday that Israeli forces conducted Sunday's strike, as well as one last week. Sunday's strike targeted a research facility in a mountainous area near Damascus and weapons that were to be transferred to Hezbollah, according to the source. The earlier strike, which U.S. officials had previously said happened Thursday or Friday, targeted Fateh 110 missiles stored at the Damascus airport, the source said. SANA reported that the allegation of weapons transfers was false. And Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al-Mekdad told CNN the attacks amount to a declaration of war by Israel. ""The details are not clear on what happened,"" al-Mekdad told CNN. ""Did they fire missiles? ... It is not clear for me, because I don't know how it happened, and of course it is worrying, but Israel will suffer the same."" 'Watching everything' While Israel has not acknowledged responsibility for the attacks, the country has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups. ""We are watching everything when it comes to the movement of these types of weapons. We have the means to do that,"" a senior Israeli defense official told CNN's Sara Sidner on Sunday. The official is not authorized to speak to the media. Shaul Mofaz, a lawmaker in Israel's Knesset, told Israeli Army Radio on Sunday that Israel isn't meddling with Syria's civil war. But Israel must protect itself from Lebanese militants, he said. ""For Israel, it is very important that the front group for Iran, which is in Lebanon, needs to be stopped,"" Mofaz said. International response . Hezbollah did not immediately comment after Sunday's claims. Iran said it will stand by Syria, ""and if there is need for training, we will provide them with necessary training,"" Brig. Gen. Ahmad-Reza Pourdastan, commander of the Iranian Army's Ground Forces, told reporters Sunday. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said he had no doubt Syria and its allies will ""give a crushing response to the aggressions of the Zionists,"" the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Russia also weighed in Monday, with a Foreign Ministry spokesman calling the reports of Israeli strikes ""very worrying."" ""Any intensification of military confrontation greatly increases the risks of creating hotbeds of tension aside from Syria, in Lebanon, and also destabilizing the Israeli-Lebanese border, which has so far remained relatively calm,"" ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Monday. But Israeli Maj. Gen. Yair Golan indicated war is not imminent, according to the IDF's website. ""There are no winds of war,"" said Golan, who is in charge of the Northern Command. Two rockets fired from inside Syria fell into the Golan Heights, the IDF said in a tweet. The military said the rockets were ""fired erroneously as a byproduct of internal conflict in Syria."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters Monday that the alliance had no information on the reported airstrikes, but said the alliance remains concerned about the possibility that the conflict could spread beyond Syria's borders. ""It's not a new concern that for quite some time we have expressed concerned of the risk of spillover of this conflict,"" he said. Chemical weapons reports . The tensions have been worsened by conflicting reports on the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria. On Monday, a U.N. official said evidence points to the use of the deadly nerve agent sarin by Syrian rebel forces. Carla Del Ponte told an Italian-Swiss TV station that the findings come after interviews with doctors and Syrian victims now in neighboring countries. Del Ponte, the commissioner of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria, said the notion isn't surprising, given the infiltration of foreign fighters into the Syrian opposition. Later, the commission issued a press release saying it ""has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict."" Therefore, ""the commission is not in a position to further comment on the allegations at this time,"" the statement said. The Syrian Coalition released a statement in response to Del Ponte's comments, condemning the use of chemical weapons and stressing that it will continue to conduct its own investigations. ""The Syrian Coalition will take all necessary legal measures in case the investigation reveals parties other than Assad's regime have used chemical weapons,"" it said. A U.S. State Department official told CNN that the United States does not have information suggesting that rebels have ""either the capability or the intent to deploy or use such weapons."" But, the source said, the ""facts are not complete"" and efforts to obtain more information are ongoing. Rebel Free Syrian Army spokesman Louay Almokdad said rebels don't have unconventional weapons, nor do they want any. ""In any case, we don't have the mechanism to launch these kinds of weapons, which would need missiles that can carry chemical warheads, and we in the FSA do not possess these kind of capabilities,"" Almokdad said. ""More importantly, we do not aspire to have (chemical weapons) because we view our battle with the regime as a battle for the establishment of a free democratic state. ... We want to build a free democratic state that recognizes and abides by all international accords and agreements -- and chemical and biological warfare is something forbidden legally and internationally."" Intelligence claims . The claim of rebels using sarin gas comes after months of suspicions that the Syrian regime has used the same nerve agent against rebels. Last week, the United States said its intelligence analysts had concluded ""with varying degrees of confidence"" that chemical weapons had been used in Syria and that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad was the likely culprit. In April, the head of Israeli military's intelligence research said the Syrian government is using chemical weapons against rebel forces. ""In all likelihood they used sarin gas,"" Brig. Gen. Itai Brun said. The Free Syrian Army's chief of staff has also said the Syrian regime has used sarin in cities such as Homs, Aleppo and Otaiba, outside Damascus. ""We took some samples of the soil and of blood. The injured people were observed by doctors, and the samples were tested, and it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons,"" Gen. Salim Idriss told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month. Sarin gas can be hard to detect because it is colorless, odorless and tasteless. But it can cause severe injuries to those exposed to it, including blurred vision, convulsions, paralysis and death. Why Syria matters . The Syrian civil war has pitted rebel fighters against the regime run by al-Assad, whose family has ruled the country for four decades. Syria matters to Iran because it is believed to be the main conduit to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, the proxy through which Iran can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah, according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks. The last thing Iran wants is a Sunni-dominated Syria -- especially as the Syrian rebels' main supporters are Iran's Persian Gulf rivals: Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Hezbollah's feared scenario is Israel on one side and a hostile Sunni-led Syria on the other. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Damascus; Sara Sidner reported from Jerusalem; and Hada Messia reported from Rome. CNN's Schams Elwazer, Tim Lister, Holly Yan, Samira Said, Jill Dougherty, Hamdi Alkhshali and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian prime minister: Israeli ""aggressions ... have left no room for hesitation""

"(CNN) -- A former drug dealer was executed in Texas on Wednesday night for the murders of two reputed gang members -- 15 years to the day after the crime. Texas death row inmate Frank Moore says he acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two in 1994. Frank Moore, 49, was pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. ET, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said. ""Self-defense is not capital murder,"" Moore said before the lethal injection began, echoing his unsuccessful claims to the courts to prevent his execution. Moore did not deny firing the fatal shots outside a San Antonio bar but insisted he acted in self-defense and did not deserve to die. Moore was the second death row inmate to be executed in 2009. He spoke at length with CourtTVnews.com in 2007. Samuel Boyd and Patrick Clark were shot multiple times in the head and chest early in the morning of January 21, 1994, outside the Wheels of Joy bar. ""They came with intentions to kill me,"" Moore said in the interview. ""It was a do-or-die situation."" But no witnesses ever came forward at trial to corroborate Moore's self-defense claims. Prosecutors contended that Moore, a long-time gang member with a lengthy rap sheet dating back to his teens, shot the two in cold blood to assert his authority after a shoving match broke out in the bar, according to court records. A Bexar County jury convicted Moore and sentenced him to death, but his conviction was reversed in 1998 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found error in the trial court's refusal to give the jury the option of convicting Moore of a lesser offense. Even so, Moore was convicted and sentenced to death at his second trial in 1999. Moore insisted he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on Boyd, 23, and Clark, 15, at a bar near the housing projects where Moore admitted he sold crack cocaine and weapons. But it was not until 2006 that a private investigator, who once worked against Moore and his fellow gangsters, came forward with information that Moore said corroborated his self-defense claims. Warren Huel, a retired Navy Seal who was in charge of the private security firm that oversaw the projects, was the first peace officer on the scene, arriving about 45 minutes before the San Antonio Police Department, according to an affidavit. During that time, Huel said he spoke with witnesses who reported that Boyd and Clark shot at Moore first from inside the car after trying to run him over, according to the affidavit. Witnesses also told Huel that they had seen the victims' relatives remove their weapons from the car before police arrived, Huel stated in the affidavit. When Huel attempted to share the information with San Antonio Police, he says the officers told him to forget everything he had seen and learned, he said in an affidavit. ""I was told that did not matter, as they already had Frank Moore, the murder weapon and an eyewitness,"" Huel stated in his affidavit. ""I was told Moore was a dope dealer and had to go to jail."" Since then, three others have come forward claiming they witnessed the shootings, providing similar details, said Moore's lawyer, David Sergi. ""Unfortunately, people from the street didn't come forward to testify at the time of the trial,"" he said. ""The problem is, the law doesn't allow for a change of circumstances."" The Texas State Attorney's Office argued that Moore's claims should be dismissed because the evidence had always been available, and was not the ""newly discovered"" evidence the law requires. A lower court sided with the state, prompting Moore to appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. On Monday, the court declined to hear his claims, making the U.S. Supreme Court Moore's last chance for a reprieve. The justices remained silent on the matter.","Frank Moore pronounced dead at 7:21 p.m. ET in Huntsville, Texas .

"(CNN) -- Nine people were shot in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn early Sunday morning at a house party, police said. Four men and five women -- all younger than 45 -- sustained injuries and were transported to four hospitals. Seven patients were released; two remain in the hospital and are in stable condition. The injuries were not life-threatening, according to New York police officer Sophia Tassy-Mason. Police said the shooting at East 52nd Street began around 1 a.m. A neighbor, who lives nearby, told CNN affiliate WCBS that she heard a series of gunshots. The neighborhood is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, Tassy-Mason said. According to NYPD statistics, there have been 21 shooting incidents reported in the area this year. The number of shooters involved is still unknown, and police are searching for one or more suspects, Tassy-Mason said.","NEW: Nine sent to hospitals with injuries; two remain in hospital in stable condition .

"(CNN) -- Fleeing U.S. law enforcement and stuck in a Moscow airport, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden seems stuck about where to go from here. CNN Travel advises which countries should be on his list ... 1. Iceland . Iceland makes for an excellent fugitive destination, particularly for someone with a wintry name such as Snowden. It professes a love for Internet freedoms and once checkmated extradition efforts by offering citizenship to tax-evading U.S. chessman Bobby Fischer. For Snowden it might feel chilly after Hawaii, Hong Kong and midsummer Moscow, but he could easily warm up with a dip in the geothermal waters of the Blue Lagoon in Grindavik. Why stay: Ash-spewing volcanoes could help to shroud actual whereabouts. Why leave: New laws to aid whistleblowers aren't yet in place. Also, they eat puffins. 2. Ecuador . It's a two-way deal: exiles get a subtropical shelter while Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa gets to burnish anti-American credentials and gain a distraction from his clampdowns on press freedom. Why stay: Plenty of Inca ruins and colonial Spanish buildings to admire. Why leave: Ecuador still has an extradition deal with the United States. Opinion: Why Ecuador might shelter Snowden . 3. The UK . It might be heavily in diplomatic hock to Washington, but the UK remains a popular place of refuge -- particularly among Russian exiles drawn by its liberal outlook, robust legal system and miserable weather. Despite security cameras on every corner, plenty of people have managed to lose themselves in London. And if all else fails, it has an Ecuadorian embassy, although since Julian Assange has already snagged the spare room, you'll be on the sofa. Why stay: Strong tradition of political radicalism . Why leave: Did we mention the awful weather? 4. The Philippines . The Filipino police have a strong track record of helping foreign agents hunt down their quarry, but with more than 7,000 islands to choose from, it could take them some time. Why stay: Boracay's beaches, Banaue's scenic rice terraces and -- as it happens -- more colonial Spanish architecture! Why go: Corruption. Even if you're not on the lam, you'll still be bilked for backhanders. 5. Spain . Southern Spain's enduring popularity among expat UK villains has earned its coastline the unfortunate soubriquet of ""Costa del Crime."" A spate of arrests has tarnished its appeal, though. Why stay: The sunshine, the paella, the sangria. Why leave: British pubs selling greasy breakfasts to greasier Brits. Abject lack of Spanish colonial architecture. 6. France . The French have a rep for being rude to foreigners -- unless they're fleeing justice. The country has ignored extradition deals in the past, refusing to give up U.S.-wanted hijackers in the 1960s and '70s. If you've done something political -- or you're Roman Polanski -- you're probably safe. Why stay: France has it all: culture, countryside and cheese. Why leave: France also has the French. 7. Cuba . Embargoes didn't stop Jay-Z from heading to Havana, but you probably won't have to worry about facing the other kind of rap as Cuba lacks an extradition treaty with the U.S. Why stay: Salsa, cigars and those great old cars held together with washing machine spares. Why go: Worrying proximity to Guantanamo. Cuba isn't always fun for skyjackers . 8. North Korea . Clearly this would be madness. But at least in North Korea fugitives are almost guaranteed to be beyond the reach of international justice. U.S. soldier Charles Jenkins demonstrated this principle between 1965 and 2004 after deserting to the north during the Korean War, and living -- albeit rather wretchedly -- to tell the tale. Why stay: Don't stay. Why leave: It won't be your emails that are monitored, just your every waking thought. 9. Transit . Snowden appears to have spent several days air-side at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, a location that Kremlin authorities insist doesn't fall within Russian borders. Perhaps he could stay there, following the footsteps of Iranian exile Mehran Karimi Nasseri, whose eight years stranded at Charles de Gaulle Airport inspired the movie ""The Terminal."" Why stay: Limitless supplies of Dan Brown books and giant Toblerones. Why go: Audacious flight from justice could be rendered into another lame Tom Hanks comedy. 10. United States . Why not hide in plain sight? It's a big, frequently beautiful country and there are parts of the country where people don't even know who their president is, let alone who's on his most wanted list. Why stay: Land of the free. Why go: Pressure to have plastic surgery. Even if you're not changing your identity. Editor's note: Barry Neild may not be a diplomatic expert but he has a long history of jetsetting from one sunny place of refuge to another.","NSA whistleblower could try Ecuador, but Iceland and North Korea also beckon .
For some reason, Spanish colonial architecture features heavily in places of refuge .
As a last resort, somewhere deep -- very deep -- in the U.S. could do ."
"San Francisco (CNN) -- Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was flying far slower than recommended as it approached San Francisco International Airport just before its crash landing on Saturday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday. The Boeing 777 was traveling at approximately 106 knots (122 mph) upon impact and at about 118 knots (136 mph) 16 seconds before impact at an altitude of about 200 feet; the recommended speed upon approach to the runway threshold is 137 knots (157 mph), Deborah Hersman told reporters. The onboard systems warned the crew the plane was about to stall four seconds before the crash, she said. That warning comes in the form of a ""stick-shaker,"" said Arthur Rosenberg, a pilot, engineer and partner with the New York-based law firm Soberman & Rosenberg, which specializes in litigation stemming from plane crashes. ""It's basically saying, 'Hey idiot, wake up and do something ... Now!"" That something typically is to lower the nose of the plane and apply power, he said. The plane was already close to the ground and couldn't be lowered much further. But the crew apparently boosted the power to the engines, which were increasing from 50% capacity three seconds before impact, according to Hersman. One-and-a-half seconds before impact, the crew called for a ""go-around,"" meaning that they wanted to abort the landing and go around in the air to try to make another landing, she said. But they didn't make it. ""There just wasn't enough room to recover,"" Rosenberg said. Investigators have found a path of wreckage that started at the seawall and continued to the main wreckage site hundreds of feet up the runway, Hersman added. The pavement itself was scarred from contact with the landing gear, the engines and the fuselage, Hersman said. The tail's lower portion was in the rocks at the seawall and ""a significant piece of the tail"" was in the water, she said. Additional aircraft parts were visible at low tide. On the path that leads along the pavement away from the seawall were horizontal stabilizers, a vertical stabilizer and an upper portion of the tail cone, she said. The air-traffic control team found no evidence on voice communications of any distress calls before the accident, she said. But investigators have found that the pilots had the appropriate charts for the airport and approach in place in the cockpit, she added. The NTSB was working to find out what the four pilots had done during the 72 hours before the crash in an attempt to determine whether fatigue or sickness may have played a role, she said. A preliminary review of FAA radar data indicates that there was ""no abnormally steep descent curve that's been detected"" in the landing approach of the jet, she said, reacting to media reports citing a steeper descent. And a preliminary review of the engines indicates that both engines were producing power when the plane crashed, she said. Investigators were focusing on the crew and aircraft as they try to learn why the giant jet clipped the end of runway before crashing, she had said earlier in the day. ""We're certainly looking at the crew and how they operated, how they were trained, at their experience,"" Hersman told CNN's New Day. ""We're also looking at the aircraft. We're looking to see if the crew was using automation or was flying on autopilot, or they were hand-flying the airplane,"" she said. Boeing 777s can land automatically, but it was unclear if the plane's computer was handling Saturday's attempted landing or if it was being done by the pilot, who Asiana said was making his first San Francisco landing at the controls of that model of aircraft. The flight, with 307 people on board, originated in Shanghai, China, and stopped in Seoul, South Korea. It was preparing to land Saturday in San Francisco when the rear of the plane struck the edge of the runway, severing the tail. Most passengers were able to escape before the plane erupted in smoke and flames. The fatalities, teenagers Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, were among 35 Chinese students headed to California to attend West Valley Christian School's summer church camp, the school said on its website. Both of the girls had been seated in the rear of the plane, which suffered significant structural damage, Hersman said. Investigators said they were looking into reports that one of the girls may have been run over by an emergency vehicle. ""We are still looking at this issue,"" she said. ""The coroner has not yet determined the cause of death and so we want to make sure we have all the facts before we reach any conclusions."" Chinese netizens mourn Asiana crash victims . Pilot's flight record . Lee Kang-kuk, the pilot who was in the captain's seat of Flight 214, had flown from Seoul to San Francisco several times between 1999 and 2004, the airline said. But Saturday marked his first time landing a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport and was the ninth time he had flown the model, with 43 hours at the controls, the airline said. He has about 10,000 hours as a pilot, Asiana said. Hersman, who has discouraged speculation about whether the crew bore responsibility for the crash, downplayed the significance of the pilot's experience in her New Day interview. ""It's not unusual for crew to change aircraft types,"" she said. And with air crews flying all around the world, it's not unusual for pilots to fly into unfamiliar airports for the first time either. She said it's important for the two pilots in charge of the aircraft during the ""very risky"" landing phase to work closely together, and while she said investigators have no evidence of cockpit communications problems, it's something investigators will be looking at. Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said video and other data related to the crash suggest the crew ""lost situational awareness"" while approaching the airport. 'Oh, Lord have mercy': Witness captures fatal jet crash . ""They're low and slow, and that's a problem,"" Schiavo said. All four pilots have been interviewed by NTSB and South Korean investigators, said Choi Jeong-ho, the head of South Korea's Aviation Policy Bureau. ""We cannot reveal what's been said as it is an ongoing investigation,"" Choi said. The pilots represented two teams -- a crew and a relief crew, said Hersman. ""I think it really is too early to conclude pilot error, because there is so much that we don't know,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The cockpit voice recorder -- which has been flown to Washington for analysis -- contains conversations between the pilots that were carried out in a combination of English and Korean, she said. Hersman said that in most airplane crashes, investigators rarely find a single explanation for what went wrong. ""In most of our investigations, we find that it's not just one thing, it really is a combination of factors that lead to an accident,"" she said. While weather has been ruled out as a factor, other factors officials are investigating include whether construction at the airport may have played a role, Hersman said Sunday. Work to extend a runway safety area required the temporary shutdown of a system designed to help pilots land planes safely, she said. What we know and don't know . Clues from voice recorder . The pilots apparently tried to speed up seven seconds before the crash, cockpit voice and flight data recorders showed. A stall warning sounded three seconds later, telling the pilots the plane was about to lose its ability to stay in the air. Then -- just 1.5 seconds before the plane slammed into the runway -- the crew decided to call off the landing and try to pull up for another try, Hersman said. It was too late. Moments before crash, passengers knew they were too low . The frightening crash . With no warning from the cockpit, survivors said, the plane's rear struck the sea wall at the end of the runway. The impact severed the plane's tail and sent the rest of the body spinning on its belly. Amateur video obtained exclusively by CNN shows the plane crashing and spinning counterclockwise and coming to a stop. In addition to the two deaths, 182 people were hospitalized with injuries ranging from severe scrapes to paralysis. ""We're lucky there hasn't been a greater loss of life,"" San Francisco Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. Some injured passengers remained hospitalized Monday, including six in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital, said Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of surgery. About half of those admitted to the hospital had spinal fractures, she said. Others have head trauma. ""Their recovery could be months and months and maybe not even to full recovery,"" she said. Many of the injured said they were sitting toward the rear of the aircraft, Knudson said. But 123 of the 307 people on board walked away uninjured. Benjamin Levy was among them. ""Honestly, I was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down, in which case I think a lot of people would have not made it,"" Levy said. ""If we flipped, none of us would be here to talk about it,"" he said. CNN's Michael Pearson and Tom Watkins reported and wrote from Atlanta; Mike Ahlers reported from San Francisco; CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey has regained the top spot on Forbes magazine's annual most powerful celebrities list. The TV personality has been a runner-up for the past two years, but on Wednesday it was revealed that Oprah has regained her crown. It is the fifth time the 59-year-old star has topped the prestigious list of 100 celebrities, beating out stiff competition from the likes of chart superstars Lady Gaga, BeyoncÃ© and Madonna. Jennifer Lopez - who was No. 1 last year - dropped to 12th place in this year's rankings. Oprah made an estimated $77 million between June 2012 and June 2013, down from last year's $165 million. However, despite not being the highest earner on Forbes magazine's list, ""her money, mixed with strong fame scores in metrics like press mentions and social networking power, pushed her to the top,"" said Forbes writer Dorothy Pomerantz. ""She still wields an enormous amount of power, which is really what we look for in our fame matrix. She is taking this cable network and turning it around just through the sheer force of her will, her connections and her ability,"" Pomerantz continued. Lady Gaga ranked second on the list, despite having to cut her tour short because of a hip injury. The eccentric star's social media success and press influence pushed her up the list, aside from her $80 million earnings. Esteemed Hollywood director Steven Spielberg came in third, while BeyoncÃ© and Madonna claimed the fourth and fifth spots, respectively. Taylor Swift came in sixth place, Bon Jovi was named in seventh position, while Roger Federer and Justin Bieber came in eighth and ninth places. Ellen DeGeneres was also named in the top ten, coming in just behind Bieber. The Celebrity 100 is based on income over a 12-month period and fame. This element is defined by media influence and social media power, including Twitter and Instagram. Oprah is one of three celebrities who have been featured on the list every year since 1999. Howard Stern and Steven Spielberg also hold this honor. See the original story at CoverMG.com.","Oprah Winfrey is back at No. 1 on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful celebrities .

"(CNN) -- A southern California man killed by a grizzly bear in Alaska's backcountry was shooting photos of the animal that killed him just moments before the attack, a National Park Service official said Sunday. The bear that killed Richard White, 49, was still with his body when rangers found him in Denali National Park on Saturday, the official said. The San Diego resident had been backpacking alone for three nights when he was mauled to death by the bear, according to a park service statement. Grizzly bear kills backpacker in Alaska's Denali National Park . Photographs found in his camera revealed that White was watching the bear for at least eight minutes near a river before the attack. ""The bear was generally unaware that he was there until the last couple of shots, then his attention turned,"" park spokeswoman Maureen McLaughlin said. The photographs ""are not that demonstrative"" and show ""nothing graphic, or any showing major signs of aggression,"" McLaughlin said. ""We're not sure what happened after the camera was put down."" State troopers, park rangers and wildlife biologists, using the photos to identify the ""large male bear,"" shot and killed the animal as it was still ""defending the kill site along the Toklat River as the recovery team attempted to reach White's remains,"" the park service said. A necropsy of the bear Saturday night confirmed it was the animal that killed White, the statement said. The first sign of trouble came Friday afternoon, when three hikers noticed an abandoned backpack and signs of a struggle -- including torn clothing and blood -- along the river, the park service said. The hikers went back to a rest area, about three miles to the south, and alerted authorities around 5:30 p.m. Friday. About two and a half hours later, park rangers conducting an aerial search spotted at least one grizzly bear and, after touching down, the unidentified victim's remains. The bear intially ran away, but returned to the site a short time later while the rangers were investigating the scene, forcing the rangers to retreat, the park service said. After the bear began to circle around them and as darkness was setting in, the rangers decided to wait until Saturday to remove the body. The area of the Denali backcountry where the attack occurred has been closed -- prohibiting all hiking and camping in that area -- ""until further notice,"" the park service said. About 12 grizzly bears have been living this summer around where Friday's attack occurred, the park said, citing wildlife biologists. Grizzly bear attacks are not common, though they are not unprecedented. Last September, a grizzly attacked and killed a hunter in northwestern Montana within sight of another hunter. Earlier that year, grizzly bears killed two men in Yellowstone National Park, according to the park's superintendent. This attack is the ""first known bear mauling fatality"" recorded in Denali National Park and Preserve, according to the park service.","Richard White, 49, of San Diego, California, was hiking alone when the bear killed him .

"(CNN) -- Ryan ""Mac"" McDonald's friends and family describe him as a teddy bear: charismatic, gentle and unassuming. The description is fitting -- the former Texas all-state offensive lineman weighed as much as a small bear in 2000 when his friends bought him a gym membership for his 25th birthday. Not wanting to appear ungrateful, Mac went to the gym and a personal trainer promptly put him on a treadmill. Mac, now 38, got to work, putting one foot in front of the other. But it wasn't long before he looked down and saw smoke emerging from underneath the treadmill's track. The trainer rushed in, quickly explaining that the treadmill was old, on its last leg and he would set Mac up on a better one. Mac obediently followed the trainer to another treadmill. The track moved and Mac walked. Before another 10 minutes passed smoke again rose from underneath the belt. ""After that I knew enough to stay off the treadmills,"" he says. ""That was another one of my excuses."" Mac would balloon to more than 500 pounds and be attacked by a life-threatening, flesh-eating bacteria before re-entering a gym with any serious intention to improve his health. But when he did, the stay-at-home dad would lose 300 pounds in less than three years. 'He never stopped putting in the calories' At 6 feet tall, Mac was always a big guy, says his best friend, Tim Scrivner, owner of Fieldhouse Fitness Center and Jailbreak, a Texas-based adventure race-event company. The men met when they were sophomores in high school at Liberty Christian School. ""I played tailback and he was an offensive tackle, which made me automatically like him,"" says Scrivner. Mac weighed between 260 and 275 pounds when he played football and made all-state his junior and senior year. He played one year in junior college and then quit. ""(Football) wasn't life for him,"" says Scrivner. ""His personality was being a big, nice guy that everybody loves."" Mac moved to the family farm near Wichita Falls, Texas, where people began noticing his rapid weight gain. His younger brother Clint remembers visiting and seeing a mini-fridge in the living room next to Mac's chair. ""I think he never stopped putting in the calories, even though he was no longer expending them,"" he says. Mac was up to 350 pounds and taking classes at Midwestern State University in 1996 when he met his future wife, Jessica McDonald. ""He was the cool guy that had the cool apartment that everybody hung out at,"" she says. A year later, Mac asked Jessica on a date. She accepted with reservations. ""I remember telling a friend, 'I don't want anything serious because I've got goals to accomplish, and he is not very healthy,'"" she says. But Mac won her over with his chivalry and charm. Jessica remembers that they were only supposed to go miniature golfing on their first date but ended up going to dinner and a movie, too. ""I remember thinking, 'Oh, mercy. I'm in deep,'"" she says. Mac's relationship with Jessica did not change his eating habits. Fast food continued to contribute to his weight gain. He'd devour bacon double cheeseburgers from Whataburger, gobble chicken McNuggets from McDonald's and wolf down bean burritos from Taco Bell. When these off-the-chart sodium servings made him thirsty, he'd wash them down with ""the nectar of the Gods,"" Dr Pepper. Nothing could keep him from frequenting these eateries, even hitting the big 5-0-0 on the scale. ""That's the thing about drive-through windows,"" he says. ""You can hide when you order five things, and they ask you if you'd like two drinks with it."" Jessica remembers going on vacation to the Biltmore Estate near Asheville, North Carolina, where she toured the mansion's sprawling gardens by herself because Mac was too embarrassed to walk around. ""I wanted to be so protective of him because people would just stare,"" she says. ""He saw the world from the seat in the car."" In November 2009, Mac saw the world from a hospital bed when necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating skin bacteria, assaulted the left side of his body. The infection was dangerously close to his heart, forcing doctors to remove softball-size chunks of infected tissue. Mac tried to laugh off what was happening but the situation scared him. He didn't want to die. The low-hanging fruit method . A year later, Mac hit 530 pounds and realized he had to try to lose weight. ""There is not an 'aha' moment,"" he says. ""It was more like, 'OK, if I'm going to try to do this, I'm going to have to do it a little bit at a time. But I better do something before I lose my family to my untimely demise.'"" Mac started ""dabbling"" at Scrivner's gym. Next he gave up fast food and all-you-can-eat buffets. Then stopped ordering soft drinks. Finally, he started buying healthy food from the grocery store. Mac describes his strategy as the ""low-hanging fruit"" method. It allowed him to lose weight without having gastric bypass surgery, hiring a nutritionist or discovering a dieting secret folks in Hollywood would give their big toe to know about. ""It was simple, but it wasn't easy,"" says Mac. ""I knew that I had to make a change because I was sick and tired of not being able to do anything I wanted to do."" Rachel Berman, a registered dietician and director of nutrition for Caloriecount.com, says setting small, attainable goals like the ones Mac made is a better approach to weight loss than using an ""all-or-nothing mentality"" because people appreciate the progress that comes from each change. ""If you do too much at once, it can be overwhelming and that makes you less likely to maintain it,"" she says. Scrivner says he avoided Mac when he first started showing up at the gym, asking members to not say anything to his friend. ""We've hounded him so much over the years,"" he says. ""We were all just kind of holding our breath and hoping he would stick with it."" After Mac lost about 50 pounds, Scrivner approached him about entering an upcoming Jailbreak race. Together they made a video inviting people to sign up to run the approximately 3-mile obstacle course, promising Mac was going to keep exercising and enter the event, too. True to his word, Mac competed in the Jailbreak race at 350 pounds. ""I just knew I wanted to complete it,"" says Mac. ""I remember crossing the finish line and being ecstatic."" He has since entered and completed 5K and 10K runs, a half-marathon, a duathlon and a sprint triathlon. He will enter the Hotter 'N Hell Hundred-mile bicycle race this August. At 230 pounds, Mac is now light enough to ride a motorcycle, an activity his weight kept him from for years. In November he will fulfill a lifelong dream by racing a motorcycle in the Baja 1000 in Baja California, Mexico. ""I had people in my life that I could go to and ask questions and I could use their knowledge,"" he says. ""I did not do this alone."" Mac still does weekly weigh-ins and says the battle to maintain his weight will last the rest of his life. He spends his free time with Jessica and their two children, Matthew, 3 and Libby, 5. The McDonalds will celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary in December. ""I think we're stronger now than we've ever been,"" says Jessica, who is writing a Ph.D. dissertation about obesity's impact on the learning process. ""He's my biggest cheerleader."" Mac also takes time to share his story with others struggling with obesity. He has a blog and occasionally speaks to kids at the YMCA of Metropolitan Fort Worth, encouraging them to begin healthy nutritional habits early. He recently took two 500-pound men grocery shopping, invited them to his house to show them the types of foods he now eats and gave them some of his old regular and workout clothes. Scrivner says he believes Mac's story is better than a personal trainer for those trying to lose weight, because he has walked in their shoes. ""He's about the most inspirational person I know.""

"(CNN) -- A large Southern California nuclear plant is out of commission indefinitely, and will remain so until there is an understanding of what caused problems at two of its generators and an effective plan to address the issues, the nation's top nuclear regulator said Friday. Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, refused to give a timetable as to when the San Onofre nuclear plant could resume operation. He said only that his agency had ""set some firm conditions"" as to when that could happen. ""We won't make a decision (to approve the facility's restart) unless we're satisfied that public health and safety will be protected,"" Jaczko told reporters. ""They have to demonstrate to us that they understand the causes, and ... that they have a plan to address them."" The power plant has been shut down since this winter, when a small amount of radioactive gas escaped from a steam generator during a water leak. At the time, federal regulators said there was no threat to public health, though they could not identify how much gas leaked or exactly why it had happened. The water leak occurred in thousands of tubes that carry heated water from the reactor core through the plant's steam generators. Leaks occur periodically in older units, but plant owner Southern California Edison replaced the four steam generators at San Onofre in 2010 and 2011 as part of a $680 million project. They are in units 2 and 3 of the nuclear facility; unit 1 went out of service in 1992. Each of the 65-foot-tall, 640-ton generators -- built by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries -- are packed with thousands of narrow tubes that carry hot, pressurized water from the reactors. The heat produces steam in a separate loop that drives the plant's turbines and generators. ""Tubes are vibrating and rubbing against adjacent tubes and against support structures inside the steam generators,"" the agency noted. Eight of the more than 9,700 tubes in one of the unit 3 generators failed a pressure test, while six tubes in unit 2's reactor needed to be plugged, the NRC has found. Another 186 tubes in unit 2, which was shut down for refueling at the time of the leak, were plugged ""as a precautionary measure."" In addition to driving the turbines to create electricity, the steam generators are ""one of the barriers between the radioactive material in the reactor core and ultimately the external environment,"" Jaczko noted. Located near San Clemente, the San Onofre nuclear plant's twin reactors are ""Southern California's largest and most reliable sources of electricity,"" according to Southern California Edison's website. When operational, the facility -- which is owned by that utility, San Diego Gas and Electric and the city of Riverside -- supplies power for 1.4 million households at any given time. Anti-nuclear activists gathered Friday, not far from where Jaczko, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, toured the power plant, to question the need for nuclear energy and raise alarms about a potential environmental catastrophe. Gary Headrick, founder of the group San Clemente Green, said that such public pressure was needed in order to guard against a nuclear crisis along the lines of what happened last year at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant. ""If we were to let things go as they've gone in the past, it's very likely that we'd experience a Fukushima right here in Southern California,"" Headrick said at the rally. ""And that's why we're here today."" CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Anti-nuclear activists warn of a potential environmental catastrophe .

"(CNN) -- Late actor James Gandolfini's will left large amounts of money to family and friends, with much of it going to his teenage son, Michael, according to a copy of his will made public Wednesday. Gandolfini, who found fame in the hit HBO series ""The Sopranos,"" died of a heart attack last month in Rome at age 51. Besides receiving all of his father's clothing and jewelry, 14-year-old Michael is the beneficiary of a $7 million life insurance policy owned by a trust set up in his name. The trust also has the option to purchase Gandolfini's Greenwich Village condominium in New York. Michael lives with his mother, Gandolfini's first wife, in California. Gandolfini's widow, Deborah Lin, receives all of Gandolfini's tangible property, aside from the clothing and jewelry. The will says Gandolfini made other provisions for Lin not listed in the will. Both Michael and his half-sister, 8-month-old Liliana Ruth, receive a 50% stake in property Gandolfini owns in Italy. It's being held by a trust and will be available when Liliana turns 25. ""It is my hope and desire that they will continue to own said property and keep it in our family for as long as possible,"" Gandolfini states in the will. ""The Sopranos"" star left $500,000 to each of his nieces, Laura and Jenna Antonacci, and $200,000 each to his assistant, Trixie Flynn Bourne, and friend Thomas Richardson. His godson Robert Parish receives $100,000, and friends Fatima Bae and Doug Katz each receive $50,000.

"(CNN) -- The great promise of social networking has been the ability to stay in touch with friends, family and, let's face it, mere acquaintances without regard to traditional hurdles like geography. But in the process of bringing everyone, from long-lost friends to grade-school acquaintances, just a status update away, the rise of Facebook, Twitter and the like may have left someone out: the folks next door. ""We did not see a social network that could connect us to what we believe is one of the most important communities of all, the neighborhood,"" said Nirav Tolia, CEO of Nextdoor.com. ""We realized that neighborhoods really were the original social network."" Nextdoor is part of a growing trend of online sites and tools geared toward filling a gap left in part by commuter culture, frequent moves and dual-income homes. ""Technology has done a great job putting us in touch with the people we don't live close to,"" said Tolia, who co-founded customer review site ePinions.com in 1999. ""It has not done as great a job, in the past, of helping us connect with the people right outside our door."" The site requires users to either verify their address (sign-in codes on postcards are one way) or be vouched for by an existing member to join pages that were, in turn, created by someone who lives close by. Once created, Nextdoor pages focus on everything from babysitter searches and requests to borrow lawn tools to discussions about crime in the area or suggestions on which local businesses to patronize. It's the kind of chatter one would traditionally expect to take place over coffee, across the back fence or at the local barber shop. But statistics suggest those conversations are becoming few and far between. In a Pew Research Center poll from last year, 19% of respondents said they knew the names of all their neighbors, while 28% said they didn't know any of them. Worth noting is that the poll found daily Internet users were actually more likely than nonusers to know their neighbors and equally as likely as people who go online less frequently. (That's been a consistent finding in Pew's Internet studies, flying in the face of the assumption that online social networking detracts from real-world interaction and users should ""just go outside"" and socialize). ""You certainly could just go outside,"" Tolia said. ""Unfortunately, almost a third of people, if they were to go outside, they wouldn't know their neighbor. If they can use tools like Nextdoor, they're much more likely to actually interact."" Nextdoor isn't alone in trying, at least in part, to address that. There are sites like EveryBlock, which lets users punch in their ZIP code to get local news updates, and Topix, basically a home for glorified message boards focusing on individual communities. There's also Patch, AOL's network of more than 500 hyper-local news sites. ""Growing up, I saw my mom who knew ever single neighbor in every single house and I knew every single person on the street,"" said Daniel Dietrich, co-founder of HeyNeighbor.com, another localized network focused on ""micro-favors"" among folks who live near each other and a sort of uber-local Craigslist to buy and sell. ""I don't think it's that we don't want the neighborhood relationships we used to have ... . It's a lot of factors that have put us in this space today. (B)ut there's a longing for community. There's a longing for local."" With Internet usage increasingly common among all age groups, Dietrich said sites like his can act as a virtual ice-breaker. ""It's awkward to walk up to someone's door and say 'hi,' "" he said. ""I'm a relatively social guy, but it's just not comfortable to walk up to a door and say, 'Hi, I'm your new neighbor.' You don't know what the circumstances are behind that door, so you just don't do it."" HeyNeighbor launched in late summer. It is not publicly announcing user numbers. Tolia's site was launched October 26 after a year-and-a-half of testing, during which 176 neighborhoods went online. Less than two months later, the site has 620 neighborhoods in 40 states and the District of Columbia. Another 450 neighborhoods are in what the site calls ""pilot stage."" ""We've been absolutely blown away by the response,"" Tolia said. ""We've had literally tens of thousands of people come to the website and either want to create Nextdoor for their neighborhood or join a Nextdoor neighborhood."" Whoever sets up a neighborhood page on the site submits what they consider the boundaries of that neighborhood. As membership grows, the boundaries can be narrowed or expanded. Both are free to use and eventually hope to sell targeted advertising to local businesses. Meanwhile, they'll keep trying to help introduce people who may be more likely to find your lost dog or loan you a cup of sugar than ""like"" your status update or ""favorite"" your tweet. ""We're not necessarily trying to make everyone who passes each other on the street hug each other,"" Dietrich said. ""But there's a value to having a relationship with the people who live next to you.""","As social sites expand, a new wave aims to help get to know real-world neighbors .

"(CNN) -- They met at a country bar in Utah. She was riding a mechanical bull, and he couldn't help jumping on the saddle with her. The relationship started there, and the couple took it to new heights on their wedding day by tossing the bride's bouquet and garter from a ""human slingshot."" Jacob and Natasha Johnson wanted to replicate the experience of a mechanical bull at their July 13 wedding. But their parents worried it was too ""redneck."" Luckily, they decided to hold their wedding at Hobble Creek Lodge in Springville, home of ""Utah's human slingshot."" At first they thought it was a joke, but a bit of research showed that others had used it before. They decided to go for it. A YouTube video posted by wedding guest Colton Spencer shows the bride, still in a fluffy gown, strapped to a red rubber slingshot, her feet attached to an ATV with a stretchy cord. The groom drives the four-wheeler down the lawn and releases the cord to fling his bride through the air. Natasha says she was terrified but not necessarily for her safety. ""I was afraid of ripping my dress,"" she said. She wore shorts to ensure she wouldn't flash guests when launched in the air. They practiced the night before, but it still took two tries to successfully launch her because she was ""20 pounds heavier"" while wearing the gown. Reception guests were alerted before the launch began and gathered around. With Beyonce's ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" playing in the background, Natasha sailed through the air and threw her bouquet back to a crowd of eager women. ""All of the ladies were waiting and my girlfriend and niece argued when my niece caught the bouquet,"" she laughed. Then, it was Jacob's turn. He was nervous about being strapped to the slingshot for other reasons: ""I turned around and saw Tasha's dad driving the ATV."" The couple says the video has garnered international attention with people expressing shock and delight over the different take on a wedding tradition. Guests will always remember the slingshot, Natasha says, but it wasn't the only exciting moment of the fun-filled night. ""The groomsmen decided to go skinny dipping in the pond,"" Natasha said. ""Jacob didn't want to tell that."" The couple is enjoying married life and says life is back to normal, with a few extra interview requests. ""We're just having fun with it,"" Jacob says.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador to Egypt and closed its embassy in Cairo and its consulates in Alexandria and Suez Saturday, following protests in the Egyptian capital over a human rights lawyer imprisoned in the Arab kingdom. The decision to pull out Saudi diplomats came after protester ""attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its (embassy) employees,"" according to the Saudi Press Agency. Throngs of Egyptians had gathered in front of the Saudi Embassy this week, calling for the release of Egyptian lawyer Ahmed el-Gezaw -- detained earlier this month for allegedly insulting King Abdullah. Saudi officials say el-Gezawi was arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country. But the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights say el-Gezawi had been traveling on a pilgrimage to Mecca when he was detained. The Cairo-based group credited the activist for demanding better treatment of Saudi-held Egyptian detainees and criticizing the kingdom over alleged human rights abuses. El-Gezawi has since been sentenced to flogging and faces a year behind bars, the group reported. Video of the demonstrations in Cairo was posted online earlier this week and showed sign-wielding crowds chanting slogans in front of the Saudi Embassy. ""Say it, don't be afraid, the Egyptian will be lashed,"" the crowd chanted. ""We will lash the ambassador! Lash us imprison us! Tomorrow the revolution will be in Medina."" In a statement Saturday, the Egyptian government denounced ""these irresponsible acts,"" saying that it regrets ""the individual incidents, which were conducted by some citizens against the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Cairo."" ""The incidents only reflect only the view of those who carried them out and nothing more,"" the statement said. The protests and Saturday's decision by Saudi authorities to remove diplomatic personnel from the country appear to have again ratcheted up longstanding tensions between the two Middle Eastern nations. ""It's a relationship that's been flawed,"" said Steven Cook, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Especially since the uprising, many Egyptians regard Saudis as a counterrevolutionary force in the region."" Relations between the two countries soured in 1979 when the kingdom broke off diplomatic relations with Egypt after it inked a peace deal with Israel following the Camp David Accords. The ties were later restored in November 1987. Egypt, the most populous Arab country, has often engaged in ""a subtle competition"" with their Saudi counterparts ""over this question of regional leadership,"" Cook said. Egypt erupted in protest last year during 18 days of demonstrations in Cairo's Tahrir Square after similar uprisings in neighboring Tunisia, ultimately ousting Egypt's longtime president Hosni Mubarak after nearly three decades in power. ""The Saudis were not enthusiastic about their uprising,"" Cook said of Egypt, pointing to apparent concerns among elites in the oil-rich kingdom over their own grip on power. ""And they were angry at the United States for its role in supporting the movement."" In February 2011, President Barack Obama called for orderly transition in Egypt to a fully representative democracy, saying the transition ""must be meaningful, it must be peaceful and it must begin now."" CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, Caroline Faraj and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: Egypt denounces ""these irresponsible acts,"" referring to the Cairo protests .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian Armed Forces sought Tuesday to portray itself as a stabilizing force fully capable of handling the anger and unrest that have divided the nation less than a week after overthrowing the first democratically elected president. ""Destruction of public property or the stability of the state will not be tolerated,"" the military said in an audio statement broadcast on state television. ""A constitutional declaration has been issued and the road to transition is clear, so people should feel secure."" The announcement came a day after 51 people were killed in clashes between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military over the ouster of former President Mohamed Morsy and as the fledgling new government announced it had filled key roles. Hazem El-Beblawi, a liberal economist who was finance minister and deputy prime minister, will serve as the interim prime minister; Mohamed ElBaradei, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning diplomat, will serve as interim vice president, it said. Cabinet posts also will be offered to the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, as well as to the Salafist al-Nour Party, MENA, Egypt's official news agency, reported. ElBaradei: Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot 'fail' The military's projection of confidence contrasted with the mood that surrounded a demonstration outside the Raba'a Al-Adawiya Mosque in Cairo, where thousands of people packed a square, some of them waving the country's red, white and black flag and others holding aloft pictures of Morsy. The Brotherhood's highest official of religious law said Tuesday he does not recognize the authority of the nation's interim president and will not negotiate until Morsy regains power. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? After that happens, ""we will have a national and comprehensive reconciliation in which all the problems can be discussed over a negotiation table but through a prior constitution,"" Grand Mufti Abdulruhman Albir told the Reuters news agency. He said he recognized neither last week's military coup nor any of the moves by those who have seized power. ""Therefore, there is no need to speak about any decrees, because they were issued by people without authority."" Albir was referring to Interim President Adly Mansour, who had issued a constitutional declaration giving himself limited power to make laws and outlined a timetable for parliamentary and presidential elections, according to state media. Adly Mansour: Interim president, veteran judge, mystery man . There was no official word on the decree from the president's office. If the state media reports are accurate, the 33-article decree would grant Mansour limited legislative powers after consultation with a cabinet, which would wield veto power. The decree also would lay out a timeline for voting on an amended constitution and for holding parliamentary and president ballots. The declaration calls for a constitutional referendum in November, followed by parliamentary elections in December and a presidential poll in February. Without confirmation from the president's office, it is impossible to say whether the reports -- carried by state-run Al-Ahram and MENA -- are accurate. Also on Tuesday, funerals were held for the victims of clashes between the Brotherhood and security forces on Monday -- the deadliest day in Cairo since the revolution that forced then-President Hosni Mubarak from office in 2011. The interim Egyptian government announced Tuesday that it would investigate the violence. The White House has refused to describe as a coup the military's ouster of Morsy, who was reportedly being held under arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters. Doing so would require the United States to suspend its $1.3 billion in annual military aid to Egypt. When is a coup not a coup? It is in the interest of the United States and the Egyptian people ""in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. But he added that U.S. officials were ""cautiously encouraged"" that the interim government's plan ""includes a return to democratically elected government that includes presidential and parliamentary elections."" In response to a question, State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters that, ""broadly speaking,"" the administration still believes that continuing military aid is a U.S. national security priority. But Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, has called for a suspension of military aid to Egypt. Some financial heavyweights in the region have offered financial assistance of their own. Saudi Arabia's finance minister said the kingdom has pledged $5 billion in grants and loans to the interim government, according to the official Saudi news agency SAPA, and the United Arab Emirates will give $1 billion to Egypt and lend it another $2 billion as an interest-free central bank deposit, state news agency WAM reported Tuesday.

"Washington (CNN) -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career. D.C. Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher ruled that the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia should release the transcripts of secret conversations between the lawyers and the judge at the judge's bench in hearings from earlier this year. The case of Levy, whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court because defense attorneys for the man convicted of her murder have called into question the testimony of a key prosecution witness. Ingmar Guandique, 31, was sentenced in 2011 to two concurrent 60-year sentences for murder with kidnapping and murder with attempted robbery in Levy's death. He was in court Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs. In February 2009, police arrested Guandique, who was already in prison for attacking two other women in the park where Levy's body was found and who had reportedly spoken about killing her. New hearings in Chandra Levy case add to mystery . Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy. Guandique repeatedly said at his trial he had nothing to do with Levy's death. Guandique's defense attorney, Jonathan Anderson, on Monday questioned Morales' credibility and said he had given contradictory testimony about Guandique. According to Anderson, Morales had provided information to law enforcement before about three murders. A status hearing on the case has been scheduled for September 26. Levy, a 24-year-old California native, was in Washington working as an intern for the Bureau of Prisons when she was last seen on May 1, 2001. Her skull was found a year later in Washington's Rock Creek Park and she was identified through dental records. Levy's disappearance gained national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Gary Condit, who was then a congressman for Levy's California district. Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he was questioned intensively for details about Levy's whereabouts. Condit denied he and Levy were having an affair, but an FBI forensic expert later confirmed his semen was found in Levy's underwear that was retrieved from her apartment after she went missing. The sealed information is from hearings late last year and earlier this year. They are transcripts of discussions that lawyers and Fisher had at the judge's bench, which observers in the courtroom could not hear. A group of media outlets including the Associated Press, Gannett, McClatchy, The Washington Post and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed court papers seeking to unseal the information. Condit, who served in Congress until 2003, is currently on the board of directors of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable farming.","The documents are transcripts of secret conversations at the judge's bench .

"(CNN) -- As Paula Deen's apology tour continues, it becomes more and more disturbing to watch. With each heartfelt tearful statement, Deen seems completely uninterested in the broader contexts of her comments, missing ample opportunities to address the reality of racism today both in the form of cultural and social interactions, but even more powerfully by policies and actions. I heard her speak very little about the extraordinary injuries and injustices black people face, I have not heard her show alliance with those who fight racism nor show solidarity with or compassion for black people based on the profound impact racism has on their lives. What kind of heartfelt apology intended to prove you are not a racist ignores these gestures? Deen is steadfast in her denials about being a racist. But she seems to explain away her actions or redirect the conversation when asked about the specifics of her comments and their implications. Her reflections, apologies and justifications are striking in their inability to see things from the perspective of those she has offended, and how they might feel in the face of her actions. Plus, she can't seem to connect her actions to broader, endemic conditions in society. This could be a teachable moment to discuss how complex racism is, how good intentions cannot do the work of anti-racism education, and how even people who like black people can behave in ways that do racial harm. Yes, Paula Deen, good people can hold racist ideas even though they might not be aware of them. Instead, it has turned in to a maudlin, self-absorbed reality-TV style drama. Her apology on the ""Today"" show on Wednesday is a case in point. In it, Deen was asked about her use of the N-word. In reply, she emphasized that she had a gun put to her head and that the black man wielding it was someone to whom she had given a loan. Her emphasis asks us to empathize with her. I guess we are to say, ""Oh sure, with a gun to my head I'd resort to racial epithets, too, especially if I gave that N-word some loan money."" She has other options here: ones that might contribute to our broader racial conversation and knowledge about race. She could have said: ""It was a horrible word to use given its powerful centuries long role, especially in the South, as a way to dehumanize black people. And, my identity as a white Southern woman (one whose family were slave holders) only makes it worse. It undermines my belief in racial equality and counters my efforts to support racial justice."" Later in the interview, when ""Today"" anchor Matt Lauer returned to the issue of her use of the N-word, she deflected her use, and instead described how the constant use of the word by the young black staffers in her kitchen hurts HER. What? I am not a fan of black youth using the word so casually, extensively and publicly, but there is a remarkable lack of self-awareness to imagine that their use of the term is equivalent to her use of the word. What does their use have to do with hers? How is it that we are talking about her injury again? Her lack of awareness was evident again in her desire to have a plantation style wedding party, which would feature a black-only wait staff. She thought the black-only wait staff - who, in historical context would likely be performing as slave workers -- would be an entertaining theme. Was she going to have the white guests perform Southern plantation era behavior of ""cultured"" and vicious racial domination, too? Who was supposed to be entertained by this? Perhaps some of the apology tour could be devoted to explaining her vision for this party and why she thought it a good idea. And, ideally, this would be followed by an admission that she should have considered the downside of having black low-wage workers, who as a group face extraordinary levels of job discrimination and other hurdles, play slaves for white partygoers. I suspect she imagines no ill racial intent in this, either. Frankly, she isn't alone in this kind of thinking. Our public understanding about how racism works today is thwarted by the personalized response that focuses on intention, rather than action. ""Good"" people are very often blind to and support disturbing and discriminatory actions, behaviors and ideas. Today, there is widespread normalized racial discrimination. One study shows that white job applicants with a criminal record are nearly twice as likely to get a call back for low-wage work than equally qualified black applicants with a college degree and no criminal record. For this apology tour to do real good, Deen might consider taking an anti-racist position, reaching out to black people and honoring the pain many face as a result of serious racial discrimination, and thinking about how she might have contributed to it. Deen might use her extensive media platform to draw attention to racial injustice today, to show the broader public just how much it saturates American society, even for those who think they are above it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tricia Rose.","Tricia Rose: Paula Deen doesn't seem to see why she offended people .

"(CNN) -- A Dutch couple kidnapped in Yemen last month pleaded for help in a video released on Monday. ""We have been kidnapped here in Yemen and we have a big problem,"" said the woman in 90-second video posted online. The couple went on to say they had spoken to the Dutch ambassador to Yemen about the demands of their kidnappers, and are asking for help. A spokeswoman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, released a statement saying: ""The Foreign minister announced on the Ministry's Facebook page that the government is concerned about the safety of the citizens. The situation is being given the government's full attention. The families of the abductees have been contacted."" The couple was kidnapped on June 15 as they were leaving their home in Hadda zone, one of the most secure locations of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. They had gone missing for a week before the authorities were alerted and the Dutch embassy informed. Source: 3 European hostages released in Yemen . A tribal leader involved in the mediation process told CNN that the health situation of the Dutch couple was stable although they are going through depression. ""The kidnappers are asking for a ransom but have yet to announce how much,"" said the tribal leader who asked to remain anonymous due to sensitivity of the matter. The tribal leader said that the government has indirectly asked a number of tribal leaders to be involved in this case and to help in ensuring their safe release, adding ""our priority is the safety of the Dutch couple."" When contacted by CNN, the Yemeni Interior Ministry would not address who was behind the latest kidnapping. ""It is for the best interest of this case that comments are not given by the ministry. But I would like to assure that we are doing our best,"" a senior official in the minister's office said. The official would not say if the government had information on the whereabouts of the Dutch couple. Interior Ministry records show that some 35 kidnapping attempts have taken place in Yemen this year. Most of the victims have been released, all unharmed. Kidnapped Red Cross workers freed in Yemen . Al Qaeda is believed to have been behind most of the kidnappings, including that of a South African couple in May. A Finnish couple and a Austrian who were kidnapped by tribesmen last December were released five months later following tribal mediation involving Oman. Last week, activists in Yemen launched an online signature campaign this week to exert some pressure on the Yemeni government to ensure that the disappearance of the Dutch couple is treated with care and caution. The Yemeni Journalist Syndicate (YJS) has condemned the kidnapping, saying that local groups are using the practice as a bargaining chip against the government.","The couple was kidnapped on June 15 as they were leaving their home in Sanaa .

"(CNN) -- Police in Canada are looking into the deaths of two young boys who appear to have been strangled by a python. The boys, ages 5 and 7, were found dead Monday morning at an apartment in Campbellton, New Brunswick. They had been sleeping over at a friend's apartment above a reptile store, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Early indications suggest that a snake from the store escaped its enclosure, got into the ventilation system, then the apartment, and strangled the two boys, the statement said. RCMP Sgt. Alain Tremblay described the snake as a python. It was captured, and police have the snake in their possession. Canadian broadcaster CBC reported the python is between 11 and nearly 15 feet long and weighs more than 99 pounds. Autopsies on the boys' bodies will be performed Tuesday. A neighbor, Diane Fournier, has lived on the same street as the pet store for 12 years. She described the deaths as ""shocking."" ""I knew the kids. They were brothers. They played in my yard with my dogs all of the time,"" she said. Fournier sent CNN a photograph her husband took of the store. It showed police cars, cones and yellow tape blocking off the area. The store, Reptile Ocean Inc., offered condolences on its Facebook page before the page shut down. ""deepest symphathies goes out to the family of the children. a terrible accident without a meaning. this page will be shut down temporarily to avoid any further demeaning comments. you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" the post read. ""we all have a heavy heart today. as anyone would. and attacks on the animals owner are unneccesary.""

"(CNN) -- When a call came in about a stranded hiker, Las Vegas Police Officer David Vanbuskirk hopped onto a helicopter with a rescue crew, and rushed to retrieve the man from a rock ledge. At Mount Charleston, a helicopter harness attached to Vanbuskirk lowered him toward the hiker -- dangerous terrain made foot rescue impossible. He retrieved the hiker and attached him to the rescue equipment, and signaled the aircraft to lift them up. As the helicopter did, Vanbuskirk got detached from the device and plunged into the canyon below Monday night, dying on impact, authorities said. The hiker, who was in the Mary Jane Falls area, was hoisted to safety. Additional rescue crews scoured the canyon and found Vanbuskirk's body, officials said. It was unclear what caused the device to detach. ""This officer dedicated his life to saving people and that act ultimately cost him his own life,"" Sheriff Doug Gillespie told CNN affiliate KVVU. Vanbuskirk, 36, was a 13-year veteran of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and worked with the rescue division for six years. His friends had nicknamed him officer Rambo Dave for his love of the outdoors and the martial arts, CNN affiliate KTNV reported. ""David was one of the most sincere people, and I just can't believe it,"" Michael Connolly, a friend, told KTNV. Vanbuskirk, who was married, is the first officer to die in the line of duty since 2009 in the the department, KVVU reported. No information was released about the hiker.

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury has returned a 30-count indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, that alleges he used a weapon of mass destruction. Tsarnaev is charged with killing four people -- three spectators who died in the bombings and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later -- and ""maiming, burning and wounding scores of others,"" U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said. ""I have met several of those that were injured on April 15, as well as members of the deceased's families,"" Ortiz said. ""Their strength is extraordinary, and we will do everything we can to pursue justice, not only on their behalf but on behalf of all of us."" At least 264 people were wounded in the double bombings, which took place near the marathon finish line. The grand jury charged Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with the use of a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and conspiracy, bombing of a place of public use resulting in death and conspiracy, malicious destruction of property resulting in death and conspiracy, use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence causing death, carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury, interference with commerce by threats or violence, and aiding and abetting. The indictment details the planning that allegedly went into the attacks. It says that, on February 6, Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought 48 mortars containing about eight pounds of explosive powder from a fireworks store in Seabrook, New Hampshire. It also says that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, downloaded a copy of Inspire magazine, which included instructions on building IEDs using pressure cookers and explosive powder from fireworks. Three days after the attacks, on April 18, the FBI released photographs of the brothers, identifying them as bombing suspects. Hours later, they drove their Honda Civic to the MIT campus, where they shot and killed officer Sean Collier and attempted to steal his service weapon, the indictment says. They were allegedly armed with five IEDs, a Ruger P95 semiautomatic handgun, ammunition, a machete and a hunting knife. The indictment alleges that late that night, the brothers carjacked a Mercedes in Boston by pointing a gun at a man -- identified in the document as D.M. -- and threatening to kill him. They then allegedly drove the man to an automatic teller machine, where they forced him to withdraw $800. About 12:15 a.m. on April 19, D.M escaped the car and called 911. Soon after, police discovered the Tsarnaevs at an intersection in nearby Watertown, where they tried to apprehend them, but the brothers fired at the police and used four IEDs against them, the 74-page indictment alleges. At about 12:50 a.m., police tackled the elder brother and were trying to handcuff him when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev got back into the Mercedes and drove it at the officers, according to the indictment. He wound up running over his brother, ""seriously injuring him and contributing to his death,"" and causing ""serious bodily injury"" to a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer. The younger Tsarnaev escaped, abandoned the car nearby and hid in a drydocked boat in the backyard of a home in Watertown until he was captured by police, the indictment says. While he was hiding in the boat, he scrawled messages on an inside wall and boat beams that give a hint about his alleged motivation, according to the indictment. The indictment says messages included: ""The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians."" ""I can't stand to see such evil unpunished."" ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed."" And, ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" Read the indictment . Seventeen of the charges authorize a penalty of up to life in prison or the death penalty. The other charges authorize a maximum penalty of life in prison or a fixed term of years. Tsarnaev is scheduled to be arraigned on July 10 in U.S. District Court in Boston. The case will be handled by Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., who was assigned the case at random, the federal court in Boston announced Thursday. O'Toole received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1972 and was nominated to the district court in 1995 by President Bill Clinton. Alleged conspiracy started no later than February . The indictment alleges that the brothers conspired to use improvised explosive devices against people, property and public places from no later than February until Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended. ""The brothers placed IEDs among the crowds of spectators who were cheering the runners towards the Marathon finish line"" and ""detonated the bombs seconds apart, killing three people, maiming and injuring many more, and forcing a premature end to the Marathon."" The IEDs were made from pressure cookers, explosive powder, shrapnel, adhesives and other items, and were designed to shred skin, shatter bone and cause extreme pain and suffering, as well as death, the indictment said.

"(CNN) -- Death has a way of sanitizing the most virulent and despicable aspects of prominent lives, especially those who trafficked in racial bigotry. Roland S. Martin says former Sen. Jesse Helms was an unapologetic conservative but also unabashedly racist. In the last several years, notorious racists such as former Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox and Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina left this Earth, and in efforts to show the humanity of both, tributes poured in, speaking to their Christian faith and unyielding conservative values. Vice President Dick Cheney spoke warmly of Thurmond at his 2003 funeral, citing his run for president in 1948. But Cheney failed to mention that he ran as an ardent segregationist. I recall former Sen. Zell Miller holding up a Bible belonging to Maddox as he told the world about Maddox's wonderful faith, never citing how he used that same Bible to deny African-Americans basic rights. Oh, such good Christian men Maddox and Thurmond were. Now they are joined in the conservative wing of heaven by former Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who died July 4. I'm sure a freedom-loving man such as Helms wouldn't have it any other way: meeting his maker on the same day the United States celebrates its independence. The tributes were endless and laudatory, hailing him for being a ""conservative champion,"" according to a piece in USA Today. Some mentioned his opposition to various issues of race, including the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Even the Rev. Billy Graham, often called ""America's pastor,"" honored Helms in a 174-word statement, ending it by saying that folks ""honor his legendary life and extraordinary legacy."" But to recognize Helms properly in his totality, it's important to add to the list of words and phrases to describe the unapologetic conservative Republican: unabashedly racist. It's easy in this age to say that Helms, who carried his dislike of African- Americans like a badge of honor for 30 years around the U.S. Senate, was a son of the South who was simply honoring good, old-fashioned Southern values. But when you stand in opposition to a bill that would, for the first time, give African-Americans from border to border the constitutionally guaranteed right to cast a vote, then I refuse to call you a stand-up person for the rights of every man, woman and child. And don't try to suggest that because Helms hired several African-Americans in his office that he was still a good and decent guy who was misunderstood. No, he was very clear in how he looked at issues, and if you had the wrong skin color, sorry, but you didn't fully count as an American. As the tributes came in, I wonder if anyone had the audacity to ask former Sen. Carol Moseley Braun what she thought of Helms. Once when she was on the elevator and he saw her, Helms started to sing ""Dixie,"" a call-to-arms song for lovers of the Old South, and clearly an offensive song to anyone black. He later said he did it hoping it would make her cry. The two also didn't see eye to eye on the Confederate flag. She was an ardent opponent; he a devout proponent. It was no surprise that when she was appointed to be a U.S. ambassador by President Clinton, who was her chief blocker? Good ol' Jesse. Look at the effort to integrate the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by Clinton. Helms was steadfast in his effort to block an African-American's appointment to the seat. He and others claimed it was because the court didn't need an additional judge and spending the money was wasteful. But it was evident that Helms didn't want an African-American sitting on what some called the most conservative federal appeals court in the nation. And no one can forget the overt racism he displayed when running for re-election for the U.S. Senate against former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt in 1990 and 1996. Realizing he could lose in 1990, Helms agreed to an ad by Republican strategist Alex Castellanos that showed a white hand destroying a job application with an announcer saying that person needed the job but it was given to a minority. It worked with the bigots in North Carolina. That ad put Helms over the top and kept his Senate seat safe. Did Jesse Helms have his convictions? Sure. But an ideological conviction displayed in the political arena doesn't mean we are to overlook a history of denying Americans their rights based on race. Give Helms credit for ushering in a new brand of conservatism in the country. But don't let that cover up his racism.  Roland S. Martin is an award-winning journalist and CNN contributor.

"Seoul (CNN) -- North Korea's underground nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, is set amid terrain appropriate for its purpose: The mountainous, northeastern province of Hamgyong, which borders China and Siberia, is one of the most inhospitable winter landscapes in Asia. But this grim, forbidding province, which is also home to the notorious Yodok labor camp, seized the attention of the wider world half a century before Pyongyang's nuclear tests and claims of human rights abuses made headlines. Hamgyong witnessed arguably the most harrowing battle fought by U.S. or British troops since World War II, a forgotten epic that offers every ingredient for the perfect war movie: an embattled force, towering odds, murderous combat and treacherous weather. Yet 60 years after the Korean War ended, and with the number of surviving veterans rapidly dwindling, the dramatic story of what took place at Chosin Reservoir has so far eluded the silver screen. ""It's an amazing story,"" said Brian Iglesias, a former U.S. Marine, Iraq veteran and independent film producer. ""It's unbelievable what they did, from both a military and a human standpoint."" In November 1950, a United Nations force -- including U.S. Marines, U.S. Army units and British Royal Marine commandos -- deployed around the strategic Chosin Reservoir, a frozen, man-made lake high in the Hamgyong mountains that supplied hydroelectric power to the industrial cities on the coastal plain. They were preparing for what they believed would be the Korean War's final offensive. The North Korean Army teetered on the brink of defeat; men expected to be ""home for Christmas."" What they did not know was that China, in a brilliant feat of mass infiltration, had intervened to support its North Korean ally, then led by Kim Il Sung, late grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un. As a Siberian cold front descended over the highlands, the 30,000-strong U.N. force found itself surrounded by eight Chinese divisions with an estimated 80,000 men. Around 65 miles from the sea, in temperatures of minus 37 degrees Celsius (minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit) and winds of 60 knots, the British and U.S. troops' only hope of escaping annihilation was to hack their way through massed enemy in a fighting withdrawal. Combat and cold claimed a gruesome toll: Of the 15,000 U.S. troops involved, more than 3,000 died during the 17-day struggle. But the Chinese forces paid a much greater price forcing the allied troops from their positions -- some 60,000 replacements were required to replace men lost to firepower and cold. The fight remains seared into veterans' memories. ""Six decades later, it's still vivid,"" said Warren Wiedhahn, a retired U.S. marine. ""The biggest part of the battle in my mind was not being able to evacuate our wounded; if they couldn't walk to keep warm, it meant almost certain death."" It was a brutal campaign featuring a range of near-unbelievable events. An Anglo-American force battled 9-1 odds in an ambush in ""Hellfire Valley."" A marine company somehow held off a Chinese division for five nights at a strategic pass. Chinese soldiers blew up a bridge over a 4,000 feet deep valley, forcing the U.S. to carry out an unprecedented operation: The airdropping of a replacement bridge. Lyle Bradley, a marine fighter-bomber pilot, recalled that during one strafing run, he could only use the cannon in one wing, as Chinese and U.S. troops were fighting so closely. On one freezing night, embattled marines watched in awe as a single star appeared through the clouds above their base. (That star later became the veterans' emblem.) And as Chinese advanced and U.N. forces evacuated North Korea, a single ship, the SS Meredith Victory, carried 14,000 desperate refugees to safety in the South, earning the title ""Ship of Miracles."" Such scenes demand cinematic treatment. In 2010, New York-based Iglesias produced an award-winning documentary, ""Chosin,"" and has since been working on a feature film: ""17 Days of Winter."" Two years ago, all looked rosy. Oscar-winners signed on: Eric Brevig (Best Effects, Visual Effects for ""Total Recall"") as director and Frank Pierson (Best Writing, Original Screenplay for ""Dog Day Afternoon"") as scriptwriter. Then tragedy struck. After finishing the script, Pierson died last year, complicating revisions. The project then hit a funding gridlock, leaving the movie in indefinite limbo. But Iglesias remains philosophical. ""Obstacles are not uncommon for these kinds of projects,"" said Iglesias. ""Sometimes, it takes a year; sometimes a decade; sometimes they never happen."" If the project never happens, it would be par for the course for the Korean War. The conflict left such little mark on popular culture that it is dubbed ""The Forgotten War."" ""Korea was not a war like the Spanish Civil War, that intellectuals went to fight in,"" said Mike Breen, author of ""The Koreans."" ""There are books and movies about it but no classics; it needs to be revisited in modern times."" Despite its near invisibility in art, the Korean War marked numerous Cold War milestones. It was the Cold War's first ""hot war;"" the first U.N. war; and the only time troops from the ""free world"" advanced into a communist state, North Korea. Beijing's shock intervention also marked the first and only battlefield clash between the U.S. and China. But it ended with an inconclusive armistice, and while North Korea remains 21st century news, the unfinished 1950-53 war lacks much of a cinematic image. Although Hollywood has produced numerous classics on World War II and Vietnam, perhaps the only memorable Korea-set films are ""Pork Chop Hill"" (1959) and ""MASH"" (1970). A 1952 film on Chosin, called ""Retreat Hell"" barely does the material justice, some believe. ""Korea is too hard to define in Hollywood terms: They put out movies of heroism and derring-do in World War II or arrogance and stupidity in Vietnam, and people understand,"" said Don Kirk a veteran Asia-based U.S. correspondent. ""We can't do that with Korea."" ""One problem with the Korean War is generational: it happened after 'The Greatest Generation' but before the 'Baby Boomers,'"" added Mark Russell, a culture critic and author of ""Pop Goes Korea."" ""So for much of Hollywood, it never really happened."" But poignantly for the war's aging veterans, this year may mark probably its last significant commemoration: July 27, 2013 is the 60th anniversary of its end. The anniversary has raised some hopes for a filmic treatment. ""I'm disappointed that Hollywood hasn't done a feature film on this largely overlooked battle,"" said Wiedhahn. ""It would contain drama, horror and suspense, and would be a major attraction on the 60th anniversary of the armistice."" Since December, Iglesias and business partner Anton Sattler, another ex-Marine, have raised more than $30,000 on Kickstarter, a fundraising website, to produce a 3-D animated short on the battle and are finalizing a graphic novel. ""There is a collective purpose with our Chosin products: Create awareness,"" Iglesias said. ""We decided to continue the story on different platforms."" Iglesias' passion for Chosin is such that, with his proposed movie having just a ""50-50"" chance of production, he would applaud competing projects. ""If someone else makes this movie, I'll support them,"" he said. ""For the Korean War, there's not enough consciousness.""","Dramatic battle took place at freezing Chosin Reservoir over 17 days in 1950 .

"(EW.com) -- Oprah has done it again: EW can exclusively report the entertainment mogul has landed Lindsay Lohan for an exclusive sit-down after the actress emerges from rehab later this summer. Moreover: Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network has signed Lohan to an eight-episode docu-series that will follow the actress as she works to rebuild her career and stay healthy. The interview will tape and air in August, with the series to air in 2014. ""OWN will air an exclusive interview with Oprah and Lindsay Lohan that will tape and air in August and an eight-part documentary series with Lindsay for 2014,"" an OWN spokesperson confirmed. The 27-year-old Lohan is currently serving a 90-day court-ordered stint in a rehabilitation facility that is expected to conclude on July 31. Getting her first post-rehab interview is considered a big scoop, while the series is arguably even bigger â€” Lohan has turned down unscripted project offers for years, preferring to focus on scripted acting roles (though her family participated in an E! docu-series titled Living Lohan in 2008). Lohan recently had guest-star appearances on Fox's Glee and FX's Anger Management, as well as starred as Elizabeth Taylor in Lifetime's biopic Liz & Dick. She also co-stars in Paul Schrader's upcoming film The Canyons. Over the last year on her Oprah's Next Chapter program, Oprah has scored a string of coveted celebrity interviews, including Lance Armstrong's doping-admission interview, Rihanna talking about her turbulent relationship with Chris Brown and an interview with Whitney Houston's family after the singer's death. Her network, which got off to a rocky ratings start, is coming off its strongest quarter yet, up 32 percent from the first quarter. See the original story at EW.com.

"Denver (CNN) -- When Nick Nisbet says he once hit rock bottom, he means it. ""I had a heroin overdose. I stopped breathing for too long, and I died. My heartbeat stopped and brain waves stopped,"" he said. ""They had to jump-start me with the paddles."" The 2006 episode finally persuaded Nisbet to kick his deadly drug habit. But getting clean -- and staying clean -- was a daunting proposition. ""I'd tried to get sober many times,"" the 34-year-old said. ""I tried the methadone clinic, I tried just cold turkey. But ... you need to fill the void with something."" He tried 12-step meetings, but they depressed him. So when his girlfriend told him about Phoenix Multisport, a sober support community that offers free athletic activities, he agreed to check it out. ""I reluctantly went, thinking it was just going to be a big waste of time,"" he said. ""Turns out it was the best move I ever made in my life."" Phoenix, named after the mythical bird that rises from its ashes, helped Nisbet rediscover his love of biking. It also connected him with other recovering addicts who wanted to be active. ""They just make sure that you're staying sober and having fun doing it,"" he said. ""It's the best support crew I could imagine having."" More than 4,700 people have participated in Phoenix, which Scott Strode started in 2007. Most join the group because they've struggled with drug or alcohol addiction. ""Life should be better once you get sober,"" said Strode, 38. ""(We want to) help people build a new life, a new self-image and have fun without getting high."" Strode developed his approach through hard-won personal experience. He started drinking when he was just 10 years old. By 15, he was using cocaine. His addictions intensified after college. One night, after a bender, he woke up on the bathroom floor. ""Suddenly it dawned on me that if I didn't change things, I was going to overdose and that was going to be how my mother would find me,"" he said. He decided to give it all up for good. But that meant abandoning his entire social network, as everyone he knew was involved in drinking and drugs. ""Overnight, your friends are gone, you're alone,"" he remembers. ""It was a depressing first three months of recovery."" Eventually Strode started working out at a boxing gym, and he later got involved with triathlons and climbing. These new activities kept him busy, and they also made him feel good. ""You start to believe you can succeed in whatever you do, whether that's your sobriety or ... crossing the finish line,"" he said. But for Strode, the most important factor was that many of the people he met through these activities were sober. With these friendships, he built a new support system. ""It was surrounding myself with a group of people that would rather get up at 7 in the morning to climb a mountain than to stay up until 7 in the morning drinking and using,"" he said. ""With influences like that, I just moved further away from the darkness of my addiction."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . In 2005, during a climbing trip, Strode realized that New Year's Eve had passed and he hadn't given so much as a thought to drugs or alcohol. He decided he wanted to share what he'd learned with others. A year later, Phoenix Multisport began offering programs in Boulder, Colorado. Phoenix offers around 50 programs every week, ranging from casual walks and yoga to mountain biking and ice climbing. Activities are led by field instructors, all of whom are in recovery and happy to show beginners the ropes. The organization provides the gear and also offers grants to help people purchase their own equipment. Nearly all events -- with the exception of overnight activities or ski trips -- are free. ""It's a great way to introduce people into something that then later becomes ... sort of their coping mechanism, as opposed to picking up a drink or a drug, "" Strode said. He notes that Phoenix isn't a substitute for any other recovery support program; in fact, many in the group are also in 12-step programs. But Strode believes the natural ""high"" that people get from Phoenix activities can be transformative. ""Just getting the blood pumping again -- for a lot of our folks, it's been a long time since that's happened,"" he said. ""The physical effects of exercise translate to your work, your family life, your belief in yourself."" Anyone who has been sober for 48 hours is welcome to come to one of Phoenix's open sessions to participate in an activity and learn about the group. After attending several events, individuals are invited to join, provided they sign a pledge to treat everyone respectfully and stay sober. Some members are hard-core athletes, but the group welcomes people of all fitness levels. Most participants have never been active. Phoenix is now in four locations in Colorado: Boulder, Colorado Springs, Denver and Fort Carson, where the organization does outreach with veterans and active-duty military personnel. Strode would like to expand beyond Colorado later this year, and he hopes Phoenix will one day become a national program. Already, members can often be seen in their red-and-black Phoenix jerseys at competitions around the country. By being open about their sobriety, Strode hopes they're helping to reduce the stigma of addiction. ""There's so much camaraderie, people often come up and ask us how they can join our club,"" he said. ""We're having fun, and we're proud of being sober."" Nisbet's pride in his sobriety is easy to spot. He sports tattoos on each finger to spell out ""DRUG FREE."" ""I was proud to be Nick the heroin addict,"" he said. ""When I stopped, I was just plain old boring Nick, I thought. ... Now I get my self-confidence by being able to go out and run a marathon or riding my bike for 100 miles. I like having that identity, as the guy that can do endurance sports. It feels good."" Now married, Nisbet wants to set a good example for his 10-month-old son old by graduating from college. Just recently, he got a new tattoo to cover up one that he got when he was using. The design? A colorful phoenix. For him, the symbolism means a lot. ""Anytime I look down and see (it), it's rising, so ... no more muttering around,"" he said. ""Life is way too short to waste it doing drugs."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- This is no way to run a party. The details of the scandal sweeping the New York Republican Party are tawdry, sad and infuriating -- and a wake-up call to a national party that is urgently seeking to make inroads among black, Latino, and young voters. Barely two weeks after RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and New York state Republican Chairman Ed Cox held a press conference at a black church in Brooklyn to launch the party's ambitious, $10 million diversity campaign, FBI agents arrested Malcolm Smith, a longtime black state legislator. According to federal prosecutors, Smith spent months organizing cash bribes to two top city Republican officials in exchange for a slot on the ballot in this fall's Republican primary for mayor. Unfortunately for Smith, a real estate tycoon he enlisted to make cash payments was, in fact, an undercover FBI agent, according to federal prosecutors. The criminal complaint against Smith and five others -- including a Republican City Council member and the chairman and vice chairman of two Republican county organizations -- details mind-boggling details of recorded conversations and alleged handovers of envelopes stuffed with money. All the scheming, say prosecutors, was done in the hope that Smith might secure the Republican nomination and somehow win the race for mayor in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 6-to-1. Smith will get his day in court, along with the five other men and women named -- but the damage to the party is incalculable. In a 100-page plan of action, Priebus and the RNC laid out a pilot project to build support among black urban voters, and specifically declared that ""big-city mayoral races provide our best 2013 opportunities for these projects."" New York can probably be crossed off that list, and the fallout will be felt in other cities as the case unfolds. And that's a shame. Republican leaders are right to make their case to young, urban, black and Latino voters, and should be grooming candidates from all communities. America's two-party system can't function properly if the parties are racially divided. The flirtation with the Republican Party by Smith, a lifelong Democrat -- if done honestly -- might have started a new conversation within black circles about the cost and wisdom of always supporting Democratic candidates and policies. It has long been noticed that black communities contain their share of church-going social conservatives; the GOP theory is that intelligent outreach to those voters could tilt close contests to Republicans. That's not likely to happen now. Smith's troubles -- and the arrest of Republican leaders accused of taking money to advance Smith's cross-party ambitions -- will supply ammunition to conservative party leaders who are skeptical about the new diversity strategy. The scandal also weakens the argument, popular among national Republicans, that big-city Democratic political machines are corrupt and wasteful. In New York, at least, the shoe is on the other foot, with GOP party leaders in the nation's biggest city hauled from their homes in handcuffs and facing up to 40 years in prison or more. It now falls to New York's Republican chairman, Ed Cox, to straighten out this mess. Cox knows his way around a scandal: As the son-in-law of the late President Richard Nixon, he had a ringside seat as the Watergate debacle unfolded. Cox must do whatever it takes to chase any crooked characters out of his party -- and try, against the odds, to continue Priebus' outreach strategy. Doing so will be a challenge, because the next black or Latino Republican candidate will face the question: Are you another Malcolm Smith? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Errol Louis.","State lawmaker accused of bribing GOP officials to put him on ballot for New York mayor .
Errol Louis: For a party trying to woo blacks and Latinos, the damage is incalculable .

"(CNN) -- Syria accused Israel of firing rockets into the Damascus suburb of Jamraya on Sunday, striking a ""scientific research center,"" Syrian state TV reported. It is the second Syrian claim this year of a strike against what observers have described as a government defense research facility, and it comes one day after U.S. officials first told CNN that the United States believes Israel carried out an airstrike against Syria. Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the Syrian TV report. ""We do not comment on these reports at all,"" an IDF spokesperson said. The Syrian news report claimed the rocket attack on the research center aided rebels, who have been battling government forces in the region. In late January, reports surfaced that Israeli warplanes targeted the research facility. The Syrian government has said the airstrike killed two workers and injured five others. A U.S. official told CNN at the time the Syrian claims were false. The official said Israeli fighter jets targeted a Syrian government convoy carrying surface-to-air missiles bound for the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria denied there were such shipments. The report of rocket attacks come as sectarian violence erupted in northwestern Syria, where three consecutive days of killing by mostly Alawite forces have left hundreds of predominantly Sunni residents dead, opposition groups said Saturday. ""The regime attacked the town of Beyda and other neighboring areas from the sea with rockets before security forces and militias loyal to the regime entered the area and conducted mass executions,"" Free Syrian Army chief of staff Gen. Salim Idris said by phone from Antakya, Turkey. ""They want to establish a sectarian-based entity in the region,"" he said. State media have said their forces were seeking only to clear the area of ""terrorists,"" the term they have routinely used when referring to rebel forces. But the U.S. State Department said it was ""appalled by horrific reports that more than 100 people were killed May 2"" in Beyda, a suburb of Baniyas. ""We call on all responsible actors in Syria to speak out against the perpetration of unlawful killings against any group, regardless of faith or ethnicity,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in a statement. Opposition groups that included the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Free Syrian Army said the widespread killing in and around the coastal city of Baniyas continued Saturday as largely Alawite regime forces used tanks, battleships and missile launchers to hit largely Sunni neighborhoods in Baniyas. The government forces killed at least 200 people on Friday and Saturday in Baniyas and its suburbs, the LCC said Saturday. More than 200 others were killed there on Thursday, when the killings started early in the day, it said. Reliable information has been difficult to obtain because government forces controlled access to the village, the LCC said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said hundreds of Sunni families began fleeing Baniyas' southern neighborhoods at dawn Saturday, heading toward the cities of Tartous and Jableh. A graphic video posted by activists who said it was shot in the Ras al-Nabaa neighborhood showed people, including an infant, lying lifeless on the ground. Many bore what appeared to be bullet wounds and some appeared burned. CNN's access to war zones has been limited by the government and has not been able to confirm its authenticity. State-run Syrian TV filed reports from Beyda over the last two days reporting that government troops along with the National Defense militia, an armed Alawite group loyal to the government, ""have cleaned the area from armed terrorists"" after ""they burned civilians' homes and stores and terrorized the population."" The reporting was supported by interviews with members of the Syrian army. U.N. has warned of sectarian violence . Last December, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry warned that the civil war had become ""overtly sectarian."" It said government forces and militias, dominated by Alawites, had been attacking Sunnis -- who were ""broadly (but not uniformly)"" backing the rebel groups. And anti-government armed groups were targeting Alawites. Other minority communities, including some Christians, Armenians, Palestinians, Kurds and Turkmen, ""have also been caught up in the conflict, and in some cases forced to take up arms for their own defense or to take sides."" But it said the ""sectarian lines fall most sharply"" between Alawites and Sunnis. The ""increasingly sectarian nature"" of the fighting is a motivator for proxy groups fighting in Syria. Anti-government armed groups are composed of Sunnis from the Middle East and North Africa, the report said. Shiites from other countries have entered the conflict on behalf of Syria. The Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah has said its members are fighting. There are reports of Iraqi Shiites fighting in Syria and of Iran's Revolutionary Guards providing intellectual and advisory support. Christian communities across Syria have been under the gun and on the move. Homs, for example, was once home to 80,000 Christians, but the commission said most had escaped to Lebanon. ""With communities believing -- not without cause -- that they face an existential threat, the need for a negotiated settlement is more urgent than ever,"" the commission said. Al-Assad makes public appearance . Also Saturday, the country's president made his second public appearance this month, according to state-run Syrian Television. ""President Bashar al-Assad joins thousands of students and families of martyrs in Damascus University in inaugurating the Martyred Students Monument in memory of all the students who were killed in Syria,"" it said. The president's Facebook page posted a picture of the event. On May 1, al-Assad visited the Ummayad electrical plant to ""congratulate its staff and all the Syrian workers on the occasion of International Workers' Day,"" the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. Israel said to be flying over Lebanon . Israel was flying warplanes over Lebanon on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the Lebanese army said. Lebanon's president, Gen. Michel Sleiman, condemned the violations as ""an attempt to shaken Lebanese stability,"" the state-run National News Agency reported Saturday. The Israeli military had no comment. But a source in the Israeli defense establishment told CNN's Sara Sidner, ""We will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist organizations. We have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future."" Israel appears to have struck Syria . Two U.S. officials told CNN on Friday that Israel appears to have conducted an airstrike into Syria on Thursday or Friday. Based on initial indications, the U.S. does not believe Israeli warplanes entered Syrian airspace to conduct the strikes. President Barack Obama told reporters on Friday that he did not foresee a scenario of ""American boots on the ground in Syria"" that would be good for that country or the region. Obama said other leaders in the region want to see al-Assad out of power.

"(CNN) -- Today could be a crucial day in the push to rid Syria of chemical weapons. It's day two of meetings between Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva, Switzerland. A plan could be created Friday, but then again ... The United Nations is also poised to get involved. Although Syria's bloody civil war is over two years old, power players from many nations seemed focused on making changes. Here are the five things to pay attention to today. 1. Nailing down a plan . Lavrov and Kerry take 2. The most talked about chat in the world goes into its second day Friday with many hoping that the two can nail down a blueprint to destroy Syria's chemical weapons. If Thursday's meeting in Geneva is any indication, there is going to be a lot of back and forth. The sparring began in the opening statements. Lavrov spoke first. Kerry followed with longer and more forceful remarks. When he finished, Lavrov asked to respond and said he hadn't come ""prepared with the extended political statement,"" adding that ""diplomacy likes silence."" Kerry then asked the translator to repeat Lavrov's final comment, but when that didn't happen, Lavrov tried to assure Kerry there was no problem. ""You want me to take your word for it? It's a little early for that,"" Kerry said, smiling, as the two men shook hands for the cameras. Ouch. Though this exchange was playful, former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says Kerry will have his hands full with Lavrov. Cohen said Lavrov is ""very, very skilled,"" ""bright,"" ""articulate"" and ""a very tough negotiator."" The talks could extend into Saturday, officials have said. If any deal is reached, it would have to be taken to the United Nations for consideration. 2. More Putin backlash . Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be America's favorite writer, right now. Putin's opinion piece published Wednesday in the New York Times ruffled some feathers and had at least one U.S. lawmaker looking for a barf bag. The Russian leader's argument against military intervention in Syria brought some response. But his slap at American exceptionalism brought a flurry of U.S. reaction Thursday. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez says the piece made him almost want to throw up, and House Speaker John Boehner says he's ""insulted."" Even though the the White House shrugged off the fuss calling it ""irrelevant,"" don't be surprised if there are more reactions Friday. 3. More fighting and sadly more deaths . Though the camera seems focused on political spats, and negotiations about Syria, in the country a fierce fight continues. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that fighting killed at least 94 people across Syria on Thursday, including 24 in Daraa province. This figure includes 27 deaths in Daraa province and another 26 in Aleppo province. The same group documented shelling that struck nearly 500 locales, along with almost 50 military jet attacks. The fight continues Friday. 4. So where are these chemical weapons? And while world powers haggle about what to do with Syria's chemical weapons, a rebel leader is claiming the government's cache of mass destruction is on the move. Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the opposition Free Syrian Army, says Syria's government is shifting its chemical weapons out of the country. Where? Iraq and Lebanon, Idriss says. CNN could not verify that claim. And Iraq quickly said: no way. ""We were the victims of chemical weapons under Saddam (Hussein's) regime, and we will never allow to let any country to transfer chemical materials to our lands at all,"" said an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. 5. The UN gets closer to weighing in . A greatly anticipated U.N. report on Syria's alleged chemical attack could be coming soon. This development could speed up an international response to Syria . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday that the United Nations report on the August attack in Syria will ""probably"" be published on Monday, and that there will ""certainly be indications"" pointing to the origin of the attack. France and other U.S. allies have said they want any coordinated response on Syria to be controlled by the U.N. The report is being created by inspectors who traveled to the site of the chemical weapons attack in the suburban Damascus that the United States estimates killed more than 1,400 people. It could be a first step toward generating support for a Security Council resolution. The world is waiting. CNN's Barbara Starr, Steve Brusk, Jamie Crawford, Jake Tapper, Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, John King, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Talks between the United States and Russia continue .

They will do it again on Monday at the Capitol before a crowd of up to 800,000 people. The Constitution mandates that U.S. presidents be sworn in on January 20.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military is pounding Taliban targets in the country's Swat Valley, trying to clear militants who control parts of the district's main city, military officials said. Pakistani army trucks transport cannons for the military operation against the Taliban. The Pakistani forces had killed 35 militants in Wednesday's fighting, the officials said. The officials said there are reports of some civilian casualties in Wednesday's fighting -- which has been concentrated in Swat's district capital of Mingora -- but they denied local media reports that 35 civilians died. An eyewitness said he saw the bodies of 15 civilians were being taken from a village near Mingora on Wednesday. Twelve of the dead were children. Taliban militants have laid siege to Mingora, looting banks, attacking army headquarters, the police station, and the main power grid station, the officials said. They are also occupying civilian houses and government buildings in the city center, according to the military.  See a map of Taliban-controlled areas » .

"(CNN) -- Belize, the tiny nation bordering Mexico and Guatemala, was already a fan favorite at the Gold Cup given its massive underdog tag. But the national team likely gained even more supporters after players turned down a ""large amount of money"" to throw a match against the U.S. at the tournament. Two of the players, Woodrow West and Ian Gaynair, told CONCACAF officials about the incident and after an investigation was launched, it led to ""positive identification of the individual attempting the bribery,"" the governing body said in a statement. ""We want to thank Woodrow West and Ian Gaynair and recognize them for their bravery and commitment to preserving the integrity of our game,"" CONCACAF said. According to the website of a television station in Belize, the man offering the money first met team members in Guatemala and attempted to befriend them. He then called them in Portland, Oregon and met players at a mall near the team hotel two days before the game against the Gold Cup host. ""He started talking that we don't really stand a chance to beat the U.S. so he wanted us to promise him that we would lose the game and that he would give us a large amount of money to change our lives in Belize and to help our families,"" Gaynair was quoted as saying by the website, www.7newsbelize.com. Even though the majority of Belize's players are part-timers and the team needed to hold fundraisers to help cover costs, the players declined the offer. ""He saw that my features changed and he saw that we weren't into it so he got frightened and took out a large amount of money to bribe us, a lot of hundred and fifty dollar bills and threw it at us on the table and told us to keep it and to not say anything,"" Gaynair, a defender, said. ""Like I told him, 'We can't take that money,' because at the end of the day our country is behind us and we just made history for these big games so we can't just sell out our country for a little bit of money."" Belize, 130th in the FIFA rankings, would go on to lose 6-1 to the U.S. in Portland in its tournament debut Wednesday. ""We are Belizeans and that is what we're doing out here -- to represent our country and me, Woodrow West, and being loyal to my country,"" said West, the backup keeper. ""That (is) bigger than any amount of money that they can ever give me and that is why I stood firm.

"(CNN) -- Wichita was under a tornado emergency late Saturday as a large twister, part of a series of severe storms in the Great Plains, moved through south-central Kansas and threatened to destroy homes. The ""confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado was located just east of Conway Springs and moving northeast at 35 mph,"" toward the Wichita area, the National Weather Service reported Saturday night. ""This is a particularly dangerous situation."" Major damage to houses and buildings were likely, ""and complete destruction possible,"" the weather agency said. But by 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), Kansas authorities had reported no serious damages. Earlier in the day, a possible tornado struck a hospital Saturday evening in Creston, Iowa, according to a dispatcher with the Union County Sheriff's Department. A search-and-rescue operation was under way. ""We have been hit. We are triaging and moving patients,"" a spokeswoman at Greater Regional Medical Center in the south-central Iowa city confirmed. City Council member Randy White told CNN he was aware of no serious injuries. ""A lot of windows have been broken out and some cars have been flipped over. We can't see a lot right now because the power is out."" A temporary hospital was set up at Southwestern Community College, White said. The region had more than 80 preliminary tornado reports by 10:30 p.m. ET Saturday, according to CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras, though some of those reports could be of the same twister. Most were in rural areas and damage was reported to be relatively minor, including downed trees and power lines and minor flooding. Across the south and central Plains, storm chasers broadcast images of funnel clouds roaring through rural landscapes. Residents in some high-risk areas received new warnings intended to grab their attention and prompt them to find safe shelter. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback issued this advisory: ""If you're on the road, get off as soon as you can and find some shelter."" Are you there? Share videos, pictures and stories . The tornado outbreak had been predicted by forecasters, who said there was a ""high risk"" of severe thunderstorms into Sunday in portions of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma. More than 5 million people live in those at-risk areas. A tornado touchdown was reported near Medicine Lodge, Kansas, and a large tornado advanced on Salina, Kansas, just before sundown. The National Weather Service's Wichita office, taking part in an experimental warning system, used graphic terms to warn residents of potential harm. The warnings are used by media outlets. Residents near Brookville, Kansas, for example, were told ""major house and building damage was likely and complete destruction was possible."" Des Moines, Iowa, National Weather Service meteorologist Roger Vachalek said residents in the area should be prepared for high winds and possible tornadoes and hail overnight. Two or three possible tornadoes were already sighted. About 16,000 MidAmerican Energy customers in the Des Moines area lost power. At least four apparent tornadoes were reported near Dodge City, in southwestern Kansas, officials said. Two were reported in Rush County. ""It's been an interesting day,"" said meteorologist Mike Scott, adding severe storms arrived earlier than expected. Forecasters said a ""dry line"" colliding with moist Gulf air was making for dangerous conditions. A dry line is a boundary that separates warm, moist air from dry desert air. ""Everything west of that line is very dry and is associated with downsloping winds,"" Scott said. Four active tornado warnings and four tornado watches were in effect Saturday evening in the region. Two of the watches that extend from Iowa and Nebraska south into Kansas and Oklahoma are ""Particularly Dangerous Situation"" watches, meaning there is a significant chance of long-track, damaging tornadoes. The tornado threat may increase as storms move through more populated areas such as Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Wichita; Omaha, Nebraska; Des Moines, Iowa; and Kansas City, Missouri. Tennis-ball-sized hail and winds of up to 60 miles per hour were reported in Nebraska's Antelope and Boone counties, said Mike Moritz of the National Weather Service office in Hastings, Nebraska. Tornado reports came in from Hardy and Deshler, Nebraska, and Tipton, Kansas. None was a long-track tornado. Rick Smith, warning coordination meteorologist in the agency's Norman, Oklahoma, office, said a line of supercell thunderstorms stretched Saturday afternoon from northwestern Oklahoma to the Texas Panhandle. A tornado formed in Woodward, Oklahoma, Smith told CNN. A brief touchdown was reported. ""This is just the beginning of what could be a long afternoon and night, and people should pay attention to warnings,"" Smith said. No injuries had been reported in Oklahoma by mid-evening Saturday. According to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris, ""high risk"" areas could possibly endure EF3 to EF5 tornadoes, packing winds of 136 mph or stronger. CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said the Interstate 35 corridor -- from Oklahoma City to Wichita -- was among the most threatened areas. An elevated severe thunderstorm ""moderate"" threat extended from northern Nebraska, southward into the tip of northern Texas. This includes Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri. A ""slight"" risk area extended all the way from Texas to southwestern Wisconsin. A severe thunderstorm is defined by the National Weather Service as a thunderstorm that produces at least one or more of the following: winds of at least 58 mph, hail 1 inch in diameter and tornadoes. The predicted severe storms come as five National Weather Service offices in Missouri and Kansas are conducting an experiment on how to better convey risks from tornadoes and severe storms. The ""impact based"" warning test, which began earlier this month, comes on the heels of the May 22-27 Midwest/Southeast tornado outbreak, including a tornado that killed 158 people in Joplin, Missouri. The National Weather Service is ratcheting up its efforts to combat complacency, with the help of graphic terms to ensure people find safe shelter. A tornado is confirmed, on average, only once for every four formal warnings. Forecasters in the test area will continue issuing traditional tornado warnings, but for ""significant"" and ""catastrophic"" scenarios, they can add information at the bottom of the warnings issued to media outlets. When a storm has the potential to cause ""significant"" damage, meteorologists may include terms such as ""major house and building damage likely,"" ""complete destruction possible"" or ""major power outages in path of tornado highly likely."" In a ""catastrophic"" outlook, descriptions may include ""This is a life-threatening situation,"" ""You could be killed if not underground or in a tornado shelter,"" or ""complete destruction of entire neighborhoods likely.""

"(CNN) -- Yousef is two years old and lives in a refugee camp in Iraq. Her mother tells comedian and UNICEF ambassador Eddie Izzard that she wants to return to her country, but will not jeopardize her children's safety. With every day that passes in their life as a refugee, she fears that they are losing another day of their childhood. Yousef (not his real name) is two years old and lives in a shack that once sheltered animals. He arrived in Northern Iraq from Syria a few months ago. In Syria he lived in a nice home, in a nice area - full of middle-class comforts. But planes began to whirr through the skies and bombs began to fall in his region. The power supply diminished and the police disappeared. And, one day, a group of men came to the house and threatened his young sister. His mother said enough. So, Yousef was bundled up, packed into a car and set off to the border, where his mother carried him and his sister across to Iraq. Syria's forgotten refugees . The family lost everything in Syria -- their house, their roots, and most of their loved ones. They followed in the footsteps of the only relatives who had already fled and moved into a large settlement of improvised homes, not far from Domiz refugee camp near Dohuk. An uncle had found the shell of a shelter for sheep and goats. They built up walls and covered holes with tarpaulin. Sixteen people moved in. There are now three rooms, with a family sleeping in each. I traveled to Northern Iraq with UNICEF to report on the growing catastrophe facing Syrian children. I was surprised to find that three quarters of refugees are in Yousef's situation and do not live in formalized camps. Instead, refugees cram into overcrowded, rented flats; shacks they have built from scratch, or converted dwellings. Others squeeze in with family members. Refugees find a home where they can. There is not enough space in camps for everyone. Domiz refugee camp alone was designed for 15,000 people and is already home to 45,000. There are 160,000 refugees in Iraq and the number is anticipated to more than double by the end of the year to 350,000. Towns, cities and wasteland soak up the overspill. The needs in these communities are dire. One young refugee girl I was told about had been out of school for two years and had forgotten how to read. Keeping children safe from harm and abuse is also problematic in fractured and ad hoc settlements. And -- perhaps most crucially as the temperatures hit 45 degrees - there is not enough clean water or sanitation facilities for everyone. With cholera epidemics most common in September, the threat of disease looms large in people's minds. UNICEF, along with the Kurdistan Regional Government and other humanitarian organizations, is doing everything it can to get aid to children and their families who need it -- safe drinking water, adequate sanitation, specialist psychological support, education and health services. A dedicated plan to cater to the needs of urban refugees in northern Iraq is currently being drawn up with partners including UNHCR. But numbers are huge and expanding -- and there are not enough resources to go round and not enough funds to scale up existing programs. UNICEF has only a third of the money it needs for the year in order to deliver vital aid. At the moment, the agency simply cannot help everyone it wants to. Yousef's mother does not know how long they will have to stay in Iraq. She wants to return to her country, but will not jeopardize her children's safety. She fears her son and daughter will forget Syria and they are growing up without the education, basic services and protection they deserve. With every day that passes in their life as a refugee, she fears that they are losing another day of their childhood. Syrian refugees plead with U.S. secretary of state in Jordan . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eddie Izzard.","Two-year-old Yousef fled to Northern Iraq from Syria with his mother and sister for their safety .

"Algeria (CNN) -- All eyes are on Algeria following the hostage crisis at a BP gas facility that left at least 37 hostages -- and dozens of militants -- dead. And while we're uncovering details of what happened at the remote desert complex at In Amenas and why, we must also scrutinize what this crisis tells us about security in North Africa, or the Maghreb. This tragedy is the outcome of a larger series of events that cannot be separated from its transnational -- and especially regional -- context. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . The Maghreb, or ""Arab West,"" encompasses Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara, spanning from the southern rim of the Mediterranean well into the Sahara. Some argue it also includes Chad, Mali, and Niger, where national borders are porous. The Maghreb region is tied together by these nations' historical, commercial, religious and, more recently, ideological exchanges. Despite decades of French and Italian rule, these links between the people and communities of the region never disappeared -- in fact, they have moved to the fore in the past decade, and accelerated since the Arab Spring. Read more: At least 37 hostages killed in Algeria gas plant standoff, prime minister says . Transnational origins of the crisis . How do al Qaeda and other jihadi Islamist movements figure in the context of the region? The antecedents of the transnational al Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) are linked to disparate elements of the jihadist movement that lost the 1990s Algerian civil war -- among them Moktar Belmoktar, the one-eyed Algerian militant who claimed responsibility for In Amenas. Though initially based in northern Algeria, they have been present in southern Algeria, northern Mali and Niger for a decade. Initially involved in smuggling cigarettes, cars, drugs, and weapons, the movement has more recently engaged in kidnappings in the Saharan regions that have generated millions of dollars in ransoms. In 2007 many of these groups officially rallied to al Qaeda. Read more: American killed in Algeria hostage standoff 'really, truly felt safe there' The fall of Ben Ali during the Tunisian revolution in 2011 emboldened citizens in neighboring Libya to rise against Moammar Gadhafi. But as Libya's NATO-supported rebels closed in on Gadhafi, truckloads of arms left for Northern Mali. The colonel had actively recruited ethnic Tuaregs from Mali and Niger to form a hard core within his armed forces. With no place to go in a post-Gadhafi Libya, many rallied to Azawad, their homeland in northern Mali. Perhaps emboldened by liberation in Tunisia and Libya, in January 2012, the National Liberation Movement of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine, the most prominent Tuareg armed groups, launched a rebellion that pushed the government from northern Mali. While the MNLA declared an independent Tuareg state called Azawad, the armed group Ansar Dine rallied to AQIM and another splinter group, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO). Read more: Algeria attack may have link to Libya camps . Together, the three announced their aims to push the rebellion to the capital Bamako to impose an Islamic state. With a war chest filled with monies from smuggling, drugs and ransoms, AQIM has purchased sophisticated weaponry smuggled from Libya. It too has been effective in recruitment -- of all the armed movements in northern Mali, none can match its international reputation, puritanical ideology, and potential for wealth accumulation. France intervened in Mali earlier this month when the Jihadist alliance began to push into central and southern Mali. The jihadi front led by AQIM threatened reprisals on France and its allies. On January 16, 2013, members of the ""Signed in Blood Batallion,"" an AQIM splinter group, led by Belmokhtar, attacked In Amenas. The breakdown of nationalities represented in the team reveals the degree to which AQIM has become the nexus for trans-regional jihadism: Eleven of the 32 terrorists were Tunisian, the remaining twenty-two included Canadians, Egyptians, Malians, Mauritanians, and Nigerians. The group itself is led by an Algerian. The attack was planned in Mali, launched from Libya, and executed in Algeria. Read more: Algeria attack changes terror landscape in North Africa . Transnational ramifications . The ramifications are trans-regional in the Maghreb and Sahara. To the south, the jihadi alliance is likely to be dispersed by the joint ECOWAS-French military intervention. The crisis will likely spill into neighboring Mauritania and Niger, as rebel groups flee French air strikes -- just as the Libyan war spilled into Mali. A humanitarian crisis looms. In the Maghreb, the event will have ramifications for moderate Islamist political parties recently elected to power. Moderate Algerians who have participated in the political system for the last decade and a half have been destabilized. The Islamist Movement for a Society of Peace (MSP), still reeling from an electoral defeat in the May legislative elections, and a schism within the party, has imploded. Two days after the attack, MSP leader Bouguerra Soltani announced he was quitting the party leadership. The announcement passed virtually unnoticed by a public disabused of political Islam, and which had rallied behind its army to a degree not witnessed in many years. Many refer to the In Amenas attack as the ""Algerian 9/11."" Read more: Former al Qaeda captive 'not surprised' by Algeria attack . While the Ennahda-led coalition in Tunisia denounced the attack, the crisis will likely have an important impact on domestic Tunisian politics. The hostage crisis occurred almost two years to the date of Tunisia's 14 January Revolution. There is a broad perception that insecurity has increased in Tunisia since the flight of Ben Ali, as well as popular feeling that the Ennadha government is doing little to protect citizens from an increasingly violent Salafi, or puritanical movement. Post-Arab Spring blues . The In Amenas attack underscores the importance of viewing Saharan terrorism as part of a broader, region-wide political development. Just as ideas of freedom, justice, and dignity buttressing the Arab Spring have snowballed across the region, jihadist movements have likewise spread, destabilizing democratic aspirations across the region. The halcyon period of the post-Arab Spring is over. Moderate political Islam in Algeria is on the decline, Islamists fared poorly in Libyan elections, and Ennahda opponents are gaining public support as they rally under the banner of security in Tunisia.

"(CNN) -- Tests of a Louisiana parish's water supply confirmed the presence of a rare brain-eating amoeba blamed for last month's death of a 4-year-old boy. The state's Department of Health & Hospitals said Thursday that tests conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found Naegleria fowleri in St. Bernard Parish water. The water is safe to drink, state officials said, although they cautioned against getting water in the nose. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking or cooking with contaminated water, the CDC said. Infected patients are diagnosed with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. The parish water supply came under suspicion because its chlorine levels were low. Chlorine kills the amoeba, said Assistant Health Secretary J.T. Lane. Naegleria fowleri associated with disinfected public drinking water has caused deaths in only one other case in the United States, according to the CDC. The water came from an untreated, geothermal well-supplied drinking water system in Arizona; two children died there in 2003. Lane said the Louisiana parish, along the Gulf Coast southeast of New Orleans, began flushing water lines with chlorine last week, a process that will continue for weeks until chlorine levels reach recommended levels. A Mississippi boy who had played on a water slide made out of a long sheet of plastic while visiting St. Bernard Parish contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis and died last month. Tests at the home where he was playing found the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Officials said less than 1% of patients survive the deadly brain infection caused by this amoeba. But an experimental drug from the CDC has shown promise in fighting it. Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old in Arkansas, survived after contracting the amoeba in July, possibly at a Little Rock, Arkansas, water park. Doctors credited Kali's mom, Traci Hardig, with her survival, saying she brought her daughter to the hospital early and pushed for more tests. ""If you believe that there's something more wrong with your daughter or your son than a simple virus or stomach flu, stay in there, hang in there,"" Hardig told CNN. ""Talk to the doctor ... and reassure them that this is not a normal illness."" The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the government agency's website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower the risk of infection: . • Avoid swimming in fresh water when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. • Hold your nose shut or use nose clips while swimming. • Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. • If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized.

"Henryville, Indiana (CNN) -- Even as potent winds and heavy rains lingered in spots, residents through huge swaths of the eastern United States spent Saturday trying to come to grips with vicious storms that obliterated communities, reduced scores of homes to rubble and left at least 37 people dead. About 17 million from Texas to Indiana to North Carolina were affected by the massive tornado outbreak that began Friday, and continued into the weekend. Of the 37 victims, 18 were in Kentucky, 14 in Indiana, three in Ohio, and one each in Alabama and Georgia. Much of Saturday was focused on assessing the damage, treating the wounded and grieving those killed. But in parts of southern Georgia and northern Florida, it meant braving heavy rain and high wind as far south as Orlando all tied to the same powerful system. In Lakeland, Georgia, strong winds ""destroyed"" several houses, felled trees, spurred major outages, and caused what appears to be minor damage to several buildings behind a hospital, Lanier County Sheriff Wesley Studstill told CNN. He said he was unsure if there were any related injuries. The National Weather Service received two reports of tornadoes Saturday in Lanier County, which is about 30 miles north of the Florida border. Meanwhile, residents from Alabama to Ohio spent Saturday trying to make sense of the chaos -- and right their lives -- after the previous day's devastating tornadoes. Piles of debris took the place of well-built homes. High winds toppled tall trees. Bright yellow school buses smashed into buildings. Garbage bins and wooden beams flew through the air with the force of a jet airliner. Churches turned into shelters and thousands of people began a weekend unnerved by nature's fury. In hard-hit Henryville, Indiana, rescuers combed for survivors after a twister ripped through the town 20 miles north of Louisville. Joe Sullivan, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the tornado that swept through that and other Southern Indiana communities was an EF-4 -- meaning it had sustained winds of between 166 and 200 mph, putting it in the top 2% of all tornadoes in terms of strength. It went for 52 miles and was roughly 150 yards wide, he added. There were no active searches for survivors as of 5 p.m. Saturday, said Sgt. Jerry Goodin of the Indiana State Police. The breadth of destruction left authorities, however, with ""no idea how many people are homeless."" ""There are a lot of people who can't sit down on their own couch this evening,"" Goodin said. Wayne Hunter, 64, huddled under a blanket with his wife for safety in the middle of their one-story home -- as they'd done many other times -- when the tornado ""hit head on,"" their daughter Pamela Rawlings told CNN on Saturday. A neighbor eventually found Pamela Hunter some 30 feet away from her husband, bleeding but apparently not suffering from life-threatening injuries. Wayne Hunter, however, did not survive. ""Whether you wanted to laugh or not, he always put a smile on your face,"" said Rawlings, remembering her father. Amid the mounting reports of death and destruction, there was some good news. A 20-month-old girl was found alive, alone and injured in a field in Salem, about 20 miles south of Henryville, said Maj. Chuck Adams, a sheriff's department spokesman. She was later identified and family members joined her at the hospital. However, she remained in critical condition Saturday afternoon, Kosair Children's Hospital spokesman Brian Rublein said. At Henryville's high school and adjacent elementary school, staff had huddled in the office area with about 40 students who had not been able to go home and prayed as twisters approached. ""It's a blessing. We praise God"" that no one was hurt, said Glenn Riggs, the elementary school principal. Added Sullivan, from the weather service, ""There could have been scores of fatalities"" had most students not been let out early. Unfortunately, many nearby residents were not so lucky. It was unclear how many people were missing in Henryville, as well as the towns of Chelsea, Paynesville and Marysville -- all hit by tornadoes -- because authorities are still trying to wrap their arms around the sheer amount of devastation, Adams said. ""Marysville is almost completely gone,"" Adams told CNN affiliate WHAS-TV, out of Louisville, Kentucky. In Chelsea, east of Henryville, Steve Kloepfer told WHAS that the bodies of his aunt and uncle, Terry and Carol Jackson, and their 4-year-old grandchild were discovered in a field, covered in debris. His own home, he said, also was gone. President Barack Obama talked Saturday with the governors of Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio to express his concerns, offer condolences for those killed and provide federal assistance if needed, the White House said in a statement. To that point, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has been in touch with emergency management officials in the affected states. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones and those whose lives have been affected by the storms,"" said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. Roughly 250 National Guard troops have been called in to provide aid and security in Henryville, Marysville and elsewhere, said Sgt. 1st Class Tina Eichenour. In Kentucky, similar scenes played out as Gov. Steve Beshear declared a statewide emergency and ordered the deployment of 220 National Guard troops to join a 12-person team searching for survivors in Morgan County. Around 5 p.m. Saturday, the governor detailed -- citing the state Department of Public Health -- 18 fatalities in six counties, including five in Laurel County. One apparent tornado made its way down Main Street in West Liberty, shredding buildings and overturning cars along the way. Mike Lacy, with Morgan County's emergency management agency, reported that several people were rescued -- including one man trapped under up to 10 feet of debris -- though four died as a result of the storm across the county. ""It's been a tough night,"" said Morgan County executive Tim Conley. ""We are (fortunate) to report four (dead) and not 104, because we could have lost a whole lot more lives in this thing."" In Tennessee, there were reports of possible tornado touchdowns in nine counties, according to Jeremy Heidt, the state's emergency management spokesman. The National Weather Service later confirmed a tornado hit at least in Jackson, Putnam and Overton counties. At least 29 people were injured across the state. The storms also moved through northern Georgia late Friday. A tornado was believed to have struck north Georgia's Paulding County, damaging two elementary schools, a small local airfield and an undetermined number of homes, said Ashley Henson, a sheriff's spokesman. Aerial images showed roofs ripped off houses, exposing bedrooms, kitchens and garages. Six houses were destroyed. In one, a couple survived by getting into the bathtub with their 6-month-old child, Henson said. ""Thank goodness there were actually no injuries or fatalities reported in the Paulding County area,"" he said. ""That is amazing to me, looking at some of this damage."" But one person was killed in the suburban Atlanta city of Alpharetta. Around Charlotte, North Carolina, at least three people were injured, said Capt. Rob Brisley of the fire department. The National Weather Service confirmed an EF-2 twister --- with maximum winds up to 135 mph -- struck early Saturday morning along a roughly 3.8-mile long, 175-foot wide stretch through East Mecklenburg and Cabarrus counties. At least 20 homes were damaged, six of them extensively, according to the agency. In Ohio, two people died in Bethel and another in Moscow due to the storms, Clermont County Commissioner Bob Proud said. ""It's like a bomb went off and everything is splintered, bricks are down, and trees, and just a lot of debris,"" Ohio Gov. John Kasich said after touring damage in those and other nearby towns. He said that the state plans to work with the federal government to provide relief, though at this point there are no plans to request a federal disaster declaration. After talking with people who planned to rebuild, Kasich vowed ""we'll be back."" ""We're knocked down, but we're not knocked out,"" he said. ""We're going to get through it."" CNN's Joe Sutton, Susan Candiotti, Athena Jones, Eric Marrapodi, Moni Basu, Melanie Whitley, Kara Devlin, Maria P. White, Greg Botelho and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Muslim Moro National Liberation Front rebels were holding at least 180 hostages in Zamboanga on the Philippine island of Mindanao as troops continued to pour into the embattled city, Philippine state media said Wednesday. There are also reports that the breakaway group seized between 30 and 37 additional hostages in the city Wednesday morning, said PNA, the state news agency. Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas had earlier told a news conference that about 100 hostages were in the hands of the MNLF rebel forces in Zamboanga. Roxas said almost 13,000 people had been evacuated amid fighting between government armed forces and an estimated 300 armed Muslim rebels in blockaded areas of the city. ""The situation continues to be contained,"" Roxas said. ""Government forces continue to come in and adopt a nonaggressive stance,"" he said, adding that the government's policy was to show restraint during the siege. Read more: Philippine rebels agree to wealth-sharing deal . He confirmed that five hostages were released Tuesday in exchange for food and that the death toll had climbed from six to seven after one of the wounded died overnight. He said 36 people had been injured in the siege. Rebels, he said, had also fired on security forces and government aircraft with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. ""We continue to condemn these acts,"" Roxas said. Brig. Gen. Domingo Tutaan Jr., a military spokesman, said the military was doing everything it could to prevent the violence from spilling over to other parts of the country, PNA reported. He said government forces and the rebels had a sporadic firefight in the Barangay Santa Catalina area Wednesday afternoon. Tutaan also said two rebel fighters were killed and one injured after a reported firefight in Barangay Canelar, the news agency reported. Fire department authorities told reporters that firefighters had been fired on in Santa Barbara, an area in Zamboanga held by the rebels, but there were no reports of injuries. Zamboanga's mayor, Isabelle Climaco Salazar, said in a Facebook post that a curfew would be in place overnight and that public and private schools would remain closed Thursday. Only government offices providing front-line services will operate Thursday, she said. The mayor also urged citizens to report security concerns to authorities rather than posting them on social media ""to stop undue panic."" She said incidents involving the MNLF were occurring only in the Talon-Talon, Santa Barbara, Santa Catalina, Kasanyangan, Canela and Mampang areas. The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in this mainly Catholic country, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, though some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. Under the terms of the 1996 agreement, Misuari was named as governor of an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, or ARMM. He served until 2001. Last month, Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with an another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on the resource-rich island of Mindanao.

"(CNN) -- Marcel Kittel won the 10th stage of the Tour de France -- but it was Mark Cavendish who stole the headlines Tuesday. The Briton was forced to endure a nervous wait following the conclusion of the race with television pictures appearing to show him barging into Dutchman Tom Veelers during a sprint finish. The Manxman had looked to be in contention as the 197 kilometer stage between Saint Gildas des Bois and Saint Malo approached its climax before clashing with Veelers within sight of the finish line. The Argos rider suffered cuts and bruises but race jury president Vicente Tortajada Villaroya refused to blame Cavendish for the coming together. ""Veelers had done his job for Kittel, he was tired and he was looking down,"" the Spaniard told reporters. ""If we have to blame anyone, it is Veelers. There has been no complaint from Argos, but we were not considering sanctions or a disqualification."" Cavendish, who finished third following the incident, maintained his innocence after missing out on a 25th stage win. ""The commissaires are already putting the blame on me,"" he told reporters. ""You can see he (Veelers) moves a little bit right, I move a little bit left, it's not like I took his wheel, I'm following the road."" Cavendish also took to Twitter to defend his actions, tweeting: ""Just seen the sprint. I believe I didn't move line. I'm actually coming past Veelers and we touch elbows when he moves. Anyway, hope he's OK. ""There's no way I'd move on a rider deliberately, especially one not contesting a sprint. I hope Tom's OK."" Winner Kittel, who is the first man to win two stages during this edition of the Tour, escaped the crash as the sprinters went full pelt for the line. ""I'm really happy to have won but the victory is tempered a bit by the crash. I hope Tom isn't too injured,"" he told reporters. ""Apparently Cavendish bumped into Tom and he lost control of his handlebars and crashed. ""I cannot imagine that Cavendish did that on purpose, it just happens sometimes in a hectic finale. Every sprinter wants to come to the front when he comes to the line and I hope that he's OK. ""You can see that Cavendish really bumped into the handlebar of Tom but it doesn't look like he does it on purpose. Tom swings off to the right and Cavendish to the left - and it's just very unlucky at that moment."" Team Sky's Chris Froome maintained his one minute 25 second lead over nearest rival Alejandro Valverde. Froome was close to the crash towards the conclusion of the race but escaped with his lead intact. ""It was a bit tricky towards the end, but I always had a teammate with me and I kept out of trouble,"" he told reporters. ""It's always nervous when you come into the last 2 km with a bunch sprint coming off the final bend, but I was to one side of it and went around it without any problems.""","Germany's Marcel Kittel of Argos won the 10th stage of the Tour de France .

"(CNN) -- At least 13 people were killed in explosions and shootings in three of Iraq's most strategic cities on Monday, police officials said. The deadliest incident was in the southeastern part of Mosul, where a car bomb exploded by Iraqi army convoy. Five people were killed, including two Iraqi soldiers, in the neighborhood of al-Muharbeen. In the eastern part of Mosul, three people were shot dead by gunmen in two separate shootings. Mosul, which is in Nineveh province, has a largely Sunni population and is about 420 kilometers (about 261 miles) north of Baghdad. And in the capital of Baghdad, a man and his son were shot dead by gunmen in the al-Jaara neighborhood in the southern part of the city. In the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, gunmen attacked a group of men in a shooting area in al-Naser in eastern Kirkuk and killed three people. Four other people were wounded. Kirkuk is an ethnically mixed city of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen and is about 240 kilometers (about 149 miles) north of Baghdad. Casualties mount at alarming rate in Iraq . Monday's attacks come as Iraqi security forces are conducting a large-scale operation, ""The Revenge for the Martyrs,"" which is attempting to track down al Qaeda members in and around Baghdad. The operation started few days ago, and so far, hundreds of people have been arrested, according to the Baghdad Operation military command website. An al Qaeda group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks in July on two Iraqi prisons that a lawmaker said freed more than 500 inmates, including some senior members of the militant group. July was the deadliest month in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to figures released by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence in July.

"(CNN) -- An 8-year-old boy died when a trailer being pulled by his father ran over him during an Oklahoma Fourth of July parade, while a man driving a tractor died in a collision with a vintage fire truck in another parade nearly 2,000 miles northeast. The young boy either fell or jumped off the float late Thursday morning and was run over by the trailer carrying it, according to police in Edmond, which is about 15 miles north of Oklahoma City. The boy's father was in the truck that was towing the trailer, which was filled with hay and decorated by small patriotic garland along its edges. The float had a martial-arts theme, according to police spokeswoman Jennifer Monroe. The father rushed out of the vehicle, and he and a nurse who had been riding in a car behind the float performed CPR on the child, police said. Video from CNN affiliate KFOR later showed first responders along the road, which appeared to be bordered by trees, and moving a stretcher with the child into an awaiting ambulance. The boy was later pronounced dead at a hospital, Monroe said. ""Our thoughts today for the family of a 7 yr old boy killed in a float accident at the end of the LibertyFest parade,"" Edmond police said Thursday in a tweet. ""Heartbreaking."" Money magazine a few years ago listed Edmond, a city of about 81,000 people, as 35th on its list of America's best small cities. The annual LibertyFest festivities around Independence Day -- highlighted by the parade -- was singled out as a ""must-go event"" in the city, according to the publication, which like CNN is a division of Time Warner. The Edmond incident wasn't the only parade fatality this Independence Day. July 4 accidents . A man driving a green tractor in Bangor, Maine, died instantly Thursday afternoon after a vintage fire truck hit him from behind, police said in a statement. Both vehicles were part of the Bangor-Brewer July Fourth parade, which is the state's largest such parade with more than 1,000 participants and 30,000 spectators, according to Gov. Paul LePage. Police officers in the city's accident reconstruction team, evidence response team and criminal investigations division -- as well as the medical examiner's office and a Maine State Police member -- are assisting in the investigation, according to Bangor police. Police Sgt. Paul Edwards explained that the parade was rerouted because of a four-hour standoff in Bangor with a man who'd shot a gun, prompting a woman and her baby to run for help. ""They would not have been on that street normally,"" Edwards said of the people driving the tractor and fire truck. The suspect fired several rounds at police from a second-floor apartment window, with authorities responding with several rounds of their own and tear gas. The man -- identified by police as 43-year-old Perrin Oliver -- was taken into custody around 12:20 p.m. and charged with criminal threatening and aggravated reckless conduct with a firearm, both felonies. Edwards, the Bangor police spokesman, said he doubts Oliver will face additional charges tied to the tractor driver's death.

"(CNN) -- After part of an engine fell off a Qantas plane in mid-flight Thursday, a passenger shooting a personal video recorded the pilot announcing, calmly, that the flight was experiencing a ""technical issue."" ""I do apologize,"" the pilot begins. ""I'm sure you are aware we have a technical issue with our No. 2 engine. We have dealt with the situation. The aircraft is secure at this stage. We're going to have to hold for sometime whilst we do lighten our load by dumping some fuel."" The pilot then tells passengers on the Airbus A380 that there is a ""checklist we have to perform."" ""I'm sure you are aware we are not proceeding to Sydney at this stage,"" the pilot says. ""We're making a left turn now to track back towards Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you [informed] but at this stage everything is secure. [The] aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information. Thank you for your patience."" The video is shot facing out the passenger's window and focuses squarely, without panning, at the wing of the plane. Damage to the wing is visible in a video shot by a passenger. Volume is low, but it sounds as if conversation on the plane continued as normal, suggesting no one realized the gravity of what had happened. The cowling, or covering, on the engine reportedly fell off about 15 minutes into the flight. There were 440 passengers and 26 crew members aboard the flight which left Singapore bound for Sydney, Australia. The plane returned to Singapore. Everyone was safe. Passengers later described hearing alarming sounds while in the air. Meg Graham said she heard a loud bang within minutes of the plane departing. ""And then another bang,"" she said. Ulf Waschbusch said the crew kept passengers apprised of what was happening. ""We all stayed pretty calm,"" he said. ""It was an almost eerie calm."" CNN iReport: 'We saw the debris' Qantas, Australia's national airline, has grounded its Airbus A380 fleet. Flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation into Thursday's incident is complete, said airline CEO Alan Joyce. ""As long as it takes,"" Joyce said, responding to a reporter's question about how the suspension would last. ""We are being very cautious until we know exactly what caused this."" Qantas now has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver another 14, the airline said. One of the four engines on a Qantas airliner shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, Joyce said. Part of the engine's covering -- know as cowling -- tore off while the plane was above the western Indonesian island of Batam. ""I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground,"" Joyce said. ""We're still looking at what exactly was the cause of that."" Local television stations in Indonesia showed debris with red-white markings. A security officer at a Batam engineering firm said he heard a loud explosion and saw smoke coming out of the engine of a flying plane. The man's name is Trifuadi. (Many Indonesians go by only one name.) He said that debris fell from the plane. Airline investigators plan to work with the plane's manufacturer as well as Rolls-Royce, the maker of the engine. ""Safety is always our highest priority,"" a spokesman for Rolls-Royce told CNN. ""We are currently analyzing the available information and working with our customers to support their operations."" Singapore Airlines announced Thursday that it has temporarily halted flights of its 11 Airbus A380s to do precautionary checks in light of the Qantas incident. Lufthansa, which operates three Airbus A380s, said its operations currently are ""normal."" ""We are on standby to go further but no decisions have been taken.

"(CNN) -- One day before the election, tensions are running high and poll numbers are being crunched every few hours. Nowhere is this truer than in Ohio -- the pathway to victory. So there was a collective gasp Friday when a last-minute directive from Ohio's secretary of state, a Republican, threatened to invalidate a number of provisional ballots. When the fate of the nation could hinge on a handful of votes, arcane state rules and local politicians' motives take on a new urgency. Earlier last week the Obama campaign complained to Wisconsin's attorney general about what it said was ""willful misrepresentation"" by the Romney campaign in the materials used to train Election Day poll watchers. At issue was whether people in Wisconsin with felony convictions could vote. (They can, once they complete their sentences, but the Romney documents had said they can't.) Given that this fact can be Googled in less than 10 seconds, one must conclude the Romney campaign was either grossly ignorant of election law or intentionally deceiving volunteers in an effort to swing the vote. Opinion: Vote, damn it! This election year is the culmination of years of Republican efforts to foment confusion and fear to keep certain Americans from voting. That is a subplot of this election, but one that will have massive consequences. In close and bitterly fought elections, there's far more at stake than who occupies the White House: Americans' belief in the integrity of our democracy hangs in the balance. These efforts are pernicious, pervasive and professionalized. In a recent New Yorker article, Jane Mayer profiled Hans von Spakowsky, a legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has been hyping the myth of voter impersonation fraud since 1998, despite mountains of evidence refuting his claim. (The Brennan Center for Justice has concluded that many more people are struck by lightning than commit in-person voter fraud.) Rep. John Lewis -- a civil rights hero who bled to get all Americans the right to vote -- describes von Spakowsky as waking up every morning thinking ""What can I do today to make it more difficult for people to vote?"" Spakowsky is a close adviser to True the Vote, a Houston-based organization funded by wealthy conservative donors that has led challenges against the registration of minority voters across the country. Because of these challenges, thousands of Americans who have voted reliably in the same place every year have had to attend formal hearings to defend their registrations or be disqualified from voting. The group has been so aggressive and so inaccurate in its work that Rep. Elijah Cummings has said it could ""amount to a criminal conspiracy to deny legitimate voters their constitutional rights."" The backbone of the voter suppression movement has been the national push to institute a labyrinth of voter identification laws. Thirty-three states have passed such laws since 2009. Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012 . The result has been confusion and sloppy implementation as overburdened poll volunteers have had to memorize constantly changing regulations. Meanwhile, millions of Americans, including tens of thousands of seniors, will be disenfranchised because they don't have the required ID or they are simply confused by the laws. While advocates claim they are just trying ensure a fair vote, Pennsylvania's Republican House Majority Leader Mike Turzai infamously spilled the beans in June when he claimed the state's new voter ID law would deliver the state to Mitt Romney. Recent news reports suggest that if there is an actual attempt at systemic voter fraud, it's coming from GOP-affiliated groups. Meet Nathan Sproul: a longtime Republican operative paid $3 million by the Republican Party to register voters in five states this cycle. Evidence suggests Sproul's company, Strategic Allied Consulting, has been systematically encouraging falsifying signatures and having workers lie to voters. The GOP severed ties with Sproul's group when these allegations became public, but his relationships with the party and affiliated groups date back to 2004, and the allegations against him date back almost as long. A Google search turns this information up in a couple of seconds. Some American values do trump election victories if the choice between the two is laid bare. The American Legislative Exchange Council, the driver for much of the voter ID legislation, has faced a revolt of its corporate members as citizen consumers have expressed their outrage: Thirty-seven companies have left ALEC, including such high-profile names as Sprint, Nextel, and Entergy. Clear Channel has been forced to take down billboards making vague threats of legal action against voters in low-income and minority neighborhoods after a campaign by civil rights group Color of Change. And courts in Pennsylvania ruled that a new voter ID law cannot be enforced in this election after hearing from plaintiffs like 92-year old Vivian Applewhite, who showed she would be disenfranchised since she has no birth certificate. Regardless of who wins, if the election proves as close as it appears, it's likely that the demand for recounts and accusations on both sides will fly fast and furious. But this erosion of Americans' rights requires a clear and comprehensive solution -- universal legislation that makes it easier to vote for all Americans regardless of their circumstances. Our democracy depends on it.

"(CNN) -- For one weekend in September more than 155 million people in six neighboring countries in one continent pull out all the stops to honor the birth of their nations. Five Central American countries -- Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica -- kick off their Independence Day celebrations on September 15, the date when, in 1821, they declared independence from Spain, while the following day Mexico holds its own independence celebrations. We asked people from each country to send in their best images from past and present Independence Day celebrations. From masked revelers in Guatemala to elaborately costumed dance troupes in Honduras, we received stunning images from nations proud to celebrate their beginnings. More Celebrates: The world's best firework displays . Like the best birthday celebrations, the events are marked with glorious parades, street parties, festivals and family gatherings. TV producer Brad Cordeiro was in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua, when he captured stunning images of young women in beautiful flowing blue dresses performing in a parade held for the country's Independence Day. ""The feel of the parade was of a lot of proud parents watching their kids participate,"" he said. ""The celebration was a week long, and as San Juan del Sur is a resort town people from all over the country came to town, it felt like the whole country was there,"" he said. Sometimes the celebrations can provide the most eye-opening of visuals. In Guatemala City, anthropologist Lucas de Soto captured this image of a rather motley crew of soldiers, worker and, yes, a man dressed in a bird suit during the country's celebrations in 2011.

"Santa Fe, New Mexico (CNN) -- New Mexico -- one of three states that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses -- is debating whether to change the practice. The state's lawmakers were scheduled to take up the issue in a special session on Tuesday. However, there are nearly a dozen other issues they must address by the end of the session, which could last up to 30 days. The session was originally scheduled to focus on redistricting for statewide elections, but the governor put the driver's license issue on the docket. Republican Susana Martinez, the nation's first Latina governor, campaigned on a promise to stop undocumented immigrants from getting licenses. The state's House in March passed a measure to start requiring license applicants to have Social Security cards, which are available only to legal residents. The Senate has rejected House Bill 78, however. A push is underway to swing the vote in the Senate, with Martinez leading the effort. Immigrant-rights advocates defend the current practice. It was intended to offer undocumented immigrants ""the opportunity to buy insurance, register their vehicles and have a driving record available to all law enforcement,"" said Marcela Diaz of Somos Un Pueblo Unido (We Are a United People). But critics say the practice is turning New Mexico into a magnet for fraud. ""Currently, illegal immigrants from all over the country come to New Mexico to obtain a license without having the intention of staying here,"" said Demesia Padilla, the state's secretary of taxation and revenue. Some scofflaws sell their residency information. One woman, Rosa Pardo-Marrufo, confessed to allowing her address to be used -- charging up to $700 for each application. She was arrested in 2009 and is serving 10 years in prison for fraud. The state Taxation and Revenue Department has pushed a ""residency certification program."" Aiming to expose residency fraud, officials began sending letters in July to 10,000 of the more than 84,000 immigrants who have been issued a license without a Social Security number. They've been asked to prove their state residency or lose their licenses. On Thursday, a New Mexico district judge placed a temporary restraining order on residency certification, in response to a lawsuit against the Taxation and Revenue Department by the Mexican American Legal and Educational Defense Fund (MALDEF). A hearing on September 13 will determine whether Judge Sarah Singleton's restraining order will become permanent. Utah and Washington are the only other states that grant undocumented immigrants driver's licenses.

The 27-year-old midfielder is currently on international duty ahead of Brazil's World Cup qualifier against Paraguay on Wednesday but was released for the medical tests in the north-eastern city of Recife. International duty means the official unveiling of the player in the Spanish capital will more then likely not occur until the end of the month, after Kaka returns from helping Brazil defend the Confederations Cup in South Africa. Kaka is set to become the first of the new wave of ""galacticos"" brought together under the leadership of returning club president Florentino Perez. Milan president Silvio Berlusconi had told Kaka that he had to decide on his future on Monday. The Serie A club's owner revealed on Italian television station Rai, he would meet with the Brazil playmaker at the start of next week to thrash out Kaka's future. Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani said last week that the club had agreed to sell the 27-year-old Kaka for ""solely economic"" reasons. ""Milan can not go on losing $100 million a year,"" he told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport on Thursday . ""Kaka has behaved very professionally with us, he has never asked for his deal to be revised or his contract extended. He has been here six years and won everything there is to win. But we can't afford to miss out on $100 million.""

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Chantal was headed for the islands of the eastern Caribbean Sea on Monday, prompting storm warnings from Puerto Rico to Barbados. The storm was well out in the Atlantic Ocean on Monday night, but it was moving swiftly over the open water and was expected to cross into the Caribbean early Tuesday, U.S. forecasters reported. Projections from the National Hurricane Center in Miami show Chantal is not expected to reach hurricane strength. But forecasters reported the storm would cross the Lesser Antilles, may skirt Puerto Rico and sweep across the Dominican Republic, Haiti and eastern Cuba on Wednesday and Thursday. At 8 p.m. ET, Chantal was centered about 320 miles (515 kilometers) east-southeast of Barbados, moving to the west-northwest at 26 mph. Its top winds had strengthened to 50 mph, and the storm could strengthen more in the next two days. Tropical storm-force winds of 39 mph or higher extended more than 90 miles from the eye, mainly to the north, the hurricane center reported. Tropical storm warnings were in place for Barbados, Dominica, St. Lucia, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico, while tropical storm watches were posted for the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Vincent, the southern coast of the Dominican Republic and the islands of Vieques and Culebra, off Puerto Rico. Track the storm with CNN's hurricane tracker . Chantal is expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain over the Leeward and Windward Islands, with up to 6 inches possible in some areas.

""I feel very honored to have been asked to sign for Rovers and being able to help both the club and the amazing charity Bluebell Wood is what it's all about.""

As a child, Tomlinson used to attend games both as a fan and as a ball boy but his heavy work schedule means he will face a real challenge to be available for a cameo appearance. He will miss Doncaster's first game of the season against Blackpool on Saturday with One Direction set to perform in Las Vegas before the group move onto California. Tomlinson will then be touring Australia and New Zealand in September and October with the band appearing in Adelaide, Perth and Melbourne before moving onto Christchurch and Auckland. But that has not deterred Rovers, with the club fully aware of Tomlinson's ability to lure in new fans. ""Louis has always been passionate about football and wanted to realize a dream of signing to his home town club where he once worked on match days,"" said a statement on the club's official website. ""After discussions between Louis, Paul Dickov and media manager Steve Uttley, it was decided that the club could sign him and issue him with a squad number for the 2013/2014 season. ""As part of the signing it is hoped that Louis will be able to appear in Rovers colors at some point this season in aid of Bluebell Wood and train with the lads. ""Chairman John Ryan and the manager Paul Dickov have given Louis the number 28 shirt for this season to help him raise money for Bluebell Wood.""","One Direction star Louis Tomlinson has signed a deal with Doncaster Rovers .

"(CNN) -- There comes a time during pregnancy, after finally choosing the perfect pastel for the baby's room, installing that complicated car seat and sorting through all the new bibs and onesies, when it's high time to think less about Pampers and more about being pampered. Or perhaps you just want to visit London to celebrate the upcoming birth of royalty (the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William are expecting their bundle of joy any day now). Either way, we've got you covered. Here are nine spots in the British capital that will have you living it up like a royal in no time: . Bask in luxury: Draycott Hotel . Check-in at this five-star hotel begins with sparkling cider for mommy-to-be and some bubbly for the frazzled dad-to-be, not to mention a bouquet of roses. Settle into your room before heading to your prenatal massage, included in the Royal Babymoon package. Don't worry: The Draycott has thought of everything, including a cuddly teddy bear for the newborn, extra pillows and parenting magazines. Don't forget to sip some tea at 4 p.m. (it's on the house), traipse through the private garden and settle down for hot chocolate and homemade biscuits (also on the house) at 9:30 p.m. Ice cream cravings? They've got that covered, too, with nightly room delivery of strawberry, chocolate or vanilla. 26 Cadogan Gardens, London . Act like royalty: The Goring . The Goring is most famous for the fact that Kate stayed there her last night as a single lady before the royal wedding. It was also the venue for the reception after-party. The Goring has welcomed Royals since 1910. Even the queen of England holds her annual summer garden party there. And why not? This hotel is said to have the largest private garden in London. With the stamp of approval from Kate and company (aka a royal warrant from the queen herself), you can rest assured you will feel perfectly regal, too. The Goring, Beeston Place, London . Indulge in some retail therapy: St. Martin's Courtyard . There's nothing like having a personal stylist dress you to the nines, especially when she takes you on a sartorial tour through the heart of Covent Garden, one of London's most fashionable neighborhoods. Book a half day with Eliisa Makin, the wardrobe consultant at St. Martin's Courtyard, to find all the trappings of a great wardrobe, including L.K. Bennett and Barbour, two labels Kate has been seen wearing. (Note: Ask Makin to take you to King's Road, too. Perhaps you'll land yourself a Kate sighting.) Makin, a stylist and fashion editor, will take you to lunch to discuss the looks you are after and then dress you from head to toe in the season's trends. There's plenty of ground to cover with a mix of fashion, beauty and lifestyle boutiques, including Sienna Miller's label Twenty8Twelve, Jaeger London and Cos. Slingsby Place, London . Breathe in, breathe out: Tri-Yoga . Bring on the harmony with a visit to this popular yoga studio with various locations throughout London. Besides offering a slew of classes (vinyasa, ashtanga and aerial yoga), there are treatments that will further put any expecting couple at ease. Ladies can opt for pregnancy craniosacral therapy, reflexology or acupuncture; gentlemen will dig the sports massage or the Thai foot massage. And if you're up for some extra credit, the studio also runs workshops for couples who are expecting, including topics such as hypnobreathing, emotional detox and postnatal restorative techniques. After working up an appetite, stop by the on-site cafe for raw carrot cake bites, filling salads, smoothies and juices. There's even a pregnancy drink (packed with apple, pear, kiwi and spinach) said to give mother and baby an extra wallop of nutrients. Picnic in the park: Hyde Park . What once was a place for King Henry VIII and his court to hunt deer and wild boar in the 16th century is now a refuge for tai chi, swimming and kicking back. Stake out a shady spot among the 350 sprawling acres and wind down with a picnic. This gorgeous expanse is a prime spot for people-watching and a delightful place for an impromptu photo shoot. The picture-perfect backdrops include hyper-manicured gardens, Queen Elizabeth Gate and Serpentine Lake. After whiling away the morning, consider heading to the south side to spot the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, who reside at the Hyde Park Barracks. (Note: check website for times.) Rent a yacht: Linton Motor Yacht Charters . When it comes to spoiling yourself silly, lounging around on a private yacht is a surefire way to feel like a VIP. Aboard the Princess V48 motor yacht, appropriately named the Happy Bunny, you can easily spot the famous landmarks in style without ever mingling with the masses. Opt to cruise to Alderney if you have a few days. It's often described as the most British of the Channel Islands. Here, you can hop out and walk among the puffins, rabbits and, if you're lucky, the elusive blonde hedgehogs. Short on time? Choose a day trip down the River Thames instead. The crew will even take you on a small, high-speed boat for water skiing and wakeboarding lessons. You'll have alfresco BBQ by day and fancy dinners by night. For an extra special touch, arrange the services of a Michelin-trained chef to prepare your meals. Get schooled in chocolate: Melange Chocolate Shop & Cafe . If you have a passion for high-quality chocolates and dream of playing the part of Willy Wonka, the chocolatiers at Melange can help. At this whimsical store, try your hand at creating sweet treats through chocolate-making classes and even chocolate painting. Start by a sampling cocoa beans and a selection of chocolate bars. Then, learn the art of truffle making by flavoring and shaping different types of delectable fillings. If that's not your cup of tea, then opt for chocolate painting, where guests whip up delicious pieces of edible art. If you visit in October, be sure to check out Chocolate Week, a festival where the capital's best chocolatiers offer up to-die-for desserts. 184 Bellenden Road, London . Sip on afternoon tea: The Cadogan Hotel . The perfect way to unwind in London is, of course, to sip tea in the afternoon. The Cadogan has been serving afternoon tea since 1887, so, by now, they have perfected it. Relax among the original artworks, stained glass windows and oversized mirrors while nibbling on finger sandwiches, home baked scones, Chelsea buns and a variety of Partridges teas, supplied by the queen's grocer, Partridges of Chelsea. You'll be feeling positively British and blissfully stress-free in no time. 5 Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, London . Stop and smell the roses: Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew . The Royal Botanic Gardens are, hands-down, among London's most beautiful and serene places. So it's no surprise the gardens were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003. This 750-acre botanical garden is a maze bursting with color and unusual greenery. It's also the ideal spot for some serious tranquility. Take a tour of Kew's Palm House, considered one of the most important surviving Victorian iron and glass structures in the world, or visit the treetop walkway, which takes you under the ground and then up 59 feet in the air to see the mammoth oaks from a different angle. Afterward, get a feel for royal living by peeking into Queen Charlotte's Cottage, an 18th-century thatched cottage that was a private haven for Queen Charlotte and her family in the 18th century.

"(CNN) -- Imprisoned former Peruvian leader Alberto Fujimori won't receive a pardon because the nation's president determined that he does not have a terminal illness, officials said Friday. President Ollanta Humala made the decision for that reason and the fact that one of the charges Fujimori, 74, was convicted of cannot be pardoned, the country's justice minister announced. In October, family members requested a humanitarian pardon for Fujimori, saying he should be released from prison because of health problems. He is serving four concurrent sentences, the longest of which is 25 years, for corruption and human rights abuses. Fujimori underwent surgery September 19 for a recurring lesion in his tongue and returned to the clinic nine days later because of problems with scarring of the wound, the state-run Andina news agency reported at the time. 2011: Longtime Peruvian fugitive turns himself in . Family members say the ex-president, who has suffered from mouth cancer, will die if he remains a prisoner. Human rights activists have said that granting a pardon to the former strongman would be an insult to victims of his regime, Andina reported. 2009: Ex-Peruvian president sentenced for giving spy chief $15 million . Fujimori is a polarizing figure in Peru, the country he led from 1990 to 2000. His strong hand is credited with defeating the Shining Path terrorists who destabilized the country, and his austere economic policies reined in hyperinflation. But stability had a cost, which in his case was an authoritarian streak that included the killing of civilians. After winning a third term whose constitutionality was challenged, he was finally brought down by an Andean-sized corruption scandal. In 2009, a special supreme court tribunal sentenced the former president to 25 years in prison for authorizing the operation of a death squad responsible for killing civilians. In separate trials, Fujimori was found guilty of breaking into the home of a former spy chief to steal incriminating videos, taking money from the government treasury to pay the spy chief, authorizing illegal wiretaps and bribing congressmen and journalists. 2009: Former Peruvian president sentenced to fourth prison term .","Family members argued Alberto Fujimori should be released for medical reasons .

"Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A string of bombs struck churches in five Nigerian cities Sunday, leaving dozens dead and wounded on the holiday, authorities and witnesses said. The blasts mark the second holiday season that bombs have hit Christian houses of worship in the west African nation. In a statement issued late Sunday, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan called the bombings ""a dastardly act that must attract the rebuke of all peace-loving Nigerians."" ""These acts of violence against innocent citizens are an unwarranted affront on our collective safety and freedom,"" Jonathan said. ""Nigerians must stand as one to condemn them."" Bombs targeted churches across the country, hitting the cities of Madalla, Jos, Kano, and Damaturu and Gadaka, said journalist Hassan John, who witnessed the carnage in Jos. The death toll in Madalla alone was 18, including two people reported dead overnight at a nearby hospital, Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency spokesman Yushau Shuaib told CNN. John said witnesses in Madalla reported a higher death toll, with more than 30 killed. Some victims died after being taken to a hospital, he said. In Damaturu, a northern town in Yobe state, a police station and a state security building were also bombed, an aid worker said. The worker asked not to be named for security reasons. Nwakpa Okorie, a spokesman for the Nigerian Red Cross, said the some of the wounded were taken to the capital Abuja for treatment. ""The situation is under control now. The security agents have secured the streets close to the bombed areas ... in Madalla, Jos and Dematuru,"" he said. Jonathan said his government ""will not relent in its determination to bring to justice all the perpetrators of today's acts of violence and all others before now."" And in Washington, the White House said U.S. officials would help Nigeria pursue those behind ""what initially appear to be terrorist acts."" ""We condemn this senseless violence and tragic loss of life on Christmas Day,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a written statement. ""We offer our sincere condolences to the Nigerian people and especially those who lost family and loved ones."" The first explosion Sunday struck near a Roman Catholic church in Madalla, west of Abuja, Nigeria's capital, the National Emergency Management Agency said. Church officials were trying to get a picture of what happened in the city. ""Lives have been lost but we do not have the details,"" said the Rev. Michael Ekpenyong. ""The area has been cordoned off. I tried to call the priest, but I couldn't get through."" Ekpenyong, the secretary general of the country's Catholic Secretariat, said the church that was bombed was ""not a big church, but lots of people attend."" Photos from the scene showed burned-out cars and at least three bodies on the ground, one covered with a blanket, at the rural church. Usman Abdallah Baba, who witnessed the bombing, said there were at least 15 or 16 casualties and that authorities were still counting the toll. Baba said local people were already blaming the violent extremist Muslim Boko Haram sect, which has targeted Christians as well as Muslims its members consider insufficiently Islamic. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the acts ""in the strongest terms,"" his office said in a statement Sunday. He expressed his condolences to the Nigerian people and reiterated a call ""for an end to all acts of sectarian violence in the country."" In 2010, five churches in Jos were attacked while residents were celebrating Christmas Eve. The blasts killed dozens in Jos, which lies on a faith-based fault line between the Muslim-dominated north and the mainly Christian south. On Sunday, two blasts targeted the Mountain of Fire Ministries church in Jos, northeast of the capital, said John. No one was killed in that bombing, which John called a ""miracle"" -- but a police officer who got into a gun battle with the attackers died of his wounds later, John said, citing officials. The second church, in Jos, was hit by two explosions when young men threw bombs, John said. Police responded quickly and exchanged gunfire with the attackers, who wounded at least one of the police officers, he said. The injured officer was rushed to the Jos University teaching hospital for medical attention, but died of his wounds, John said. The attackers fled into the crowd and disappeared after the attack, John said. Police arrested four people and recovered four unexploded devices, Nigerian state television reported. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and has the world's sixth-largest Christian population -- about 80.5 million people as of 2010, according to a report published this month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington. That makes the country just over 50% Christian, according to the Pew figures. Dozens killed in fighting in Nigeria . The latest attacks follow two days of clashes between militants and security forces in northern Nigeria. Lt. Gen. Azubuike Ihejirika, the Nigerian army chief of staff, said the clashes left three soldiers dead and several more wounded. The fighting began Thursday between Boko Haram militants and the military in the Yobe state town of Damaturu, Ihejirika said. ""There was a major encounter with the Boko Haram in Damaturu,"" Ihejirika said Friday. ""We lost three of our soldiers, seven were wounded. But we killed over 50 of their members."" Boko Haram translates from the local Hausa as ""Western education is outlawed."" The group has morphed into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the last two years. Boko Haram's targets include police outposts and churches as well as places associated with ""Western influence."" CNN's Josh Levs, Richard Allen Greene, Esprit Smith, Karen Smith, Amir Ahmed and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.N. condemns the attacks and calls for an end to sectarian violence in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Ramiz Rafizadeh was driving past Syria's famous Ummayad Mosque in December when another vehicle abruptly cut him off. Two men got out and shot Rafizadeh to death in front of his deaf daughter, whom he had just picked up from her school in Damascus. ""People who live in the neighborhood and witnessed the shooting talked to my mother and sister and said that the shooters were sitting in the car, waiting,"" said Rafizadeh's cousin Masoud. ""The car was carrying pro-Assad slogans, similar to the cars used by Syrian intelligence."" Rafizadeh's family wondered whether he was targeted because another cousin, Majid, is a U.S.-based Middle East scholar who has spoken out against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But that's not the only possibility. 5 reasons Syria's war suddenly looks more dangerous . ""Even though the neighbors said the gunmen were pro-Assad, the government told us terrorists killed him,"" Masoud Rafizadeh said. And that says much about the plight of Syria's Shiite community: a minority with many enemies, including an increasingly radicalized opposition that views them as outsiders and traitors and a desperate regime that questions their loyalty. The Alawite minority that dominates the Assad regime is an offshoot of Shiite Islam, but few Syrian Shiites are among its inner circle. ""The minorities in Damascus, they are completely quiet; they don't want to side with any group. The minorities want nothing but to go to their place of worship and practice their faith."" Majid Rafizadeh tells CNN. The Syrian government views minorities, including Shiites, Christians and Kurds, as a buffer against the rebels, who in turn have tried to recruit from among these groups. But many within the rebels' ranks are wary of the Shiites, suspecting some may have links to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, whose fighters have begun appearing in Syria on the government's side. ""(Shiites) end up being victims of a proxy war between rebels and the regime and are viewed with suspicion on both sides,"" said Abbas Barzegar, a professor of Islamic studies at Georgia State University. Barzegar says the Syrian revolution descended into civil war because of the sectarian nature of the opposition's rhetoric and its inability to control its sectarian tendencies. ""The religious diversity of Syria was once a point of pride, so the destruction of this ideal has been catastrophic,"" he said. The Rafizadeh family's tale of horrors includes a niece and a nephew wounded in a car bomb blast, relatives turned refugees, assassinated cousins, kidnapped uncles and a family trapped by fear. ""As my uncle left a funeral of a family who lost a teenage son, armed men took him and his sons by force from their car. My cousin who tried to resist was punched,"" Masoud says. Moyassar Saadi and his two adult sons were released after spending weeks as hostages of armed men claiming to be Free Syrian Army rebels. The family, however, believes the kidnappers were actually government forces posing as rebels in a bid to threaten Majid, the U.S.-based critic of the regime. Two days after his release, the 65-year-old father of four died of a heart attack. And it didn't end there. Kerry announces more aid to Syria . ""On the New Years Eve of 2013, our cousin Issam was killed. He was heading back home with groceries where he lived in Sidi Miqdad in Damascus suburbs when armed men approached and shot him dead."" Masoud says. ""The government told us that the terrorist killed Issam, and those terrorists want to kill all Syrians. Issam was not a member of the public committees or pro-government militias, he was as innocent as Hamza al-Khateeb,"" Masoud says referring to the fatal torture and mutilation of a 13-year-old boy allegedly by Syrian intelligence during the outset of the uprising. The atmosphere of chaos means many minorities simply cannot know who or what group has attacked their loved ones and why. ""You know, here in the U.S., we may ask, well, who did this? But for the families in Syria, it does not matter anymore. All they do is try and follow the kidnappers demands so they can get their relative back."" Majid says. More than 1 million Syrians are now registered refugees in neighboring countries. The Rafizadeh family longs to flee the violence but remains trapped in a capital under siege. ""I'm worried that the next target will be my mother or my sisters or my brother. I tried to get them out to Lebanon, but my mother is very sick and old; she can't walk."" Majid says. ""I try to call my family every two days to make sure everything is OK. But when I call, and they don't answer, I think someone has broken into the house and taken them or something."" he adds. Majid and Masoud are Syrian Shiites of Iranian origin. Their family comes from a lower-class neighborhood in the Old City of Damascus. ""In the Old City, we were close to different religions. We had Christians, Jewish, Sunni, Shiite. Growing up there it was more like a communal and collective society. People were always visiting each other, so there were strong ties between the families."" Majid says. The brothers and their two sisters grew up in poverty during the secular regime of Hafez al-Assad. Members of his minority Alawite group were given top government and military positions, but Assad cultivated other minorities as a counterweight to the Sunni majority. Dissent of any sort was not tolerated. While Hafez al-Assad ruled Syria, the Rafizadeh brothers' father was detained and tortured by Syrian security forces for his involvement in a human rights campaign. Majid eventually escaped the crushing poverty and oppression, receiving a Fulbright teaching scholarship in the United States. Masoud remained in Damascus, quitting school by second grade to support his family by selling memorabilia and tea to tourists. When Hafez al-Assad's British-educated son Bashar succeeded him in 2000, Syrians hoped for political and economic reforms. They never materialized, and in March 2011 came the first protests against the regime. Six months later, a radical Sunni preacher issued dire threats against minority groups that did not support the uprising. ""By Allah we will chop up their flesh and feed them to the dogs,"" Adnan al-Arour said in one of his inflammatory broadcasts on satellite station al-Wesal. As the civil war enters its third year, it is no longer a simple case of regime against rebels. There are overlapping and intersecting loyalties, foreign fighters and criminals taking advantage of chaos. ""Mounting tensions have led to armed clashes between different armed groups along a sectarian divide. Such incidents took place in mixed communities or where armed groups had attempted to take hold of areas predominantly inhabited by pro-Government minority communities."" a recent U.N. report concluded. ""The people are being very cautious of all different groups. They are afraid of all groups. They are afraid of any group outside their home."" Majid says. ""The minorities are scared because there are a lot of rumors that there are some extremist radical Sunni groups. They believe that they have distributed fliers saying if you kill one person from a minority, we will pay 100,000 Lira, and there are videos where they mutilate the person."" ""The general view is very pessimistic for the minorities; the ones who can are leaving. They are immigrating to European countries. What they hope is that the opposition and Assad can reach an agreement. They don't care about the political structure. They just want the violence to stop,"" Majid adds. But there is every sign that the violence is becoming more sectarian and even more vicious. Earlier this year, fighters from the Sunni jihadist group Nusra Front, designated a terrorist organization by the United States sang ""Just wait Allawi. We will come to slaughter you. Forget about any agreement ... We will come to slaughter you, Shiite."" The Rafizadeh family clings to the hope that a political solution can be found. ""I believe that most of the Syrians do not want to see violence in their homeland, and they want the safety and security to be back like it used to be. I don't get involved in politics and I don't want to. I want a normal life in Syria, and just want to live in peace,"" Masoud says.","Shiite family in Syria has endured attacks from all sides in civil war .
One cousin was shot dead in front of his daughter; others held hostage .
It's unclear whether attackers were with the Assad regime or the rebels .
Neither the government nor the rebels trust Shiites in Syria ."
"(CNN) -- An official tally of Mexico's presidential election returns -- including individual recounts for more than half the ballots -- confirmed Enrique Peña Nieto as the winner of the election. But until the country's electoral tribunal ratifies the results -- and challenges are virtually assured -- Peña Nieto remains the presumptive president-elect. According to the website of the Federal Electoral Institute, with 100% of the totals counted, Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had 38.21% of vote, while leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador finished with 31.59% and conservative candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota had 25.41%. The official tally included individual ballot recounts in 54.5% of the country's electoral districts. Lopez Obrador has vowed to challenge the results, accusing the PRI of vote-buying, and said that he would take his complaints through the legal system. He did not immediately comment following the announcement of the official count. Amanpour: Can Nieto save Mexico? For his part, Peña Nieto told CNN that ""I am president by the majority decision of the Mexicans."" If Lopez Obrador, who was the candidate for a leftist coalition, continues his challenge, the process could stretch out for months. The federal electoral tribunal, known as TRIFE, will begin on Monday to accept complaints of voting irregularities. The tribunal will have until September 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the official election results. The new president will be sworn in on December 1. In the 2006 presidential vote, election authorities said Lopez Obrador narrowly lost to Felipe Calderon. The former Mexico City mayor claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" Lopez Obrador's supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. Officials have called this election the most transparent in Mexico's history. It was the first election in which scanned copies of district-by-district election returns were posted on the Internet. But accusations have arisen of electoral manipulation by the PRI. The party, which was in power for 71 years before being voted out in 2000, was known for being corrupt and authoritarian. Its apparent victory last weekend would mark a triumphant return after 12 years of rule by the right-wing National Action Party, known by the acronym PAN. Opponents of the PRI said they have video and photo evidence of the party buying votes through thousands of cards that could be redeemed for products at a chain of supermarkets. An anti-Peña Nieto youth movement said it received 1,100 complaints of irregularities. And the group Civic Alliance found in a survey it conducted that 30% of voters reported witnessing at least one type of irregularity. Mexican election regulators said they are investigating the allegations related to the gift cards.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Blood and body parts littered the ground outside Turkey's embassy in Somalia on Saturday afternoon, the grisly result of a blast that police said left six dead and nine wounded. A minivan packed with explosives went off around 5 p.m. in the heart of Mogadishu, just a few meters from the Turkish diplomatic post, said police Col. Ahmed Mohamud. When it was over, two Somali security guards, a university student and three attackers were dead, according to Mohamud. Turkish embassy sources said that two of its staff members were among the wounded. Somali police and Turkish embassy guards, meanwhile, converged on the scene. Mangled buses and cars ended up in a disfigured heap, while the windows of numerous nearby apartments were shattered. Al-Shabaab -- a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda -- claimed responsibility for the attack. ""We are behind the martyrdom explosion,"" the group claimed via Twitter. ""The Turkish were our main target."" The U.S. government reacted Saturday to ""the terrorist attack"" by pledging its solidarity with Turkey, ""the people of Somalia ... and all members of the international community who are working for peace and stability in Somalia."" ""This cowardly act will not shake our commitment to continue working for the brighter, more democratic and prosperous future the people of Somalia deserve,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud similarly blasted what he called ""an act of cowardly desperation by terrorists"" against one of his nation's ""most determined and dependable allies."" He lauded Turks' ""tireless efforts"" over the past two years to help build new schools and hospitals, among other contributions. ""I condemn this criminal act of terrorism and my government and security forces will do everything it can to catch those who planned and directed it,"" Hassan said. ""We must continue to stand firm against those who seek to destroy this country and, with the brave support of our allies, we must double our efforts to deliver the peaceful future the Somali people so desperately want."" Saturday's bombing was the second major attack in Mogadishu in a few days: On Wednesday, at least one person died in the capital after a bomb hidden in a lawmaker's car blew up. The targeted member of Parliament, Sheikh Adan Mader, and other lawmakers were out of the car when the blast occurred and were unharmed, police said. Designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in 2008, al-Shabaab has waged a war with Somali's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law in the country. Its forces were pushed out of Mogadishu in summer 2011 by Somali and other African forces, raising hopes of a return to relative security in a city after about 20 years of violence. But the militants have persisted by maintaining control of large rural areas of southern and central Somalia and staging guerrilla-style attacks. In one such attack that al-Shabaab took credit for, in June, at least 14 people died and 15 were wounded in an attack on U.N. headquarters in Mogadishu. In addition to its volatile security situation, Somalia has been plagued by famine. A May report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network, found that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012. Half of the famine victims were children younger than 5. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Somalia, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","NEW: Somali president decries what he calls an ""act of cowardly desperation""

"(CNN) -- Former U.S. Sen. and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum has a well-known Google problem. For the uninitiated, if you Google Santorum's name, the first result you'll probably get is not his personal website but a fake definition of ""santorum,"" a sexual byproduct that's a bit too graphic to talk about in detail here. (Of course, you can Google him and easily find out.) We'll get into how that all happened in a second, but here's what's new: On Tuesday, the socially conservative politician lashed out at Google, saying the company could get rid of the sexual references to his name on the search results if it wanted to -- and perhaps would do so if he were a Democrat. ""I suspect if something was up there like that about Joe Biden, they'd get rid of it,"" he told Politico. ""If you're a responsible business, you don't let things like that happen in your business that have an impact on the country."" He continued: ""To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle, but I suspect that's not true."" Santorum contacted Google and asked the company about the issue, Politico said. In an e-mail to CNN, a Google spokeswoman said, ""Google's search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the Web. Users who want content removed from the Internet should contact the webmaster of the page directly. Once the webmaster takes the page down from the Web, it will be removed from Google's search results through our usual crawling process."" She added: ""We do not remove content from our search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines."" Santorum is just the latest to gripe at Google over how it ranks search results. The CEO of Yelp posted a blog Tuesday saying that Google purposefully ranks its own products -- like Google Places -- above its competitors. ""We believe Google has acted anti-competitively in at least two key ways: by misusing Yelp review content in their competing Places product and by favoring their own competing Places product in search results,"" Yelp's Jeremy Stoppelman wrote. Google CEO Eric Schmidt was scheduled to testify before Congress on Wednesday about similar antitrust complaints. The lewd ""santorum"" definition popped up after the former senator compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality in a 2003 interview with The Associated Press: . ""In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality,"" he said. ""That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be."" That angered gay rights supporters, including gay podcast host and sex columnist Dan Savage, who launched a campaign for his listeners to redefine Santorum's name. Savage created a website to promote the winning definition (again, you'll have to search for that elsewhere), and enough bloggers linked to it that the spoof site eventually eclipsed Santorum's campaign website in search rankings. Danny Sullivan, who writes at the blog SearchEngineLand, notes that Google has a history of being hands-off when it comes to these controversies, regardless of the politics or sensitivities involved: . ""Google is loathe to touch its results in any way, shape or form. That's because if it does intervene in any way, there's some interest group that will immediately claim a bias. Way back in 2004, an anti-Jewish web site started ranking in Google's top results for 'Jew.' ""Despite Google co-founder Sergey Brin being Jewish and himself disgusted with the result, it stood. Intervention, when Google's ranking algorithms had spoken, was seen as harmful to user trust,"" Sullivan writes. In December 2009, when racist images of first lady Michelle Obama popped to the top of Google search results, the company took a similar free-speech stance. ""We have a bias toward free expression,"" Google spokesman Scott Rubin said at the time. ""That means that some ugly things will show up."" Still, Google has removed offensive content from searches, usually by making changes to how its overall search equations function. In 2007, for example, a change to Google's search algorithm stopped the search term ""miserable failure"" from directing Internet users to pages about former president George W. Bush, according to SearchEngineLand. It's worth noting that some of these Internet weirdnesses have shown up on other search engines, too, not just on Google. What do you think about the Santorum situation? Should Google make changes? Or is the company right to stand by the way its equations rank Web pages against each other, by trying to judge their relevance?","Politico: Rick Santorum asks Google to change the search results for his name .

"(CNN) -- A day after jurors found her guilty of first-degree murder, Jodi Arias and her attorneys met with a judge in a closed-door hearing Thursday, according to a source with knowledge of the proceedings. The hearing was sealed, and it's unclear what they discussed. But afterward, officials abruptly announced the cancellation of Thursday's court proceedings and said that the trial would not resume until next week. The last-minute cancellation was the latest twist in a high-profile case that has been marked by drama so intense that spectators line up to get seats in the Phoenix courtroom. Court proceedings are now scheduled to resume on Wednesday at 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET). That's because the prosecution's witness, medical examiner Dr. Kevin Horn, is not available Monday or Tuesday, the source with knowledge of the proceedings said. Although it was not immediately clear what prompted the unexpected scheduling change, some analysts pointed to a television interview Arias gave minutes after the verdict was announced Wednesday. ""I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today,"" she told Phoenix television station KSAZ. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it."" Arias told KSAZ that longevity runs in her family, and that the worst possible outcome in the case would be a life sentence without parole. ""I would much rather die sooner than later,"" she said. The comments prompted authorities to place Arias on suicide watch, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. After visiting with her family Wednesday night, Arias was transferred from the jail where she had been held to a psychiatric ward at a different jail, the sheriff's office said. Her mother, Sandra Arias, told In Session's Jean Casarez Thursday evening that authorities did not allow her to visit with her daughter in the psychiatric ward because she is ""under watch"" there. What's next for Arias . Evidence that convicted Arias . Next phase in trial is key . Arias was stoic in court Wednesday. Her eyes briefly welled up with tears as a clerk announced that the jury found her guilty of first-degree murder for killing ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in June 2008. Alexander was stabbed repeatedly, shot and nearly decapitated five years ago. Arias says she killed him in self-defense after he attacked her, but the grisly slaying caused even some anti-domestic violence advocates to doubt her case. The jury's highly anticipated verdict Wednesday after more than 15 hours of deliberation was a significant step in the case. But the trial isn't over yet. And Arias, who testified for 18 days during the trial, could speak to jurors again in court. The next step of the case, known as the aggravation phase, is now scheduled to start on Wednesday. That phase will move Arias closer to learning whether she will live or die. Before they can consider imposing the death penalty, jurors must answer a key question: was Arias cruel when she killed Alexander? To answer that question, prosecutors will have a chance to present additional evidence and jurors will decide whether Alexander's death was caused in a cruel manner. Prosecutor Juan Martinez is expected to call Horn, the medical examiner, back to the stand to testify about how Alexander suffered before he died. There are currently 127 people on death row in Arizona. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. Twists and turns of the trial . Catch up quickly on the Arias trial . Trial marked by dramatic arguments . In the trial, both sides have dramatically presented their arguments with details about Arias' love affair with Alexander. ""She rewarded that love from Travis Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest,"" Martinez said in his opening statement. ""And you know he was a good man, according to her. And with regard to being a good man, well, she slit his throat as a reward for being a good man. And in terms of these blessings, well, she knocked the blessings out of him by putting a bullet in his head."" Photos: Alexander and his girlfriend . But defense attorney Jennifer Willmott countered: ""Jodi Arias killed Travis Alexander. There is no question about it. The million-dollar question is what would have forced her to do it?"" Willmott said Arias was the victim of a controlling, psychologically abusive relationship, and Alexander considered Arias ""his dirty little secret."" Martinez accused Arias of playing the victim. He alleged she staged the crime scene to make it look like self-defense. He also accused her of actively seeking to profit from her media attention. Courtroom bomb threat . Earlier Thursday, the sheriff's office said a suspect had been detained after a reported bomb threat targeting the courtroom where the Arias trial is taking place. Authorities found no evidence of explosives or threats at the courthouse, Sheriff Joe Arpaio told reporters. A search of the suspect's hotel room revealed bullets, but no gun or explosives, he said. But Arpaio said deputies were interviewing the suspect and the investigation was ongoing. ""I hope this doesn't disrupt the trial. On the other hand, I think people have to know that this guy who made the threat is behind bars,"" he said. ""Let's go on with the trial and see what happens."" Quiz: Test your legal knowledge . In Session's Grace Wong, Nancy Leung and Scott Tufts and CNN's Ed Payne, Dana Ford, Ashleigh Banfield and Eliott C. McLaughlin and HLN's Beth Karas and Graham Winch contributed to this report.","Arias and the defense meet with the judge in a sealed hearing .

"(CNN) -- A group of 81 migrants held captive in a house in the border city of Reynosa were rescued by Mexican authorities. A tip led state and federal agents to the two-story home where the migrants were held Wednesday. They had been held hostage there for several days, the Tamaulipas state public ministry said. All but one of those rescued are Central Americans, the public ministry said. Men and women were among the captives, 39 from Honduras, 38 from Guatemala, three from El Salvador and one Mexican, the ministry said. The migrants told authorities that they were attempting to enter the United States illegally. The unidentified kidnappers escaped, the public ministry said. Mass kidnappings of this sort are not unheard of. It is one of the many risks that Central American migrants face as they traverse Mexico. In June, 52 migrants were rescued from another home in Reynosa. That same month, 165 migrants were rescued from the city of Gustavo Diaz Ordaez, also in Tamaulipas state.

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has requested political asylum, officials and WikiLeaks said Tuesday. Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino read a statement to reporters at a news conference in Quito. He took no questions. Assange has been fighting for a year and a half against being sent to Sweden for questioning about accusations of sexual abuse. Two women accused him in August 2010 of sexually assaulting them during a visit to Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. ""Julian Assange has requested political asylum and is under the protection of the Ecuadorian embassy in London,"" WikiLeaks wrote on its Twitter page. The embassy also released a statement on its website saying Assange, an Australian, arrived there in the afternoon and will remain at the embassy while his application is assessed. ""The decision to consider Mr. Assange's application for protective asylum should in no way be interpreted as the government of Ecuador interfering in the judicial processes of either the United Kingdom or Sweden,"" the statement said. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom last week dismissed an application filed by an attorney for Assange seeking to reopen his appeal against extradition. The application was Assange's last option in the British courts. Britain's Crown Prosecution Service has previously said if the court dismissed Assange's appeal, his only further remedy would be to apply immediately to the European Court of Human Rights, and Assange's attorneys have vowed to do so. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office acknowledged Assange's request for political asylum in a statement, and said it would work with Ecuadorian authorities to ""resolve this situation as soon as possible."" Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Swedish prosecutors want to question him about allegations of ""unlawful coercion and sexual misconduct including rape,"" according to a Supreme Court document. He has been under house arrest in Britain since December 2010. Assange has maintained his innocence and claims the allegations against him are politically motivated. He fears that if he is extradited to Sweden, authorities there could hand him over to the United States, where he then could be prosecuted for his role in the leaking of classified documents. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, has published some 250,000 confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, causing embarrassment to the government and others. It also has published hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recently, the organization has come under financial pressure, leading Assange to announce that WikiLeaks was temporarily stopping publication to ""aggressively fund raise"" in order to stay afloat. An announcement at the top of WikiLeaks' home page reads: ""We are forced to put all our efforts into raising funds to ensure our economic survival."" During his wait for the Supreme Court to rule on his extradition, Assange has hosted a talk show on Russian TV. ""The World Tomorrow"" appears on the Kremlin-funded, pro-Russian network Russia Today. He hosted it from the Suffolk, England, mansion where he is under house arrest with an electronic bracelet monitoring his movements. He has interviewed controversial figures at odds with the U.S. government, including Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, which the United States considers a terrorist organization, and Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, who railed against the United States in his interview with Assange. In 2010, a statement from Ecuador's foreign ministry appeared to offer the controversial Assange an invitation to discuss a trove of leaked documents. The ministry also offered to process a request for residency, if Assange chose. But a later statement from the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United States said that was not the case. ""While there was some confusion in the media flowing out of Quito yesterday, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa has clarified that his country has not invited WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange to Ecuador,"" the statement read. In Ecuador, Correa said at the time that his country had not made a formal invitation to Assange and that the ministry declaration, made by Deputy Foreign Minister Kintto Lucas, was ""spontaneous"" and personal in nature.

"(CNN) -- The attorney representing George Zimmerman, who is charged with killing an unarmed, black teen, is no stranger to high-profile cases and TV cameras. Mark O'Mara gained notoriety in Florida for defending a man who killed a woman during a high-speed chase and then later as a legal commentator during the Casey Anthony murder trial. ""Mark knows how to handle the media. But he's also not a media hog,"" said CNN legal analyst Mark NeJame who has gone up against O'Mara in the courtroom. ""He's going to go out and say and do what's appropriate on behalf of his client."" Blog: Updates on charges and arrest as they unfolded . O'Mara is expected to make his first court appearance Thursday with Zimmerman, who faces a second-degree murder charge in the February 26 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in the suburban Orlando community of Sanford. Attorney expected to ask for bail . O'Mara  told CNN on Thursday that while he is concerned about Zimmerman's safety, he needs his client out of custody ""to assist me in going over all the evidence and preparing our defense."" He said he wasn't sure whether a bond request would be heard Thursday and noted he has only had 16 hours to prepare for the hearing. Read charges against Zimmerman (PDF) O'Mara, who has spent nearly 30 years practicing criminal and family law in central Florida, replaces Craig Sonner and Hal Uhrig as Zimmerman's attorneys. They told reporters Tuesday that they had lost contact with their client and no longer represent him. The same day, O'Mara questioned the attorneys' statements -- in his role as a legal analyst on Central Florida's WKMG Channel 6. ""I think that was a little problematic,"" he said. ""You're not supposed to talk about a client's case, for the most part at all, and yet they answered dozens of questions."" Asked about Uhrig's statement that Zimmerman may have ""post-traumatic stress,"" O'Mara said Thursday, ""A diagnosis like that should be made by a professional psychologist or psychiatrist. I'm not going to make a diagnosis like that. ""He is stressed. He's tired. He's been through a lot with the way this case has been handled to date,"" O'Mara said of his client. ""I'm just hoping his mental health stays well, and we can move forward with getting the case figured out."" A collection of public documents in Trayvon Martin shooting . On Wednesday, O'Mara told reporters that Zimmerman's family contacted him after referrals from other lawyers. Hours later, Zimmerman surrendered to authorities, and O'Mara stepped in front of a sea of television cameras. ""We voluntarily surrendered him to law enforcement, with the realization that the charges were going to come, and he did that, again, voluntarily, and we're trying to work out the best way to keep this as calm as we can,"" he said. What happens next in case . Zimmerman has said he killed Martin in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk, according to Sanford police. Martin's family says Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled the youth, who was black, and ignored a police dispatcher's directive not to follow him. Last month, O'Mara told WKMG that the shooting could be legally justified under Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. ""Other people call it the license to murder statue because it doesn't require actions to avoid the confrontation,"" he said. ""If you can present evidence or at least your own testimony that (you) felt in fear that he was going to commit great bodily injury or death, that is what kicks in the statutory protection that you're allowed to respond with deadly force."" In 2004, O'Mara defended Shamir Suber, who was charged with second-degree murder for plowing into the back of a car and killing 20-year-old Sara Phillips while trying to evade police during a high-speed chase. Suber was convicted of the lesser charge of DUI manslaughter in the death of the University of Central Florida nursing student, a case that underscored the risks of high-speed police pursuits. O'Mara's website says before becoming a criminal defense attorney, he worked as a criminal prosecutor. ""He knows how to defend you because he knows how they will prosecute you,"" it said. Meet prosecutor Angela Corey . Zimmerman was alone Wednesday when he turned himself in to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's office in Jacksonville, said department spokeswoman Joyce Dawley. ""There's a lot of issues and there's a lot of emotions, and we need to calm this down,"" O'Mara said. ""It needs to be tried in a courtroom, which is the only place it's supposed to be tried, and that's what I'm going to try help get done."" O'Mara graduated from Florida State University College of Law in 1982 and passed the Florida bar that same year.","Mark O'Mara worked as a legal commentator during the Casey Anthony trial .

"New York (CNN) -- CNN has obtained an exclusive photograph of Pedro Hernandez, suspect in the death of 6-year-old Etan Patz, who remains under the care of doctors after being ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination to determine whether he's competent to stand trial. The photograph was taken five years ago and shows him in a suit and tie, wearing glasses. Investigators are currently digging into a computer drive and two satchels, among other items, removed during the execution of a search warrant at the home of Hernandez, the attorney for Hernandez's wife said Thursday. The search warrant was executed as part of the ongoing investigation into Etan's disappearance in 1979. Hernandez was arrested last month. Police said he confessed to strangling the boy and throwing his body away in a trash bag. The search began Wednesday afternoon and wrapped up at 3 a.m. Thursday at the couple's New Jersey house, said Robert Gottlieb, who represents Rosemary Hernandez. He said his client ""doesn't know what they were looking for."" The satchels contained personal items including paperwork belonging to Rosemary Hernandez, he said. Gottlieb said his client was home during the search and cooperated fully. ""An assistant prosecutor called me before investigators entered the house and asked whether she was willing to be there to offer assistance, and she did. She was there in five, 10 minutes."" Rosemary Hernandez feels that her husband's confession is unreliable and is coming from a mentally ill man, Gottlieb said. The suspect, who is being held without bail at New York's Bellevue Hospital, is receiving a medication called olanzapine, according to a source familiar with his medical history. The drug is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia, according to the National Institutes of Health. Pedro Hernandez admitted choking the boy after luring him into the basement of a bodega, a small grocery store, on May 25, 1979, police said. Etan's remains have not been found. His attorney previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders, suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar. ""Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time,"" Gottlieb said. He would not elaborate on the mental disorders, nor would he provide an example of what his client observed. ""She does not believe the confession at all,"" Gottlieb said. Investigators have been trying to build a case against Hernandez, looking for evidence to back up his statements to them. Police have said they have no other evidence or a motive to support his confession. A relative has said she reported that Hernandez told family members in the 1980s that he killed a boy in New York. Norma Hernandez, the suspect's sister, said she went to police in Camden, New Jersey, back then but felt that they didn't believe her. Police have said they have no record of that report. Hernandez said her brother also told a prayer group about killing a boy. Gottlieb said he was asked to represent the wife because of her growing frustration over the case and her desire to make sure prosecutors ""understand the severity and nature of the mental illnesses."" A spokesman for the district attorney's office had no comment Wednesday. Rosemary Hernandez has not seen her husband at Bellevue Hospital but has spoken to him by telephone. ""It's a very difficult time for her and her daughter,"" Gottlieb said. Pedro Hernandez's next court appearance is scheduled for June 25.","The search began Wednesday afternoon and lasted into Thursday morning .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian officials said Wednesday. An Israeli army unit opened fire on a man near the fence that separates Gaza from Israel late Tuesday night, according to an Israel Defense Forces spokesman. He said soldiers fired when the man came too close to the border fence which has in the past been a location of attacks against Israeli troops. Medical officials in Gaza said they retrieved the body of a Palestinian 19-year-old at the site. Separately, the Israeli air force carried out airstrikes on Tuesday against members of the Hamas military wing in central Gaza, killing one militant and injuring three others, according to a news release put out by Hamas. The Israeli military said the attack came as a response to the firing of two long-range rockets fired from Gaza Monday night that hit the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva. No one was injured in the rocket attack. A total of 14 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza this month, according to the Israeli military, . The renewed violence comes as London based al-Hayat newspaper reported that Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Cairo to discuss, among other things, a deal for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Asked about the report, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israeli radio ""there was a grain of truth"" in the rumors but he ""preferred not to say anything because it doesn't help.""

"Chittagong, Bangladesh (CNN)  -- In a dusty, unkempt field in the middle of Bangladesh's second-largest city, crowds of men and boys gather to watch their favorite sport. But there is something most unusual about this sight, even in such a cricket-crazy nation. On this particular field, the men and boys are the spectators and the girls are the ones wielding bats and bowling balls. ""I have never seen girls playing cricket anywhere in Bangladesh before,"" remarks a male watching on the sidelines. That is because girls aren't normally given the chance to play. They are generally given less value in society than boys. Bangladesh launches Cricket World Cup . ""At first people asked: 'Why are girls playing cricket. It's a boys' game, this is a bad thing,' "" 15-year-old Rohima Bibi Moni said. In the slum where she lives, the neighbors taunted her father, saying he was ruining their religiously-conservative society by allowing his girl to play. He almost gave in to their demands. ""Then I thought that I could not do anything in my life, so let my daughter do something,"" Moni's father Muhammad Sayed said. Sayed is illiterate. He was never given the chance to go to school. But instead of marrying his daughter off at the age of 14 -- the age his wife married him -- he allowed Moni to take classes in a school run by BRAC, Bangladesh's largest non-governmental organization. He was impressed with his daughter's work and even learned a few things from her. ""I could not sign my name before, but I started learning from my daughter and now I can write my name and some others' names,"" Sayed said. So a year and a half ago, when BRAC  decided to start a girls' cricket team with funding from UNICEF, Moni convinced her parents and went from a shy teenager to the captain of her team. ""God willing someday I will be able to play on the national team,"" she said. There are dozens of girls like her, and now there are enough teams in Bangladesh to have a national tournament. There is only enough money to hold a handful of formal training sessions from volunteer coaches, but the girls take what they can and work with it. Coach Nurul Huda Khan beams when he remembers the hardships the girls have overcome. ""I am very proud! My team is not playing very well but we have been able to bring the team from so far with the help of BRAC. It's a miracle!"" But the proudest of all is Moni's father: ""I am now happy she is learning and she is playing. I am delighted with this thing. People from all across Bangladesh watch her play -- she's our pride."" No matter if the girls' teams win or lose a match. Their supporters say they have already aced some life's biggest tests. With the 2011 Cricket World Cup being kicked off in Bangladesh, Moni has gained enough confidence and support to dream even bigger now. ""I will definitely feel good when we see girls like us playing in the World Cup.""","Girls are breaking down social barriers by starting to play cricket in Bangladesh .

"(CNN) -- Some might call it the plain truth -- others, the plane truth. Virgin Group boss Richard Branson, who once received what's widely considered the world's best complaint letter, is sharing another one with his 3 million Twitter followers. Fortunately for him, it was sent to another airline. The sarcastic open letter to LIAT Airlines first appeared in The BVI Beacon, a newspaper in the British Virgin Islands, in April, but caught Branson's attention last week. ""How to write a complaint letter -- read this hilarious note from a frustrated airline passenger,"" Branson tweeted. In the letter, the writer Arthur Hicks comes out swinging. ""May I say how considerate it is of you to enable your passengers such an in-depth and thorough tour of the Caribbean,"" Hicks begins. ""Most other airlines I have travelled on would simply wish to take me from point A to B in rather a hurry.

We got to change and refuel every step of the way!"" Hicks goes on to say how much he enjoyed sampling the security scanners at each airport and the pat downs too. ""I feel as if I've been hugged by most of the Caribbean already,"" he writes. The letter closes with a curt: ""P.S. Keep the bag. I never liked it anyway."" Branson does drag after losing bet .

"(CNN) -- Jewish organizations called for a Romanian official to resign and face a criminal investigation after he wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend. Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, wore a Nazi uniform during a fashion show over the weekend. Radu Mazare, the mayor of the town of Constanta, and his 15-year-old son ""entered the stage marching the clearly identifiable Nazi 'goose step,'"" the Center for Monitoring and Combating anti-Semitism in Romania said in a letter to the country's prosecutor general. The organization's director, Marco Katz, said Mazare had broken Romanian law and encouraged his son to do the same, ""educating him to treat the law with contempt."" Katz said Mazare was sending a message ""that to wear Nazi uniforms and to march the Nazi steps is legal and 'in vogue' in Romania."" He urged the authorities and the head of Mazare's Social Democrat party to show that message ""will be strongly countermanded."" Mazare, 41, said he had not noticed the Nazi swastika symbol on the uniform before he wore it, according to the Romanian Times newspaper. ""I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it,"" he said. ""I really liked the look of the uniform after seeing it in the Tom Cruise film 'Valkyrie.' I bought it from a costume hire shop in Germany."" A top Nazi hunter said Mazare should quit. ""The proper thing for you to do is to admit your mistake, apologize for it and resign your position,"" Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem wrote to Mazare. Zuroff sent CNN a copy of the letter. He said it was no defense that the uniform was that of the Wehrmacht -- the army -- rather than the SS, the elite Nazi guard which took the lead in killing Jews during the Holocaust. ""The Wehrmacht played an active role in the mass murder of European Jewry and many other innocent victims. By dressing in a Wehrmacht uniform, you are expressing totally unwarranted support and nostalgia for an army which committed the most terrible war crimes and acts of genocide,"" the letter said. ""It would hard to adequately describe the depth of the pain that your appearance caused, not only to Jews and other victims of Nazism, but to any person of moral integrity who knows the history of World War II,"" Zuroff wrote. Zuroff told CNN he did not expect Mazare to resign, or even to respond to the letter. But he said he hoped the mayor might act on Zuroff's suggestion that Mazare create a Romanian-language edition of an acclaimed exhibition on the crimes of the Wehrmacht. The Nazi uniform incident, which took place Sunday, was the first time Zuroff heard of Mazare, he said. ""He has a history of being outrageous, but his antics have never included something that I would deal with,"" Zuroff said. ""He's a real character, apparently. He's also very popular, which makes this much more difficult."" CNN attempts to contact Mazare were unsuccessful. Romania was a Nazi ally from 1940 to 1944, under the leadership of a right-wing military government led by General Ion Antonescu. At least 270,000 Romanian Jews were killed or died from mistreatment during the Holocaust, according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia. The 1930 Romanian census recorded 728,115 people who identified themselves as Jewish, comprising approximately 4 percent of the population, the reference work says. Antonescu was deposed in 1944 and Romania switched sides in World War II.","Jewish organizations call for a Romanian official to resign .

"(CNN) -- At 6'3"" and 277 pounds, Darryl Roberts had a body mass index of 34.6. Anything over 30.0 on the BMI scale is considered obese, and his doctor warned him that his blood pressure was too high. So the doctor gave Roberts some medication and told him to take the pills daily. Side effects, she cautioned, could include erectile dysfunction. Roberts balked. ""Can't I just exercise and eat healthier?"" he remembers asking. ""Think about it,"" Roberts says with a laugh. ""A 40-something year-old man on a race not to take pills that cause erectile dysfunction. Every guy I tell that to goes, 'Oh my God, I can relate to that.' "" The documentary filmmaker bought a bike and started adding salads to his diet. Two months later he returned to the doctor and was pronounced perfectly healthy -- despite having lost only 6 pounds. It's a journey that he chronicles in ""America the Beautiful 2: The Thin Commandments,"" a follow-up to his first award-winning film. The documentary focuses on the United States' unhealthy obsession with dieting and losing weight. ""We have a health problem, not a weight problem,"" Roberts says matter-of-factly. CNN spoke with Roberts about his film, why he believes the BMI system should be outlawed and the award he's most proud of. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Why did you start filming the ""America the Beautiful"" documentary series? What sparked your passion for the topic? I always had this knack for attracting really awesome, quality women in my life. Like I had a five-year [relationship], a five-year and an eight-year relationship. [But] I used to travel around the country with these athletes and entertainers, running into these women that would hang out at the gate. After doing that for a while, I went, ""Wow, you know what? I want a girlfriend that's awesome like the one I have, but that looks like these [groupies]."" After being exposed to them for so long I could no longer appreciate the awesomeness of the woman that I was with. So that's when I started thinking, ""Why did I do that?"" Like when you have so much, why was beauty so important? That gave me the idea to do a documentary. CNN: What did you learn from your first documentary? I was sitting around watching my film one day and it occurred to me -- it just hit me -- all these three things: plastic surgery, cosmetics and eating disorders, are things that primarily affect women. And we still have an archaic appreciation for women in our country because if things primarily affect women, nobody does anything about it. But when it affects men, they do something about it right away. ... It's like we're in 1910. Everything looks really sophisticated because you have computers, you have iPads, you have smartphones and tablets, and everything you see looks so developed, but underneath it, I don't believe we value women the way that we should in this country. CNN: Why did you decide to focus on dieting in your second documentary, ""The Thin Commandments?"" When I was traveling with the first film, I went to 287 universities. At each one ... somebody would stand up and say, ""Wow, we really like your film, but you didn't deal with the dieting industry. Why not?"" So I go on the computer one night just researching dieting, and I come across this website that has the BMI, body mass index, of celebrities. So according to this website, the BMI of Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Mel Gibson, The Rock, Christian Bale, LeBron James -- all these celebrities -- make them either overweight or obese. And I'm like, ""This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard."" So then I did some more research on BMI. The government uses it, doctors use BMI, schools use BMI, and I'm like, ""This is how they get you."" In the first film, I show how we use beauty as a weapon against the American public -- now we're using weight as a weapon against the American public. CNN: What is wrong exactly with the BMI system? It was invented in like 1830 ... and it was invented to show sizes of populations. Like, for instance, the entire population of the United States. It was never intended to be used for an individual diagnosis of someone's health and how much they should weigh. That came in the 1970s with this guy Ancel Keys when he reformulated it to the current BMI thing. Then in 1998, some of the scientific advisers of Weight Watchers went to the government and said, ""Hey, you know what? The number that's used for the overweight category for BMI should be lowered."" And the government did it. They lowered it. And when they lowered it, literally 25 million people became overweight, overnight. But guess what: Those are new customers now for the dieting industry. CNN: Can you really say obesity isn't a big problem in this country? Why are you, in a way, fighting against that sentiment? First off, because [if] you are defining [obesity] by BMI, then it's erroneous. So what we may have as a problem in this country is a health problem. That I agree with. We show it in the film. We have a health problem. And what we also show in the film is that health problems come to people with or without weight. So the film is making the point that we should be focusing on the health of people and not their weight. Where we have problems is lifestyle choices. We have too many people eating fast food. We have too many people not exercising. We have too many people not engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors. My point is if we have more people engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors, we will become a healthier nation, whether we lose weight or not. If you think about it -- it makes sense, right? CNN: Tell me about the third documentary in the ""America the Beautiful"" series. What will it be about? So far I've done the health and beauty series, so the next one will complete it and make it the health, beauty and sex series, which are the three biggest things affecting our youth. It will be about the sexualization of our youth. Everyone says that's going to be the whopper there. I'm going to start it in January. I have no idea what I'm going to find. I always start my documentaries with no preconceived notions, and I jump in interviewing people to see what I can find. CNN: What award for your documentaries have you won that you're most proud of? There's a film festival that Will Smith and Meryl Streep are affiliated with -- the Giffoni Film Festival. It's a film festival for kids. They never show documentaries, only feature films that appeal to kids, right? But with [""America the Beautiful""], the Giffoni Film Festival made an exception to let a documentary in there. I went to the screening, and I was terrified that my film was going to put all these kids in a comatose state. We went to the awards presentation, and they announced the audience award and called our name. I went into shock. Here are kids voting a documentary as their favorite film in this big film festival. That was literally my proudest moment. CNN: Where can people see ""America the Beautiful: The Thin Commandments""? [It's] actually touring around the country in theaters. We've been to six cities so far; we'll go to 30 more. They can go to our website at AmericatheBeautifuldoc.com and go to the screening schedule and see when we'll be coming to a city near them. It [also] comes out on DVD in March.","Darryl Roberts says America has a health problem, not a weight problem .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A humanitarian crisis looms in Thailand after the worst floods in decades left parts of Bangkok and other areas of the country submerged, relief agencies warned Sunday. Bangkok's central business district has so far avoided major flooding, but many of the areas nearby are chest- or waist-deep in water, forcing residents to flee their homes. The Thai government has set up more than 1,700 shelters across the country, where more than 113,000 people have taken refuge since flooding began in July after heavy monsoon rains. More than 370 people have died, and charities working in the country have warned of the risk of water- and insect-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dengue fever and malaria in the coming days and weeks. Thai officials warned residents in the capital to be vigilant and expect disruptions with electricity and tap water. ""There are places on the outskirts of Bangkok and in other parts of the country which have been flooded for nearly two weeks,"" Matthew Cochrane, of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""The country's prime minister has said that the city has 'dodged a bullet' -- the economic impact of central Bangkok being flooded would have been huge, and thankfully that did not happen -- but a huge part of the country is still under water. ""Outside the city it is certainly a humanitarian crisis, because there are people who have been cut off for weeks without any aid, supplies or food."" UNICEF said it was providing 20,000 mosquito nets, and handing out 20,000 pamphlets explaining how to stay safe and healthy in flood-hit regions. Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry has said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has urged stores not to stockpile goods, amid concerns that panic buying was leading to a shortage of essential items. Officials in the capital have warned residents to expect interruptions to electricity and tap water supplies. The Metropolitan Waterworks Authority said it had reduced the amount of tap water processed for residents from 900,000 to 400,000 cubic meters per day, because of high algae counts at one of its plants. The prime minister said authorities would speed up the process of draining water into Bangkok's canals and into the sea, raising hopes that water levels in the city could start to sink. However, the government has warned it may take more than a month for the floods to recede. Cochrane said the country still faced a variety of threats, including strong currents, disease and even crocodile and snake attacks. But he said it was vital that authorities and charities also start to look beyond the immediate dangers. ""In addition to emergency services, I feel we must start working on getting resources available to help people get back on their feet and live a life after the floods,"" he told CNN. CNN's Bryony Jones and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report.","""A huge part of the country is still under water,"" an official says .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's a weekend barbecue or roasting marshmallows on a camping trip, cooking over an open fire is a novelty that many Americans enjoy. But for nearly half the world's population, building and maintaining a fire is a daily -- and often deadly -- chore. In remote villages and city slums, women tend to fires for hours on end, breathing in smoke that is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, according to the World Health Organization. Many of these women have their children close by or strapped to their chest or back, and the dangerous pollutants from the smoke can result in severe damage to their lungs as well. Nancy Hughes witnessed this firsthand while working with a medical team in Guatemala more than a decade ago. ""There were doctors on the medical team who could not put tubes down the babies' throats because the throats were so choked with creosote,"" said Hughes, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives in Eugene, Oregon. ""Imagine you've got a new baby and you couldn't save that baby's life ... and it's because of cooking."" Inhaling this polluted air has also been linked to pneumonia, heart disease, lung cancer, low birth weight and respiratory infections, just to name a few. Hughes spent years working with engineers to create the Ecocina, a stove that burns cleaner to make it safer for people and better for the environment. In 2008, she founded StoveTeam International, which she says has established factories that have produced more than 37,000 stoves and improved the lives of more than 280,000 people in Latin America. ""Cooking shouldn't kill,"" she said. An estimated 4 million people each year die from exposure to cookstove smoke, according to the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (PDF). But Hughes and her group are trying to help change that. By using a cleaner combustion process, the Ecocina stove reduces carbon emissions and particulate matter by 70%. The quick-cooking unit is also cost-efficient and portable, and it requires no installation or external chimney. ""It's kind of a little miracle,"" said Hughes, explaining that the ""E"" stands for environmental and ""cocina"" is the Spanish word for kitchen. Hughes' stoves also provide an economic boost to the communities where she works, because they are all built by local laborers using local materials. In the last five years, her group has helped start six factories in five countries: El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua. ""It not only employs the people in the factory, but obviously they're buying all their supplies locally. So anything they need, they're helping boost the local businesses,"" Hughes said. ""Also, some of the individuals who buy stoves are starting their own catering businesses."" Today, 45 people are employed at the factories that her group has helped establish. ""On one of my recent visits, one of the guys came up to me and wanted to have a picture taken,"" Hughes said. ""He said very proudly, 'Before I had this job, I was picking coconuts -- and now I am a welder!' "" It's an impressive accomplishment for Hughes, who didn't begin working in this area until a little more than 10 years ago. She'd spent most of her life as a stay-at-home wife and mother, but after losing her husband to cancer in 2001, Hughes was looking for a change. Her inner ""travel bug"" kicked in, and when she heard about a local medical team that was planning to volunteer in Guatemala, she signed up to go as a cook. ""It's an awful situation down there,"" Hughes said. ""The homes are made out of whatever material is around. Sometimes they're made out of plastic bags woven together with sticks. ... Rarely do they have windows or ventilation."" She was stunned to realize that women often spend more than 14 hours a day inside tending to an open fire, and she was horrified to see entire families suffering from chronic coughs and respiratory infections, not to mention burns. One woman's story was a turning point for her. Irma, 18, had fallen into an open fire as a toddler, and her hands were literally burned shut. The medical team treated Irma and was able to restore the use of her hands, but Hughes said she knew she needed to do more. ""I thought: 'This is crazy. So what can we do to prevent it?' "" she said. Hughes teamed up with rocket engineer Larry Winiarski, who created the original Ecocina design. Then she joined forces with Rotary Clubs around the world, and together they began partnering with local entrepreneurs to start factories. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Not only are the stoves improving and saving people's lives -- they are also saving forests. In much of the world, Hughes says, a household will use 50-100 pounds of wood to cook each day. The Ecocina requires 50% less wood than a traditional open fire, and twigs and fallen branches can be used to heat the stove. Even the stove itself is designed to be environmentally friendly. ""We wanted it made out of local materials, biodegradable materials, so if anything happened to the stove or if someone abandoned it, the materials would just go back to nature,"" she said. The stoves typically cost between $40 and $45 to make, including labor and materials, Hughes said, and they sell for $50-$60 depending on the factory site and their specific costs. Orlando Flores Perez received a free Ecocina as part of a community grant in El Salvador. His daughter Mariella suffered from asthma so severe she was hospitalized often twice a week, but the Ecocina changed that. Now, Mariella needs far fewer trips to the hospital and the entire family breathes easier. ""Mariella's health has improved dramatically since we've had the stove,"" Perez said. ""The new stove has helped improve her health and the health of our family."" Hughes is not paid for her work, and occasionally she dips into her own her savings to contribute to the project. It's her passion -- or as she calls it, her obsession. ""If anyone told me I'd be doing all this at this age, I wouldn't have believed them,"" Hughes said. But Hughes -- who plans to open new factories in Colombia and Mexico in the next year -- intends to spend the rest of her life doing this work. With 3 billion people, mostly women and children, facing health risks from open fires or leaky cookstoves every day, Hughes says there are just too many who need help. ""The best part of doing it is seeing the people who benefit,"" Hughes said. ""Anybody can do this. You just have to have a purpose and a passion."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- He survived for nearly four months in the mountains, braving freezing temperatures and eating rats and grass to survive. After an Argentine military helicopter sent to measure snow in the Andes lifted him to safety on Sunday, authorities called Raul Gomez Cincunegui's survival ""a miracle."" They marveled at how the malnourished man made it so long without proper food or heating, and wondered why he was living in a herder's shelter at 4,500 meters (14,763 feet). It turns out Gomez, an Uruguayan national, may have had good reason to be hiding. A day after his dramatic rescue from the remote area of Argentina's San Juan Province near the country's border with Chile, authorities revealed there was more to the man's story. According to Chilean prosecutors, Gomez, 58, is a wanted suspect in their country in a case allegedly involving the sexual abuse of a minor. Authorities said they opened an investigation in April after the mother of an 8-year-old boy accused the Uruguayan man of sexually abusing her son. A local judge issued an arrest warrant and a restraining order that month, prohibiting Gomez from having any contact with the alleged victim, prosecutors said. Just weeks after the investigation started, Gomez disappeared. Chilean authorities issued a national arrest warrant July 17 after he missed several court dates. Local media reported that Gomez left the country riding a motorcycle and kept walking through the Andes once it broke down. Gomez is in police custody while he undergoes treatment at an Argentine hospital, Argentina's state-run Telam news agency reported. Chilean prosecutors said they have filed an extradition request to bring him back to their country. The man's wife and daughters, who traveled to Argentina to reunite with him, deny the allegations and say it's all a misunderstanding. ""It was all started by an aunt we didn't get along with, but that issue has been solved,"" daughter Paula Gomez told Telam. ""As you can see, there's no problem here. If there were, he would be surrounded by police officers, but he's not because the case was dismissed."" Another sexual abuse case against him in Uruguay also turned out not to be true, she said. ""It's a case that was dismissed a long time ago,"" Gomez told Telam. ""He was being sought as a missing person and that's it."" A doctor who is treating Gomez told CNN affiliate Canal 13 that he's in remarkably good condition. ""When we get patients who have survived a long time in freezing temperatures, they have normally lost a finger or two to frostbite,"" Dr. Leonardo Gutierrez said. ""Other than being severely malnourished, he's perfectly fine."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","In Argentina, authorities called a man's survival in the Andes a miracle .

"(CNN) -- A passer-by found four people shot dead Thursday in a car parked alongside a rural Tennessee road, a mystery that has left authorities scrambling to identify the victims and hunt for whomever is responsible. The vehicle was spotted around 7 a.m. on Renegade Mountain, an area about 65 miles west of Knoxville. The bystander quickly called the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said. ""They knew that nobody lives on that street, and (the car) just looked odd sitting there,"" Sheriff Butch Burgess told CNN affiliate WATE. The victims were males and female, all of whom were ""relatively young,"" according to Helm. ""We are continuing to identify the victims as it is still an active crime scene,"" the spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday evening. ""...We still are trying to identify a suspect."" Authorities hadn't established a motive either. According to the Renegade Mountain Community Club, the area around where the bodies were found had been a retirement resort, a ski resort and a golf club, though it's now mostly home to a small number of families. One such resident, Cynthia Benson, described the killings as ""sad, scary."" ""We've had little problems, but nothing major,"" she told WATE. ""Nothing like this."" A Facebook posting on a page tied to the community offered ""our deepest sympathy to their families."" ""Our community is close and family-like,"" the message read. ""The victims' families are certainly in our thoughts and prayers."" Burgess vowed that authorities are using ""every asset that we have"" to track down those responsible. ""Knock on wood, we've not had any (cases) that (have) gone unsolved,"" he said. ""And we don't want this to be the one that does.""","A passer-by notices a car parked 65 miles west of Knoxville and sees four bodies inside .

"Mizoram, India (CNN) -- The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered. ""I don't care about overpopulation in India ... I believe God has chosen us to be like this (have big families). Those who are born into this family don't want to leave this tradition so we just keep growing and growing,"" he says with a smile. Ziona, who only goes by his first name, has 39 wives, 86 children and 35 grandchildren. Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will. ""I never wanted to get married but that's the path God has chosen for me,"" he says. ""It's not my wish to keep marrying again and again."" All 160 family members live in a four-storey mansion perched on top of a remote village in the northeastern Indian state of Mizoram. The state, neighboring Myanmar and Bangladesh, has one million residents, one of the lowest population densities in this country of 1.2 billion. Despite its natural beauty, special permits are required to enter the state, making tourism virtually non-existent. Four hours away from Mizoram's only airport, in the isolated village of Baktwang, Ziona's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out. The main room is a giant hall where the family cooks, eats and prays. The bedrooms are dormitory-style with an average of 20 beds, each double bed about a foot apart from the next. The children sleep with their mothers who take turns visiting the 69 year-old's master bedroom. ""There is no discrimination amongst us, he treats us all equally,"" fifth wife Twangi says. Ziona first got married when he was 17 to Zathiangi, who is now 70. His youngest wife is 31. As the eldest wife, Zathiangi calls all the shots in the kitchen so meal times are an efficient exercise. Without much fuss, while some women of the house cook, others set the table, still others serve and clean. ""We cook 25 kilograms of rice, 40 kilograms of potatoes and 5 kilograms of lentils everyday,"" Twangi says. The family indulges in meat three times a week and for every non-vegetarian meal, 30 chickens are plucked and a giant pig is roasted. But the sheer volume of food that needs to be cooked or plates that need to be washed doesn't overwhelm the women of the house. Like a well-oiled machine, everyone carries out their individual chore, so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes. Even the children help out. Tiny 6-year-olds have become experts at plucking chickens, and everyone seems to get along. ""No fighting, never, we are all one family, there's no other people here so we don't fight,"" says sixth grandson Hmingthamzauva, one of the few in the household who speaks English. ""Since we are used to living in a very big family when we go outside to study we actually feel very lonely,"" he says laughing. But while he likes living in a big family, he himself doesn't want more than one wife. ""My grandfather is specially appointed by God to have as many wives as possible and to look after them. But for me, having one wife and one son is quite enough. There is no rule or tradition as such that we have to follow polygamy, for me it's actually unbearable,"" Hmingtahmzauva says. Hmingtahmzauva says his great grandfather Chana, who also had multiple wives, had a spiritual revelation after he was expelled from the Catholic Church for his unusual lifestyle. So Chana created his own polygamist sect, which now has a following of 400 families. Ziona is the caretaker of the self-reliant sect. They grow their own crops and raise their own livestock. ""Everyone has a designated job. Some are doing carpentry work, some take care of the piggery and poultry farm and others cultivate crops,"" Ziona says. He has set up a school nearby for children of the community, the curriculum comes from the government but Ziona has added some sect-specific teachings. ""My father is the greatest god that we can have in this world, he has done so much for us,"" says his eldest son Nunparliana, who has two wives and 14 children. India is set to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2030. But crowding and crumbling infrastructure in India's booming cities don't faze Ziona. ""I'm not troubled by the noise or the overcrowding. My mind remains at peace,"" he says. The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity. But as word gets out, Baktwang village and Ziona's family may not remain so isolated.","One man in India is the patriarch of a family of 160 in rural India .

"(CNN) -- Not so long ago, having a layover between flights was like having skin graft surgery between root canals. That's begun to change. With airport amenities classy enough to impress a card-carrying Kardashian, you might even consider yourself lucky to have a few hours to spare between legs these days -- provided you know where to make your next connection. From bare bones basics like spa services to sustainable gourmet cuisine crafted by celebrity chefs and designer boutiques that wouldn't be out of place on Rodeo Drive, some American airports offer travelers an experience better than certain destinations. San Francisco International Airport (SFO) A $383 million renovation in 2008 turned this airport (most notably, Terminal 2) into an all-in-one luxury destination for shoppers, foodies and art aficionados. Travelers, tourists and locals flock to the SFO Museum. Opened 1980, it was the first museum of its kind located in an international airport and it has only grown since then, having spread throughout all four terminals. From modern photography to Pan-Asian ceramics, a rotating array of exhibitions is designed to intrigue a cross-section of visitors. For those with a tot in tow, there's also a children's museum, complete with art classes and even an aquarium (Terminal 1). The new packet of salty peanuts for the 21st century is caviar, available to go at Simply Gourmet in Terminal 1, along with various truffles, meats and cheeses. Over in T2, Napa Farms Market is a hybrid gourmet food shop/cafe/takeout/wine store curated by Steve Carlin of the famed Oxbow Market. There's also wine bar Vino Volo. Once you've had your fill of sustainable Californian cuisine, Napa Valley wine and San Francisco culture, the International Terminal houses Gucci, Burberry and Swarovski shops as well as an Xpress Spa, in case you need a quick rubdown. Miami International Airport (MIA) Taking the museum-in-airport trend to the next level, MIA too boasts an impressive art collection, one that's reflective of the South Florida community. In fact, Americans for the Arts declared it one of the best public art projects in the nation. And while the dining options fall short of ""fine,"" the best offerings are fresh, delicious and capture the city's festive spirit. Casual Cuban spot Ku-Va (Terminal D) is renown for its ropa vieja and mojitos on the go. On the celebrity chef-helmed side, Lorena Garcia Cocina (also Terminal D) offers ceviche, empanadas and other Latin-influenced fare, much of it scratch-made daily. But where MIA really excels is shopping. Beyond high-end standbys like Hugo Boss, Emporio Armani and Thomas Pink, Terminal G boasts Jack Georges, purveyor of maniacally handcrafted leather goods. Likewise, Terminal D is home to Coco Bay, where ladies of taste can take some laid-back Miami home to their closets. The piece de resistance is The Shoppes at Ocean Drive. A first-of-its-kind retail concept, this 10,000-square-foot luxury mini-mall is curated with Miami's iconic Ocean Drive magazine. Inside you'll find the highest-end apparel and accessories to make those last-minute souvenirs seem thoughtful, and an epic gourmet shop that even sells South Florida's famous stone crabs to go. If all this luxury proves too exhausting, there are three spas on site with services ranging from a 10-minute manicure to a cellulite-reducing galvanic massage at Jetsetter Spa (Terminal H). Logan International Airport, Boston (BOS) Not as overtly luxurious as SFO or MIA, Boston's Logan has its share of topnotch offerings, especially in the eating category. Terminal A has Legal Test Kitchen, a saucy offshoot of the Legal Seafood empire, where innovative technology combines with top-notch ingredients for a trendy and ever-evolving menu with a killer wine list. Meanwhile, James Beard Rising Star Chef Todd English serves his signature Argentinean, European and American fusion at Bonfire Restaurant in Terminal B. Juicy steaks and succulent tacos are crowd pleasers. English also had a hand in developing Ozone, a contemporary cocktail lounge that offers light bites. Then, of course, there's Legal Seafoods itself (Terminal C), where New England's old school, fish-centric fare is the focus. These days, it comes with an allergy-friendly twist. At the entrance to Terminal E, Dine Boston welcomes a new, locally acclaimed chef every three months as part of its visiting chef program. Not only does it keep the menu exciting, a stamped receipt grants diners access to priority security lines. Shopping options aren't vast, but Northeasterners from New York to New Hampshire can't get enough of jewelry designers Alex + Ani, whose Terminal B store glistens with sparkly goods. The Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse (JFK) OK, so John F. Kennedy Airport as a whole could use an overhaul, but trust Richard Branson to be ahead of the curve. His 10,000-square-foot Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse in Terminal 4 cost $7 million to build and the results rival any hip, metropolitan hotel when it comes to style and atmosphere. Signature cocktails invented by top-shelf mixologists and beers tapped from New York's best microbreweries are served to travelers lounging in designer Eames, Saarinen and Jacobsen chairs. Fusion fare is available from the in-house brasserie, which serves smoked haddock frittatas for breakfast and curry spiced grilled tilapia thereafter. For the travel-haggard, stylists from New York's famed Bumble and Bumble salon (where they use their own products, as well as Dr. Haruschka and Truefitt & Hill) are on hand in case you need a haircut or blow dry, and spa services include a free 15-minute massage for paying customers. There are also Mac workstations and a billiards table. With the lone exception of extended spa treatments like deep facials and aromatherapy oil massages, it's all complimentary for Virgin Business Class and Gold Members. Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW) A high-end whimsy is at play in the recently renovated McNamara and North Terminals, making parting with your money in the Motor City far more voluntary than it used to be. Before a glass of northern Michigan red at Vino Volo, layoverers can swing on the PGA Tour Shop's virtual golf simulator in the Central Link Area of the McNamara Terminal, offering a virtual shot at the famous 18 hole at Pebble Beach.

"(CNN) -- Roger Buchko insists he isn't angry about receiving too much junk mail. And the Phillipsburg, New Jersey, native isn't trying to scare anybody off his front lawn. Nor does he say he's trying to send a message -- intimidating, political or otherwise. The only thing Buchko hoped to accomplish by erecting a massive, scale-model .44 Magnum on his front lawn as a mailbox was to drum up business. And that business of course is ... cabinet making? ""If I can show folks I'm capable of this type of craftsmanship,"" Buchko told CNN, ""then I can certainly build them a fancy box."" That's one clever son of a gun. ""I've built some pretty elaborate stuff in my day"" the 49-year-old said of his giant mailbox gun. ""This one was pretty difficult. It's scaled out perfect."" At 10 feet long, 5 feet high and with an 8 and 3/8 inch wide barrel, Buchko says his Smith & Wesson is precisely 11 times bigger than the real thing. And at 350 pounds, it's safe to say it's the heaviest mailbox on the block. Newtown group, others call for Starbucks to ban guns in stores . Buchko said he worked on it in his shop for an hour a day for nearly four months -- using mostly plywood, PVC plastic, oak and mahogany. Reaction has come in from all corners of the globe and from all corners of the gun debate. Buchko, who says he is ""not a gun-toting nitwit or anything like that"" tells CNN his neighbors have mostly been supportive -- and that most of the criticism comes from faraway ""yuppies who don't know anything about guns."" As for the person who has to stare down the barrel of that gun day in and day out? ""My mail lady thinks it's great!"" While his giant gun certainly got Buchko attention, it has yet to get him any business -- any cabinet-making business, that is. He says he's already been approached about building a giant firearm-for-a-mailbox for someone, and that is just fine by him. ""I'd rather build these things than fancy boxes.""

"(CNN) -- Belying his 41 years and 327 days, Chris Horner has defied sporting convention by wrapping up victory in the Tour of Spain Sunday. The American, who rides for the RadioShack-Leopard team, maintained his 37-second advantage over Italian Vincenzo Nibali, the reigning Giro d'Italia champion, after the final stage in Madrid. Home hope Alejandro Valverde, a former winner of La Vuelta, finished third. Australian Michael Matthews won the final stage after a bunch sprint, but all the focus was on Horner in the red jersey of overall leader as he finished safely in the main bunch. At an age when most professional sportsmen are long retired, Horner has claimed one of cycling's three Grand Tours, the other races being the famed Tour de France and the Giro. Initially taking the lead on the third of 21 stages, Horner battled 2010 Vuelta winner Nibali throughout the three-week long endurance test. Nibali went into the final week with a 50-second advantage, but Horner nibbled at the lead until taking it for the final time on Friday's 19th stage. Extending it to over half a minute after the brutal 12km climb to Alto de L'Angliru on the penultimate day, Horner merely had to stay upright on the flat final leg to seal his improbable triumph. ""I have faced younger and great riders like Nibali, Valverde and Joaquim Rodriguez,"" he told gathered reporters. ""They have had a great tour so for me it is a legendary moment that may not be repeated. ""I know I am also the first North American to win the Tour of Spain and this makes me very proud of my work and above all that of my teammates."" Horner is the oldest winner of one of cycling's three majors by some margin. Switzerland's Tony Rominger was eight years younger when winning the Tour of Spain in 1994 and the oldest Tour de France winner is Fermin Lambot, who was 36 when he triumphed in 1922. The oldest rider in today's professional peloton is Germany's Jens Voigt, who turns 42 on Tuesday, but now rides as a support rider for Horner's RadioShack team. Horner, whose best finish in the Tour de France is 10th place, also played a similar role for the now disgraced Lance Armstrong with the Astana and RadioShack squads, but has achieved his best results since his infamous compatriot retired. His La Vuelta heroics have now earned him a place in the sporting record books that will be difficult to match.","41-year-old cyclist wins Tour of Spain .

"(CNN) -- At least 33 people were killed and 26 others hurt on Friday night when a suicide bomber with an explosive vest blew himself up inside an coffee shop where patrons were playing a popular Ramadan game in Kirkuk, Iraq, police said. The explosion occurred in a cafe called Classic, which is in the Wahed Hozyran neighborhood in central Kirkuk about 240 kilometers, or 149 miles, north of Baghdad, according to authorities in Kirkuk and Baghdad. Patrons were playing a game common among Iraqis during Ramadan in which participants must guess whose fist is hiding a small ring. The game, Mahaibes, is played in the evenings when Muslims take a break from their monthlong daylight fasting. The bombing occurred about 10 p.m. Friday local time. The ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk is one of disputed areas claimed by the Iraqi central government and the regional government of ethnic Kurds. Sunni extremists, including al Qaeda groups, have carried out similar attacks during prior Ramadans, but no group claimed the responsibility for the bombing in its immediate aftermath.

"New York (CNN) -- A carpenter whose former Manhattan basement is the scene of an exhaustive search for clues about Etan Patz said Friday through his lawyer that he had no involvement in the 6-year-old boy's disappearance more than three decades ago. Attorney Michael Farkas told CNN that Othniel Miller, 75, who has not been charged with a crime, has long cooperated with authorities and plans to continue to do so. ""Mr. Miller has been cooperating with this investigation for over 30 years,"" said Farkas. ""He has continued to cooperate on multiple occasions. And I am going to assist him in cooperating to the fullest extent possible."" Investigators recently relaunched their probe of the cold case, often described as a milestone effort that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness. Patz disappeared May 25, 1979, a block from his home in the city's SoHo neighborhood. It was the first time he walked to the bus stop by himself. Authorities said both new and old information led them to Miller, a part-time handyman, who met Patz the day before he disappeared and gave him a dollar. Miller faces no charges in connection with the disappearance. Miller's daughter, Stephanie Miller, told CNN affiliate WCBS that her father had cooperated with federal agents, saying he ""doesn't have anything to do with it."" Police and federal agents resumed their search of the Lower Manhattan basement Friday. It was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog about 10 days ago to a SoHo basement, where Patz apparently had encountered the carpenter, then 42, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The dog picked up a human scent in the basement, where the man had a workshop. When agents interviewed the man about his connection to the basement, the source said the carpenter blurted out, ""What if the body was moved?"" Farkas, the attorney, said he will speak to authorities about that alleged remark. ""I don't know that he asked that,"" Farkas told reporters. Late Thursday, authorities set up a grid in the basement and planned to rip up the concrete floor. They also took out part of the back wall of the basement, an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant. The floor was ""newly poured"" at the time Etan disappeared, according to another law enforcement source. It was not dug up during the original investigation. Miller was picked up by the FBI again Thursday, but is not in custody. He was questioned and returned to his Brooklyn apartment, the source with knowledge of the investigation said. ""We're looking for human remains, clothing or other personal effects of Etan Patz,"" New York police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said of the current investigation. ""It's a very painstaking process."" In 2010, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said his office decided to take another look at the decades-old mystery. FBI leads were then culled from that case file, sources said. The investigation garnered national headlines as authorities splashed the child's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information, then a novel approach. Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, said the investigation into the decades-old disappearance is ""very encouraging."" ""We think it sends a message to searching families everywhere that just because it's been a month, or year or 10 years or even 33 years you never close the case until you learn with certainty what happened,"" Allen told CNN. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million. He never paid the money. Though Ramos has been considered a key focus of the probe for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year sentence in a Pennsylvania prison for molesting another boy and is set to be released later this year. A source said investigators now also want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond Ramos. Stan and Julie Patz, Etan's parents, still live a block away from the scene and wouldn't comment on the new developments. A notice on the apartment building said, ""To the hardworking and patient media people: The answer to all your questions at this time is 'no comment.' Please stop ringing our bell and calling for interviews."" Lisa Cohen, the author of ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive,"" told CNN that ""the family's been living through this for 33 years. They've had many moments like this. They've learned how to deal with it."" Dozens of police and federal agents gathered outside the building on Manhattan's Prince Street on Thursday and are expected to continue their search over the next five days. FBI Special Agent Peter Donald said the bureau's Evidence Recovery Team is at the scene. ""We are cautiously optimistic"" that the search will be helpful,"" FBI Special Agent Tim Flannelly said. Forensic evidence uncovered at the scene will be analyzed at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, sources said. It is not clear whether authorities searched the basement in 1979, though a source said it ""figured into"" the investigation. Authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy's remains at that location, though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out, according to two sources familiar with the probe. ""I hope they find something,"" said resident Sean Sweeney, who says he's lived in the neighborhood since 1976. SoHo, a Lower Manhattan neighborhood now known for its boutique shops, art galleries and loft apartments, at the time was considered a grittier locale, where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets. Sweeney said he remembers the initial investigation into Etan's disappearance when police first knocked on his door in search of clues. ""That's odd, isn't it,"" he said, referring to the fact that 33 years later, police are again in his neighborhood searching for the boy. On the day of his disappearance, Etan's mother, Julie Patz, learned after her son failed to return home from school that he hadn't been in classes that day. She called the school, then called the homes of all his friends. When she found no one who had seen her son, she called police and filed a missing person report. By evening, more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found. The boy's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, National Missing Children's Day. CNN's Tom Foreman contributed to this report.","New York carpenter said he had no involvement in child's disappearance .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A huge explosion rocked the area near the U.S. consulate in Afghanistan's Herat province early Friday during a heavy gunfight between militants and security forces, officials said. The attack occurred just before 6 a.m. local time when attackers sped towards the front gate of the consulate, said Marie Harf, a deputy State Department spokeswoman. The attackers fired assault rifles starting a gun battle with Afghan security forces. During the battle, a truck exploded, Harf said, causing major damage to the front gate of the consulate. American consulate personnel took shelter in safe havens while U.S. security forces responded to the attack, Harf said. There were no U.S. casualties. Seven attackers traveling in two vehicles took part in the assault and all of them were killed, said Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, deputy Afghan Interior Minister. Three people, two local police officers and a local security guard, were killed, police and hospital officials said. Twenty others were injured. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in an e-mail to CNN. According to the SITE intelligence group, the Taliban said it killed and wounded dozens of International Security Assistance Force and Afghan soldiers. It said nine Taliban fighters died. Another communique said the Taliban was behind a suicide bombing that killed dozens of Afghans in Paktika, SITE reported. U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham condemned the attack and lamented the Afghan citizens who lost their lives. ""Many Afghan civilians were killed in the attack, along with others who work for the Consulate as contractors.

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber endured a frustrating first test outing in the new Red Bull on Wednesday as his world champion teammate Sebastian Vettel was again near the top of the Formula One timesheets in Spain. Vettel finished top in Tuesday's opening session of 2011 after completing 93 laps in Valencia, and the German was second-best behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso following another 44 laps at the wheel of the RB7. Webber, however, was back in a lowly 14th after being able to drive just 17 laps of the circuit. ""I didn't get so long in the car today, so we will start the real work tomorrow,"" the Australian, who finished third overall in the drivers' championship, told the official F1 website. ""There was a bit of a problem with the installation, something with the pedals, so it took a bit longer than we expected.

"(CNN) -- Claudene Christian dreamed of living a seafaring life like the historic HMS Bounty naval officer who shared her name centuries ago. She'd secured a spot as a crew member on a replica of the Bounty and had announced it proudly on her Facebook page. But less than six months after joining the ship, her dream was cut short. As Hurricane Sandy approached the East Coast, its powerful winds swirled up waves that crippled the three-masted, 180-foot Bounty off North Carolina's coast, forcing the 16-member crew to abandon ship. That's when the waves swept Christian overboard, along with the Bounty's captain and another crew member early Monday, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Robert Parker told CNN. That crew member made it to a lifeboat; Christian's body was found on Monday evening. Capt. Robin Waldridge remains missing. Christian, 42, often said she was related to Fletcher Christian, the 18th-century sailor blamed for leading the infamous mutiny on the real HMS Bounty. Grueling recovery begins . In May, Christian won a deckhand job on the Bounty replica, which was built for ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" a 1962 film starring Marlon Brando. The tall ship also appeared in several other movies, including Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. ""I wasn't sure if they'd take me because I didn't have a sailing background,"" she told a Canadian newspaper in August, ""although I've been totally interested in it all my life."" She boasted about the Bounty and her new assignment to her friends and family, describing the ship as a ""sailing museum"" on her Facebook page. On Twitter, Christian announced ""I am in love with my ship ... BOUNTY"" Seeing it as an opportunity to share ""our ship and our history,"" she posted, ""I'm sure my ancestor would be proud..."" The ship, she hoped, would begin more efforts toward educating schoolchildren, she told reporters. ""Claudene had a huge caring heart,"" Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, Sheriff Ron Lockhart told CNN affiliate KFSM. Christian once lived in Vian, Oklahoma. ""She will be missed."" Sandy changes lives forever . Christian may have been a sailing novice, but she was no stranger to adventure. A former Miss Teen Alaska, she decided to start her own business at 17 and headed to California, as she describes on her Cheerleader Doll Company website, ""fresh out of Alaska and on my own in the Big City of LA."" Once there, she attended the University of Southern California where friends tweeted that she performed as a ""USC Song Girl."" ""She was always staying busy and active at things,"" her aunt, Patricia Saulsberry, told KFSM. Photos: Aftermath of Superstorm Sandy . Christian's interest in the Bounty began after she toured a replica of Christopher Columbus' Nina on the Arkansas River last year, Saulsberry said. The Bounty tragedy began when the ship, which was sailing from Connecticut to St. Petersburg, Florida, reported Monday that it had lost power and was taking on water about 125 miles off North Carolina. Water poured in through the hull of the 50-year-old wooden ship, the Bounty's owner, Bob Hansen, told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""They just couldn't stay afloat anymore,"" he said. Early Monday, the U.S. Coast Guard staged a daring helicopter rescue: They flew into the hurricane's outer bands and plucked 14 of the surviving crew members from two lifeboats. A short distance away, the HMS Bounty sank to the bottom of the Atlantic, as Hurricane Sandy marched north. All of the crew members were wearing orange survival suits with strobe lights designed to keep them afloat, warm and easy to find. Coast Guard ships continue to search a 1,300-mile area around the site of the shipwreck for Waldridge, 63. On Tuesday, the Coast Guard reported the water temperature was 77 degrees with 15-foot waves and 42-mph winds. Even with a survival suit, ""it's very problematic"" to stay in position in heavy winds and rough seas, Parker said. Sandy's impact state by state . The Bounty set sail Thursday, as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba with an uncertain path after that. Nevertheless, people have posted pointed questions on the Bounty's Facebook page suggesting Waldridge shouldn't have been sailing through such a violent storm. Hansen noted that the captain took the ship ""way out east,"" trying to steer around Sandy. ""He knows the ship, he's been captain of her for over 20 years and nobody knows her better,"" Hansen said. ""I totally trusted his judgment."" Waldridge is a good-natured, mild-mannered captain who has a special bond with the Bounty, according to Susan Robertson, who has known him since 2001. ""Other than his wife, he acts like it's his first love,"" said Robertson, who works at The Pier in St. Petersburg, where the Bounty is often docked. The ship's crew, she said ""are like members of your own family."" ""I hope they find him,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- There is no reason Marissa Alexander should spend the next 20 years in prison. If you are the most hardened law-and-order person in the world, even you should have some compassion for Alexander, the Jacksonville, Florida, woman who has been struck by the ridiculous Florida law known as 10-20-life. The law requires anyone convicted of an aggravated assault when a firearm is discharged to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison with no regard to extenuating circumstances. Alexander says that on August 1, 2010, her husband went into a rage and tried to strangle her after reading some text messages she sent to her ex-husband. She fled the family home, got to the garage and realized she didn't have her keys. Fearing for her life, she says she grabbed a gun and went back into the home to retrieve her keys. She says her husband threatened to kill her, and to keep him at bay, she fired a warning shot into a wall. Why was she charged, convicted and sentenced? Because State Attorney Angela Corey, the same prosecutor leading the Trayvon Martin case, said the gun was fired near a bedroom where two children were and they could have been injured. Did the bullet hit the children? No. Did Alexander point the gun at her husband and hit him? No. She simply fired a warning shot, and according to Florida's shameful law, that's enough for a minimum 20-year sentence. Corey offered Alexander a three-year sentence in a plea bargain, but Alexander felt she had done nothing wrong and so rejected the plea. In sentencing her, the judge made it clear that, despite all the pleas for mercy, including one from Alexander's 11-year-old daughter who took the stand, he was left with no choice but to send Alexander to jail for at least 20 years. Alexander tried to invoke Florida's controversial stand your ground law in her defense, but that was rejected. Critics of the law's role in the Martin case have said this shows how the law is applied unevenly. But the real issue here isn't the faulty stand your ground law. It's the ridiculous mandatory minimum sentences that have been approved by countless state legislatures and Congress. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (PDF) that the federal sentencing guidelines in some types of cases should not be seen as mandatory but as ""advisory,"" giving judges the leeway (PDF) to consider multiple factors before sentencing someone. In a 2003 speech to the American Bar Association, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy railed against federal mandatory minimums, saying, ""Our resources are misspent, our punishment too severe, our sentences too long."" ""I can accept neither the necessity nor the wisdom of federal mandatory minimum sentences,"" Kennedy said. ""In too many cases, mandatory minimum sentences are unwise or unjust."" Unfortunately, on the state level, far too many law-and-order legislators, most with no courtroom or law enforcement experience, enact such laws without giving any thought to potential cases like Alexander's. The 10-20-life policy has no business in the laws of Florida or any other state. Judges should have the discretion to consider a variety of factors in sentencing, and I have no doubt had this judge been given flexibility, Alexander wouldn't be going to prison for 20 years. These types of injustices are common in our legal system, and it is necessary for everyone with a conscience to stand up and decry these so-called legislative remedies that end up as nightmares. Alexander was a woman trying to flee an enraged husband. She could have easily pointed the gun at him and pleaded self-defense, and like George Zimmerman, the shooter in the Martin case who was not initially charged, Alexander might never have been arrested. Our prison systems are overcrowded, and folks like Marissa Alexander do not belong in them. One hopes that Florida Gov. Rick Scott will find some compassion and grant Alexander a pardon, and the Florida Legislature will revise the law to prevent future miscarriages of justice. Florida elected officials and residents should be ashamed of this law and do all they can to change it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Marissa Alexander a victim of mandatory minimums .

"(CNN) -- April 19 was perhaps the most harrowing day in the history of Watertown, Massachusetts -- the suburb where the manhunt for Boston Marathon bombing suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev came to separate, bloodied conclusions. The numerous law enforcement agencies involved in the pursuit of the Tsarnaevs tracked the brothers to a residential Watertown neighborhood in the early-morning hours. The ensuing shootout ended with older brother, Tamerlan, dead, transit officer Richard Donohue seriously wounded and another 15 police officers injured. A wounded Dzhokhar Tsarnaev surrendered later that evening from a boat parked in a Watertown yard. Countless news cameras and smartphones captured images of the fear, valor and elation experienced in Watertown on that Friday; and now officials are looking for the best of those images for a 2014 calendar. ""While we will never be able to put into words our gratitude for what our police did, we can try to let the photos from that night in April speak for themselves,"" Watertown Police Foundation board member Steve Messina said in a statement. ""This calendar is meant to capture the best of those `snapshots' all in one place while also continuing to raise funds for the work that our police do."" The foundation's website invites Watertown residents to submit photos of the ""dramatic confrontation with the Marathon bombing suspects, pursuit and arrest."" Leaked photos of the younger Tsarnaev's capture landed a Massachusetts State Police photographer in hot water back in July. Sgt. Sean Murphy provided Boston magazine with the unauthorized photos after Rolling Stone magazine put Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on its cover. Murphy called the cover ""an insult"" because, in his view, it didn't portray Dzhokhar Tsarnaev the right way. He was briefly suspended and has since been reassigned. His actions are being investigated. The foundation website also suggests photos of ""the cheering afterwards, the tributes, parades, prayers, hugs and celebrations since. Interesting photos, compelling photos, preferably positive photos of the pride we all have in our Watertown Police and our town."" Proceeds from the $13 calendar will go toward ""worthwhile projects that support the work of the Watertown Police,"" according to a press release. The deadline for photo submissions is September 30. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200. He is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the April 15 attack, when a pair of bombs went off near the finish line of the packed course. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer was killed three days later at the start of the dramatic chase that led to Tsarnaev's capture.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured in Watertown; brother died in shootout .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A Libyan woman who stormed into a Tripoli hotel Saturday, telling foreign reporters that she had been raped by government troops, has been released, and her case is being investigated, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Sunday. The matter is ""a criminal case against four individuals"" who have an attorney, he said. Among those accused by Eman al-Obeidy is the son of a high-ranking official, he said. The general attorney is looking into the case. The woman ""hasn't committed, you know, any particular major offense,"" Ibrahim said. ""She just entered a place she wasn't supposed to enter."" He said al-Obeidy and her family have been asked if they want to be interviewed by ""one or two, preferably female, reporters to verify that she's fine, she's healthy, she's free with her family."" But Ibrahim refused to take further questions on the issue Sunday, noting that Libyan society is ""very conservative."" CNN's Nic Robertson, who has been on the ground in Tripoli since February 27, cautioned against taking Ibrahim's statements as fact, noting that ""oftentimes what he says doesn't match reality."" ""We've been told by the government that she's with her family, but when we asked, 'Could we go and see them?' the government official said that would be up to the family,"" Robertson said, adding that journalists have indeed been in touch with the family, who have said they would grant permission to see al-Obeidy. However, international journalists, including CNN's staff, are not allowed to move freely in the Libyan capital and are escorted out of the hotel only on organized outings by government minders. Saturday's incident was the first time a Libyan opposed to Gadhafi attempted to independently approach the journalists in Tripoli. Robertson also tried to ask Ibrahim about statements the spokesman made referring to al-Obeidy as a prostitute, but he declined to answer the question while saying, ""I'm not withdrawing from what I said."" ""We need to protect her privacy, her daughter's rights when she grows up,"" Ibrahim said. ""We need to make this as criminal case, as legal a case as possible without talking about people's history, their files, their previous crimes or their lifestyle."" Wedad Omar, the woman's cousin, told CNN that the 30-year-old al-Obeidy is single and does not have a daughter. Al-Obeidy burst into the hotel Saturday as international journalists were having breakfast. Her face was bruised, as were her legs. She showed the journalists blood on her right inner thigh. Speaking in English, she said she was from the rebel stronghold of Benghazi and had been held against her will for two days and raped by 15 men. ""Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me,"" she said. ""My honor was violated by them."" She displayed what appeared to be visible rope burns on her wrists and ankles. CNN could not independently verify al-Obeidy's story, but her injuries appeared consistent with what she said. Government officials moved to stifle her, but she persisted. Security forces moved to subdue her, and even a member of the hotel's kitchen staff drew a knife. ""Traitor!"" he shouted at her. Another staffer attempted to throw a dark tablecloth over her head. One government official, who was there to facilitate access for journalists, pulled a pistol from his belt. Others scuffled with the journalists and wrestled them to the ground in an attempt to take away their equipment. Some journalists were beaten and kicked. CNN's camera was confiscated and deliberately smashed beyond repair. Security men said al-Obeidy was ""mentally ill"" and was being taken to a ""hospital"" as they dragged her to a waiting white car. She insisted she was being taken to jail, saying, ""If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it."" Officials later said the woman was sane and would bring criminal charges against her attackers.

"(CNN) -- Up to 37 people died Friday after a fire tor through a psychiatric institution in Russia, a regional branch of the country's Investigative Committee said, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. A representative of Russia's Emergencies Ministry gave a different toll, telling the news agency that 15 bodies had been recovered and 22 people were still missing after the fire outside the central Russian city of Veliky Novgorod. A criminal case has been opened to look into the cause of the fire, according to a statement on the Investigative Committee's website. A total of 59 people were inside the building when the fire broke out, the Health Ministry said, according to RIA Novosti. The Emergencies Ministry said 23 people have been rescued, according to the news agency. Police are searching the area for residents who may have fled the site, it said. The fire broke out shortly before 3 a.m. Moscow time in the men's ward of the Oksochi mental health care clinic, state-run Itar-Tass reported. The facility is a low-level wooden building. The fire has been extinguished, the news agency said, and dozens of emergency personnel are working at the scene. In April, a fire at another psychiatric hospital near the capital, Moscow, left 38 people dead. President Vladimir Putin called for an investigation and a closer focus on fire safety in hospitals after that blaze.

"(CNN) -- Full disclosure: I have loved watching the Olympics on television since Munich 1972 and thoroughly enjoyed being in the cities for the run-up to Torino 2006 and London 2012. Costs be damned. Well, not really. But those who moan and groan about the ""costs"" of the Olympic movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city. Tokyo is a great, safe and hopefully cost effective choice to host the 2020 Summer Games. The Japanese capital achieved a crushing victory over rivals Istanbul and Madrid in Saturday's final International Olympic Committee (IOC) vote. As the Financial Times notes, the current budget projections are 0.2% of 2012 GDP. Plus, more than half of the $8 billion build-out cost projections is already set aside, the new hosts tell us. Construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts. Architects have already been hard at work. Full-time and part-time jobs will be created. Sure, the budget will rise. It always does. London tripled its initial budget estimates to $14 billion for the construction, security etc. and privately raised $3 billion or so to stage the games, from corporate sponsors, ticket sales and broadcasting rights. Construction money came from taxpayers and lottery funding. In fact, once London confirmed its final budget about five years before the Games, it stuck to it. It can be done. Now, Winter Olympics are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs. Many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places. Let's hope Sochi's $10bn budget (or more) is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year-round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a Formula One grand prix. And yes, you can always point to the abysmal state Montreal was left it with its stadium after 1976. It took something like 30 years to pay off. Montreal is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow. It has rightfully scared the IOC and host cities into getting it right, or face financial headaches for years to come. Athens 2004 was also a prescription for how not to do it. Expensive white elephants still sit idle. The last minute ""Mediterranean"" rush to finish off some venues and infrastructure plans inevitably lead to higher costs. Atlanta '96 was no great success either, but for the start of the trend to plan the use of big venues, before the Games began. The Olympic Stadium was partially knocked down and used by the city's popular baseball team. Beijing and London went in other ways -- new stadia for the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics -- with a vow to keep the spirit of the Olympics in the building's bones. While Beijing's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction, London's will be home to a mix of football, athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes, lots of tourists. Speaking of tourists, those who stayed from London in droves last summer, were here this summer, I can tell you. I have not suffered from London being so busy as July and August just gone. London also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city. Sure, the poor in the area should have had that already, but now they do; along with new schools, swimming pools and housing. Could Olympic money be ""spent"" in better ways? Not likely. Governments often go over budget and over time when undertaking large infrastructure projects. The Olympics give cities one big, wonderful immoveable objective; a deadline. As Rio is now learning, there is no pressure like the pressure of IOC inspectors.","Tokyo will host the Olympic Games for the second time in 2020 .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, the woman who says forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi raped her, is grateful for support she has received, said CNN's Nic Robertson, who met briefly with her Wednesday. ""She is a very strong lady who told me to thank all (the) people who have stopped her case from disappearing,"" Robertson said. Al-Obeidy said she had a message for humanitarian organizations: They should come to Tripoli and ""see how life is here,"" he said. She said she is still recovering physically from the alleged assault and displayed faded bruises and rope burn marks on her wrists, Robertson said. But, she told him, she is unable to leave Tripoli and be reunited with her family and faces abuse whenever she leaves her house, he said. The Libyan government is insisting on a review of the interview by a government representative before transmission. The review was scheduled Wednesday night, but an apparently imminent airstrike postponed the review until Thursday morning. Meanwhile, al-Obeidy's mother said Wednesday that talking to her daughter by telephone Tuesday night was an emotional experience. ""Of course, I felt worse,"" Aisha Ahmad said. ""Because she was crying. I couldn't understand a word because she was crying. She even made me cry."" The two women spoke on Tuesday. Al-Obeidy told her mother that a court employee pulled a weapon on her when she went to a courthouse. The 29-year-old law school graduate burst into a Tripoli hotel last month to tell her story to journalists. Authorities rushed her away from the hotel, but she is no longer in custody. Still, she told CNN's ""AC360"" Tuesday she fears for her safety in Tripoli, which she called a ""large prison."" She said authorities had taken her passport and were not letting her cross into Tunisia. Al-Obeidy: Tripoli is a prison . Al-Obeidy said she spent 72 hours under interrogation after being dragged away from the Tripoli hotel where she tried to tell journalists about her alleged abuse. She has said the public statements from a state TV anchor and government officials, who initially called her mentally ill, drunk and a prostitute, have ruined her reputation. Ahmad, who lives in the eastern Libyan city of Tobruk, said her daughter told her in the call ""she was trapped. She said, 'They're taking me back and forth, interrogating me, hitting me.' She said, 'They want to kill me. Help me, come and get me,' she said. 'Where are the human rights groups?' "" Asked how she is coping, Ahmad said, ""Our hope in God is very strong."" She told her daughter Tuesday that the world is praying for her and not to be afraid. All eyes on Eman al-Obeidy . On whether she has a message for those who might be listening, Ahmad said, ""I want [President] Obama and all the Western world to get involved and bring me back my daughter. Just bring her back to me. I would like to tell the mothers all over the world, and the Arab world, that if something happens to someone, they need to speak out. They just need to speak out."" Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli, held against her will for two days and was beaten and raped by 15 men. When CNN saw her in March, al-Obeidy's legs and face were bruised and she had blood on her right inner thigh. Her visible injuries appeared to support her allegations. Human Rights Watch, in a statement Wednesday, called for Libyan authorities to immediately allow al-Obeidy to leave Tripoli and receive medical care. Nadya Khalife, the Middle East women's rights researcher for the organization, said authorities have further victimized al-Obeidy by refusing to allow her to leave Tripoli. When rape is a tool of war . ""It's very difficult for women in Libyan society to report that they have been raped because of the shame and fear they feel, and it has been even more difficult for al-Obeidy,"" Khalife said.

"(CNN) -- The last time Ben Affleck played a superhero, the world cried. The year was 2003, and the movie was ""Daredevil"" -- a Hollywood fail that even Affleck has insinuated he'd rather forget. So is it any wonder that within hours of Warner Bros. announcing the actor was going to play Batman in the upcoming ""Man of Steel"" sequel, Twitter immediately tried to recast the part using the hashtag #BetterBatmanThanBenAffleck. (Suggestions have included ""the drunken hobo who lives under the overpass,"" the dog from ""Air Bud"" and ""Manti Te'o's girlfriend."") But in the eyes of some critics, the 41-year-old Oscar winner may not be such a bad choice. Let's not forget that Affleck has turned a career corner since his ""annus horribilis"" -- the year that sparked ""Daredevil"" and that other movie that had film fans writing him off, ""Gigli."" He recovered from that valley slowly but surely, and went on to direct and star in standouts like 2010's ""The Town"" and 2012's ""Argo,"" the latter of which won an Oscar for best picture. From actor to auteur: Ben Affleck's career trajectory . Knowing that, Yahoo! Movies thinks ""we owe Ben the benefit of the doubt"" given that ""the guy has made quite the comeback lately."" And there's also the possibility that he's learned from his mistakes with ""Daredevil"" -- the faults of which, notes CraveOnline, don't rest completely on Affleck's shoulders. Now that he's an older, more seasoned actor who's shown himself to be a wizard in the director's chair, maybe ""Man of Steel 2"" director Zack Snyder's assessment isn't so far off: . ""Ben provides an interesting counter-balance to Henry (Cavill)'s Superman,"" Snyder said in a statement. ""He has the acting chops to create a layered portrayal of a man who is older and wiser than Clark Kent and bears the scars of a seasoned crime fighter, but retain the charm that the world sees in billionaire Bruce Wayne."" If anything, says The Wall Street Journal, Affleck is ""too perfect for the role."" ""He has it all,"" says WSJ's Michael Calia.""The shoulder-heavy jock's physique, the chiseled facial features set to brood, the experience playing a tough but haunted leading character. It's yet another example of competent and professional, if uninspired, Batman casting. ... (It's) better than Hollywood forcing another nondescript young hunk on us."" Film School Rejects disagrees with those who call the decision ho-hum, arguing that ""Affleck as Batman in 'Man of Steel 2' is actually some pretty exciting casting news. ... (A)fter more than a year of rumors and speculation that he would be directing their Justice League ensemble (movie) and/or possibly playing the Caped Crusader in it, this seems to be an equally interesting announcement."" Affleck as Batman? 'No, nyet, never!' From the perspective of the studio, Warner Bros. (which shares a parent company with CNN), Affleck's casting is ""a major win,"" The Wrap says. The move not only shows that the now-back-on-top star ""still has faith in the studio,"" but it also paves the way ""for several potential superhero collaborations."" That idea is probably making several Bruce Wayne fans cringe as they hurry to sign a petition begging Warner Bros. to drop Affleck from the role. But maybe, just maybe, Affleck won't be as horrible as everyone is anticipating. After all, he's proven us wrong before.","Casting of Ben Affleck as Batman has sparked immense backlash .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- On Sept. 12, 2009, frustrated tea party citizens from across the country marched upon the Capitol in Washington, energized by a shared sense of disenfranchisement in the political system and anger at a federal government they believed was taxing too much and racking up a dangerous amount of debt. Two years later, much has changed. A powerful coalition of tea-party-backed freshmen walks the halls of Congress, where they have unsettled the establishment and pushed their own party to the right. On the campaign trail, the support of tea party groups has helped launch campaigns and is a force candidates ignore at their peril. For those who doubt the movement has moved toward the mainstream, the Tea Party Express will join CNN on Monday night to host a nationally televised forum where eight GOP presidential candidates will vie for tea party support. The loose affiliation of activists is making the transition from upstart outsiders to a force trying to affect change from within, putting different pressures and expectancies on the movement. ""We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else,"" said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country. ""We're a get-out-the-vote machine. We're organizing at the community level."" Expanding on its 2010 congressional election victories, the tea party has become a major factor in the presidential race this election cycle. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney acknowledged its reach in early September, when he rearranged his schedule last-minute to speak at two tea party events. Candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul have enjoyed strong early support from tea party groups and are working to leverage that momentum into victories in states such as South Carolina. Tea Party Express Co-Chairman Amy Kremer said as the movement continues to mature, tea partiers are increasingly recognizing their activism can change outcomes in Washington. The bloc has become so powerful, she said, that a Republican could not win his or her party's nomination without tea party support. ""We're not going to sit back and just let the Republican party hand us the nominee,"" she said. ""We're going to choose the nominee."" Though tea party leaders maintain the movement will not become a political party and comprises activists of all political stripes, Kremer said most tea partiers expected better from their GOP elected officials. ""We're sick and tired of the Republican Party handing us candidates who are not true conservatives,"" she said. ""And that's what this movement stands for."" The question now is whether the tea party will push candidates far enough to the right during the primaries that it could hurt their chances at winning a general election. The failed Senate candidacies of tea-party-backed Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware may stand as a warning. The hard-line, no-compromise stance tea party freshmen took on deeper spending cuts in Washington this year in the debt ceiling deal may have hurt the group's standing among Americans. A Wall Street Journal poll from August found the number of voters with a ""very negative"" view of the tea party had doubled since January, rising from 15 to 29 percent. In the end the party establishment prevailed with a deal that would make some cuts and put others in the hands of a bipartisan committee of 12 members of Congress. Kibbe said that unswerving dedication to political ideals could be the tea party's ""Achilles heel"" in the presidential election, where simply refusing to accept the GOP candidate could force the group into irrelevancy. ""When you're fighting congressional and House seats you can choose your champions, you can choose your battles, you can fight this race and not that race,"" he said. ""When it comes down to the question of voting for President Obama or voting for the Republican nominee, I think Tea Partiers have a challenge, and that's why we've weighed in on this conversation early so we have a better choice."" The early involvement may prove to have heightened importance this election cycle if the Republican Party begins to coalesce around the candidate they feel can best defeat President Barack Obama, said Pat Griffin, a GOP strategist and senior fellow at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm who is not affiliated in the presidential race. ""Ideology always trumps electability in a primary,"" he said. ""But with each passing day as the president's numbers appear to get worse, Republicans are looking at each other and saying, hmm, we really have a chance to win this thing."" Griffin said that could make members of the party more cautious in choosing a nominee. ""I'm starting to hear for the first time, we've got to be careful about the ideology,"" he said. ""Winning the nomination is only half the game. This is about winning back the White House."" Griffin expects eventually both the GOP party establishment and tea party voters will come around to support the party's candidate so long as they see winning back the White House as a real possibility. Whatever the outcome, don't count the tea party out, he said. Despite many predictions that the movement had reached its peak, the tea party continues to be a relevant force because it is based upon sustained anger among the electorate, said Griffin. ""The tea party is an organic movement that was largely created by people who were frustrated by Washington,"" he said. ""There's not much you can do about something that's genuine, something that grew organically. You cannot crush that out given the noise coming out of Washington these days.""","CNN sponsoring Republican presidential candidates debate with Tea Party Express .

"(CNN) -- Where there's wind and water in Marseille, you are likely to find ""Les Mouss."" Three brothers with a passion for windsurfing, and a love for their native south of France. They train together at home, travel the world together for competitions, and they also party together. The siblings still live near each other in a port city known for, among other things, its ProvenÃ§al fish stew bouillabaisse and being the birthplace of soccer superstar Zinedine Zidane. ""At the beginning we were football players,"" Cyril Moussilmani says of his younger twin siblings Sylvain and Benoit. ""From the age of 10 I started windsurfing and two years later my brothers followed me. Now we do everything together. We still see each other pretty much every day."" Several members of a family competing in the same professional sport are rare. The Sutters from Canada were one such exception, with six of the older generation playing in the National Hockey League -- which has also featured the four Staal brothers. Baseball's Molina boys, meanwhile, each won the World Series while the three DiMaggios were all MLB All-Stars. The Moussilmanis aren't quite so high profile, but they are happy in their niche. Their parents separated 25 years ago, but they were able to stay with their mom close to the beach. ""It's very nice because first of all for training, it's very important for me and them because we can compare speed,"" Cyril, the oldest of the trio at 33 and most accomplished, told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""As well, when the motivation isn't really here for me or them, one goes sailing and you say, 'Oh, I'm not going to let him go alone for training.' We help each other a lot."" That also applies to looking for sponsors, and it's apparent that a bit of banter between the siblings is never too far away. When Sylvain is asked what Cyril would be if not a windsurfer, the 32-year-old replies with a laugh, ""Nothing."" Cyril, a world champion in 2008 in the speed discipline and known in his sport as ""the Flying Frenchman,"" can still remember the day windsurfing caught his attention. He was nine and walking in Marseille with his parents when he spotted people sailing, and decided he wanted to give it a try. Not long after, he began to take lessons and his interest has never diminished. ""You get the feeling to glide on the water and this is very special,"" he says. ""It's what I like in the sport. ""Even now sometimes I go sailing and I say, 'It's not my job. It's just what I like to do.'"" The only negative, he says, is lugging around all the heavy equipment -- Cyril routinely tests gear in the off-season for the development of his own brand, and owns 15 boards and 20 sails. ""When we travel, three of us, it's like almost one ton, so it's really hard,"" he says, laughing. Having won the world speed title, Cyril finished third in the slalom rankings in 2010 and fourth last year, and is fifth so far in 2013 -- all the while trying to live up to his slogans of ""do the best"" and ""be a machine."" France is a country excelling in slalom, with Antoine Albeau a multiple world champion and holding top spot in the rankings currently. Julien Quentel is ranked second. Sylvain and Benoit have yet to match their brother, lying 20th and 27th in the slalom rankings respectively. ""We have people with talent, people who work and people with talent who work -- and Cyril is a person with talent who works,"" says Sylvain. Benoit adds: ""Cyril loves windsurfing, competition. For sure he's very focused on it compared to me and Sylvain."" Cyril says windsurfing is like a mixture of several different sports -- a combination of the laidback nature of surfing and the formality of sailing. ""It's tricky because you have the freedom of a wild sport, but on the other side you have the sailing part,"" he says. ""It's mixing between the two so you have the free spirit of 'party' and enjoying life, and the sailing part is more strict and more square."" Exerting all parts of your body is the norm and like skiing, different disciplines exist. The oldest Moussilmani brother spends three to five hours a day on the water and puts in 10-15 hours a week in the gym. The website of the Professional Windsurfing Association lists rankings in slalom, freestyle and wave but competitors can participate, too, in super x -- combining freestyle and slalom -- and speed. Windsurfing retained its Olympic status after originally being replaced by kiteboarding, although Cyril doesn't expect to be in Rio in three years because the board used is different to the one he trains with. He began competing in earnest as a 16-year-old in Australia and has tried his hand in many of the sport's formats, concentrating on slalom for competition and wave for fun. But despite enjoying his travels, Moussilmani is always happy to be back in Marseille. ""I like to stay home because we have a lot of wind almost all year,"" he says. ""Maybe in the summer it's a little tricky because it's very warm and a lot of people are on the beach, but during the rest of the season it's a very clement place to windsurf. ""When we have big storms we have waves, but most of the time it's choppy, so that's the only bad point about Marseille. But around Marseille there are two or three spots where you can do waves in proper conditions and you can travel as well. ""I like to go when it's super-strong wind and just be on the edge. When I do wave I like to show to everybody what we do -- we jump very high and we do loops. I like to be a little bit like a showman.""","Windsurfing is a family affair for Cyril Moussilmani and his younger twin brothers .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- There's a new distinction in the strife between Israel and Gaza-based armed groups -- Israel's portable anti-rocket system called the Iron Dome. With the ability to effectively take down mid-range rockets targeted at Israeli cities, and with a success rate of over 90%, the system is helping Israel offset the most widespread threat to its citizens in recent years, according to Israeli officials. Thirty-seven rockets fired out of Gaza towards Israeli cities have been intercepted since Friday, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said Sunday. ""I must point out that the Iron Dome system has proven itself very well and we will, of course, see to its expansion in the months and years ahead. We will do everything in our power to expand the deployment of this system,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday at his cabinet meeting. Casualties mount in attacks between Gaza, Israel . First deployed in April 2011, the Iron Dome system targets incoming rockets it identifies as possible threats to city centers and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in mid-air. Each battery is equipped with an interception management center to calculate the expected location of impact, and to prioritize targets according to pre-defined targets. The battery also has firing-control radar used to identify targets, and a portable missile launcher. The makers of the system praise its mobility, with just a few hours required to relocate and set up, thereby enabling the Israeli military to adjust itself on multiple fronts. Israeli officials say although the system currently is deployed near three major cities in the south of Israel, it is capable of handling missile threats in other fronts if needed. But such protection comes at a price. Developed by Israel's defense technology company Rafael, the system carries an the estimated cost for each battery of tens of millions of dollars. Each ""Tamir"" interception missile used by the system comes at a price of no less than $62,000. While the initial development of the system was a sole Israeli enterprise, the system is now heavily sponsored by the United States. In May of 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a plan to allocate $205 million for Israel's Iron Dome system. Israel currently has three Iron Dome batteries and is scheduled to receive a fourth in the coming months. According to Israeli media, Israel plans to deploy a total of nine batteries by 2013. A defense ministry official told CNN that Israel would need up to 13 batteries to completely cover all its borders. But how important is the Iron Dome for Israel? According to former Israeli ambassador to the United States Dore Gold, the Iron Dome system could potentially be a real game-changer. ""The most important question is how would the Iron Dome affect the decisions of Hamas leaders and their Iranian supporters? While Hamas rockets are aimed primarily to target civilians and terrorize the Israeli home front, a secondary and just important aim is to hit strategic sites in the future. Eliminating the ability to hit strategic targets may lead Hamas to rethink the efficiency of acquiring the rockets it has used in the past,"" Gold said. Visiting an Iron Dome battery Saturday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak gave an insight into the broader advantages of defensive skills. ""This system is part of a wider multi-layer interception system, which not only protects our citizens but also allows freedom of activity for the IDF and political leadership. This is crucial as we face threats from all around us,"" Barak said.","The Iron Dome system targets incoming rockets and fires missiles to intercept .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- For the first time in three years, Israelis and Palestinians will come to the negotiating table in Washington on Monday night. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated praise for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday morning. The talks will be ""a difficult process,"" but he added that the consequences of not trying could be worse. Kerry said the goal is to seek ""reasonable compromises"" on ""tough, complicated, emotional"" and symbolic issues, then he announced former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, as U.S. envoy to the talks. Indyk understands that peace will not come easily, but that ""there is now a path forward, and we must follow that path with urgency,"" Kerry added. The goal of the talks is to establish a Palestinian state with security arrangements and agreed-upon borders with Israel. Indyk said that he recalled a screen saver that his son once created for him -- a single question that ran across his monitor: ""Dad, is there peace in the Middle East yet?"" ""For 15 years, I've only been able to answer him, 'Not yet,'"" Indyk told reporters. But he said he is hoping that these talks would mark a change. President Barack Obama said the talks are ""a promising step forward"" but ""hard work and hard choices remain ahead."" In a precursor to the talks, Netanyahu prodded the Israeli government into approving the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners -- a move that flies in the face of popular sentiment in Israel. ""This moment is not easy for me. It is not easy for the ministers,"" he said. ""It is not easy especially for the families, the bereaved families, whose heart I understand. But there are moments in which tough decisions must be made for the good of the country, and this is one of those moments."" The measure passed 14-6, with two abstentions. ""It's easy to see why Israelis wouldn't be happy about this because some of these prisoners are murderers,"" said Elliott Abrams, an expert on U.S. policy in the Middle East with the Council on Foreign Relations. ""There are some of them who've thrown bombs onto buses. There are a lot of victims in Israel who are outraged and speaking out in media there asking, 'Why do we have to give Palestinians some kind of concession to get them to the negotiating table?' They're asking, 'Why are we having to let people out of prison with blood on their hands?' "" Abrams wrote about the peace talks Monday. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon spoke in an internal Cabinet meeting Sunday, saying: ""There is a heavy price to pay about the freeing of prisoners, from the moral point of view, the legal point of view and deterrence. ""I wish we would not have such dilemmas,"" he continued. ""However, in the situation which has come about, there will be a heavy price to pay if we decide not to go into a peace process and are blamed for that in our strategic connection with the U.S.A. and other Western countries."" Also at Sunday's meeting, the Cabinet approved the opening of diplomatic negotiations with the Palestinians and authorized a team headed by Netanyahu and four other top ministers to conduct the prisoner release. The votes were designed to build confidence and help kick-start the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The first of four waves of releases is scheduled to come after the negotiations get under way. But Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti called the gesture too little, too late. ""The number of prisoners who will be released will be 104 out of 4,800 Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli prisons, so it is a very small number in comparison,"" according to Barghouti, who said this group should have been set free after the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993. ""Second, they will be released as announced by (Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi) Livni in stages, depending on the attitude of the Palestinian negotiators on the table, which means the issue of Palestinian prisoners will be used as an instrument of political blackmail,"" he said. ""They were all arrested before the Oslo agreement. They lost 20 and 30 years of their life, and there is no justification for that at all."" The players . The Israelis will be represented at the talks by Livni and Yitzhak Molcho, and the Palestinians will be represented by Chief Negotiator Saeb Erakat and Mohammad Shtayyeh, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

But it's not just in the hands of politicians. The Israeli Cabinet approved a measure stating that any agreement with the Palestinians will be submitted to Israelis for a vote. And while leaders meet in Washington, violence raged in the region. Palestinian police in Ramallah, West Bank, clashed with marchers protesting the negotiations. The protesters believe the talks indicate a ""willingness to concede, against the position of the Palestinian national consensus and even the decisions of the PLO institutions themselves,"" and called the planned talks ""deeply dangerous to the Palestinian national cause,"" said the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Jerusalem-based Palestinian nongovernmental organization. And Hamas, which governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, issued a statement saying that it ""rejects the Palestinian Authority return to peace talks with the Israeli occupation authorities.""

"Vrindavan, India (CNN) -- In the picturesque temple town of Vrindavan, 10-year-old Maya and her three siblings walk to school every day on an empty stomach. She says her parents can't afford to feed them adequate meals; they eat bread and milk for dinner and nothing for breakfast. As the eldest child, she often has to skip class to help her parents harvest wheat. Maya says her parents believe this is a more efficient use of her time, but she has another good reason for attending school -- more food. ""At school we get the most amount of food. At home we don't get this much. At home my mother tells us to only eat a little bit so there's enough for everyone,"" she says. Following a landmark decision by the Supreme Court in 2001, all government schools in India are mandated to provide free meals to students below the age of 13. In a country where more than 40% of children below the age of five are underweight, according to UNICEF, India's midday meal scheme is making great strides. The Akshaya Patra Foundation is working with the government to feed 1.4 million underprivileged children every day. They began in 2000, feeding a few thousand school children in several schools in the southern city of Bangalore. But in the space of a decade, they say they've served more than a billion meals across the country. Akshaya Patra's Vice Chairman, Chanchalapathi Dasa, says the benefits are manifold. Enrollment in schools has increased by roughly 20%, attendance has improved, children are healthier and their cognitive abilities have also increased. ""If a child is hungry in the classroom then he or she will not be able to receive all this education,"" says Dasa. But preparing food for so many takes more than an ordinary kitchen. You could call it a culinary revolution. In what looks like a factory for food, fresh meals are being mass-produced for millions of children. Custom-made cauldrons can prepare rice for 1,000 kids in 15 minutes. A printing press-like machine can make an impressive 40,000 Indian flatbreads or chapattis in an hour. ""India is a place of numbers. If you're doing something to provide meals for 1,000 or even 5,000 children, you are merely scratching the surface,"" adds Dasa. ""From the beginning we at Akhshay Patra realized that in order to see a significant impact we have to do it in scale and that we have to use modern techniques of management and innovation."" They call it a three tier gravity flow kitchen. Tons of raw ingredients like rice, lentils and vegetables are taken to the top floor where they're cleaned, peeled, cut and sent down chutes into waiting cauldrons below. There, steam generated by furnaces cooks the food. The cooked meals are then thrown down chutes to another level where the meals are packaged. By 8 a.m. meals are ready to be delivered in special vehicles designed to keep the food warm. But while the food production process is efficient, it is also considered. ""We want to treat these children with dignity. We don't say 'you are poor children and whatever we give you, you must eat that,' no. We adapt our cooking methods, our menus, recipes to meet the local children's requirements,"" says Dasa. ""You see, in India every 300 miles you come across a different culture, a different language, a different kind of food habit, so at Akshaya Patra we are sensitive to local cultural requirements and tastes."" While there are several school feeding programs that distribute rations of wheat and rice, cooked meal programs are rare. This is one of the most successful assistance programs yet -- nourishing food for millions of children and food for thought in the fight against poverty.","UNICEF: More than 40% of Indian children below the age of five under weight .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A massive fire engulfed a newly constructed, unoccupied luxury hotel in central Beijing on Monday night as crowds watched a nearby fireworks display marking the end of Lunar New Year celebrations. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is unknown. The cause of the blaze at the 40-story Mandarin Oriental is not known and there were no reports of injuries, according to CNN staff members who were at the scene. The fire began about 9 p.m. and continued to burn an hour later. A plume of flames shot from the top of the structure as the fire quickly spread. iReporter Jean de Villeneuve lives about 200 yards (200 meters) from the fire and said she watched it for about an hour before firefighters got it under control. De Villeneuve, who is originally from France, said she was surprised at how close spectators were allowed to get before authorities established a perimeter. ""I looked and saw the huge tower full of fire, and there were hundreds of Chinese down near my apartment taking pictures,"" she said. ""If this had been the United States, you would think a perimeter would be secured, but there was nothing like that.""  Watch flames devour the hotel » . De Villeneuve said she and others were able to get within 60 yards of the fire. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that more than 1,000 people in the area were evacuated, ""traffic controls were imposed"" on a major highway and authorities temporarily stopped subway service on a line serving the area. ""Snow-like ashes fell as far as [half a mile] from the building and smoke eclipsed the full moon,"" Xinhua reported of the blaze in the capital's central business district.  See photos of the blaze » . iReporter Fred Rice, a British national who lives in Beijing, said ""the top of the building was exploding."" ""We weren't sure if it was gas canisters or what. It was a spectacular sight for sure,"" he said. iReporter Stephen Chaytor said he was walking home from work when he saw the fire.  Watch the hotel burn » . ""It was spreading incredibly fast. It was obvious that there was a lot of debris on site -- that debris ignited very quickly,"" Chaytor said. ""Fire took control of building [and] within less than 13 minutes, it went from small flames to being totally engulfed in flames."" He said a crowd of onlookers gathered around the scene, as well as fire and emergency crews who worked to control the blaze. ""There was a quiet concern for people that may be involved, working in the building or close to construction site,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? The fire reached past the 30th floor, but did not spread to any adjacent buildings. The hotel is next to a newly constructed tower for China Central Television (CCTV), but no one has moved into that building either. The blaze erupted in the final hours of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebration as people set off fireworks across the city. Xinhua reported that Beijing residents were supposed to stop selling and lighting fireworks by midnight. iReporter de Villeneuve said she suspects many people in the city were trying to use whatever remaining fireworks they had before the deadline. ""We have been seeing fireworks for the past two weeks. I have to say this is quite a surprise,"" she said. iReport.com: Eyewitnesses worried 'building might topple' iReporter Rice said he was watching fireworks nearby when he noticed that fireworks were being set off near the buildings. ""Then we looked closer and saw the flames come from the top of the building,"" Rice said. ""Soon became apparent that the building was on fire."" The modern, angular building was a sign of Beijing's recent transformation and modernization. It had been scheduled to open late last year, but the opening was postponed until this year, though most of the building had been constructed. According to its Web site, the Mandarin Oriental-Beijing is the flagship property in China for the Mandarin Oriental hotel chain. The tower stands more than 500 feet high and contains 241 rooms, Xinhua reported.","iReporter who lives nearby says she saw ""huge tower full of fire""

"(CNN) -- Dozens of Mexican schoolchildren were hospitalized after apparently falling ill from a meal at their kindergarten. At least 38 children ages four and five became sick after lunch at a state-run school in San Luis Rio Colorado, which sits right on the border across from Yuma, Arizona, emergency dispatcher Carlos Ibarra said. A local clinic alerted emergency officials Friday when 15 children suddenly showed up at their facilities with similar symptoms -- vomiting, diarrhea and fever, Ibarra said. The number more than doubled before the day was over. The children had eaten chicken salad and homemade agua de horchata. a refreshing rice water drink. Officials suspect the horchata was responsible for the food poisoning, Ibarra said. Some of the children were released from the hospital on Friday night. The food was prepared by the sister of one of the teachers who had been contracted by the school, Ibarra said. The school, named Manuel Cervantes Imaz, has a total of 312 students. The health department will conduct an investigation, he said.","A drink is suspected of having sickened 38 kindergartners in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- An imprisoned half-brother of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein died Monday of cancer, Iraq's Justice Ministry said. Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan, a former regime official and adviser to Saddam, died at a Baghdad hospital after recently being transferred there from prison, the ministry said. Al-Hassan, a presidential adviser to Saddam, was No. 36 on a U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis after American-led forces toppled the regime in 2003. Al-Hassan -- the six of diamonds in a card deck that had the names and faces of the 55 most wanted regime officials -- was captured in February 2005, and the United States handed him over to Iraqi authorities in July 2011. An Iraqi court sentenced him to death after he was convicted of murder and crimes against Iraqis, the Justice Ministry said. Al-Hassan was Iraq's head of intelligence and security during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and continued to run the security service until 1996, when he took the presidential adviser post, the Justice Ministry said.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Hours after being impeached by an overwhelming vote in the Illinois House of Representatives, a defiant Gov. Rod Blagojevich proclaimed Friday that he was not guilty of impeachable offenses and would fight ""every step of the way."" Ilinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich says his impeachment was politically driven. The embattled governor said lawmakers' actions were politically driven. ""The House action today was not a surprise. It was a foregone conclusion,"" Blagojevich said at a news conference in Chicago. ""From the very moment of my re-election, I've been engaged in a struggle with the House to try to get things done for people. ""The House's action today, and the causes of the impeachment, are because I've done things to fight for families who are with me here today,"" he added.  Watch Blagojevich fire back at critics » . Blagojevich said one of the reasons the House voted to impeach him because he wanted to expand health care benefits to Illinois residents. ""Is that an impeachable offense?"" Blagojevich asked. As he stated earlier, Blagojevich said he had not done anything wrong.  Watch Blagojevich declare he is not guilty » . Blagojevich's comments came after the state House voted almost unanimously Friday to impeach him. The vote was 114-1, with three representatives not voting.  Watch the announcement of the impeachment vote » . State Rep. Milton Patterson, D-Chicago, said he voted against impeachment because ""I did not feel like I had enough information, based on the report, to make an informed decision to remove the governor from office."" The matter now moves to the state Senate, which will try the case. A two-thirds vote in the Senate is required to remove the governor from office. Blagojevich's actions ""show a public servant who is prepared to turn public service into an avenue for private benefit,"" the chairwoman of the House impeachment committee, Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie, D-Chicago, said at the start of Friday's impeachment debate. ""They show a public servant who has betrayed his oath of office, who has betrayed the public trust, who is not fit to govern the state of Illinois."" Currie added, ""The totality of the evidence shows that Gov. Blagojevich has forfeited his right to hold office. Whatever their stations, whether petty thieves or governors, those who break the law must not be immune from the consequences and must be held to account for their actions."" Rep. Tom Cross, Republican leader in the Illinois House, said Blagojevich ""has violated [his] oath of office, and that trust that he was given by being elected twice has eroded, has evaporated, has completely gone."" On Thursday, the Illinois House committee unanimously recommended impeaching Blagojevich amid corruption allegations. Blagojevich was arrested last month after federal prosecutors alleged, among other things, that he tried to sell the U.S. Senate seat that President-elect Barack Obama vacated. ""Today is the day that we begin to give back democracy to the people of the state of Illinois,"" Democratic Rep. Jack Franks, a panel member, said as he cast his aye vote Thursday night. Blagojevich ""has been AWOL and derelict of his duties. He has abused his powers, and he has brought shame to this great state,"" Franks said. ""I believe that Rod Blagojevich is a liar, and I believe he is a thief,"" Franks said. ""He has stolen the trust of the people."" The committee heard testimony Thursday from Roland Burris, the man Blagojevich appointed to succeed Obama in the Senate. Burris denied any quid pro quo with Blagojevich for his appointment to the Senate. Burris, former attorney general for Illinois, is not accused of engaging in ""pay-to-play"" politics with Blagojevich. ""I would have appreciated it if he had stepped aside, and we would not have been made the laughingstock of the country,"" said Rep. Mary Flowers, another Democrat. She noted, however, that the governor is ""innocent until proven guilty."" The 21-member committee looked into Blagojevich's actions on a number of issues beyond the federal allegations, including a claim that he withheld state money from a children's hospital until he received a $50,000 campaign donation. Rep. Chapin Rose, a Republican, called the alleged behavior ""repugnant."" ""The report speaks for itself and contains many, many, many acts that I find, and most of my colleagues find, to be impeachable,"" Rose said. ""The evidence is overwhelmingly damning,"" he said. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald initiated a criminal complaint against Blagojevich after listening to wiretaps of the governor's phone conversations. Blagojevich was arrested December 9 but has not been indicted. A federal judge in Chicago told Fitzgerald that he has until April 7 to decide whether to charge the Illinois governor. The committee's report said it found the government's allegations against Blagojevich ""shocking"" and believes the information in the federal complaint ""is sufficiently credible to demonstrate an abuse of office"" that was ""inconsistent with the governor's constitutional oath."" The report said Blagojevich did not need to be found guilty of a crime for the House to impeach him. ""It would, in fact, be unreasonable to limit impeachable offenses to criminal conduct,"" the report said. ""An impeachment inquiry is not a criminal proceeding, and its purpose is not punitive. Rather, impeachment is a remedial proceeding to protect the public from an officer who has abused his position of trust."" The committee pointed out that the criminal complaint against Blagojevich alleges that he was secretly taped saying he would not appoint anyone to Obama's seat without some form of compensation. iReport.com: Do you trust your political leaders? ""The governor repeatedly demonstrated that his decision to appoint a senator would not be based on merits of the candidate or on public policy but rather on how that appointment could benefit him personally,"" the report said. ""The governor directed various individuals to conduct inquiries on his behalf to negotiate deals for the Senate appointment, affirmatively setting into action a plot to trade the Senate appointment for something of value to the governor,"" it said.","NEW: Rod Blagojevich vows to fight impeachment charges ""every step of the way""

"Boston (CNN) -- Widespread power outages and transit delays marked the start of a challenging week for millions of residents of the Northeastern United States, where a freak October snowstorm dropped more than 2 feet of snow in some places. Close to 1.7 million customers in five states remained without power Monday evening, and officials warned it could be Friday before power is back on everywhere. Utilities throughout the region reported significant progress in restoring power, but the cold, snowy conditions and house-by-house nature of the damage was slowing work, officials said. At least 13 deaths have been blamed on the weekend storm, which prompted emergency declarations from the governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also put Halloween trick-or-treating plans in jeopardy. President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration for Connecticut on Monday, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. About a dozen Massachusetts cities have postponed Halloween celebrations, according to CNN affiliate WGGB. At least 20 Connecticut cities and towns, including the capital city of Hartford, canceled events or asked parents to wait until later to take their kids trick-or-treating, according to CNN affiliate WFSB-TV. Even Gov. Dannel Malloy and his wife, Cathy, said they will be leaving the lights off. ""No amount of candy is worth a potentially serious or even fatal accident,"" the governor said in a statement. In Worcester, Massachusetts, officials asked residents to postpone celebrations until Thursday, when temperatures are expected to climb to 60 degrees. Trick-or-treating, the city said, would ""put families and our youth in harm's way as they negotiate piles of snow and downed limbs."" In Springfield, Massachusetts, school officials announced classes would be canceled for the week. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said some roads in the state are expected to ice up again after dark, and he warned that downed power lines continue to pose a threat. ""It was a particular challenge not just because it comes unseasonably soon, but because there are leaves on many of the trees, which caused a number of limbs to come down on power lines,"" he said. Some of the heaviest snow fell in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, but snowfall amounts of at least a foot were recorded from West Virginia to Maine. The Berkshire County community of Peru, Massachusetts, received 32 inches of snow during the storm. ""I never have seen this, and I've lived here all my life, and that's more than 90 years,"" 92-year-old Genevieve Murphy of Westfield, Massachusetts, said in an interview with CNN affiliate WWLP-TV. Aaron Kershaw in Mahopac, New York, about 50 miles north of Manhattan, told CNN he was using a 4,000-watt generator to provide power for his family of five. The wet, heavy snow brought down a number of trees while coating the area in a thick blanket of white. ""Thank God no homes, cars, people, etc. were harmed,"" he said. ""But Mother Nature left us beautiful scenery."" About 1,300 people were staying in Massachusetts shelters, state officials said. In Connecticut, 50 shelters were open, Malloy said. With no electricity and no heat at home, Jessica Taylor took her six children and spent the night in a shelter in the Hartford area. ""We've been eating meals here,"" she told CNN affiliate WTIC-TV. ""They've been serving us, taking good care of us."" Connecticut power officials said Monday that about 748,000 people were still without power, down from a peak of more than 900,000. ""It's all hands on deck,"" said Mitch Gross, a spokesman Connecticut Light and Power, the state's largest utility. ""We have a lot of work to do."" Power crews from across the country are converging on the state to help restore power, according to Gross, who said every town that Connecticut Light and Power serves was adversely affected in some way by the storm. In Massachusetts, state officials said utility crews had come from as far as Louisiana and Texas to help. Patrick said utility crews had made a 23% dent in the number of buildings without power as of Monday morning. ""A 23% reduction overnight is pretty great, but we have a whole lot more to do and a few days yet before power will be restored to everyone,"" Patrick said. About 478,000 people remained without power Monday evening, according to officials. Elsewhere, about 202,000 customers were without power in Pennsylvania; 116,000 in New Jersey and 127,000 in New York, according to figures from emergency managers and power companies in those states. Thousands also lost power in New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia. Kimberly Lindner of Chappaqua, New York, said the family whiled away the hours by building a ""jack-snow-lantern."" ""It's October, and there are 12 inches of snow on the ground,"" she said in a submission to CNN's iReport. ""But the kids think it's great. They've been playing outside all day and really don't care that there is no power. Why not make the best of things and have some family time in the snow? A snowman without a head, a jack-o'-lantern without a body ... enough said."" For others, however, the unexpected storm brought unexpected misery. Airline passengers left stranded by the storm spent a restless weekend night on cots or airport floors. ""Whatever kind of system they had, it completely and utterly broke down,"" said passenger Fatimah Dahandari, who spent a night in Hartford, Connecticut's, Bradley International Airport while trying to get to New York. ""It looks like a refugee camp in here."" Passengers stuck on jet for hours . As of Monday, authorities reported at least 13 deaths attributed to the storm. Three people died in Massachusetts, Patrick said, including a Lunenberg resident who died in a fire and a resident of Hatfield who succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, apparently from an improperly vented generator. The third death happened in Springfield when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guardrail, which was charged, city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere said. At least four people died in Pennsylvania -- two of them in a crash Sunday on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, CNN affiliate KYW-TV reported. A third death happened in Temple, when an 84-year-old man was resting in his recliner Saturday and part of a large, snow-filled tree fell into his house and killed him, according to a state police report. The fourth death was blamed on carbon monoxide poisoning, after the victim in Lehigh County used a charcoal grill to heat a home, said Ruth Miller, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. Four people also died in New Jersey because of the storm, police said. Two were killed in motor vehicle accidents, one in Bergen County and one in Passaic County, while two others died after trees fell on their cars. In Connecticut, two people died, including a motorist involved in a traffic accident in Hebron.

"(CNN) -- Hardly anyone has been rumored dead as often as al Qaeda's No. 2 man in Yemen. Said al-Shihri has emerged from the aftermath of drone strikes in the past to lambast the CIA for trying to kill him. It seems it finally did. A message on jihadi websites announced his death Tuesday. It was purportedly posted by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). It did not say when or where al-Shihri died, just that a U.S. drone took his life sometime after the first week of April. Al-Shihri's career as a terrorist leader has its roots in the U.S. detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was released in 2008 to his native Saudi Arabia under the condition that he not travel outside the country. He quickly disobeyed the order to join a fellow former Guantanamo inmate with AQAP in Yemen, where he climbed to the number two slot in 2009. The CIA promptly put drones in the air with him in its crosshairs, and Yemeni authorities erroneously reported deadly direct hits. Shortly afterward, al-Shihri would pop up on jihadist websites to correct the reports. The occurrences repeated themselves -- most recently, in January. In April, al-Shihri issued a threat to the Saudi royal family for allegedly conspiring with American ""crusaders"" against ""the faithful people of Yemen."" The jihadi statement said the airstrike killed him sometime after that.","Hardly anyone has been rumored dead as often as al-Shihri .

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet has approved legislation that could end the exemption ultra-Orthodox Jews get on military service. The bill now goes to Israel's parliament, the Knesset, for consideration, the prime minister's office said Sunday. ""We will enact this change gradually while considering the special needs of the ultra-Orthodox population,"" Netanyahu said. ""Our objective is two-fold: integrating young ultra-Orthodox into IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and national service and, no less important, integrating them into the labor force."" The bill would require the enlistment of the ultra-religious Haredim in the army. All other Jews in Israel are required to serve. The Haredim, who make up about 10% of the country according to government figures, are the fastest-growing segment of the population and constitute a powerful voting bloc. They have used political clout to maintain government subsidies for working-age men to study the Torah full time and protect the ability for ultra-Orthodox Israelis to win easy exemptions from compulsory military service. But the latest ruling government coalition formed this year excludes ultra-religious parties, almost always part of such coalitions in Israel. The exclusion comes amid a growing sense of resentment and anger among other Israelis over the exemptions. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel have been exempt from military service .

"Puyallup, Washington (CNN) -- The two sons of a Washington man killed along with their father in a weekend fire suffered hatchet wounds before dying of carbon monoxide poisoning, authorities said Monday. Investigators found a hatchet in the home of Josh Powell, whom authorities believe set the Sunday afternoon fire, said Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County, Washington, Sheriff's Department. Powell was a suspect in the 2009 disappearance of his wife, Susan Cox-Powell. An autopsy showed his sons, 5-year-old Braden and 7-year-old Charlie, suffered chop injuries to their necks, but medical examiners concluded both boys and their father died from inhaling carbon monoxide, the county medical examiner's office reported. Powell's death was ruled a suicide, while his sons' deaths were determined to be homicides. Powell first gave toys and books to charity, sent multiple goodbye e-mails and doused the Puyallup, Washington, home with gasoline before setting it ablaze, authorities said Monday. That evidence suggests that Josh Powell planned a murder-suicide for some time, Troyer said. ""He was making arrangement to leave this place, so he had some knowledge of what he was going to do,"" he told CNN's John King. ""(I) believe this was intentional -- it's two counts of murder and then suicide."" It was a tragic development in a puzzling case that began two years ago in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Valley City, Utah, when 28-year-old Cox-Powell disappeared. Nancy Grace interviews Susan Cox-Powell's sister . Before he set fire to his home, Powell sent his attorney an e-mail saying simply: ""I'm sorry. Goodbye."" He also sent e-mails to his pastor and others just minutes before the fire, giving instructions on how to handle his end-of-life business, according to Troyer. Powell donated his sons' toys and books to a local charity, seemingly to clean house, he said. The spokesman added that authorities found two five-gallon cans of gas in the home, one of which appeared to have been lit right next to the bodies, which were found together in the same room. The sheriff's department has copies of an e-mail Powell sent to his attorney as well as family and friends that said ""he couldn't live with what was going on,"" Troyer said. The deaths of the Washington man and his two sons may mean the disappearance of the children's mother may never be solved. Still, the case remains open and investigators vowed to pursue it until the point of closure. Follow a timeline of the case . ""I promised the Coxes I wasn't giving up and I'm still not because we want to get some closure here,"" West Valley City, Utah Police Chief Buzz Nielsen told reporters Monday. A team of detectives was sent to Washington in the aftermath of the fatal fire. ""The case is still active; we're not closing the case. We still got things that have not been resolved,"" he said. Powell, who was never charged in his wife's disappearance, was embroiled in a bitter custody dispute with her parents. ""Words can't describe any of this ... I can't imagine any of us going through what Chuck and Judy Cox have gone through, losing their daughter and losing these dear little boys,"" attorney Anne Bremner, who represented Charles and Judith Cox in the disappearance of their daughter, told HLN's Vinnie Politan. The children, at least the older boy, Charlie, had reached the age where they may have been giving away information, Bremner said. ""I know that to be true in this case because as recently as Christmas, the boys told their grandparents, 'Mommy's in the mine. If we go to the mine, we'll find Mommy,'"" she said. Authorities have searched mines in Utah and Nevada for Cox-Powell, Bremner said. When asked Monday whether she feared Powell would ever hurt his children, Cox-Powell's sister, Denise Cox, responded: ""Absolutely."" ""From the get go, from when he was named a person of interest, the boys should have been taken away from him, and he should not have been allowed visitation,"" she told HLN's Nancy Grace. The children had started ""opening up and talking to my parents about what happened that night,"" in recent months, she said. ""The boys really, once they started opening up to our family, they started closing down on their dad,"" the sister told HLN. According to investigators, Powell had said the last time he saw his wife was the night he and his sons -- then ages 2 and 4 -- left to go camping. Cox-Powell's sister eventually reported her missing. A month later, Powell and his children moved from Utah to Washington. As late as last month, Utah authorities were still working to connect Powell to the disappearance of his wife, who authorities believe is dead. The weekend's tragic events appeared to have been set in motion days earlier when a judge refused Powell's petition to regain custody of his children and instead ordered he undergo psychological evaluations -- an order that came after authorities turned up child pornography in the home Powell shared with his father. As part of the investigation into Cox-Powell's disappearance, Utah authorities searched the Washington house where Powell, his two sons and his father, Steven Powell, were living last year. During the search, investigators ""discovered numerous images and recordings of adult and juvenile females,"" according to a statement released by the Pierce County sheriff's department. Powell's father, Steven, was subsequently charged with 14 counts of voyeurism and one count of possessing images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct, according to court documents. After the arrest of Powell's father, custody of his sons was given to the Coxes, according to Washington state court records. Powell maintained in court documents filed last week that he established his own home after his father's arrest and ""have consistently proven my fitness as a stable and loving parent under close supervision by (child welfare caseworkers)."" ""The real story is not that anyone is a bad person, including me,"" Powell said in the affidavit. ""The story is one of overcoming and rising above what many people think are insurmountable challenges."" On Sunday, shortly after noon, Powell was standing outside his home in a quiet, tree-lined cul-de-sac waiting for a social worker to bring the two boys for a supervised visit, authorities said. As the children got to the door, Powell pushed the social worker back, quickly brought the two boys inside and locked the door. The social worker, who later reported smelling something similar to gas at the time, tried ""pounding the doors, trying to get in,"" said Gary Franz, a deputy chief with Graham, Washington, Fire and Rescue. About two minutes later, as the social worker was calling her supervisor, the house exploded, Franz said. The powerful explosion shook houses, with debris landing on lawns blocks away. Jennifer Bleakley, who lived near the Powell home, was making coffee in the kitchen when the explosion violently rattled windows and doors in her home. ""It really hurts my heart. My heart ached for those boys anyway,"" she told CNN affiliate KOMO-TV, wiping away tears. CNN's Chelsea Carter, Greg Botelho, Ashley Hayes, Sara Weisfeldt, Leslie Tripp and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: Powell kids had chop wounds, autopsy shows .

"(CNN) -- U.N. inspectors will travel to Syria ""as soon as possible"" to investigate three reports of chemical weapons use, a U.N. spokesperson said Wednesday. The announcement of the upcoming visit followed talks last week between Syria's government and a U.N. representative for disarmament affairs, according to the U.N. statement. Syria has been embroiled in a bloody civil war for more than two years, during which more than 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced or become refugees in other countries, according to the United Nations. Amid the fighting, there have been numerous allegations that chemical weapons have been used. In June, the White House said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces had crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin gas, against rebel forces. This prompted the U.S. government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters, despite its earlier reluctance to do so. Syria's government, meanwhile, has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well. That includes a March incident in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack, while other rebel leaders said Syrian troops fired ""chemical rockets"" at civilians and opposition forces. The Khan al-Asal will be one of the three incidents that U.N. inspectors will look into during their upcoming visit, according to the U.N. spokesperson.","U.N. inspectors will go to Syria ""as soon as possible"" to probe chemical weapons use .

"(CNN) -- The one-eyed jihadist commander known as ""Mr. Marlboro"" is back in action. Moktar Belmoktar, whose group was responsible for the deadly attack on the BP oil facility in southern Algeria last January, appears in a new video released by his group -- the al-Mulathameen Brigade, which translates as the ""Signatories in Blood Brigade."" More than 30 foreign workers at the In Amenas facility in Algeria were killed during a three-day occupation of the plant. Belmokhtar is an Algerian but was more recently based in northern Mali, where he had combined kidnapping and smuggling (hence the nickname) with audacious terror attacks. He got his nickname for smuggling cigarettes across borders. Thought to be about 40, Belmokhtar was rumored to have been killed or wounded in March during the French military intervention in Mali. But in the new 51-minute video he is shown training fighters and paying tribute to another jihadist commander who was killed earlier this year. Belmoktar shows no sign of having been wounded. The video shows a group of jihadists preparing for two deadly raids in neighboring Niger in May, which targeted a French-owned uranium mine and a Nigerien military academy. ""My brothers, all you should do is strive and make efforts with all determination and power to bring down their sites and harm their troops,"" Belmoktar says before embracing the group. At one point, he appears to be instructing recruits in using a rocket-propelled grenade. The government of Niger sent troops to join the French-led operation in Mali. Commanders from the al-Mulathameen Brigade, which is linked to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), also appeal in the video to Muslims in Europe and America to carry out attacks. One of them, Omar Ould Hama, a top Belmoktar deputy, is filmed standing in front of a pickup truck in the desert flanked by half a dozen masked armed fighters, and issuing a direct threat in heavily accented French. ""This message is sent to France especially, to the USA and to all NATO countries. Like we have said since the beginning, the jihadists are ready to go on the offensive at any moment. We need to transmit this message to the whole world. We need to complete our mission at any price. We have told you that we will hit you in the middle of the Quai D'Orsay in France, and we will target you like we have done before -- all the French interests, both military and economic in the whole world."" The Quai D'Orsay is the site of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2008, Hama kidnapped Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler on Belmoktar's orders and held him for 130 days, Fowler told CNN after his release. French minister: Islamists' heavy weapons found in Mali . Analyst: Focus likely will be on Sahara . ""Such threats have been made before by Belmoktar and his commanders and associates but they have not yet demonstrated a capacity to launch attacks in the West. For the time being, it's more likely they will focus on hitting Western targets in the Sahara region,"" Andrew Lebovich, an analyst who closely tracks the group, told CNN. Belmoktar himself is seen providing encouragement to the jihadists about to attack the French mine and Nigerian military academy in May. Another commander, Abu Usama al-Masri, appeals for 'lone wolf' attacks in France. He talks of the young French-Algerian man -- Mohammed Merah -- who carried out a string of gun atttacks in the French city of Toulouse last year, killing seven people. Merah was later cornered and killed by French police in his apartment. ""To every Muslim brother,"" says al-Masri, ""whether his nationality is Algerian or Tunisian or Moroccan ... I believe they walk on the street and make the French people scared.....So the Muslim youth inside France have a great duty, even if it is with a stone or knife"" to hit a Frenchman, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence group. The video was made available to CNN by Flashpoint Partners, an outfit tracking jihadist websites. It has since appeared on YouTube. It shows jihadists operating in the northern Mali cities of Gao and Konna earlier this year, and the application of strict Shariah law. And it shows an interview with a man described of French-Mauritanian origin, who was detained by Belmoktar's group for drinking alcohol. He says he will be judged by Shariah law and will never drink alcolohol again. The French intervention in Mali, which began in January and was aimed at defeating jihadist groups that had seized much of the north of the country, has subdued, but not eliminated, the threat from Belmoktar and allied jihadist groups. One source briefed by Western and regional intelligence officials told CNN Belmoktar is believed to have moved to the triangle regions straddling the borders of Algeria, Niger and Libya in late 2012 after signs that an international intervention in Mali was growing more likely. Known as the ""Salvador pass,"" the area is a key transit points for drug traffickers and international criminal groups. Some counterterrorism analysts believe Belmoktar may have relocated in southern Libya, where an absence of state authority gives him room to regroup. CNN previously learned that Belmoktar had visited to Libya after the uprising against Moammar Gadhafi and established ties with the emerging jihadist groups there. Intelligence sources told CNN earlier this year that he may also have had a role in the attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi exactly a year ago. According to one source, militants in the area called him up in Northern Mali shortly after the attack and offered congratulations. The call, which was intercepted, did not however provide proof of his involvement. Working with other al Qaeda affiliates . According to analysts, the new video, which includes computer animations of attacks, is one of the most sophisticated yet produced by al Qaeda fighters in the region and should be seen as part of Belmoktar's pitch to have Zawahiri recognize his group as the stand alone al Qaeda affiliate in the Sahara. The video also confirms the presence in Mali of fighters from Nigeria, where Boko Haram and Ansar al-Muslimeen have been involved in a campaign of sabotage and suicide attacks against police, government officials and Christians. There were reports earlier this year that Nigerian jihadists had joined AQIM in the city of Gao, in eastern Mali. A fighter in a black and yellow headscarf who calls himself Abu al-Nigiri says: ""To my mujahedeen brothers everywhere and in Nigeria in particular, I say to you: Wherever you find them, attack them and kill them."" Last year, simmering tension between Belmoktar and AQIM's paramount leader Abdelmalek Droukdel, who is based in northern Algeria, burst into the open -- leading to Belmoktar's dismissal from the North African al Qaeda affiliate's leadership. But this video suggests Belmoktar's group is again joining forces with other al Qaeda affiliates across the region. The video features clips from speeches by Qasim al Raymi, a leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), as well as from Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri. Belmoktar has a deep file of jihadist contacts across the region because of the time he spent fighting with other Arab fighters in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, which analysts say he is likely to continue to leverage. On his way back to fight in the Algerian civil war he spent time in Yemen, where he made contacts in militant circles. Since the Arab Spring, according to western counter-terrorism sources, North African and Yemeni jihadists have consolidated their connections. Those officials say three Yemeni fighters who belonged to AQAP participated in the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi and then fled to northern Mali where they connected with Belmoktar's group. And, this month, three Libyans were arrested in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, suspected of belonging to AQAP. There appears to be a growing effort by al Qaeda's leadership -- and not just by individual jihadists -- to improve co-operation among the various arms of the group. In 2012 AQAP leader Nasir al Wuhayshi, who was recently appointed al Qaeda's global No, 2, sent several letters to AQIM emir Droukdel which were subsequently discovered by the Associated Press in northern Mali. They indicated that Wuhayshi had emerged as a bridge for communications between al Qaeda figures in Pakistan and the North African group. al Qaeda document sheds light on attack plans .","Jihadist Moktar Belmoktar appears to be back on the stage .

"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- In my nine years as a UNICEF ambassador, I've been to camps for people displaced by conflict. Though hardly luxurious, they usually have some kind of structure: a water source, latrines, even schools. In Lebanon, even the most basic services are hard to come by as the small country staggers from the flow of refugees from its larger neighbor. The places I saw had no toilets, no clean water sources, no places to shower and no areas for cooking. Cases of painful scabies, lice and fleas are on the rise. I met mothers and children who have witnessed unspeakable acts of violence, including the death of loved ones. Often arriving in Lebanon with no more than the clothes on their backs, moms are trying to hold their families together with no idea how they will feed, clothe or shelter their traumatized kids. Many of these refugees lived a middle-class life in Syria, where they had homes, jobs, electricity and plumbing. Visit UNICEF's website to find out how you can help . Now, their savings have dwindled and many of them are dependent on the generosity and hospitality of strangers. They are living in tents constructed from discarded objects such as burlap sacks and plastic sheets. They might rent land from a farmer or squat in an abandoned construction site. These new ""homes"" leave them exposed to all sorts of dangers, respiratory infections and other diseases. And because there are no official camps, people are scattered, which makes identifying the informal settlement sites extremely challenging. We traveled to a cement factory, where some Syrian mothers were renting tiny rooms to house their entire families. I noticed one young girl who had dull, patchy skin. Her eyes sparkled and she was quick to smile, but her hair, eyebrows and lashes were sparse. When I asked about what happened, I was told that she became ill after playing in the factory's toxic waste. Since January, the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon has increased nearly six-fold. More than a million people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid. Considering Lebanon has a population of 4 million people, this is a crisis of epic scale that is putting enormous strain on local communities. According to UNICEF, there are more than 270,000 refugee children who are not in school in the country; by the end of the year, the number could exceed 400,000. Some of them have missed out on more than a year of learning. Syrian children can enroll in public schools in Lebanon as long as there is space, but many schools are already at capacity. In the United States, much of the discussion about Syria has been focused on politics. But for the kids I met, and millions more like them all across the region, politics is the farthest thing from their minds. Despite bearing no responsibility for the violence, children are paying the heaviest price for the conflict. They desperately need water, medical attention, sanitation, psychological support and the opportunity to receive an education, but there are simply not enough resources to alleviate suffering. In spite of the enormity of the crisis, funding for lifesaving aid is in short supply. UNICEF still needs $172 million this year to assist Syrian refugees across the region, which means programs to support these children are threatened. Clean water, schools, health care and nutrition are all at risk. I was overwhelmed by the deprivation and trauma the children we met have endured. But they rushed up to us with kisses and hugs, asking only for the chance to go to school. They deserve that chance. What's at stake is an entire generation of children who are carrying the emotional and physical scars of war. Time is running out for them. They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again. Frustration in Congress with aid to Syrian rebels .","UNICEF Ambassador Lucy Liu visited Syrian refugees in Lebanon .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- An unintentional fireworks explosion rocked downtown Beirut on Thursday, injuring five civilians who were working with a local non-governmental organization, a Lebanese interior security forces source told CNN. The blast, which occurred around 8 p.m. (1 p.m. ET), left a crater on fire next to Martyr's Square. Those hurt were working with the fireworks for a celebration on Thursday, which is Army Day in Lebanon, when a large firework never launched and instead exploded on the ground, the security forces source said. They'd been working on a grassy area, which is one reason that there was no significant damage to nearby buildings, despite the substantial size of the blast. Ambulance crews and firefighters converges on the scene, the latter trying to put out flames that had spread into the grass.

"Washington (CNN) -- A government official at the center of lavish spending at a Las Vegas conference claimed his Fifth Amendment rights against testifying at a congressional hearing Monday, while his former boss said she mourned her departure from public service over the controversy. Jeff Neely, the General Services Administration official who organized the 2010 conference that cost $800,000, repeatedly refused to answer questions, saying more than five times: ""I respectfully decline to answer any questions here today based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional privileges."" Rep. Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, then excused Neely and proceeded with the hearing on what he described as an unacceptable waste of taxpayer money. ""We're here today to get answers to questions that should have been asked and answered a long, long, long time ago,"" Issa said in his opening remarks, adding that the controversy raised ""serious questions in the minds of the American people about how government is using their tax dollars."" Issa also injected politics into his comments, saying the situation should raise questions in the minds of people about whether ""government and its reach should be expanded,"" a common Republican criticism of Democrats. The controversy involving a normally obscure federal agency has become politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish 2010 conference in Las Vegas were released. The revelation has prompted taxpayer indignation, embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the GSA, which acts as a real estate agency for the federal government. Particular questions raised by Issa included why it took 11 months for the results of an inspector general's investigation to become public, and why a former congressional aide to President Barack Obama remained in his top job at GSA when he likely knew of the wrongdoing -- or should have. In later tough questioning of that official, GSA Chief of Staff Mike Robertson, Issa determined that a lawyer in the White House counsel's office knew of the ongoing investigation of the GSA in the middle of 2011, nine months before the earliest time acknowledged to date by the administration. However, Robertson later issued a statement to clarify his testimony to the committee, saying: ""I only mentioned in passing the existence of an IG (inspector general) investigation as I bumped into a White House staffer that I regularly worked with on GSA issues. This was in late May or June of 2011."" Committee members from both parties expressed outrage Monday over the GSA's excessive spending, contracting violations and other abuses cited by the inspector general's report. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the panel, called the GSA behavior ""indefensible and intolerable,"" taking aim at Neely, a Public Buildings Service regional commissioner for GSA who organized the Las Vegas conference. ""In one e-mail,"" Cummings began, ""Mr. Neely invited personal friends to the conference, writing, and I quote -- and this is simply incredible -- quote: 'We'll get you guys a room near us, and we'll pick up the room tab. Could be a blast.' End of quote. He then went on and wrote this -- 'I know I'm bad, but as Deb and I often say, why not enjoy it while we have it and while we can. Ain't gonna last forever.' End of quote. Well, Mr. Neely it stops now."" In her opening statement, former GSA administrator Martha Johnson said she found a badly managed GSA when she took over in 2010 after more than two years of interim leadership. She added that the Western Regions conference at the heart of the problem had become a ""raucous, extravagant, arrogant, self-congratulatory event that ultimately belittled federal workers."" When she received a draft of the final inspector general's report outlining the abuses, Johnson said, she started thinking immediately she might have to resign. Her final decision to step down came ""three or four days"" before the final report was released in March because she wanted to send a message to the American people that ""this was unacceptable, it was appalling and not the norm,"" said Johnson, who had a long career in public service. ""I will mourn for the rest of my life the loss of my appointment,"" Johnson said of her resignation. Johnson stepped down nearly two weeks ago as the Obama administration revealed details of the Western Regions convention at a Las Vegas casino. Videos then surfaced of David Foley, a deputy commissioner of the Public Buildings Service, an arm of the GSA, appearing to mock congressional oversight. In it, he gave a talent show award to an employee whose video featured a rap about spending too much and joking about avoiding investigation. Additional videos also came out, including one that seemed to make fun of President Barack Obama, as well as a fake red carpet ceremony with Neely, a deputy GSA commissioner, boasting that his goal was to make the Las Vegas conference he helped organize ""over the top."" Details also emerged of an employee incentive program that violated limits on awards or gifts. Johnson, Foley, Robertson and Neely were all witnesses at Monday's hearing, along with GSA Inspector General Brian Miller, who wrote the report on GSA spending that set off the public controversy. Issa said Neely was the only witness who required a subpoena. Neely also was the only one who refused to answer questions under constitutional protections against self-incrimination. Committee members took the witnesses to task over the violations of government regulations and policies cited by Miller's report. In particular, conservative Republican members repeatedly listed the excesses -- more than $6,000 for commemorative coins for conference attendees, $75,000 for a team-building exercise to construct 24 bicycles then given to underprivileged children, the hiring of a mind reader as entertainment -- as well as bypassing a staff event planner to pay outsiders to prepare the conference and repeated ""scouting visits"" to Las Vegas by officials and family members. ""I want indictments,"" Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, said to Miller. ""That's a great way to get people's attention. Not a memo, not a report. An indictment."" Working for the government ""is a sacred trust, which you have blown,"" Gowdy said to the GSA officials. He lamented the culture of waste and extravagance, saying of the team-building exercise that ""I hate that you robbed yourself of the satisfaction of knowing what it feels like yourself instead of spending somebody else's money to do it."" The hearing included several harsh exchanges, including when Issa questioned Robertson, a former staffer for Obama in the Senate, about when he first told anyone in the White House of the investigation of GSA. In a long back-and-forth, Issa tried to narrow Roberton's responses to a specific date and person. ""I communicated to the appropriate people,"" Robertson initially answered, then acknowledged he spoke to the White House as part of his regular dealings. Asked when he first told anyone at the White House about the investigation, Robertson eventually said it was within a few weeks after GSA officials were first notified by the inspector general of a problem in May 2011. Issa then asked who he told, and Robertson twice said it was an unnamed person in the White House counsel's office before Issa insisted: ""What's the name?"" Only then did Robertson answer the person was Kim Harris. White House salary disclosures for 2011 list a Kimberley D. Harris as a deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president. Previously, a senior administration official told CNN that the White House was notified by GSA about the final inspector general's report shortly before it was released last month, more than nine months after Robertson said he told Harris about the ongoing investigation. Issa acknowledged that over-the-top GSA spending existed during the preceding Bush administration, though he disputes figures released by Obama officials that show a 102% increase from 2006 to 2008. However, information provided by his staff on Monday showed the increase from 2006 to 2008 approached that figure. ""Wasteful spending is a problem that transcends multiple administrations,"" he said, adding that it was up to the current administration to halt it now. CNN's Stacey Samuel contributed to this report.","Committee members express outrage over GSA actions .

"(CNN) -- The trial of mass murderer Anders Breivik has confirmed one thing so far: He seems quite mad. Looking plump and dumb, with a slightly receding hairline, the Norwegian gave a right-wing salute as he entered the courtroom and smirked his way through CCTV footage of his handiwork. Breivik claims that he killed 77 people as an act of self-defense against the Islamification of Norway, that he is a member of the Knights Templar and part of an ""anticommunist"" resistance to multiculturalism. Reading his insane manifesto, it is tempting to dismiss him as a nut with a gun. Nevertheless, there's no denying the political context to what Breivik did. Since 9/11, fringe and mainstream politicians in Europe and America have spoken of Islam as incompatible with Western values. Breivik quoted many of them in his manifesto. This is not to say that he took direct inspiration from those public figures, or that they bear personal responsibility for his crimes. But Breivik's paranoia does conform to a popular -- wholly negative -- view of the twin problems of Islam and multiculturalism. Tragically, it is a view that few mainstream politicians have been willing to challenge. Breivik makes two false claims. The first is that Islam is ethically inferior to Christianity and cannot exist peacefully within the secular democracies of the post-Enlightenment West. That is the open view of the Dutch Party for Freedom, the French National Front, the English Defense League and the Finnish True Finns. It was implicit in Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain's aversion to the building of mosques. We might also infer it from much of the testimony presented at Rep. Peter King's congressional hearings into the radicalization of American Muslim youth. King has opined that there are ""too many mosques"" in the United States and that roughly 80% of American Muslims are radical. The mistake being made by all these people is to conflate a tiny minority of political Islamists -- whose precise ideology has only really emerged in the last 30 years -- with the entire global and historical community of Muslims. It is true that Islam has never undergone a total Reformation, but it has experienced mini-enlightenments. The most celebrated is the Islamic Golden Age (750- 1258), centered in Baghdad, in which the arts and sciences flourished in a manner that left Dark Ages Europe far behind. (You can also find humanist poetry and art in Persia and even a small amount of erotica in Northern Africa.) Islam never outright rejected scientific empiricism but instead tried to reconcile and integrate it into its religious beliefs, with a surprising amount of debate about the primacy of either faith or reason. It preached that divine revelation could be found in other religions and so practiced tolerance in the lands that it conquered -- a kind of Islamic multiculturalism. One of the giants of the European Enlightenment, Voltaire, favorably opined that Islam was more tolerant in its treatment of minorities than Christianity (consider the comparative persecution of Catholics in Ireland or of Jews in Spain). Today, Islamic society looks different in every region where it is found. The royal families of Saudi Arabia have promoted ultra-conservative Wahhabism, which discourages personal vice, idolatry, veneration of saints, etc. The Bangladeshis prefer the more mystical Sufism, which places greater emphasis upon a subjective experience of Allah and is traditionally more tolerant of human foibles and dissent. Almost every part of the Islamic world has produced progressive movements, some headed by women. Pakistan gave the world Benazir Bhutto and Indonesia Megawati Soekarnoputri. In all cases, the political development of Muslim countries has been as much shaped by poverty and the legacy of colonialism as it has Islam. Iran might have continued on a course toward liberalism had the West not sponsored an anti-democratic coup in 1953. In short, there is no monolithic Islamic history or experience, which makes it hard or even disingenuous to talk about the challenge that Islam as a whole poses to the West. Put another way, no American would want anyone to think that the Westboro Baptist Church spoke for all of Christianity. Breivik's second, equally fallacious claim is that Islam's growth in the West has been encouraged by liberal elites as a means to destroy traditional Christian culture. Indeed, multiculturalism has been strongly critiqued by two British prime ministers -- Tony Blair and David Cameron. Cameron said that it had ""failed"" because it did not demand submission to the liberal principles of gender and sexual equality. But multiculturalism is not a Marxist ideology carefully plotted by the ""Saul Alinksy radicals"" so loathed by Newt Gingrich. Rather, it was free-market economics and globalization that caused the mass migration of Muslims from East to West -- and multiculturalism was simply a policy response. The aim was to protect the cultural integrity of both host and guest populations by allowing them separate spaces in which to develop. Far from intending to threaten the religious or civil liberties of the majority Christian population (which remains vastly superior in numbers), the goal was to create a common framework of laws but otherwise leave everyone to their own devices. If Christianity has declined in the West, it's the fault of the Christians who stopped going to church -- not the small groups of Muslims quietly attending their local mosque. And yet Muslims in Western countries now live under the pressures of anti-terrorist surveillance and social ostracism. They are forced to defend their Britishness, their Frenchness or their Americaness -- even if they are third- or fourth-generation citizens of those countries. Breivik's attack has raised the threat level against the West's Muslims: They are now the target of our politically engaged sociopaths. Given how widespread the condemnation of both Islam and multiculturalism is across the West, perhaps it is apt to describe Breivik as a symptom of Western psychological angst. It is a condition of neurosis about decline and paranoia about foreign invasion that is in desperate need of remedy.

"(CNN) -- The girlfriend of James ""Whitey"" Bulger was sentenced to eight years in federal prison Tuesday for identity fraud and helping the reputed mob boss avoid capture for 16 years. Catherine Greig, who prosecutors said was Bulger's ""partner"" in avoiding capture, must also pay a $150,000 fine, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock ruled. Greig, 61, declined to speak before her sentencing, but her lawyer said afterward that she has no regrets. ""She was in love with the guy and lived with him for 16 years,"" J.W. Carney said. ""Of course she doesn't regret it."" Bulger and Greig were captured at their Santa Monica, California, apartment a year ago. He faces trial later this year, accused of committing 19 murders during a reign of terror in South Boston during the 1970s and 1980s. The clues that led to the Bulgers' capture . Greig pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud. Federal prosecutors, calling it ""the most extreme case"" of harboring a fugitive, asked the judge to give her 10 years in prison. ""She not only hid his identity, but also hid the fact Bulger had filled their apartment with weapons, enabling Bulger to avoid capture by violence if necessary,"" prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. Woodlock, before imposing the sentence in U.S. District Court in Boston, said Greig had to pay a price for her bad choices. He suggested she could show that she was making better choices by cooperating with prosecutors in the case against Bulger. Her lawyer made it clear outside of the courthouse that she would not become a government witness because she feels ""the love of her life"" is innocent. ""She doesn't buy that, doesn't believe it, and absolutely stands by her man,"" Carney said. Stephen Rakes, who says his South Boston liquor store was taken over by Bulger, was one of the victims who spoke in court before the sentencing. He said he thought Greig should have been given the maximum 15 years in prison. ""She has no heart,"" Rakes said after the sentencing. ""She probably sleeps in an ice chest."" Bulger, who is being held without bail, was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. He evaded law enforcement for 16 years before he and Greig were arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica. The couple had, for several years, hidden in plain sight in the palm-tree-lined, oceanside city near Los Angeles in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia.","NEW: Catherine Greig has no regrets for hiding the ""love of her life,"" her lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Our youngest child, Peter, was murdered on September 11, 2001, while attending a conference at Windows on the World at the World Trade Center. He was 25 years old when he died. When the towers fell, we were in France, on vacation to celebrate Steve's 60th birthday. Peter, our daughter, Jane, and our son Jeff and his wife, Tobey, had all been with us for a week before flying back to the U.S. on September 8. On the day of the attacks, we were terribly upset after hearing the news. But at first, we were not worried about our kids. Jeff and Tobey lived in Tulsa. Jane lived in D.C. but her job was nowhere near the Pentagon. Peter worked in midtown Manhattan for Bloomberg LP. But since he traveled throughout the city for his job, we became concerned. We desperately tried calling our kids but could not get a line out of France. It wasn't until late in the day that we learned from Jeff that ""Pete was there."" The next day, Michael Bloomberg, who became mayor two months later, called to tell us that Pete was dead. My world stopped, and it still is totally out of kilter. News: Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11 . Not Peter! Pete was all laughter and sunshine and love. He wasn't uncomfortable kissing his mother or father in public, or hugging his sister for no reason at all. He and Jeff traveled to fun places and laughed and laughed. Not Peter -- he was too full of life. Our mark on this Earth is our children. After his death, we knew we had to leave a mark that Peter existed and the world would be a better place because he lived. In searching for a way to honor his life, we learned that 1 billion people, almost one sixth of humanity, have directly experienced torture, terrorism or mass violence. Victims are left with lifelong emotional wounds preventing them from leading productive lives. In sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of traumatic depression and PTSD exceeds that of HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB combined. Peter loved life; he was compassionate and caring. There was nothing we could do for Pete, but returning survivors to life in his name was the perfect memorial. In March 2003, we created the Peter C. Alderman Foundation. People often ask: ""Why are you dealing with traumatic depression and PTSD when there are so many greater problems in the world?"" Our response is simple: Billions of philanthropic dollars go into fighting HIV/AIDS, malaria and poverty. But if people don't care whether they live or die, they will not follow through with their medication regimens, walk that extra mile for potable water or take advantage of microfinance. If you can restore hope, a person is less likely to strap on dynamite and kill innocent people. Opinion: 11 years after 9/11: Who are the terrorists? Our foundation started by training indigenous health workers, but we quickly learned that training by itself was not sufficient. We needed to provide a framework in which professionals could work. To that end, our foundation runs eight trauma clinics in Cambodia, Uganda, Liberia and Kenya. Establishing public-private partnerships with local governments, our foundation trains, supervises and pays its staff; the government provides clinic space, in-patient beds and psychotropic drugs. Our foundation's average annual cost per clinic is $30,000. More than 30,000 children have been abducted in Uganda, and many of our patients are child soldiers, like Patrick. He has been treated in our Kitgum clinic for two years. Now he no longer has nightmares or flashbacks. He can sleep through the night and hold down a job. He no longer thinks of suicide. He has even named his new baby after his counselor at the clinic. Our foundation sponsors an annual African training conference on traumatic depression. Watch: The Alderman's talk to CNNMoney . At July's fifth annual conference in Tanzania, attended by 500 mental health professionals from 22 countries, an imam from Somalia rose to say the opening prayer. He only spoke Arabic. When translated, we learned that he had said a prayer for Peter. Tears streamed down my face as I realized we were truly on the way to leaving that mark for Peter. The work has kept us functioning and given us a reason to get out of bed every day. Nothing can erase our pain, but our passion to leave a profound and indelible mark that Peter existed on this Earth has propelled us forward. Peter would be very proud of the foundation that bears his name.

"San Diego (CNN) -- You may have heard that a group of Republicans in Congress -- including GOP rock star and possible vice presidential pick Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida -- are getting ready to introduce their version of the DREAM Act.You also may have heard that Democratic lawmakers and liberal advocacy groups despise the Republican alternative and derisively label it ""DREAM Act Lite."" As someone who has written about immigration for more than 20 years and hammered Democrats and Republicans (including Rubio) when appropriate, I call the GOP approach to the DREAM Act something else: A common sense solution. It could break a stalemate and improve millions of lives. And it could only be opposed for ugly partisan reasons. While it's not perfect -- and no piece of legislation is -- it is better than nothing, which is all the critics have been able to offer, even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress and the White House. Like the bill that has been kicked around in Congress for more than a decade, and which met its demise in December 2010 when five Senate Democrats effectively killed it by voting against cloture on the debate, the Republican plan would give undocumented students a path to legal status in exchange for going to college or joining the military. But unlike the earlier version, it would not include a path to citizenship. Students could become citizens later. It's not like they'd be barred from the citizenship process. But they would have to take the initiative. It would be on them, as it should be. Of course, Democrats hate this idea -- for three reasons. 1. Some of the 50 Senate Democrats who voted in favor of cloture in support of the original DREAM Act may have been moved by the humanitarian argument that young people brought here by their parents shouldn't be forced to languish in the world of the undocumented. But for others, it is likely that their vote was a political calculation. If hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant students could gain legal status, many of those people would become loyal Democratic voters for life. But if citizenship isn't in the mix, and there are no votes to be had, why bother? 2. Rubio is attached to the bill, and, in fact, seems to have been put front and center by Republican colleagues such as Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. Democrats know that the Cuban-American senator is on the short list of likely running mates for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. And that has to terrify them. Rubio has skills. Besides, they know that putting him on the ticket could lure some Latino support away from Democrats -- especially given that, according to polls, a majority of Latino voters disapprove of President Barack Obama's handling of immigration. If they can torpedo the GOP DREAM Act, they might just hobble Rubio. But if they can't, and Rubio uses the bill to score points with Latino voters, it could be a nightmare for Democrats in November. 3. Many Congressional Democrats, and for that matter, most of the other critics of the Republican bill, don't really understand what is at stake in the debate over illegal immigration. They approach the issue of what to do with the undocumented in the third person, like rich folks who talk about poverty over lunch. If you want to know what the immigration debate is really about, you need to get out of the Washington echo chamber and ask an illegal immigrant. Why would you ask a U.S. citizen who takes for granted all the benefits that come with citizenship? Take it from me. I was born in the United States, as were three of my four grandparents. So while I care about the immigration debate, the truth is that my destiny, and that of my family members, doesn't rise and fall on whether Congress stops passing this hot potato and finally tackles immigration reform. I can sympathize with the undocumented, but I can't empathize. So when they talk, I shut up and listen. What I'm hearing from the illegal immigrants I've interviewed -- who also happen to be parents of teenagers who are also undocumented -- is emphatic support for a bill like this. They don't care about citizenship, and they care even less about voting. All they care about is putting their kids in a lifeboat. Many of those kids are planning to go to college and start lives of their own like their classmates, and the last thing their parents want to do is explain why that is impossible. While Congress dickers on this issue, all these people hear is the ticking of the clock. They understand the value of a solution, even if Democrats in Congress don't. Of course, there is always the possibility that those who are so quick to criticize a bill they have not even seen yet may not be interested in solutions at all. Maybe what they really want is the problem -- something to hurl at their opponents at election time to rile up Latinos so they turn out and vote for Democrats. If that is the case, then shame on them. This isn't a game. This is about peoples' lives and finding the best way to enrich them without turning our country's principles inside out. We tried the Democrats' approach. Many of them backed the original DREAM Act, but the leadership couldn't even convince every Democrat in the Senate to support the bill. Now let's give the Republicans a chance. And give politics a rest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: GOP plan to float new version of DREAM Act a step in right direction .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea Clinton can trace her African awakening to February 11, 1990, when she sat on the kitchen counter of the governor's mansion in Arkansas and watched with her parents as Nelson Mandela walked out of prison in South Africa. Just shy of her 10th birthday, Clinton knew then that history was being made and even more, ""that the future was being born,"" she told CNN before leaving this week on a nine-day, six-stop African trip with her father, former President Bill Clinton. Now she is part of that future she envisioned more than 23 years ago. The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is involved in myriad projects in Africa intended to help historically disadvantaged people get a chance to realize their human potential on a continent known mostly for squalor and conflict. Changing both the reality of Africa and the perception of its failed progress are important to Clinton, a self-proclaimed child of advantage raised by wildly successful and famous parents. She credits both with helping her better understand the world, quoting her father's maxim that ""intelligence is equally distributed; opportunity and resources aren't,"" while citing travels around the world with her mother -- former U.S. Sen. and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- that always included time with women and girls in far-flung places such as Zimbabwe. ""I always got to meet girls who very much were my age and very much were experiencing different things and very similar things that I was experiencing in the United States,"" she said, describing encounters that helped her realize ""how many more advantages I had by being born in late-20th century America."" It resulted in a simple but profound question that inspires her today: ""How could I not have thought about what I could do in my life to try to close the gaps that happened just by accident of where I was born?"" The answer is reflected in her work with the foundation and its various initiatives focused on health care, economic empowerment, climate change and other issues. This week's trip begins in Malawi, where Clinton and her father will meet with President Joyce Banda and tour a Clinton Health Access Initiative clinic to visit HIV-infected patients being helped by access to less-expensive medicine. Other stops include Zambia, Tanzania, Zanzibar, Rwanda and South Africa, a regular destination on her African travels. She spent time there in 1997 with her mother on a trip that preceded her father's historic visit a year later as the first sitting U.S. president to go to the country. Clinton and her father also visited South Africa last year as part of a similar African swing to visit foundation sites there and in Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda. Many of the projects result from work of the Clinton Global Initiative, a kind of facilitating arm of the foundation that brings together philanthropists, corporations and others seeking to do good with projects and partners that need help. ""One of the things that we see over and over again is that so often the right constituent parts aren't really that far from one another,"" she said. ""They're just not connected or organized."" So far, CGI members have committed to projects and other participation in Africa worth $27.8 billion, more than a third of the initiative's total member commitment worth $73 billion. Clinton will visit one of the CGI projects on Friday in Zambia, where the U.S.-based Starkey Hearing Foundation will work with local authorities to fit hearing aids for people who need them. It is part of the Starkey foundation's plan to ""to give 1 million people hearing aids this decade to restore the gift of hearing, and to make a difference in people's lives in new ways,"" according to its website. ""It's not giving a gift of hearing for a moment; it's giving the gift of hearing for a lifetime,"" Clinton said of the project, which also supplies batteries and teaches people how to use and maintain the devices to ""totally transform the trajectory"" of their lives. For much of the work of the foundation and the initiatives, success generally means that at some point, their help no longer will be needed, Clinton explained. For example, a coffee roasting plant in Rwanda, which she and her father will visit with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, will eventually process 3,000 tons a day to create 40 jobs while boosting the income of tens of thousands of farmers, according to the Clinton Development Initiative website. Given the nation's troubled history, with the 1994 genocide still resonant as a symbol of African upheaval and misery, the coffee plant represents ""the next chapter in what's been really exciting to watch unfold in Rwanda,"" Clinton said.","The former president and his daughter will make six stops on a nine-day trip .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Could the leader of a democracy reverse his nation's slide toward the ever more permissive use of firearms and mandate stringent new gun control laws in less than a fortnight? Well, yes. One of America's loyal allies did just that -- and with massive voter support. In a popular tourist spot at Port Arthur, Tasmania, in April 1996, a lone gunman killed 20 innocents with his first 29 bullets, all in the space of 90 seconds. This ""pathetic social misfit,"" to quote the judge in the case, was empowered to achieve his final toll of 35 people dead and 18 seriously wounded by firing semi-automatic rifles originally advertised by the gun trade as ""assault weapons."" Now we discover that a similar military-style rifle enabled the Connecticut killer to add his name to the global list of gun horrors. In his initial press briefing on the Connecticut mass shooting, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said ""today is not the day"" to talk about gun control. In 1996, Australians reacted with the opposite mass-majority voice, insisting: ""Now IS the time."" Polls: Your thoughts on gun control . Australia's newly-elected prime minister at the time was John Howard. The country's most conservative leader in decades, openly proud of his pal status with George W. Bush, Prime Minister Howard led the then U.S. president to refer to his nation as America's ""sheriff"" in South East Asia. Just like President Obama, Howard was seen to weep and to offer the nation's prayers in the wake of another gun massacre. But only 12 days after the shootings, in Howard's first major act of leadership and by far the most popular in his first year as prime minister, his government announced nationwide gun law reform. Read more: Obama on assault weapons ban . Attitudes to firearms and the regulations governing them had changed almost overnight. After a decade of gun massacres which saw 100 people shot dead and 38 wounded, Australians had overwhelmingly had enough of anyone with a grudge gaining easy, mostly legal access to weapons designed expressly to kill a lot of people in a very short time. New legislation agreed to by all states and territories specifically addressed mass shootings: Rapid-fire rifles and shotguns were banned, gun owner licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards. In two nationwide, federally funded gun buybacks, plus large-scale voluntary surrenders and state gun amnesties both before and after Port Arthur, Australia collected and destroyed more than a million firearms, perhaps one-third of the national stock. No other nation had attempted anything on this scale. It wasn't without cost to John Howard. Self-interest groups among his conservative base raised hell, and at one rural meeting in a country town, he became the first Australian prime minister to be photographed wearing a bullet-proof jacket. But with statements like: ""We do not want the American disease imported into Australia... Guns have become a blight on American society,"" Howard knew he was speaking for most Australians. Polling at the time measured public approval of his government's new gun laws at 90 to 95 per cent. In the years after the Port Arthur massacre, the risk of dying by gunshot in Australia fell by more than 50% -- and stayed there. In the 16 years since the announcement of legislation specifically designed to reduce gun massacres, Australia has seen no mass shootings. Gun deaths which attract smaller headlines are 80 times more common, yet the national rate of gun homicide remains 30 times lower than that of the United States. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . To claim cause and effect would be to stretch all this too far. Mass shootings are such rare events as to defy prediction, gun death rates were already falling, and John Howard's gun laws no more prevent every shooting than our traffic laws eliminate the road toll. The best we can say is that the results are encouraging, and suggest a way forward. Beliefs and fears aside, death and injury by gunshot could be as amenable to public health intervention as road toll, drunken driving, tobacco-related disease and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The obstructions to gun control are nothing new to public health. An industry and its self-interest groups focused on denial, the propagation of fear, and quasi-religious objections -- we've seen it all before. Barack Obama, at the center of a maelstrom of clashing convictions few foreigners can comprehend, deserves our sympathy. But the future is there to see. With gun violence, as with HIV/AIDS, waste-of-time notions like evil, sin, blame and retribution could in time be sluiced away to allow proven public health procedures. Given the opportunity and the effort, gun injury prevention might save lives as effectively as restricting access to explosives, and mandating child-safe lids on poison bottles.

"(CNN) -- Two world records tumbled in the Aquatics Centre Sunday while France claimed two golds including a stunning upset in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay. Dana Vollmer gave the United States a winning start on the second night of swimming finals with a commanding swim in the women's 100m butterfly, becoming the first woman under the 56 seconds barrier with 55.98 seconds. The second world record of the night saw South African Cameron van der Burgh claim the men's 100m breaststroke gold with a 58.46 seconds clocking. The French gold rush then started with Camille Muffat in the women's 400m from American Allison Schmitt with defending champion Rebecca Adlington taking a battling bronze for Team GB. But it was the freestyle relay which provided the most thrilling finish and a real upset as France's anchor leg swimmer Yannick Agnel overhauled Ryan Lochte to give his country its first gold in the event after a series of near misses. The United States looked to have the gold in the bag after an improved Michael Phelps had given them a commanding lead after the second leg. But Agnel powered past 400m individual medal winner Lochte for France to win in three minutes 9.93 seconds. Russia took the bronze ahead of fancied Australia. The silver medal for Phelps, so disappointing in his opening final Saturday, was his 17th in the Olympics, one behind the all-time record of Larisa Latynina, a Soviet gymnast. Earlier, Vollmer's dominance had been total as she finished nearly a second clear of China's Lu Ying with Alicia Coutts of Australia in third. She bettered the previous world record of 56.06 seconds set by Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom, who finished fourth, at the 2009 world championships. ""I just relied on my strengths,"" Vollmer told gathered reporters. ""Just set it up well, passed a few people and charged it home."" Van der Burgh also broke a mark set at the 2009 championships in Rome, shaving Australian Brenton Rickard's old mark of 58.58 seconds. He dedicated his gold to his former training partner Alexander Dale Oen of Norway, who died at an Arizona training camp in April of heart failure as the result of a blood clot. ""I just have to pay tribute to Alexander Dale Oen tonight, I know he has been with me this year, I think he helped me finish the race in such a strong manner,"" van der Burgh said. ""Once you have become an Olympic champion that can never be taken away from you,"" he added after finishing ahead of Australian Christian Sprenger and American Brendan Hansen.","Dana Vollmer of USA breaks women's 100m butterfly record .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- A manual recount of votes isn't possible in Venezuela, the head of the country's Supreme Court said Wednesday, suggesting there is no legal basis for the opposition's push for a ballot-by-ballot audit of the narrow presidential election results. In nationally televised remarks, Venezuelan Chief Justice Luisa Estella Morales said Venezuela's 1999 constitution eliminated manual recounts in favor of a ""system audit."" ""In Venezuela the electoral system is completely automated. Therefore, a manual count does not exist. Anyone who thought that could really happen has been deceived,"" she said. ""The majority of those who are asking for a manual count know it and are clear about it. Elections are not audited ballot by ballot but through the system."" Her comments came a day after the sounds of clanking pots and pans and bursting fireworks rang out in Caracas as tensions mounted over Venezuela's tight election results. It was a clear sign that days after Sunday's presidential vote, fierce political battles are far from over in the deeply divided country. Supporters of opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski banged pots and pans to protest the government's refusal to recount the votes, while supporters of President-elect Nicolas Maduro set off fireworks to celebrate his victory and drown out the noise. Maduro, the late President Hugo Chavez's handpicked successor, is scheduled to be sworn in on Friday. Election authorities proclaimed him president-elect on Monday despite Capriles' demand for a recount. Venezuela's state-run AVN news agency said at least eight people had been killed in post-election violence across the country. AVN also reported that authorities had arrested 135 people in connection with political violence. The government news agency tied the deaths to opposition protests and said the victims were all followers of Maduro. Government health clinics, food distribution centers, a bank and a preschool program were the targets of violence, officials said. CNN could not independently confirm the government reports of violence, and it was unknown whether there were any opposition injuries or fatalities. Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while opposition candidate Capriles won 49%, Venezuela's National Electoral Council said. Since the tally was announced, both Capriles and Maduro have publicly urged supporters to remain peaceful while also accusing each other of inciting violence. The issue of post-election clashes swiftly has become a flashpoint for a new round of political sparring, as Capriles repeated his calls for a recount and Maduro vowed to use an iron fist to crack down on any attempts to unseat him from the presidency. Analysis: Why Venezuela is so divided? Capriles' repeated demands for a recount have left key questions about Venezuela's future unanswered: Will Maduro's supporters stick behind him? Will tension in the deeply divided country boil over after the tight race? And will world leaders recognize the results? U.S Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that he could not say if he would recognize Maduro as the president-elect or not. ""We think there ought to be a recount. ... Obviously if there are huge irregularities we're going to have serious questions about the viability of that government,"" Kerry said during a hearing of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee. His comments drew a stern response from Maduro, who said Wednesday in national broadcast remarks Wednesday that he ""does not care"" whether the United States recognizes his election victory. ""Don't recognize anything. Your recognition does not matter to us,"" Maduro said. ""We have decided to be free and we are going to be free and independent, with you or without you. Your opinion is not important to us."" CNN's Paula Newton reported from Caracas. CNN's Rafael Romo and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- It's cold and raining in Kabul and the pothole-filled dirt roads have turned into a sea of mud. We drive up to the gateway of a high-walled compound. A soldier brandishing an AK-47 stands guard outside the building. We've come to a women's shelter to meet Gul Meena -- a 17-year-old girl from Pakistan who shouldn't be alive. My crew and I are ushered into a room and sitting on a wooden chair slouched over is small, fragile Gul Meena. Her sullen eyes turn from the raindrops streaming down the window outside and towards us as we enter the room. Gul's bright coloured headscarf is embroidered with blue, red and green flowers and covers most of her face. She nervously plays with it and gives us a glimpse of a frightened smile from underneath the fabric. Her guardian Anisa, from the shelter run by Women for Afghan Women, touches her head and gently moves the headscarf back. That's when we see the scars etched deeply into her face. This Pakistani girl's life of misery and suffering began at the tender age of 12, when instead of going to school she was married to a man old enough to be her grandfather. She says: ""My family married me off when I was 12 years old. My husband was 60. Every day he would beat me. I would cry and beg him stop. But he just kept on beating me."" When Gul told her family what was happening, they responded in a way that shocked her. ""My family would hit me when I complained. They told me you belong in your husband's house -- that is your life."" After five years of abuse, Gul Meena met a young Afghan man and finally gathered the courage to leave her husband in Pakistan. In November 2012 she packed up some belongings and they made their way across the border into Afghanistan to the city of Jalalabad. READ MORE: Afghanistan's future: 5 burning questions . Gul knew she was committing the ultimate crime according to strict Islamic customs -- running away from her husband with another man -- but she also knew she didn't want to continue living the life she had since her marriage. ""I'd tried to kill myself with poison several times but it didn't work. I hated my life and I had to escape. When I ran away I knew it would be dangerous. I knew my husband and family would be looking for me but I never thought this would happen. I thought my future would be bright,"" she says. Days later her older brother tracked them down. Armed with an ax, he hacked to death Gul Meena's friend, and then struck his own sister 15 times -- cutting open her face, head and parts of her body. Gul Meena shows me these scars -- taking off her headscarf, her finger gently running up and down the raised, freshly healed skin. She touches her head where the blade hit her and then shows me the deep cuts that were made to the back of her neck and her arms. It's clear to me she desperately tried to fight off her brother before she passed out. Assuming she was dead, her brother escaped back to Pakistan. Authorities are yet to catch him, but his family denies that he tried to kill Gul. Hearing the commotion, a passer-by discovered Gul Meena lying in a pool of blood in her bed, and rushed her to the Emergency Department of Nangarhar Regional Medical Centre. With part of her brain hanging out of her skull, neurosurgeon Zamiruddin Khalid held out little hope that the girl on his operating table would survive. READ MORE: Why U.S. can't deliver women's rights to Afghanistan . ""We took her to the operating theatre and she'd already lost a lot of blood. Her injuries were horrific and her brain had been affected -- we didn't think she would survive"", says Khalid as he shows us photos of Gul's injuries before he sewed up the wounds. In one photo her face looks like a piece of meat that has been hacked apart. Khalid said: ""We are very thankful to almighty God that Gul Meena is alive -- it really is a miracle."" But Gul's troubles were far from over. While she'd received life-saving treatment from the doctors and staff at the hospital, she had no one to care for her on the outside. Gul had been disowned by her family and despite the government and authorities knowing that she was alive and receiving care at the hospital, they wanted nothing to do with her due to the stigma and circumstances surrounding her attack. For two months Gul stayed in the hospital thanks to the generosity of doctors who donated the money to pay for her medicine. Finally the American-Afghan organization Women for Afghan Women was informed of Gul's situation and took her in, transporting her back to a shelter in Kabul to give her the love and care she so desperately needed. ""When she first came to us she couldn't talk or walk she was barely conscious -- she couldn't eat by herself. She had to wear a diaper. If we hadn't got her when we did, she wouldn't have survived,"" says Manizha Naderi, the executive director of Women For Afghan Women. Gul Meena is one of thousands of women living in shelters across Afghanistan -- many of them victims of attempted honor killings. Tragically this practice still exists in a number of cultures, including certain tribes in Afghanistan and Pakistan. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon recently expressed concern over the 20% increase in civilian casualties among women and girls in Afghanistan in 2012. Moon said: ""I'm deeply disturbed that despite some improvements in prosecuting cases of violence, there is still a pervasive climate of impunity in Afghanistan for abuses of women and girls."" READ MORE: UN: Civilian deaths fall in Afghanistan; first drop in 6 years . The U.N. claims that 4,000 cases of violence against women and girls were reported to the Afghan Ministry of Women between 2010 and 2012. While there are 14 women's shelters in Afghanistan, all of them are funded by the international community, and the concern is that once international forces pull out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014 this funding will disappear. What will that mean for the thousands of women who rely on their services like uneducated, illiterate, homeless Gul Meena? Naderi says: ""If we send her to her family, she's going to be killed. As far as her family is concerned she's dead. That's the problem for all our women. It's a scary time for Afghanistan and especially for Afghan women, in particular the women in our shelters because we don't know what's going to happen. If they leave here, for most of them it will be a death sentence."" Gul Meena doesn't think about the future -- and in fact, she wishes she had died the day she was attacked. ""I've tried to kill myself several times since arriving at the shelter but they won't let me. When I look at the mirror I put one hand to the side of my face. People tell me not to do that ... but I'm so ashamed.""","Gul Meena, 17, left her abusive husband in Pakistan for another man .

"(CNN) -- Like so many others, I am distraught. It will take many days to sort through my feelings and reactions to the verdict of not guilty in the Trayvon Martin case. Still, some thoughts and lessons are obvious, immediate and, in a sense, imperative. First, those who delight in the verdict are wrong. There is no winner here. Trayvon Martin is still dead and George Zimmerman still must live with the fact that he killed without reason or cause. Here, the ""should have"" rules: He should have stayed in the truck. Those who react to the verdict with despair are wrong. We work hard for justice in this world, but we, being human, are flawed. We will make mistakes. The law is only our best approximation of justice, and the law needs constant revision. But doing what's right is not limited to the law. Sometimes, we must go beyond it. Opinion: Zimmerman case echoes issues of race, guns . Those who expect -- perhaps desire -- a riot are wrong. We are better than that. We respect the law. While the law cannot force a person to be moral or tolerant, through the law we can demand respect and expect equality. If we are to move forward as a country we must recognize that this case highlights three issues. We must confront these without excuse or rancor. We must be honest about our weaknesses. LZ: Trayvon could have been my son . First, we are not in a post-racial society. Racial profiling still exists and it is a cancer. Assumptions and fallacies and prejudice feed it. We are suspicious of those who look different; we are uncomfortable with cultural differences. We distrust what we don't understand, but surely we should not act with violence or bigotry. If you don't know about the ""black male code,"" you should. It's something black boys learn early, even before adolescence. It goes, in part, like this: Even though you're not a criminal, some people assume you are, especially if you're wearing certain clothes. Never argue with the police, but protect your dignity and take pride in humility. As a black male, you must go above and beyond to show strangers what type of person you really are. There's more, but you get the point: If you're black and male, know that many Americans -- not all, not even most, but many -- assume you are guilty of something, just because you're you. Opinion: Trayvon could have been my son . Now try to live with that every day. We need to see ourselves through the eyes of others. Finally, there's the cliché -- think before you act. Thou shalt not murder is a universal commandment, one necessary for a civilized nation, a civilized world. Let us focus on ways to improve the system -- the criminal system, the justice system, the moral system, the general welfare system. Let us focus on acts of goodness and kindness that bring us together, as a people and as creations of God. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: There is no winner here .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney arrived Wednesday in South Carolina as the clear front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, while his rivals campaigned across the state to try to halt the former Massachusetts governor's momentum after his victory the day before in New Hampshire. CNN projected that Romney's second straight triumph in the first two contests of the nomination process gained him seven of the state's 12 delegates, based on his first-place support from just over 39% of primary voters. Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who finished second with about 23%, picked up three delegates, and former Utah Gov. and U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman gained two delegates based on his third-place finish with roughly 17% of the vote. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum got no delegates for their support of just under 10% each, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry also was shut out by trailing with less than 1% of the vote. With 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination, the New Hampshire haul was more symbolic than substantive, but it further bolstered Romney's campaign after his razor-thin victory in last week's Iowa caucuses. Next on the primary calendar is the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where Romney's five opponents are counting on the state's social conservatism and reputation for brass-knuckle political brawls to help their cause. The Palmetto State has picked the winner of every GOP nomination fight since 1980. Gingrich told a town hall in Rock Hill, South Carolina, that the result of the upcoming primary will be historic. ""I believe the next 10 days are as important as any 10 days we have seen in modern American politics,"" Gingrich said. ""I believe that South Carolinians are either going to center in and pick one conservative or by default they are going to send a moderate on to the nomination."" Santorum, who lost to Romney by eight votes in Iowa, said Wednesday that it was ""silly"" for anyone to suggest Romney has the nomination wrapped up. ""This is a long process,"" Santorum said while campaigning in Ridgeway, South Carolina. ""Half the people (who) voted yesterday weren't even Republicans."" Romney is hoping a combination of momentum, campaign cash, growing establishment support and a fractured opposition will lead to a victory not only in South Carolina but also in Florida at the end of the month. That would be four straight victories for Romney after Iowa and New Hampshire, and could bring the Republican contest to an early conclusion. In a sign of Romney's support, his campaign said Wednesday it would report fourth-quarter earnings of $24 million for a total of $56 million in 2011. ""I have a long way to go before I get the nomination,"" Romney told CNN on Wednesday morning. The other candidates will ""find new attacks. (But) I think in the final analysis people want someone who can lead the country back to strength with good jobs and rising incomes, and all these attacks I think will fall entirely flat."" In his victory speech Tuesday night, Romney sounded like the presumptive Republican nominee, calling Barack Obama ""a failed president"" who puts his faith in government while ""we put our faith in the American people."" Romney is the first non-incumbent Republican in modern history to win both Iowa and New Hampshire. Romney leaves N.H. with wind at back . For their part, the other candidates quickly tried to minimize New Hampshire's importance and appeal to South Carolina's more conservative electorate. In Rock Hill, Gingrich said that if elected, ""we will not tolerate a speech dictatorship in this country against Christianity."" He also questioned Democratic challenges to Republican efforts to require more stringent voter identification efforts in some areas. ""What does it tell you about the Obama administration that they are afraid -- afraid -- to have an honest elections?"" Gingrich said. ""They are afraid if we only allow legal voters."" Perry noted the fact that he had all but abandoned New Hampshire, focusing his time and energy on South Carolina. ""South Carolina is a winner-take-all state,"" Perry said on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""Winning here, I can promise you, wipes out the caucus victory and New Hampshire. So if Mitt's thinking he's got it in the bag, I think he'll be in for a great surprise in South Carolina when he shows up here."" Are you in South Carolina? Tell us why you're voting . Santorum, meanwhile, took aim at both Romney and Perry. Without naming Romney, Santorum said electing a moderate would be little better than having a Democratic president. ""That's not a victory at all,"" Santorum said, adding: ""We want a leader that believes in us and is not an establishment candidate who's going to do more of the same."" Responding to Perry's claim of being the only true political outsider in the race, Santorum noted that Perry ""requested 1,200 earmarks as governor of Texas, and Rick Perry's been in politics in Texas for 25 years, so he's been in public life more than anyone else running for president."" Santorum's campaign said it has raised $3 million since the second-place finish in Iowa, with at least half of that planned for spending on ads in South Carolina. Paul told CNN after his second-place finish Tuesday that he expects to raise more money, and his campaign chairman said Wednesday that Paul plans to spend $1 million in South Carolina, a significant amount in a state where television advertising isn't all that expensive. Even if Romney is unstoppable as the GOP nominee, Paul and his aides made clear he intends to keep his campaign going, perhaps all the way to the Republican convention. The more delegates he can rack up, the more leverage he would have to integrate key messages of his libertarian, anti-interventionist movement into the Republican Party platform. ""We're on the move,"" Paul said Wednesday in West Columbia, South Carolina. ""It isn't only because you have a candidate. We have an issue, and we have a set of principles that we're going to defend, and this is what motivates people."" Paul: Only I can stop Romney . In an interview with CNN before Tuesday's results came in, Gingrich acknowledged South Carolina will be vital to his presidential hopes. ""We're going to go all out to win South Carolina. We think that's a key state for us,"" the former speaker said, describing the race there as a contest between himself -- a ""Georgia Reagan conservative"" -- and Romney, ""a Massachusetts moderate."" Gingrich has been pounding at Romney since Iowa, complaining about a massive negative ad campaign against him by allies of the former Massachusetts governor. A Gingrich-allied super PAC has already launched its own anti-Romney barrage in South Carolina, and Gingrich and others have honed in on Romney's years as a financier with Bain Capital, accusing him of getting rich by gutting companies and laying off workers. ""The last thing you want is to nominate somebody who collapses in September because they can't answer the questions,"" Gingrich said Wednesday in an interview to broadcast on CNN. "" ... You know, people want to attack me for my past, that's fine. I either will answer it and be ready to be the nominee or I won't. Romney ought to have to meet the same test."" Gingrich wasn't alone in attacking Romney's business record. In South Carolina, Perry told supporters Romney's firm ""looted"" a photo company in Gaffney and a steel company in Georgetown. ""I would suggest they are just vultures,"" Perry said. ""They are vultures that are sitting out there on the tree limb waiting for the company to get sick, then they swoop in, they eat the carcass, they leave with that and they leave the skeleton."" Democrats have joined the Republican criticism, with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the Democratic National Committee, saying Wednesday that Romney emerged from New Hampshire a ""wounded candidate."" ""Yesterday's primary couldn't have happened soon enough for him because his support in the state was rapidly eroding,"" Wasserman Schultz said ""As I watched it erode, it seemed to me the more people got to know Mitt Romney the less they liked him."" Romney seemed unconcerned in an interview Wednesday on CNN. ""It's been brought up every time I've run,"" Romney said, adding that Democrats are trying to put ""free enterprise on trial."" ""But, you know, Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich are going to be the witnesses for the prosecution,"" he added. ""I'm not worried about that. ... You saw last night that approach didn't work very well for (them). And so we'll take it to the next level."" At a Romney event Wednesday night, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley chided fellow Republicans for making an issue of Romney's business past. ""We have a real problem when we have Republicans talking like Democrats against the free market,"" she said as the audience cheered. ""We believe in the free market."" A former businesswoman, Haley appealed to the audience as fellow executives. ""We want companies to be able to do what is best for companies, and during tough times you downsize and you make hard decisions and during good times you expand and you help those businesses grow more,"" she said in her introduction of Romney. ""That's what he's done. He's done what every one of us has tried to do."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Alan Silverleib, Jim Acosta, Peter Hamby, Dana Bash, Kevin Bohn, Tom Cohen, Jessica Yellin and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","NEW: South Carolina's governor says don't attack Romney's business record .

"(CNN) -- While the Tour de France ambles around the French countryside a dark shadow still lingers over the sport's blue ribbon event. While the PR machine goes into overdrive and the wheels of change are supposedly set in motion, cycling's attempt to lift the specter of Lance Armstrong still remains. A man who 'won' the Tour de France on seven occasions brought the sport to its knees last January after finally admitting he doped following years of denying the allegations. Earlier this year, Armstrong revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone which is naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. His seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 came amidst rumor and speculation that he was doping -- while the U.S. Anti-Doping agency (USADA) accused Armstrong of running ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" Now, the Union Cycliste International (UCI), the sport's governing body and its president Pat McQuaid are under pressure to revamp cycling's entire image. But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck -- despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame. ""I'll look back on a rider who was as well as many others at that period, cheating and getting away with it because the system wasn't strong enough to beat him,"" McQuaid told CNN ahead of the start of the Tour. ""It wasn't a question of authorities, because many authorities tried to catch him and weren't able to, so I don't blame the UCI. I don't blame the AFLD (French anti-doping agency) or USADA or anyone else. ""The system wasn't strong enough and they were using products that couldn't be caught with the system. ""The system is a lot stronger now and so I look back on an athlete and it's not just Lance Armstrong, many of his counterparts were doing the same thing because they could get away with it."" Disillusioned . However McQuaid's position as president of the UCI is under huge strain with opponents desperate to displace him. Cycling Ireland refused to back its home candidate for September's UCI elections, while a recent management committee meeting in Bergen, Norway, was a fiery affair. A dossier compiled by private investigators on McQuaid was reportedly put forward to the committee with the Irishman blocking any attempts to discuss it on the opening day of the meeting. The document was eventually discussed and although its contents have not been made public, it represented another blow to McQuaid's re-election hopes. While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong's activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a hugely detrimental report from the USADA last October. The report raised question marks over whether the UCI had a role in covering up positive tests -- an allegation which McQuaid strenuously denies. When pushed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: ""No. Absolutely not."" After being quizzed on how he could be sure, McQuaid added: ""Because we know, we've studied, we know what we've done and we know, we have looked into all of this even since. ""We have prepared, we have prepared a big number of files for the independent commission that we were going to present to the independent commission and all those questions that you've asked there are all answered in those files. ""I think he (Armstrong) was tested 10-15 times during the Tour de France. So we did all we could do. Those samples were sent away and they came back negative. ""The UCI wasn't the only anti-doping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. ""I mean everybody was testing him and they were coming back negative and in that situation one has to say that the situation isn't strong enough and it wasn't at that time but today the system is much stronger and much better."" But McQuaid is facing a challenge for the leadership from British cycling chief Brian Cookson, who has grown disillusioned with the Irishman's tenure. It follows a catalog of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,000 donation from Armstrong in 2002 -- four years before McQuaid took up his role. The money was used by the UCI to buy a Sysmex machine, a contraption which is used to analyze blood samples. It is a decision which McQuaid concedes should not have been made. ""I would say and we have said, we have admitted that in hindsight -- and of course hindsight is an exact science -- that it would have been better had we not accepted those,"" he said. ""But we took them at that time in good faith and we used them for the uses that we said we had put them to."" Cookson has been heavily critical of the way McQuaid has led the UCI and has pledged to restore faith in the organization. He has promised to create a completely new independent anti-doping unit, which would work alongside the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Cheats . McQuaid, who is aiming to secure a third term in office, remains philosophical about the future and the battle against doping. ""Nobody is silly enough to say that you're 100% confident that the peleton is 100% clean,"" added the UCI president. ""That's just not possible. It's not going to be possible in any sport or in any parts of society, but certainly I think the large majority of cyclists are now going into their careers, not wanting to get involved in doping. ""And there's evidence of many riders who come from strong teams, with strong anti-doping backgrounds all winning races and when they get across, you know, when they're doing their press conferences, they are saying I'm an example of how you can win a race clean . ""I don't think it'll ever be beaten because in every part of society there are cheats. ""There are people who look for a short-cut, who try to win by devious means or whatever. ""Whether it's cheating by taking drugs or cheating in any other fashion, there are always going to be people like that in society and in sport ."" There is one avenue which remains open to McQuaid though -- a route which involves Armstrong. The opportunity to talk to the disgraced cyclist in a bid to improve doping control remains a possibility -- and McQuaid is refusing to rule out such a move. ""He certainly has more knowledge,"" he said of Armstrong. ""If he was prepared, in terms of coming to the UCI, not necessarily to me and explain in more detail or give us more assistance, give us more information and try to help us in planning the future on the fight against doping, we'd certainly be interested in speaking to him.""","Chris Froome is current leader of Tour de France .

"Beijing (CNN) -- ""I have a bomb!"" a wheelchair bound man shouted, holding what looked like a homemade bomb. ""Stay away from me."" Minutes earlier, Ji Zhongxing had wheeled himself into Beijing International Airport's arrivals terminal. As he began to distribute leaflets to publicize his cause, he was stopped by airport security. Arriving passengers walked past him, seemingly oblivious to the looming danger. Ji had written on his personal blog in 2006 that he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in Shandong Province in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation. Shortly after his standoff with airport security, the disgruntled petitioner detonated his device, causing a minor explosion and injuring his arm. A policeman also suffered minor injuries but there were no other casualties, except perhaps China's fragile facade of stability. Sympathy . The country's mainstream and social media covered the explosion and its aftermath. Rather than decry what was an act of terror, many people sympathized with Ji -- some even depicted him as a hero for warning people away before setting off the bomb. But an editorial in the state-controlled Global Times this week stated that although cases like Ji's were sad, extremism by victims was not ""tolerable."" ""It's important to remember that Ji should be condemned and dealt with by law. His grievances can't provide moral support for his extreme actions, nor can they shield him from legal punishment,"" the editorial stated. ""Behind extreme crimes at the cost of self-harm, there are often unfortunate stories of suffering and tears. We support and call for the authorities to investigate those sad stories and consider investigation to be an important element that cannot be neglected when tackling extreme cases."" Central concern . Authorities will also be worried that Ji's act may spawn similar actions . Ji's act was the latest in a number of incidents involving petitioners airing grievances and seeking social justice. In 2011, Qian Mingqi, a 52-year-old unemployed man, set off consecutive explosions in three government buildings in Jiangxi province, killing two -- including the bomber himself -- and injuring ten people. Qian, it turned out, had been trying to seek redress for the loss of his property, which he claimed was illegally demolished by local authorities. ""Ten years of fruitlessly trying to seek redress have forced me to go on a path I did not wish to make,"" he had posted on Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like microblog. While these sad tales have become more frequent, they are not new. I've seen this replayed many times. Annual petition . The Chinese practice of going to Beijing to ""shangfang"" (petition) is centuries old, dating back to the days when aggrieved citizens could petition the emperor. Every year, ahead of the annual meeting of China's legislature in Beijing, police take away thousands of petitioners from around the country seeking redress for problems with local officials. Many of them phone media offices like ours to seek help, or to simply vent their frustrations. Every month or so, we receive packets in the mail containing handwritten accounts and pictures, recounting their sad stories. China is grappling with an acknowledged rise in social unrest, sparked by public anger over land grabs without proper compensation, official corruption, the growing gap between the rich and the poor and environmental damage. Abusive behavior . Allegations of official abuse and police brutality are common. Spontaneous riots are also frequent. In central Hunan province, for example, watermelon vendor Deng Zhengjia, 56, recently died after he and his wife were beaten up by six officers of ""chengguan,"" the Urban Management Law Enforcement forces, prompting online uproar and detention of the officers. Such abusive behavior has put the spotlight on the problem of the ""chengguan,"" the para-police agency tasked with enforcing non-criminal city regulations. Although it has no legal authority to detain suspects, critics say, they frequently do so and sometimes even resort to ""enhanced interrogation."" They confiscate merchandise and impose arbitrary fines, leading critics to suspect corruption. They are also known to collude with property developers to evict people. Growing discontent . Human rights groups have called on the Chinese government to clip the chengguan's powers and investigate its violent acts. ""The chengguan are not protecting the safety of Chinese citizens, they're actively undermining it,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. ""The Chinese government can signal that it's serious about meaningful rule of law by ending chengguan abuses and impunity."" The Chinese leadership recognizes the risks posed by growing social discontent, but seems unable to find fundamental solutions. It fears that political liberalization might lead to massive ""dongluan"" (chaos). Such fear drives the Chinese leaders to seemingly contradictory policies and behavior. Instead of addressing legitimate complaints, officials tend to resort to force and intimidation. Many cities have set up elite police squads to deal with riots and ""terrorism."" They say they encourage ""whistleblowers"" to expose abuses, but when they aim at abusive officials, they get muzzled. Li Chengpeng, one of China's most influential bloggers, recently had his Weibo account suspended after he posted a pointed essay about Ji Zhongxing's case. Ji, 34, had long been silenced by a system that tolerates little dissent, he said. 'Festering away' The Shandong native has been paralyzed since 2005, when he was allegedly beaten up by several ""chengguan"" officers while working as an unlicensed motorcycle driver in southern Guangdong province. He was suing for damages, asking for over 334,000 yuan (about US$53,000) but to no avail. ""I am now festering away, paralyzed and over 100,000 yuan in debt,"" he posted on his blog that has since been deleted. ""The only thing that is keeping me going is the thought of seeking justice."" In desperation, Ji brought his struggle for justice to Beijing, adding his voice to the chorus of discontent. Chinese political scientist Li Fan says Chinese leaders can ignore this rising chorus at their own peril. ""The airport bombing shows that when people are hopeless they will resort to more violence,"" he explained. ""It's dangerous because next time someone will think, if no one listens, take even more radical steps, then your voice can reach the top and your case can be solved."" Li, author of the book ""The Rise of Civil Rights Movement in Contemporary China,"" believes the old petition system has very limited role. ""The Chinese government should give people more space, to be able to speak out and participate in local affairs. It's a good way to defuse the anger of the people,"" said the Beijing-based political scientist. ""Otherwise there will just be more and more protests.""","Many on Chinese social media sympathized with plight of Beijing airport ""bomber""

"(CNN) -- Businesses exist to make a profit. That's why they're businesses. But, in their quest to make money, there are certain invisible lines they should be careful about crossing. Making a profit is one thing. Going over the line and insulting your customers is another. It's the kind of thing that can put a business out of business. Almost every airline has been charging passengers to check bags for quite a while now. When the fees were first instituted, there was considerable grumbling, but travelers have become accustomed to it, even if they still don't much like it. Executives who run the airlines know that passengers will always flock to a low fare. That's the primary reason the airlines began charging to check bags: Operating an airline is tremendously expensive, and to keep the basic ticket price as low as possible, the revenue had to be made up somewhere. Fees to change reservations, fees for meals, fees for early boarding, fees for pillows and blankets, fees for seats with a little extra legroom. . . . Reporter Susan Carey of the Wall Street Journal recently wrote that ""airlines are likely to keep looking for new ways to nickel-and-dime customers on formerly free items."" She quoted George Hobica, an airline industry consumer advocate, as saying that ""he wouldn't be shocked if big carriers eventually adopted fees for carry-on luggage."" That's not a typo. Fees for carrying on bags, not checking them. Now, that could never really happen, right? That's just speculation, isn't it? But in fact, there is already precedent in the U.S. aviation industry. Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines charges its passengers a fee for their carry-on bags; based on when and where they purchase their tickets, the fee ranges from $25 to $50 per carry-on bag. On its website, Spirit says that to provide ""ultra-low basic fares,"" it gives its passengers ""freedom to choose only the extras they value."" If the price wars continue to escalate, would the major airlines ever dare to tell their passengers that carrying their clothes along with them on a trip is an ""extra"" feature of flying for which the customers should be expected to pay an additional fee? Because that's what the choice would come down to. If you buy a ticket and are told that you have to pay more to check your bags, and that if you don't check your bags you also have to pay more to carry them with you, your only alternative, if you object, would be to leave at home any clothes except the ones you are wearing. That's where the invisible line between trying to make a profit, and insulting your customers, comes in. More than a decade ago, First Chicago Corp., which became Bank One Corp., decided that it would be a bright idea to charge customers a fee -- $3 -- every time those customers interacted with a teller. Banks were already charging fees to use ATMs -- people getting cash from the machines were paying a convenience fee. But then First Chicago instituted the rule that, if customers with less than a certain amount of cash in their accounts went to a teller window, the conversation and transaction with the teller would cost them that $3. Customers with whom I spoke at the time said that even when they were making deposits, they would be charged for handing over their own money. To some customers, that constituted robbery -- by the banks. There are a few things in this world, even in the world of business, that people should not be expected to pay for. When you walk into a bank, no matter what, dealing with a teller should be free. During the extensive public and media conversation over the issue, I expressed the opinion that any bank that charges any of its customers a penny to interact with a teller doesn't deserve to have any customers. First Chicago became Bank One, and installed a new top man who had not made the original decision, but had inherited it. He was a fellow by the name of Jamie Dimon, who has, of course, since moved on to bigger things: As chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Dimon is one of the most powerful and influential financial figures in the world. Back when he was newly at Bank One, he called me, saying he wanted to explain the business rationale for the teller fee. If you should ever unexpectedly receive a phone call from Jamie Dimon, you will immediately recognize (at least I did) that he is smarter than you, that he is 100 % certain that his position is the correct position, and that he is confident that he can persuade you to come around to his side. But, world-class persuasiveness notwithstanding, in the case of teller fees the policy was destined ultimately to fail, because it crossed that mythical line: It insulted the customers. Two years after that conversation, Bank One announced that it was dropping the fee. One of its top executives told a reporter: ""Why have it? I wasn't here when we started it. I really don't understand why we'd have it."" (Yet, as some readers already are thinking, there are banks around the country that have figured out new ways to charge for dealing in person with tellers without using the label ""teller fee."" It usually shows up on the monthly statement, under some arcane heading. The desire to make that extra buck never seems to end.) Will you eventually be paying to carry your bag onto a plane? Southwest Airlines has garnered a lot of good will, and a lot of business, by holding out against the movement to charge for checked bags -- Southwest still checks the first two bags for free. JetBlue doesn't charge for the first checked bag. If some major carriers announce that they are instituting a fee for carry-ons, the best counteroffensive will likely come from one or more of their competitors, who may choose to proclaim: . ""Come fly with us. We don't charge you to carry your own bag."" For the beleaguered traveling public, that may even sound like a victory. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Businesses exist to make profit. But would airlines stoop to charging for carry-ons?
At least one small carrier does, he says. Such a business move insults customers .

"(CNN) -- We've come to expect fees for hotel WiFi and parking, but as lodging fees pile up, there are some that may come as a surprise to even the seasoned business traveler. Early check-in? Some hotels charge for it. Restocking that $5 bottle of water you drank out of the minibar? Yes, some properties charge for that, too. The amount of fees and surcharges being tacked onto hotel bills has reached an all-time high, according to a report from the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, which estimates that the U.S. lodging industry collected $1.95 billion in fees in 2012 -- up a whopping $100 million from the previous year. Airports where architecture soars . ""Fees and surcharges emerged as an industry practice in about 1997,"" notes Bjorn Hanson, the divisional dean of NYU's Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management, which compiled the NYU-SCPS report. According to the study, the amount of hotel fees collected has risen every year since 1997 except for select periods following 2001 and 2008, when the demand for lodging declined. The rise in hotel fees can be attributed to two things, explains Bill Carroll, a PhoCusWright hotel analyst and senior lecturer at Cornell University. ""There is a unique opportunity for hotels to produce additional revenue from their asset. Second, the consumer choice to purchase additional services is not encumbered by competition. The consumer has already chosen among competitors to stay at the property. Given that decision, the property can now offer additional services, without direct (price) competition. In addition, the property knows a lot more about the guest (traveling alone or with family, staying over a weekend as a leisure guest versus midweek as a business traveler, etc.). Targeted service offerings can be made."" Check in: World's best airport hotels . Hotel fees for things that add customer value are one thing, says Carroll, but ""on the negative side are fees that bet on the guest not paying attention to folio charges."" Here are a few examples of the new batch of fees that have been creeping onto hotel bills. Early check-in fee. If you want to check in to your room before the preset time, you could incur a charge of as much as $50 for the privilege. Early check-out fee. You may also be charged anywhere from $50 to the cost of a night's stay if you have to leave a day or more earlier than expected. Cancellation fees. Need to cancel your stay altogether? Whereas before you might have been able to cancel your reservation without penalty by 6 p.m. on the day before your scheduled arrival, some hotels are now charging you a night's stay if you don't cancel within 48 or even 72 hours prior to arrival. Minibar restocking fee. At some hotels you'll not only have to pay to enjoy an item from the minibar, you'll also have to pay a restocking fee to have the item replaced. So that $12 can of nuts may end up costing you more like $19. Automatic gratuities. Before you tip anyone, check to see if an automatic gratuity for their services has already been added. For instance, you may incur a one-time $10 to $30 fee to cover housekeeping and bellman gratuities, while your bill for room service or spa services may already include a 10% to 20% tip. Gym fee. Some hotels are pumping up their bills by charging anywhere from $5 to $40 a day for the use of the fitness facilities. Baggage holding fees. Need to stash your luggage at the bellhop stand? You might have to shell out a couple of bucks per bag to have them tucked away. Tiered WiFi charges. Some hotels are charging for Internet access based on how you use it. For example, basic Internet service for things like checking your e-mail may be free, but if you need high-speed access, then it could cost you upwards of $10 a day. Airlines collect $27 billion beyond ticket revenue . What irks travelers even more than having to pay the growing number of hotel fees is the fact that they may not even know about them until they've already booked the room, or worse, gotten their bill. So you need to do your due diligence and find out ahead of time what to expect. In the minds of some hoteliers, the fees are a way to give guests what they want and not charge them for what they don't. ""Many guests don't require the full amenities a hotel offers, so fees are implemented to offer additional services the guests can add to their basic stay without penalizing other guests who don't need them,"" says Marc Sternagel, general manager of the Novotel New York Times Square. ""Guests like the option of choosing additional add-ons, and therefore they are able to customize their experience in accordance with their personal needs for any specific stay."" Others hoteliers worry that bombarding their guests with fees will cost them customers. ""At all of our resorts, valet parking, Internet and minibar refreshments are extended to our guests on a complimentary basis,"" says Caroline MacDonald, senior vice president of marketing for Auberge Resorts. ""Several resorts also provide breakfast as part of the daily rate. We find that our guests really appreciate the small gestures, and have found that they value the overall experience."" World's best airport spas . Benji Homsey, president of Hotel ZaZa, a collection with locations in Dallas and Houston, says his company puts convenience and the guest experience first. ""We've never charged for WiFi. We consider technology an investment for the hotel, since 65% of our midweek guests are business travelers."" However you see them, hotel fees aren't likely to be going away anytime soon. ""Such fees will continue,"" predicts Carroll. ""The smart hotels will structure offerings that are both reasonable to the consumer and add value. A few hotels will challenge the very notion of hospitality â€” 'Mary and Joseph, there will be an additional straw fee for the manger.'"" Hanson forecasts that the number and variety of hotel surcharges will likely taper off, but the number of hotels charging fees will increase, as will the amount of the fees being charged. Explains Melanie Nayer, a veteran travel journalist and hotels expert: ""Like everything, prices fluctuate with the economy and also based on demand. And hotels are just calculating appropriately based on industry standards."" Besides, she says, you were basically already paying these fees, you just didn't know it since they were lumped into a flat rate. ""These aren't new fees so much as they are fees that have been separated from your room charge and put into a different line item."" Luckily, there are some ways you can avoid the glut of hotel surcharges. ""Loyalty programs are the best way to avoid extra fees and surcharges, since loyalty programs typically offer fee waivers,"" says Nayer. ""You can also avoid fees in many cases by calling ahead to the hotel and asking about packages, many of which include fee waivers, especially for WiFi and parking."" Avoiding hotel fees may mean a little extra work on your part, but it could make a noticeable difference, especially for business travelers who may have trouble explaining all those extra line items when they turn in their expense reports. What kinds of hotel fees have you encountered? What's your take on line-item billing?","The U.S. lodging industry collected $1.95 billion in fees in 2012, NYU study says .
Fees started to emerge in the hotel industry in 1997, expert says, and fee revenue keeps increasing .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Donating to charity itself is a relatively new phenomenon in a society that traditionally values family units. President Lee Myung-Bak is criticized by opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich. So the announcement that South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak will be donating $26 million, the bulk of his wealth, to charity, is considered highly unusual. The president's office said the money will be used to set up a new youth scholarship program. ""My fortune, which I accumulated through hard work during my life, is very precious to me,"" said Lee in a statement. ""I have long thought that it would be good if my wealth was spent for society in a valuable way."" Lee, who came to office last February, promised to donate his personal wealth to society in late 2007 when he was accused of amassing his fortune through illegal means. He was since been cleared of all charges. But he is now facing criticism from opposition parties who say he supports policies that favor the rich. Lee is a former CEO of Hyundai Construction and the Seoul mayor. But he emphasizes his impoverished beginnings, as a poor young man who had to earn his college tuition cleaning streets. ""Looking back, I realize that all of those who helped me were poor,"" said Lee in the statement. ""I know that the best way for me to pay back such kindness is to give back to society what I earned."" Analysts say this move will hopefully encourage many others to follow.","President Lee Myung-Bak to donate $26 million, the bulk of his wealth, to charity .

"Granby, Colorado (CNN) -- In my American Quest I am visiting states firmly for President Barack Obama (Illinois), those strongly for Mitt Romney (Utah) and some, like my next train stop, which can't make up their minds. Colorado, is one of these ""undecided"" states, which have become crucially important. A look back shows Republicans won eight out of the last 10 presidential elections here, and in an interesting twist, Colorado also picked the election winner in eight of those 10 elections too. The exceptions of course were the Democrat victories of Bill Clinton in 1992 and Obama in 2008. In other words, Colorado stays Republican until it sees a Democrat it likes, and then that man wins the election. With a large percentage of voters who classify themselves as independent, this year Colorado also has 6% of the electorate who say they are undecided -- the independents and the undecided will make the difference here. Amtrak train: No better way to connect with U.S. voters . Behind these numbers is a state with changing demographics, bringing in new voters. Denver bristles with IT, media and healthcare industries, which have shifted parts of the state to the political center. There is the rising number of Latino voters, who could be crucial if they cast their ballot. And, of course, there are the traditional rural, ranching and agricultural communities that remain the stalwarts of the Republican backbone. So today Colorado is absolutely split. Of those who have expressed a preference, roughly 47% are going for each candidate and the rest are undecided. But here is the crucial point. Undecided does not mean apathetic. According to Patrick Brower, the former publisher of Granby's local paper, Colorado's 6% undecided will vote; they just haven't decided for whom. When I tweeted this fact at the weekend (@richardquest) there was a barrage of tweets back. ""How could anyone be undecided this close to the election?"" was a common thread. After so much debate and discussion, surely everyone has made up their minds? Not here! Honest Abe's 19th century wisdom for 20th century problem . On the C Lazy U ranch in Granby, I met one political commentator from the right, one from the left and one in the middle. And I immediately understood the predicament. Colorado is a frontier state; hardy, rugged, mountainous, with winters that are not for the faint hearted. But it is also a fair state, with a liberal tradition on social issues (a proposal to legalize marijuana is on the ballot paper this year). In 2008 they liked the idea of change, and gave Obama a 9% victory. Now that undecided element is in play again and there is confusion about which way it will move. According to liberal columnist Felicia Muftic's research, ""undecideds"" eventually stay with the incumbent. Better the devil you know. Her conservative rival columnist William Hamilton told me exactly the opposite. He quoted research showing ""undecideds"" ultimately go with the challenger. An Amish life: America without sound bites . I was none the wiser, until my political pundits had a rare moment of agreement. The undecided voters would choose on issues of character, and on how the candidates behaved. With no single hot-button issue here, Colorado will go with the man they feel speaks to their frontier spirit and values. Which man is that? Ah, there you have me again, and that is because of the economy and the demographics. Colorado is changing and it is simply too close to call. What I can say is that we should keep a close watch on this state in the weeks ahead, especially as it bodes for the presidency. After all, on the last two occasions that elections saw the state go Democrat, the party failed to repeat the result four years later. In 1992 it didn't matter; Clinton won elsewhere. In 2012, Obama needs this state to ensure his second term . I must return to the train. The California Zephyr is almost boarding at Granby. It will take me 11 hours to reach Romney's safe, solid state: Utah, my next stop on this American Quest.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- The Syrian regime says it has taken over a rebel stronghold in Homs, inflicting a strategic and psychological blow to rebels in the country's two-year-long crisis. Government forces took control of the Khalidiya neighborhood of Homs, Syrian state-run TV reported Monday. The area had been under rebel control for about a year. Controlling the area of Khalidiya is crucial as it helps regime forces gain control of the city of Homs. In turn, controlling Homs helps gain a handle on the main routes and territory between the coastal town of Tartus, on the Mediterranean, and the capital, Damascus. A regime capture of Homs could be a key turning point in the bloody war, which has killed more than 100,000 people. The rebel Free Syrian Army has not commented on the regime's claim. But on Saturday, dissidents reported violent clashes between rebels and government forces in Khalidiya. Fighters from Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran, joined the regime's side, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Opposition activists said the regime had taken over about 50% of Khalidiya. Khalidiya has been a rebel haven as the rest of Homs city suffered intense fighting. Syria's third-largest city is now riddled with scars from shelling and airstrikes that pummeled it last year. President Bashar al-Assad's forces have made notable advances in recent months, including the capture of Qusayr, a town near the Lebanese border. Hezbollah fighters were instrumental in that siege. CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","The Khalidiya neighborhood of Homs has been a rebel stronghold for about a year .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's factions must find a way to bridge their differences and pave the way for a political solution that involves all sides if the country is to leave its current chaos behind, the European Union's top diplomat said Tuesday. ""Only an inclusive process will work,"" EU High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton told reporters Tuesday after visiting with the country's deposed president, current leaders, Muslim Brotherhood members and others during a brief trip. ""And though I recognize that is challenging, it is really important to begin now,"" she said. Egypt has suffered from sporadic violence since the July 3 military coup that removed President Mohamed Morsy from power on the heels of mass protests against his rule. He is being held at an undisclosed military facility on a variety of criminal charges. Most recently, violent clashes between security forces and protesters in Cairo on Saturday left dozens of Morsy supporters dead, and officials have threatened to disband a sit-in of the former president's supporters -- an act that could spur yet more bloodshed. Several Egyptian human rights groups demanded in a statement released Tuesday that Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim resign over the Saturday incident and demanded that government forces refrain from further violence. ""The Egyptian security forces' recurrent use of excessive, lethal violence in the face of political protest will only exacerbate the political ills that led Egyptian society to rebel against the policies of Mubarak, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" according to the statement, which was signed by 10 human rights, womens' and legal organizations. From CNN correspondent: Egypt's revolution of the mind . Speaking at a news conference with Ashton, Vice President Mohamed ElBaradei said he agrees with Ashton's call for a non-violent approach that includes the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups in a political solution. ""I want to emphasize again that our immediate priority, as we shared with Lady Ashton, is to stop violence in all its forms and shapes and try every possible way to find a peaceful solution,"" he told reporters. ""Violence is not a solution. It opens new wounds. It doesn't heal old wounds."" Muslim Brotherhood officials said on the group's website that they will continue protesting until Morsy is restored to office. Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down . Speaking to the possibility that security forces could clear a Cairo square where some Morsy supporters are staging a sit-in, ElBaradei said preparation must proceed for both a political resolution and one in which security forces are called in to end the situation. ""The political resolution has the priority, and I wish there will be political resolution before the security one,"" he said. Ashton, who has previously criticized Morsy's forced ouster, said in an earlier interview with CNN that Egyptian officials should release political prisoners and that all sides should rein in violence. But, in the news conference, ElBaradei noted Morsy is facing charges, echoing Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi's statement Monday that the former president should continue to be held. Ashton, who met with Morsy for two hours Monday, said Morsy is well. He is keeping up with current events through newspapers and television, she said. Ashton -- the first high-level official outside the Egyptian military to meet with the former president since the military whisked him away this month -- said she was kept in the dark about his location during their meeting. ""I don't know where he was,"" she told journalists in Cairo. Opinion: How to rescue the Arab Spring . She had insisted with the interim government that she be allowed to meet with Morsy as a precondition to her visit to Cairo. ""And that was freely offered to me,"" she said. Though she had a ""friendly and open and very frank discussion,"" she did not pass on details. She told Morsy that she would not represent his views to the world. ""He cannot correct me, if I do it wrong,"" she said. During her trip, she also met with acting President Adly Mansour and Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who led the military coup against Morsy. ""We are not here to impose. The people of Egypt will determine their own future,"" Ashton said. But she expected Egypt's leaders to ensure that happens. Morsy's party did not meet with Ashton, but it let her know it is sticking by its demands. ""We made it clear to her that we will keep protesting for our civil rights until the legitimate president is released,"" said Essam Elerian, the vice chairman of the Freedom and Justice Party. ""And as we said it before, restoring the democratic legitimacy of our elected president is non-negotiable.""","NEW: ""Only an inclusive process will work,"" EU's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, says .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- ""We are breaking the law,"" says Madiev Tynchtyk, a member of local government in a small village outside of the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, ""but here everyone understands this is a tradition and you can't change it."" Madiev kidnapped his wife, Elmira more than 10 years ago. He is one of the many Kyrgyz men who have gotten married through the Central Asian practice of bride kidnapping. In August, VICE traveled to the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan to investigate the origins and present-day incarnations of bride kidnapping. We met a family who was preparing their 18-year-old son, Kubanti, to kidnap his desired bride Nazgul, a teenage girl from the next town over. Kubanti gathered his friends into an eight-seat minivan and plotted out the operation: Lure the girl to the neighborhood watering hole (an actual watering hole), then ambush her and drag her kicking and screaming into the van and away from her family. Bride kidnappings happen in two basic ways: There are ""consensual kidnappings,"" where the two people know each other and it is a kind of role-playing, then there's full-on, off-the-street abductions. Unfortunately, they both look the same. It can be hard to tell if the girl you see crying for her mom and clawing at the faces of her abductors is merely acting out her part for her boyfriend and his family's sake, or is actually on her way to being married against her will. Although the tradition of bride kidnapping is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, authorities largely ignore the law. Nearly half of all marriages in rural Kyrgyzstan are a result of the practice, with the most common justification being ""tradition."" See the rest of Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan at VICE.COM . Russell Kleinbach, founder of the Kyz Korgon Institute, a non-governmental organization that works to abolish bride-kidnapping, argues that the practice has never been a part of Kyrgyz tradition. ""The main source for Kyrgyz customs is the national epic, Manas. But if you read the entire Manas, nowhere in it does the hero kidnap his wife or even reference the practice. Actually, according to our research, we think the practice of bride kidnapping started in the 19th century and didn't become popular until the 1940s and 50s, when Kyrgyzstan was part of the Soviet Union. What I tell people when I go out to the countryside to educate them about bride kidnapping is 'It's illegal, it's against Islam, and it's not in Manas.'"" Not only are its historical antecedents pretty dubious, bride kidnapping has become a serious danger to the country's women says Kleinbeck. ""Spousal abuse is higher in kidnapped marriages, the divorce rate is higher in kidnapped marriages, and suicide rates are higher."" None of this seems to phase the men who have participated in this practice. ""We are Kyrgyz,"" says Madiev, ""it is in our blood.""","VICE looks at the practice of bride kidnapping in Kygyzstan .

"(CNN) -- Jagged oranges, reds, purples and pinks make up the view from the rim of the Grand Canyon, changing color as the sun's angle constantly adjusts their tint and position. Meanwhile, the Colorado River swerves and curves through the canyon floor, slowly expanding the six million-year-old gash in the high desert of northwest Arizona. Grand Canyon National Park lies around and within one of the seven wonders of the natural world; it's close to two million acres of practically untouched hinterland offer a lifetime of adventure and exploring. Park stats: Grand Canyon was the second most visited national park in 2012, attracting almost 4.5 million visitors. It has been more than 20 years since fewer than 4 million people visited Grand Canyon National Park in a given year. The location: The Grand Canyon is in northwest Arizona near the Utah and Nevada borders. Flagstaff is about a 90-minute drive from the South Rim. The park is about a four-hour drive north of Phoenix and a four-hour drive east of Las Vegas. The Grand Canyon became a national park in 1919. It stretches along 277 miles of the Colorado River, which runs through the bottom of the canyon. The distance from the South Rim to the canyon floor is a full vertical mile. While the canyon's width varies, it measures 18 miles in several places. If you go:  Park entrance fees are $25 per vehicle and $12 for individuals (hikers, cyclists and motorcycles). Be sure to check the weather in advance as temperatures vary according to season and what part of the park you are visiting. The North Rim is generally the coolest place in the park, and the canyon floor is the warmest. There is no additional cost for day hikes on the rim and into the canyon, but overnight trips require buying a backcountry permit. The permit costs $10 plus an additional $5 for each person in the group. The park is divided into the North and South Rim. The South Rim is open year-round, while the North Rim is open during the spring and summer. Grand Canyon Village: There are several lodging options at the Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim, including hotels and campgrounds. There is also access to Desert View Drive and the east entrance to the park. Book early. The park's rooms fill up months in advance. Getting around: There are free shuttle buses in the South Rim that connect the visitor center, museums, lodging and dining to trail heads and scenic overlooks. North Rim: Due to high winds and heavy snows, the North Rim is only open from May 15 to October 15. The Grand Canyon Lodge is the only hotel on the North Rim. Campground space is available, but like the South Rim, reservations are required and advance reservations are recommended. North Rim visitors can also stay outside the park at the Kaibab Lodge and Jacob Lake Inn, which are 18 and 45 miles north of the park. The North Rim has a visitor center but does not have shuttle buses. Hiking on the rim and into the canyon: Temperatures on the rim change with the season, and increase dramatically during summer hikes into the canyon. Visitors should be prepared for extreme cold and intense heat. Hiking at the Grand Canyon is physically demanding, even for experienced hikers. Be sure to drink plenty of water, carry plenty of food and never hike alone. The trail from the South Rim to the canyon floor is seven miles. Mules are a common sight on hiking trails into the canyon. When you see them approaching, move off the trail to the side away from the edge, stand still, keep quiet and do not return to the trail until the mule is at least 50 feet away from you. Always follow directions given by the mule wrangler. Lodging is available in the bottom of the canyon at the Phantom Ranch. Reservations are required and you do not need a backcountry permit to stay there. Rafting on the Colorado River: There are several options for taking Colorado River rafting trips at the Grand Canyon. Check out the park's permit information online for specifics. Trips can last between a half day and 25 days. Meet our ranger: Andy Pearce, 52, is the environmental education specialist at Grand Canyon National Park and loves spending the majority of his time teaching kids about the park. ""I feel like with school groups we are connecting a whole population of young people to the national parks that otherwise wouldn't come here,"" he says . Pearce was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and his parents, especially his mother, Eleanor, raised him with a love for national parks and hiking. He graduated from Colorado State University with a degree in geology and was working a summer construction job when he received an opportunity to volunteer at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. The experience helped him get his foot in the door as a seasonal ranger and eventually get his first full-time position at Wupatki National Monument near Flagstaff, Arizona. He worked at nine other national parks before coming to Grand Canyon in 2002. ""It's a fantastic resource,"" he says. ""It changes year-round with four seasons. It's not Arizona as you'd think of Arizona when you're on the rim of the canyon."" For a day trip, don't miss:  Stop at the Grand Canyon Visitor Center on the South Rim and then visit Mather Point, Mohave Point and Desert View Watchtower. Part of the magic of going to the Grand Canyon is that you often can't see the canyon until you reach the edge. Mather Point has ""a wow factor that makes the first view quite spectacular."" If you are traveling by car, Pearce says these areas are close enough to each other that you can see them all in one day. Favorite less-traveled spot: The North Rim, which has a higher elevation and is more heavily forested than other areas in the park. It is only 10 miles as the crow flies from the South Rim. Pearce says it takes up to five hours to drive there because the road runs along the rim's twists and turns. ""If you want to experience a national park kind of like they were decades ago -- the feeling of slower pace, quieter, fewer people -- the North Rim is the place to go."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: The grassy areas near the train depot in the village and Hopi Point. Pearce says elk and deer gravitate toward the train depot's grassy areas and endangered scavenger birds, including the California condor, nest and socialize near Hopi Point. Never feed the animals in the park, especially squirrels, which bite between five and 10 guests every day during the summer, he says. ""We want to keep the 'wild' in wildlife,"" he says. Most magical moment in the park: Cross-country skiing under a full moon to the South Rim of the canyon in 2004. The experience was so peaceful, Pearce says, he has made it an annual tradition. ""It'll be quiet, really chilly,"" he says. ""The air will be still. The moon sparkles on the snow and the canyon has a moonlit glow coming from it. It makes some of the cliff walls appear to glow."" Oddest moment at the park: Seeing a man walk backward down into the canyon on the South Kaibab Trail in 2009. ""I found out later he was trying to break some record for walking backwards,"" he says. ""Of course I had to step to the side and watch him go by."" A ranger's request: Come to the Grand Canyon informed and prepared. Pearce stresses that the park is a unique geographic setting, significantly cooler than the rest of Arizona. When it comes to hiking down into the canyon, Pearce says to keep in mind that the temperature increases as you descend and that walking back up takes more time than going down. ""The elevation is the factor,"" he says. ""People get in trouble because they do not realize it will be much more of a workout coming up."" Another park he'd like to visit: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in Colorado. The dunes are the tallest in North America and seasonal Medano Creek offers guests the chance to relax and rinse off after playing in the sand. ""You've got 40 square miles of sand that provide endless entertainment for kids,"" he says.","The Grand Canyon was the second most visited national park in 2012 .
It is one vertical mile from the South Rim to the canyon floor .
The North Rim is more remote and is open from mid-May to mid-October .
Overnight reservations at the Grand Canyon must be booked far in advance ."
"Zanzibar, Tanzania (CNN) -- A Catholic priest was attacked with acid on the east African island of Zanzibar in the third such unprovoked assault in two months, and remained hospitalized Saturday, the cleric told CNN. The Rev. Joseph Anselmo Mwagambwa said he was attacked Friday afternoon while coming out of an internet cafe in Mlandenge, a community in the city of Zanzibar. He was being treated in a hospital in the Tanzanian mainland city of Dar es Salaam. Police are still investigating, and no arrests have been made. Last month, two British women, both 18, were walking unaccompanied on a street when acid was thrown on their faces, chests and hands by two men on a motorcycle in Zanzibar, officials said. Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup were attacked in Stone Town, the island's historic center, and had been working as volunteer teachers on the island, according to the firm i-to-i Travel. Stone Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site popular with tourists. The attack against the two women came as Islamist extremism is rising in the area. The government said it would consider regulating the purchase of acid and other related products, and warned that such attacks could seriously damage the island's tourism industry. In another incident in July, a businessman of Arab origin who had built a mall close to the American Embassy in Dar es Salaam was also injured in an acid attack, Tanzanian media reported. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania. According to the CIA World Factbook, the population of Zanzibar is 99% Muslim, while the residents of mainland Tanzania are split roughly evenly among Christian, Muslim and indigenous beliefs.

"(CNN) -- Imagine kicking back on a private island in the Bahamas where the staff caters to your every whim. Yes, it's a pipe dream for 99% of us, but let's imagine. Put that bank balance out of your mind. Now conjure up a snorkel and flippers. To find some of the most out-of-this-world destinations for jet-setters in 2013, CNN.com asked Robb Report editorial director Bruce Wallin for ideas. So keep this list handy in case of a fat financial windfall: . Singita Grumeti Reserves, Tanzania . Located on a private 350,000-acre game reserve, the Singita Grumeti Reserves has only four small lodges on the property. The four-bedroom Serengeti House, which is listed on its blog, quietly opened to guests in December and includes its own chef, guides, tennis court and pool. ""The lodges themselves are as nice as Four Seasons New York, if not nicer,"" says Wallin. ""The wildlife is great, and the service and food is incredible. It's one of the nicest places in the world to stay."" Serengeti House rates start at $8,500 a night for up to four guests during high season (parts of December and January and all of June, July and August), with additional charges for five to eight guests. Pay $84,500 to rent the house for a week for up to eight guests. Song Saa Private Island, Cambodia . The dream of an Australian couple living in Cambodia, the exclusive Song Saa Private Island resort opened in March. With just 27 villas on two small islands in the Koh Rong archipelago, the resort offers diving, snorkeling, nature trails, kayaking, fishing and boat trips to surrounding islands. Song Saa also has a relationship with the Amansara resort in Siem Reap, allowing travelers to stay there while visiting Angkor Wat's ancient temples. High-season villa prices starts at $1,595 a night for the one-bedroom Jungle Villa. Rates include food, beverages including beer and house wines and spirits, guided tours and the use of kayaks, boats and snorkeling gear. Four Seasons Around the World . Imagine jetting around the world via private 757 airplane, visiting some of the world's most extraordinary sites with travel experts and staying at Four Seasons hotels at your destinations. Customs is a breeze for such world travelers. Four Seasons featured two around-the-world trips in 2012, each 22 days long, and is already taking reservations for next September's trip. The 2013 journey includes stops in Japan, China, the Maldives, Turkey and Russia. Only 76 spots are available. Double occupancy costs $70,950 a person, and the single supplement is an extra $8,650. Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay, Bahamas . Want a vacation for up to 24 family members or best friends that goes beyond luxury? Consider Musha Cay and the Islands of Copperfield Bay, owned and developed into a beach resort in the Exumas by world-famous magician David Copperfield. You and your guests can take part in a treasure hunt, spy challenge or other theatrical adventures designed by the team behind Copperfield's magic shows. Of course, the resort also has beaches, a swimming pool, tennis court, outdoor movie theater and nature trails. Rent out the whole resort, which consists of five houses on the main island. Rates start at $37,500 a night for up to 12 guests with a four-night minimum, including all meals and beverages. The resort can host up to 24 guests for an additional fee. King Pacific Lodge, Northern British Columbia, Canada . Accessible via privately chartered plane from Vancouver to Bella Bella with a transfer to float planes for the final leg, King Pacific Lodge is in the middle of British Columbia's Great Bear Rainforest. The lodge actually floats: Built from cedar, fir, pine and stone on a barge, King Pacific is only open June through September. It has 17 guest rooms and suites, a spa, deck and pool. Prices start at $4,900 (Canadian) based on double occupancy for three nights and include all meals, beverages and use of the lodge facilities. The Great Bear Rainforest, home to the Gitga'at people (part of the Tsimshian Nation), is host to many nature activities, including kayaking, fishing, whale watching and wildlife watching. Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, Puerto Rico . The Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, isn't a newcomer to Puerto Rico. The resort, which opened is doors on December 12, is on the site of Laurance Rockefeller's former estate near San Juan. The property continued his environmental legacy by setting aside some 75% of its 1,400 acres as green space. All 100 guestrooms and 14 one-bedroom suites are on the beach. ""Su Casa,"" a restored four-bedroom beachfront villa, was the original hacienda. Restaurant and beachfront dining feature the talents of acclaimed chef Jose Andres. The spa offers a tree-house option for massages. Rates start at $1,499 a night based on double occupancy. Ballyfin, Ireland . Sitting at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the Irish countryside, Ballyfin was named in the Robb Report's ""Best of the Best 2012."" Originally the home of Sir Charles Coote, the Regency mansion reopened as Ballyfin in May 2011 with 15 guest rooms. Built in 1822 for Coote's family, the 614-acre estate was later sold and served as a Catholic school. Purchased by a Chicago businessman in 2002, it underwent a nine-year renovation that upgraded the technology while keeping the Old World elegance and charm. The resort is closed in January and February (reservations can still be made during that time), and it reopens for the season on March 8. Daily weekend rates for March and April, including meals and amenities, start at 915 euros ($1,206 U.S.) a night for a deluxe room, based on double occupancy. Aspen, Colorado . The recent reopening of the Hotel Jerome, one of the oldest U.S. luxury hotels west of the Mississippi, is just one of the reasons why Aspen is a top U.S. spot for high-end travel, says Wallin. Even without the renovation, Aspen was already a magnet for the rich and famous. St. Regis Aspen reopened in December 2011 after a $40 million redesign. And the five-star lodge Little Nell just opened Element 47, which Wallin says may be the best restaurant in town. ""Aspen has long been the country's most glamorous ski destination, so it's hard to say it's undergoing a revival -- it never really waned in popularity in the first place,"" says Wallin, ""But with all the new restaurants, renewed hotels and other developments in the area, Aspen is probably the best it's ever been as a luxury destination. "" At the St. Regis Aspen, the winter season starting rate for a standard guest room, based on double occupancy, is $899 a night. Hotel Jerome's winter season rates start at $695 a night based on double occupancy.","Serengeti House is so exclusive the parent company doesn't list it on its website (yet)

"(CNN) -- Underwhelmed. That, in a word, was the response in many quarters to Apple's rollout of two new iPhones on Tuesday. With the iPhone 5S, the industry's leading smartphone got a quicker processor, better camera and new fingerprint security scanner. With the iPhone 5C, it got less expensive and more colorful. And yet, from the Internet to Wall Street, Apple got savaged mercilessly. ""Much-hyped iPhone announcements from the tech giant did little to stop (Apple's) year-long descent into stagnation,"" wrote Marcus Wohlsen in Wired, a CNN.com content partner. ""Though the faster, sleeker, more powerful phone is unarguably cool, the steps forward are still incremental. And incremental isn't what the world expects from Apple."" Even The Onion, whose spot-on satire can sometimes be a brutal contact sport, mocked Apple CEO Tim Cook's presentation with a story headlined, ""Apple Unveils Panicked Man With No Ideas."" ""The white, ultrathin man, who exhibited such features as artificial excitement, a fully quavering voice, and what appeared to be a near total lack of inspiration, was put on full display for thousands of shareholders, industry insiders, reporters, and fans today in what Apple hopes will be a game-changer for the multinational corporation,"" read the article. Add to that a chorus of tongue-clucking from an oft-skeptical tech blogosphere, the short-form snark of Twitter, sideswipes from competitors and jitters on Wall Street, and you're a long way away from the fantastical ""reality distortion field"" that Steve Jobs famously conjured whenever he pitched a new idea or product to an adoring world. But is all this criticism fair? Harder to make a splash . To some, Apple is a victim of its own success. After revolutionizing mobile technology with the iPod, iPhone and iPad, unveiling a device that feels more like an upgrade than a game-changer may feel to loyal fans like a breach of trust. ""When a company has positioned itself on the foundation of innovation, the idea of not innovating in a new product introduction can be a commercial nightmare,"" said Ronald Goodstein, an associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University. ""Apple has consistently bet the house on innovation, and has a great winning record in the past 15 years. For them to introduce a 'me too' product is against what they stand for ... . ""This is not to say that the new phone is not good. Its quality is fine,"" Goodstein told CNN. ""But to develop a new product that is in violation of their stated brand association is inconsistent."" Technically, there were smartphones before the iPhone and tablets before the iPad. But by fine-tuning design concepts and making them accessible to the mass market, Apple established itself as a hothouse for cutting-edge consumer technology. But Tuesday's iPhones were the seventh and eighth versions of the aging iconic device. After six years on the market, some say there's simply no way the iPhone can cause a seismic shift in smartphone technology every 12 months. ""It's really easy for people to be disappointed and be critical and you're looking at Twitter and all these tech people, they're ripping Apple ... ,"" tech writer Rocco Pendola, of TheStreet.com, said to CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Yes, they are less exciting. Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs. We're not in a situation where they roll out the next big thing and surprise us at the end of the presentation. We have to come to grips with that. We have to live with that."" Adds CNET's Charles Cooper: ""The magic's gone out of the smartphone business, leaving companies and their advocates to argue about slightly faster processors, more megapixels, or slightly improved battery life. That's progress, but it's the equivalent of three yards and a cloud of dust. ""Smartphones ... belong a maturing industry, which means that it's going to get harder and harder for any company -- Apple, Samsung, or any other would-be challenger -- to make a splash."" Innovation in new forms? In other words, competition changes expectations. During its first few years of existence, the smartphone market was basically the iPhone and a handful of competitors trying desperately to catch up with the iPhone. Now, while it remains the top-selling handset, the iPhone only accounts for about 17% of the world's smartphones. Phones running Google's Android operating system come in an array of sizes and styles and with a plethora of features. ""There is always room for 'Wow!' But, the fact is that when someone does wow the market, over time that feature or benefit becomes a 'must have' for the industry,"" said Georgetown's Goodstein. ""It takes very little time until all brands offer that feature or benefit, and it goes from ""wow"" to being the ante to play in the game."" Carolina Milanesi, a tech analyst with Gartner Research, says that the true quantum leaps for tech companies probably won't be in smartphones anymore. Instead, she says, most innovation will come in wearable tech, integrated television and other areas where Apple and its rivals are said to be at work on developing new products. Milanesi rejects the notion that there was no innovation unveiled Tuesday in Cupertino. ""I am not sure how they can talk about a 64-bit architecture and fingerprinting ... as a lack of innovation,"" she said. ""It might not be the innovation people are looking for, such as a larger screen, but it's hard to say 'lack of.'"" The iPhone 5S will contain the first 64-bit processor in a smartphone, which promises to increase the performance and speed of data-intensive games and other apps. Touch ID is a new security feature that will allow users to use their fingerprints to unlock the device. And the phone's camera will now let you shoot slow-motion video. There may have been no Siri or sleek new design. But at the end of the day, Milanesi said, the iPhone got better. And a better new iPhone is still a formidable product. ""In most cases Apple does not walk on others' paths,"" she said. ""They create their own and stick to it. This is not necessarily the easy way to do it in the short term, but assures that they remain in control.""","New iPhones fail to impress Wall Street, some bloggers and analysts .
iPhone 5S and 5C saw upgrades, but not overhauls .
But some say it's not fair to expect major innovation from Apple every year .

"(Health.com) -- Streamline your workouts, your morning makeup, even your resolution list. Here are eight New Year tips on how to look better and improve your health for 2012. 1. Focus your New Year's resolutions . Got a long list of ways you want to overhaul your life? Simplify it and you'll tick off more by year's end, says Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., a health psychologist at Stanford University and author of ""The Willpower Instinct."" Setbacks are inevitable while making a change, she says, ""but what's important is to not let one failure turn into an off week or month."" Here's how to prioritize so you get real results. Pick the one thing that matters most. You're most likely to succeed if you stick with a resolution (or two) that is compelling and inspiring to you. How to tell what's a keeper? Pretend it's 2013: Are you grateful you made this change? If your answer is ""eh,"" drop it. Think big picture. That old advice about making resolutions specific and measurable? Not quite spot on. You could, after all, check off your goal of exercising 30 minutes each day, then help yourself to a second piece of cake -- not consistent with your true overall desire to be fit. ""Rather than an outcome like losing 20 pounds or saving $10,000, identify a value, like health or financial security, that becomes your focus for the new year,"" McGonigal says. Give yourself a break. Think about what you're pretty sure you can do -- then cut it in half. So if you want to save 10% of each paycheck this year, aim for 5%. And if you don't always hit the mark, don't get discouraged: Even if you saved only 2% this month, that's still in line with your overarching goal (financial health), so onward and upward! Health.com: Top 10 healthiest New Year's resolutions . 2. Simplify your schedule . If you cringe at each ding of your BlackBerry calendar, you might be over-scheduling yourself, says Sherrie Bourg Carter, Psy.D., author of ""High Octane Women."" Four ways to get control: . --Book like a therapist. Make appointments 50 minutes long, leaving 10 minutes of flex time to return calls or make up for running long. ""Without that cushion, inevitably something will put you off schedule,"" says Carter. --Get real. If it's time to trim obligations, but everything feels essential, ask yourself: What was my original goal? If you signed up for marathon training to be more active, but now you're so achy you spend every night on the sofaâ€”there's your answer. --Be single-minded. ""When you get pulled away from a task by email, it takes 16 minutes to return to your previous level of productivity,"" says Carter. Plow through work faster by turning off all bells and whistles until a project is finished. --Pencil yourself in. Slot in time for yourself, even if it's just a 10-minute walk in the sun. ""Then,"" says Carter, ""don't cancel it!"" Health.com: Job killing you? 8 types of work-related stress . 3. Make under your morning beauty routine . You can sleep in tomorrow: Carmindy, makeup artist on TLC's ""What Not to Wear"" and author of ""Crazy Busy Beautiful,"" officially releases you from the mandate to re-create your features every a.m.: ""You want to enhance your natural beauty, not contour new cheeks."" Try this to get gorgeous with a lot less effort: . Go big. Apply blush with one swipe of a large powder brush. ""A traditional brush puts too much on a smaller area, so you spend time blending,"" Carmindy says. Highlight key spots. Sweep pale-vanilla shimmering shadow under brow, on inside eye corner, and on cheekbone top. ""The contrast makes you look as good as if you were wearing more makeup,"" she says. Skip the blowout. Every other day, swap your shampoo and blow dryer for a de-greasing powder. ""Brush this through and hair's perfect again,"" says Carmindy. Health.com: 15 ways to be a natural beauty . 4. Streamline your go-to meals . Six p.m. might just be the shortest hour of the day. Save the dicing, measuring, and fussing and still get healthy, mouthwatering food on the table with these tips from Ellie Krieger, R.D., host of the Cooking Channel's ""Healthy Appetite"" and author of ""Comfort Food Fix."" Use no-chop ingredients. All you need for a great homemade meal in 15 minutes is a quick-cooking, minimal-prep protein (chicken or fish), whole grains (whole-wheat pasta, brown rice), and veggies that are already bite-size (snow peas, baby arugula). ""I love garlic basil shrimp with cherry tomatoes and orzo -- you don't even need a knife,"" Krieger says. Swap shortcuts. You might automatically grab a tub of shredded Parmesan, then head to the fresh produce section for veggies. But rethinking which ingredients you buy premade can cut time and boost flavor. ""Frozen peas and spinach are easier and just as good as fresh in many dishes,"" Krieger says. ""But there's no substitute for freshly grated cheese. Plus it has more flavor than store-bought, so you use less."" Just put a hunk on the dinner table along with the grater. Alter the atmosphere. A lot of cooking stress comes from the attitude you walk into the kitchen with, Krieger says: ""I used to approach making dinner as drudgery, but then I started putting music on, pouring a glass of wine, having my daughter there ripping up lettuce for the salad. It can become the nicest part of your day."" Health.com: 20 easy and healthy meals for families . 5. Edit your news feed . To counter iOverload, unsubscribe to useless e-lists and news feeds. Then use a bare-bones or customizable home page like iGoogle (instead of a headline-heavy one) or a customized reading app like Flipboard, suggests Gary Small, MD, professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of ""iBrain."" 6. Lighten your handbag . It's a great way to instantly feel more organized. To do it: Follow these steps from Regina Leeds, author of ""One Year to an Organized Life."" Take everything out. Separate it piece by piece into groups of like items, creating categories as you go (cosmetics, pharmacy, work essentials). Get brutal. Toss the trash and trade full-size anything for travel-size. Admit what you can do without (superglue? spare thumb drive?). Repack. Tuck each group of must-haves into different-colored mesh bagsâ€”easier than remembering which of your purse's seven pockets your lipstick is in. Do a daily sweep. Take 60 seconds when you get home to file receipts, clear out junk, and replenish supplies. You should be feeling lighter already! Health.com: 7 steps to organizing clutter . 7. Weed out your closet . Weird-but-true wardrobe math: Subtracting pieces can make you feel like you have more to wear, says Dana Ravich, fashion stylist and co-author of ""I Have Nothing to Wear!."" Clear out the freeloaders this way: . Give it three rounds. First, toss anything that's not in good condition (you can't even donate it). Second, donate what no longer matches your life or style -- uncomfortable shoes, plunging necklines that make you fear a wardrobe malfunction. In round three, try on what's left. ""Anything that stays must be a 10,"" says Ravich. That means it satisfies two additional criteria: It flatters your figure and expresses your personal style. Variety isn't as important as quality. So what if you wear one of the same five fabulous bottoms every day? Your bottom will look fabulous every day. Slim down your rack. Trade bulky wood and plastic hangers for ""huggable"" ones. ""These are very thin felt hangers that quadruple your space and grip all your spaghetti straps and anything else that normally slides off,"" says Ravich. Don't hang knits, by the way -- stack them on shelves. Display jewelry. You can use a plastic hanging organizer with dozens of clear, zippered compartments so that jewelry stays detangled and visible all at once. Done. Health.com: Stacy London's closet rehab . 8. But keep one pair of almost-fit jeans . Yes, you want to streamline. But hanging on to jeans you hope to fit in can help you stick with a fitness goal, says Jennifer Baumgartner, Psy.D., author of ""You Are What You Wear."" Hang them right on your closet door, she advises, so you can visualize the payoff.

"Washington (CNN) -- When a fire alarm blared Monday morning at the Washington Navy Yard, Terrie Durham thought it might be another drill. Then office fire wardens came in shouting for everyone to get out as fast as possible, and ""that's when we started moving,"" she told CNN affiliate WJLA. Durham and colleagues including Todd Brundidge rushed out the door toward the exit. Down the hall, they saw a man with a rifle. ""He stepped around the corner and we heard shots,"" Brundidge said. What seemed like two or three seconds passed, and then ""he aimed his gun at us and then he fired at least two or three shots."" Latest developments . The pair provided an eyewitness account of a suspect they described as a tall black man accused by authorities of opening fire at the heavily secured Navy yard along the Anacostia River, not far from the U.S. Capitol and just blocks from where baseball's Washington Nationals play. Durham said the gunman was too far away to see his face, but ""we could see him with the rifle and he raised and aimed at us and fired."" The shots hit high on the wall, and the group ran out of the building. Navy Cmdr. Tim Jirus didn't see a gunman, but he witnessed the carnage. He told CNN he was in an alley outside Building 197 to help people get down the fire escapes. A worker from the building approached him to say he heard someone was shooting inside. Then he heard more gunfire -- two shots that apparently came from the building. The man who stood three feet from him fell to the ground, bleeding from a head wound, ""and that's when I ran,"" Jirus said. ""I never met him before in my life,"" said Jirus, who described himself as ""lucky to be here."" He had not heard clear gunshots earlier, but this time, he was certain. ""In the alleyway with the amount of sound reverberating, you know exactly what it is, not to mention he's on the ground, bleeding,"" Jirus said. The shootings that began around 8:20 a.m. set off chaotic scenes inside the Navy Yard and in the redeveloped neighborhood around it, with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies converging in what seemed like a tidal wave of sirens and helicopters. Police Chief Cathy Lanier praised the speed and cooperation by various law enforcement agencies that responded. After the first call, D.C. police were on the scene ""within literally two to three minutes,"" she told reporters. ""Now, internal security had already engaged, identified and engaged the suspect,"" Lanier continued. ""We already had victims down at that point. Within seven minutes, we had active shooter teams inside the building, moving through the building."" The first responders found ""one of the worst things we've seen"" in Washington,"" according to Lanier. ""As officers entered the building, they were, you know, making transmissions in and keeping command informed as to what they were coming across as they went through,"" she said. ""Multiple victims. There was gunfire still going on."" In the bureaucratic tone of police talk, she described a sporadic gun battle -- ""mulitple engagements"" -- that witnesses said lasted 40 minutes or so. ""Both metropolitan police and park police, on preliminary information, got into a final gun battle with the suspect,"" Lanier said, adding there were ""multiple incidents in that time frame in which there was a gunfight with a suspect,"" who now was ""deceased."" Meanwhile, workers poured out of the huge Navy complex into the surrounding streets. ""Everybody was going down the stairs,"" Brundidge said in describing the pandemonium. ""People were pushing. People were shoving. People were falling down. After we came outside, people were climbing the wall, trying to get out over the wall. ... It was just crazy."" D.C. Navy Yard victims in surgery . Paul Williams, a program coordinator at a nonprofit that works with foster children, was heading to his office nearby when he encountered what he described as a panic. ""I had my headphones in, so I didn't know what was going on,"" Williams, 29, told CNN. ""I was listening to music, but I heard four rapid bangsâ€”bang, bang, bang, bang."" At first he thought it was construction noise that has become common in the area, but about 30 seconds later, he saw a rush of people coming toward him from the Navy Yard. ""I didn't know what was happening. I just ran with them,"" Williams said, adding that ""everyone seemed scared. People were crying, people were being consoled and calling loved ones and family."" The impact of the shootings spread through Washington. The Department of Transportation was locked down, as were some U.S. Senate offices, and the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily halted air traffic Monday morning at Reagan National Airport. Two events Monday night -- a Nationals baseball game against the Atlanta Braves and a Musica Latina event at the White House -- were postponed. To Brundidge, the encounter with a gunman was hard to believe. ""You know,"" he said, ""you just go to work and you never think something like this is going to happen in your building."" CNN's Rene Marsh, Ashley Killough, Gabe Lamonica and Virginia Nicolaidis contributed to this report.","NEW: The D.C. police chief describes multiple teams going after the shooter .

"(CNN) -- Police in British Columbia have filed charges against a motorcyclist who allegedly videotaped himself reaching speeds of at least 186 mph on a busy Canadian highway. Through tips from the public, the Saanich Police Department, on Vancouver Island, identified the rider as 25-year-old Randy George Scott of Victoria. Scott is still on the lam, police said, and they still are trying to track him down. The online video of the harrowing ride has been viewed nearly a million times. ""We have a dedicated group of traffic safety officers and that is a very dramatic example of some obviously dangerous driving,"" Sgt. Dean Jantzen told CNN. The video shows a motorcyclist reaching an apparent top speed of 299 kilometers per hour (186 mph) weaving between cars, but authorities think his actual speed may have been even faster. You can hear him accelerating even when it says 299 kilometers per hour,"" Jantzen said. The posted speed limit is 50 mph. The incident took place on April 6 on a busy stretch of the Trans-Canada highway. Jantzen said motorcyclists traveling at dangerously excessive speeds are not typical in that part of Saanich, which is more urban. Saanich police say if convicted on the current charges, he could be sentenced up to five years in jail. Scott, who police say has had prior run-ins with the law, has been added to Saanich Police Department's ""Most Wanted"" fugitive list, and police are advising him to turn himself in.

"(CNN) -- A Paris court has ordered eBay to pay $63 million damages to luxury goods company LVMH for allowing copies of its goods to be sold on the Web auction site. Louis Vuitton took eBay to court for selling a range of fake luxury goods online. The fashion company -- home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Fendi, Emilio Pucci and Marc Jacobs -- complained it had been hurt by the sale of fake products on eBay. Pierre Godet, an adviser to LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, said the  court's decision was ""an answer to a particularly serious question, on whether the Internet is a free-for-all for the most hateful, parasitic practices."" eBay said LVMH was trying to crack down on Internet auctions because it was uncomfortable with its business model, which puts sellers rather than brands in control. ""If counterfeits appear on our site, we take them down swiftly,"" eBay spokeswoman Sravanthi Agrawal said. ""But today's ruling is not about counterfeits. Today's ruling is about an attempt by LVMH to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers that eBay empowers every day."" She said eBay intended to appeal the ruling. The case pit two pillars of their industries -- one old, one new -- in a country whose courts often challenge Internet companies on matters protected elsewhere by freedom of speech. The ruling faulted eBay for ""guilty negligence"" for not doing enough to prevent fake goods from being sold on its site. The court also ruled that eBay was responsible for the ""illicit sale"" of perfumes from the LVMH empire, which can be sold only through the brands' ""selective distribution networks."" The court barred eBay from running ads for the perfume and cosmetic brands or  face a fine of $79,000 per day. Heather McDonald, partner at law firm Baker Hostetler, said: ""eBay has policies and procedures in place where they will intervene in an action between a buyer and seller if there's a problem, and they profit directly on the basis of every item that is sold on their Web site. ""This gives them an affirmative obligation to take steps to make sure that illegal goods aren't sold, and they certainly have the ability to do that. ""They have been able to make sure that you can't buy a handgun and they have been able to make sure that you cannot buy pornography or prescription narcotics or other medicines on eBay. ""They have the ability to do this, they have just chosen not do and to rest the entire burden of policing eBay on the shoulders of the trademark and copyright holders whose rights are being infringed here.""","Paris court orders eBay to pay $63 million in damages to luxury group LVMH .

"(CNN) -- Whether a monochromatic yellow or featuring every color in the Crayola box, these cites are guaranteed to brighten your day. The word ""pretty"" isn't often associated with the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro. But gazing across the hills toward the notorious Santa Maria favela, you might be pleasantly surprised by the burst of colors, the result of a recent social art project launched by Dutch design duo Haas&Hahn. Pockets of rainbow-bright residences and streets pop up in cities across the globe; some are contrived, like Haas&Hahn's favela project and the commissioning of a blue-painted town in southern Spain by Sony Pictures to promote the Smurfs 3D movie (no, really). Others, like the eclectic homes and murals of ValparaÃ­so, Chile, are more organic, inspired by the creative spirits of the residents that inhabit them. From a monochromatic Indian city painted pink for a visiting English prince to the candy-colored waterfront of Miami's South Beach, these landscapes bring a new level of vibrancy to austere deserts, mountains, slums and already sparkling aqua waters. Travel + Leisure: World's most beautiful canal cities . Jaipur, India . Now this is a royal welcome: Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh had the whole city daubed in pink for the arrival of Edward, the Prince of Wales, during a diplomatic visit in 1853. The Rajasthani capital retains its signature rose-tinted hue across broad boulevards and historic buildings like the Hawa Mahal (Palace of the Winds). Chefchaouen, Morocco . A four-hour drive from the bustling city of Fez brings you to this village high in the Rif Mountains, known for its labyrinthine medina bathed entirely in shades of blue. The area was once a refuge for Spanish Jews who, fleeing the Inquisition in the 1500s, found a harmonious haven in Chefchaouen. Though most have now migrated to Israel, the warren of turquoise alleys remains as their legacy. Travel + Leisure: World's strangest towns . Izamal, Mexico . Mexico's tourism secretary designated Izamal, in the Yucatan region, a pueblo magico (magical city), and it's easy to see why. The colonial buildings are awash in a vivid yellow that gives the monochromatic town a sunny look whatever the weather. Take a horse-and-buggy ride around the cobblestone streets past marigold churches, government buildings and the city's centerpiece: the historic 16th-century Basilica of San Antonio de Padua. Bo-Kaap, Cape Town . No, that's not a rainbow at the foot of Signal Hill. The pops of color making their way up the slopes are typical of Cape Town's historic Muslim quarter, where the mosques and homes make up a splashy kaleidoscope of aquamarine, fuchsia and lime. Its Cape Malay community is descended from slaves brought over by the Dutch from Southeast Asia in the 1600s, and residents began painting their homes to celebrate the end of apartheid. Travel + Leisure: World's strangest bridges . Balat, Istanbul . Once Istanbul's old Jewish quarter, Balat has attracted a more diverse range of residents over time. Yet the architecture takes you back to a lost era; it's easy to spend a few hours wandering, preferably with camera in hand, to capture the dilapidated yellow and pink buildings adorned by billowing red or green curtains, all sparkling against the cerulean sky. Juzcar, Spain . Among the iconic White Towns of Andalusia, Juzcar looks so comically out of place that you'd be forgiven for wondering if it's out of a cartoon -- in fact, you'd be correct. Until recently, it, too, was a whitewashed village; in 2011, Hollywood executives inquired whether the residents would paint their homes blue for a promotional blitz surrounding a Smurfs movie. Afterward, Sony offered to paint the town back, but aware of the skyrocketing tourist numbers that resulted from the gimmick, the 220 citizens voted to keep it blue. South Beach, Miami . Neon lights, frothy facades, quirky patterned lifeguard stands, art deco buildings -- driving along Ocean Drive in Miami is a retro trip back to an era when Technicolor was just bursting onto screens. Flamingo pinks and tropical greens flank the white sand on one side, with azure waters on the other. Rio de Janeiro . In 2010, Dutch artists Haas&Hahn schemed to turn a favela in Rio de Janeiro into a giant canvas for their third project in that city's slums (favelapainting.com). Enlisting the help of local youths, they converted the homes of Favela Santa Maria into a rainbow of staggering proportions, composed of rays in myriad shades radiating across the facades. Willemstad, Curacao . Legend has it that in the 1800s, when the Dutch ruled Curacao, the then-governor attributed the migraines that afflicted him to the powerful Caribbean sun reflecting off the colony's stark walls. The result? An official decree that commanded residents to paint the structures anything but white. Today, this World Heritage site owes its distinctive pastel shades to one man's maladies. Vernazza, Italy . These postcard-perfect pastel pink, lemon yellow and sea green facades were hit by devastating floods in 2011. While the damage to Vernazza and the four other scenic waterfront villages that make up Cinque Terre was severe, efforts are under way to restore, rebuild -- and repaint.

"(CNN) -- At least 40 people were killed in an explosion at an ammunition depot in the embattled city of Homs, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday. The opposition organization cited medical sources, who told the group that the death toll may increase because of the serious injuries to survivors. There are also unaccounted for victims, the group said. The explosion occurred in the Wadi Aldahab neighborhood after several shells fell on the pro-regime quarters of the city, including Wadi Aldahab, the group said. Meanwhile, United Nations inspectors in the Netherlands are preparing to travel to Syria to investigate three reports of chemical weapons use, a spokesman said Thursday. ""The team is now assembling (at) The Hague and will be ready to depart once the remaining logistical and legal details of mission have been finalized,"" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said. The team will consist of a head of the mission and about 10 experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the World Health Organization, Nesirky said. The upcoming visit followed talks last week between Syria's government and a U.N. representative for disarmament affairs, the U.N. said. Syria has been embroiled in a bloody civil war for more than two years, during which more than 100,000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced or become refugees in other countries, according to the United Nations. Amid the fighting, there have been numerous allegations that chemical weapons have been used. Syria: Fast Facts . In June, the White House said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces had crossed a ""red line"" by using chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin gas, against rebel forces. This prompted the U.S. government to begin providing military support to opposition fighters, despite its earlier reluctance to do so. Syria's government, meanwhile, has claimed rebel fighters have used chemical weapons as well. That includes a March incident in Khan al-Asal in the northern province of Aleppo, according to state media. Opposition officials have said rebels don't have access to chemical weapons or the missiles needed to use them in an attack, while other rebel leaders said Syrian troops fired ""chemical rockets"" at civilians and opposition forces. Nesirky said the team will investigate the Khan al-Asal incident and added that ""the locations of the two other incidents are being kept confidential as safety and security precaution.""

"(CNN) -- Whatever the reason for its recent spate of problems, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner won't fly again until regulators are satisfied the plane is airworthy. Reports of fire and smoke have put the focus on the plane's cutting-edge lithium ion battery systems and grounded the fleet worldwide. Only 50 Dreamliners are in service so far, but the airlines that bought these multimillion dollar aircraft are losing money while they sit on the ground. Big questions remain: How long will it take to get the Dreamliner back in the air? Will travelers feel safe enough to board them? It's going to be ""a big mess, cost Boeing a lot of money"" and embarrass carriers that fly the 787, said aviation historian David T. Courtwright, a professor at the University of North Florida. The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday ordered an emergency inspection of all U.S. 787s. United Airlines is the only U.S. carrier flying the aircraft, with six in its fleet. The airworthiness inspection will address the potential risk of battery fires. An in-flight fire aboard any aircraft is among the most dangerous aviation scenarios. Dreamliner woes explained . Grounding a plane is rare . It's very rare for the FAA to order an entire model of airliner out of service, even for a short time. Industry observers remember that the agency grounded the entire U.S. fleet of DC-10s for 37 days in 1979. That was after American Airlines Flight 191 crashed at Chicago's O'Hare airport, killing all 271 people aboard and two others on the ground. An NTSB investigation blamed design vulnerabilities and an engine pylon maintanance procedure. ""I was just starting my career flying at Delta and had just flown out of that airport a few days before,' said Kevin Hiatt, head of the Flight Safety Foundation and a former commercial pilot. ""It was a big, beautiful DC-10. It was very, very distressing,"" Several DC-10s were involved in crashes caused by maintenance, design and other issues in the 1970s and 1980s, spurring doubt about the plane's safety. The last DC-10 to carry paying passengers flew in 2007. The Dreamliner, of course, hasn't crashed in its 15 months of service and is making its debut during a period of unprecedented U.S. aviation safety. Nonetheless, every day that Dreamliners are grounded ratchets up the pressure on Boeing, United and other airlines that have made commitments to buy the 787s. The battery that grounded Boeing . A time frame for flying again . So now, Boeing looks for answers. A time frame for getting back in the air is anyone's guess, but the Dreamliner could be ""grounded another two weeks or two months,"" said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board and ex-airline mechanic. Experts will ""figure out what's wrong, design a fix and build a part to fix it,"" said Goglia. ""It's not easy."" Even if Boeing engineers get lucky and find the answer to the problem now, it might still take at least a couple weeks ""to get up and running,"" he said. With reports of problems continuing to plague the Dreamliner, Hiatt said the FAA didn't need to take any chances. ""They're acting with an abundance of caution,"" he said. ""They're going to go ahead and be proactive and not have the same situation"" as the DC-10. Growing pains aren't unusual . Other aircraft, including the Airbus A380, have had problems during rollout, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. It's what often happens when a new aircraft is put into service. ""I know Boeing spent a lot of time testing things extensively,"" said Ordonez. ""These are very complex systems ... and there may be problems they didn't anticipate. It's one of the most complex commercial aircraft ever."" With problems appearing in a forward electrical compartment on Wednesday's All Nippon Airlines (ANA) 787 emergency landing, aviation historian Courtwright, author of ""Sky as Frontier: Adventure, Aviation, and Empire,"" worried the situation is more serious than simply problems confined to the aft electrical bay. ""It raises the specter of something more systemic and perhaps a defective lithium ion battery, he said. The Dreamliner relies on electricity to power more functions than previous Boeing airliners, and that takes a lot of battery power. Lithium ion batteries replaced the traditional nickel cadmium batteries in the new aircraft. Lithium ion batteries keep a charge longer than nickel cadmium and weigh less, so the plane can save fuel. But there are questions about using lithium ion batteries because they've never been used on an airliner to the extent that the Dreamliner uses them. All this regulatory turbulence is part of a painful but necessary process of airline development. ""That's aviation,"" says airline pilot Patrick Smith of the aviation blog Askthepilot.com. ""There's a certain statistical aspect that you're working with in that nothing is going to happen but the best thing is to take the plane out of service and take a time out."" CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Grounding of aircraft model by regulators very rare, experts say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The two teen girls were close friends, each looking forward to a summer trip to California to improve their English. Ye Mengyuan excelled at the piano, just as she did in her academics. Wang Linjia enjoyed calligraphy and, according to local media, her work at the school's TV and radio stations. Classmates since junior high, the girls often ate lunch together at school, and few were surprised that they chose to sit together on the 10-hour flight that led to their deaths Saturday. Asiana Airlines Flight 214 had started in Shanghai, China, where the two girls boarded. Then, with a stop in Seoul, South Korea, the flight headed for San Francisco. The Boeing 777 was seconds from landing Saturday when its rear end struck the edge of the runway at San Francisco International Airport, sending it spinning and erupting in flames. When medics arrived, they found the bodies of the two girls on the runway, next to the burning wreckage. Tragic still, one of them may have been struck by a first responder's vehicle, authorities said. ""Our examination will determine whether (the death) was from the airplane crash or secondary incident,"" San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said. Remarkably, 305 people survived the crash. Ye and Wang were the only two who didn't. 'Oh, Lord have mercy': Witness captures fatal jet crash . Headed to camp . The pair, along with 28 classmates and four teachers, were headed to a summer church camp held by the West Valley Christian School near Los Angeles. The camp is aimed at helping foreign students improve their English skills. Study tours are increasingly popular for Chinese families that can afford them. Another group of students and teachers from Taiyuan in Shanxi province were also on the flight. The tours usually last around two to three weeks and cost about $5,000, with the East and West Coasts of the United States the most popular destinations. West Valley Christian School said on its website that the girls and their group had been due to arrive Tuesday and stay for three weeks. Instead, some members of the group are still hospitalized in San Francisco, waiting for their families, said Derek Swales, administrator for the school. Once they recover, they will be returning to China for the summer instead of coming to camp, he said. Students from the group were carrying bags and blankets labeled ""Salvation Army"" when they arrived at a San Francisco hotel on Monday. They met with China's counsel general, standing solemnly in a circle as he spoke. An adult with them said they were having a difficult time. ""They spent the morning crying,"" the adult said. The girls would have studied language, arts and culture during their stay at the camp. Ye was also looking forward to visiting college campuses, Chinese media said. A picture in Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper showed two grinning, bespectacled girls wearing red-and-yellow tracksuits and making a heart shape with their arms. Chinese netizens mourn Asiana crash victims . A school in mourning . Back home in Jiangshan in eastern China, students mourned the death of two of their own. At a vigil, they placed candles in the shape of a heart, hugged each other and wept. ""We hope we can send the two who died our wishes and hope that they will be in heaven, in peace,"" said Chai Peng Lei, 18. Wang was known as a natural leader in the classroom at Jiangshan High School, friends and teachers say. She studied hard and wanted to be a journalist. Her teacher told the Beijing Morning Post that Wang was hard-working and inquisitive. ""She was attentive and responsible and communicated with other students when there were problems,"" the teacher said. ""That's why she was elected class leader three years in a row."" Her classmate, Lu Hao, told the newspaper Wang was always smiling. ""She was tall and skinny and very nice to others,"" Lu said. A keen painter and calligrapher, Wang produced artwork that was said to hang on the wall of her father's office. Ye's mother told the paper her daughter had won the school's annual speech contest. Her music teacher said she possessed a special skill at singing and playing the piano. Word of the girls' deaths devastated other parents in the community, many of whom had sent their own children on the same summer trip. For years, the elite school has been sending students to the United States for the summer, so when the news came, father Mao Xiao Qiang said he thought it was a joke. ""The second feeling was surprise, and then I was terrified. I immediately called my boy, and luckily, I found he was OK,"" he said. ""As a father, I feel very sad. I saw those girls when we were saying goodbye."" Grieving parents arrive in U.S. Ye's and Wang's parents left for San Francisco on Monday bring the bodies of their beloved girls home, the school's principal said. During a layover in Seoul, Asiana Airlines President and CEO Yoon Young-doo met the parents at the airport and apologized. The families later arrived in San Francisco on Monday night, China Daily reported. CNN's David McKenzie in Jiangshan, Steven Jiang in Beijing, Dan Simon and Linda Hall in San Francisco, Stephanie Elam in Los Angeles and Jackie Castillo in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Parents of the two girls killed arrive in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association made clear Sunday it will not budge on its opposition to any new gun laws, despite heated criticism of the organization's response to the Connecticut school massacre. ""I know this town wants to argue about gun control,"" the group's CEO, Wayne LaPierre, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in Washington. ""I don't think it will work."" LaPierre stood by remarks he made at an event Friday billed as a news conference -- though he took no questions -- in which he argued for armed guards in schools. ""If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,"" he said on Sunday. He added that in Friday's news conference, ""I said what I honestly thought and what millions, and hundreds of millions, of people all over this country believe will actually make a difference."" ""We're going to support an immediate appropriation before Congress to put police officers in every school,"" he vowed. Legislation being pushed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, to restore an assault weapons ban is not going to make kids any safer, LaPierre insisted. Read more: Gun owners fear new laws . Pressed on whether high-capacity magazines should be banned, limiting the number of bullets that can be fired from a single weapon without reloading, LaPierre said no. ""There are so many different ways"" that a ""monster"" could carry out a massacre, as Adam Lanza did in Newtown, Connecticut, LaPierre argued. He would not express support for any new gun restrictions, saying most gun laws on the books are currently rarely enforced. ""I know there's a media machine in this country that wants to blame guns every time something happens,"" he said, adding, ""I know there's an anti-Second Amendment industry in this town."" The NRA supports efforts to improve mental health care in the country in hopes of avoiding such nightmare scenarios, LaPierre said. Meanwhile, Asa Hutchinson, the man charged with developing the NRA's program to place armed guards in schools, told CNN his ""high-level panel of experts"" will present educators with safety options and detailed instructions. Sen. Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, told CNN, ""I have found the statements by the NRA over the last couple of days to be really disheartening, because the statements seem to not reflect any understanding about the slaughter of children that happened in Newtown. ... ""The NRA spokespeople have been willing to deal with every possible cause of gun violence, except guns. They're right that there's a problem for our society -- how do you spot a child or a person who is troubled before they become a killer? What's the influence of violence in our entertainment culture on people? But it's obviously also true that the easy availability of guns, including military-style assault weapons, is a contributing factor, and you can't keep that off the table. I had hoped they'd come to the table and say, everything is on the table."" Lanza shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown and killed 20 children -- none of them older than 7 -- and six adults. He used a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle to mow down his victims before killing himself with one of the two handguns he was carrying. On Friday, a week after the shooting, LaPierre spoke out for the first time on the massacre, blaming video games and the media, while also proposing an armed guard in every U.S. school. ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. Some gun owners and mostly Republican officials rallied around LaPierre, and some -- such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- have indicated they support putting armed guards, or even teachers with concealed weapons, in schools. Read more: NRA breaks silence after shootings . CNN iReporter Jason Asselin applauded the NRA's stance, proposing that U.S. troops returning from war zones could serve as armed guards. ""Right now, our schools remain unprotected,"" he said. ""Action is needed. Our children deserve to be protected."" But most of the reaction to LaPierre was negative. Democratic Sen.-elect and U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy, whose district includes Newtown, called LaPierre's words ""the most revolting, tone-deaf statement I've ever seen."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, blasted them as ""a shameful evasion of the crisis facing the country."" And former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said he found the remarks ""very haunting and very disturbing."" This wave of criticism continued into the weekend. Would your gun fall under the '94 weapons ban? New York's tabloids, normally political polar opposites, offered the same take: The Daily News' headline called LaPierre the ""Craziest Man on Earth,"" while Rupert Murdoch's New York Post ran with, ""Gun Nut! NRA loon in bizarre rant over Newtown."" Rick Huffman, another CNN iReporter and a retired police officer, cut up his NRA membership card in the wake of the mass shooting, which he said changed his views on gun control. ""There's got to be a limit to what they let citizens have at their disposal,"" the Michigan resident said. Both sides, at least, appear to agree something needs to be done to prevent more mass shootings like what happened December 14 in the once quiet Connecticut town. President Barack Obama used his speech at a prayer service for the massacre's victims to call for action and subsequently tapped Vice President Joe Biden to lead a group charged with coming up with solutions. Polls suggest that, after Newtown, the American public is increasingly open to measures such as a ban on assault weapons, which was in effect in the 1990s until it lapsed in 2004. A CNN/ORC poll conducted after the shooting shows that a slight majority of Americans favor restrictions on guns. Conservative Democrats and some Republicans who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing gun control. In a speech last Sunday night, Obama insisted inaction was not an option, especially when it comes to protecting children. ""We can't tolerate this anymore,"" the president said, alluding not only to Newtown but three other mass shootings over the past two years. ""These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change."" Opinion: Don't let this moment pass without acting on gun control .","NEW: NRA's LaPierre: If this idea is crazy, ""then call me crazy""

"(CNN) -- Crashing waves. Windy bluffs. The mystique of the high seas and whatever lies beyond: Seaside places possess a dramatic allure that's naturally attractive to storytellers. Maybe that's why so many famous writers have chosen to live, work and set their fiction by the ocean. Or maybe they just liked the beach in summertime. Whatever the case, if you're fond of literature as well as lounging, consider following in one of these writers' footsteps. Whether you gravitate toward heat and palm trees or windswept north Atlantic dunes, some writer has put their stamp on a seaside spot to suit your tastes. Here are five places where inspiration hangs in the salty air. Monterey County, California: John Steinbeck . The region that John Steinbeck immortalized in ""Tortilla Flat,"" ""Cannery Row"" and other works is one beautiful place to see the Pacific. Its sunny vistas are in contrast with Steinbeck's characters and their harsh struggles, but several sites ensure that the ghost of Tom Joad is not forgotten. Start, as Steinbeck did, in Salinas, where his birthplace and boyhood home on Central Avenue has been preserved as The Steinbeck House. Tours for the public run on select Sundays in the summer (suggested donation $10); the restaurant is open Tuesday through Saturday for lunch featuring Salinas Valley produce. The places where masterpieces are born . Down the street, the National Steinbeck Center provides an in-depth look at the Nobel Prize winner's life and work, with interactive exhibits, artifacts and film screenings ($14.95 adults; $5.95 children). About 20 miles away in Monterey, stroll along Cannery Row to Steinbeck Plaza and absorb the atmosphere of this street -- called Ocean View Avenue until it was renamed for Steinbeck's book -- where Lee Chong, Mack and the others hatched their schemes. Unwind with a visit to Asimolar State Beach in Pacific Grove, where the Steinbeck family owned a summer cottage. Key West, Florida: Ernest Hemingway . Ernest Hemingway spent most of the 1930s in Key West and got a lot of writing done. This, despite the distraction of spectacular sunsets, water-based activities and ubiquitous drinking. He was lucky to live in a stately, palm-fringed house that remains a tranquil oasis to this day. Five trips for crime fiction lovers . Tour the Hemingway Home ($13 adults; $6 children) and see the splendors that temporarily tamed his wanderlust. Star attractions include a sparkling pool and large collection of six-toed cats, some descended from one the author owned. For a fuller taste of his life by the Gulf, organize a fishing charter and do battle with a marlin. Once you've perused ""To Have and Have Not,"" Hemingway's novel set in Cuba and Key West, stop for a drink at Captain Tony's Saloon (the original Sloppy Joe's). The spot was a favorite of the author's and is said to be the inspiration for Freddy's in the book. Nantucket, Massachusetts: Herman Melville . ""Moby-Dick"" was published in 1851, but it wasn't until the following year that Herman Melville got around to visiting this island prominently featured in his magnum opus. Nantucket's reputation as the whaling capital of the world impressed Melville from afar. Ishmael, the book's narrator, considers it ""the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from."" Today Nantucket is known principally as a summer getaway, but whales remain a big (pun intended) part of the tourist draw. Brick and mortar: Best indie bookstores . Bring a copy of ""Moby-Dick"" and dig in to Chapter 14, ""Nantucket,"" on your arrival. Revisit Melville's own experience as a summer tourist by checking into the Jared Coffin House -- called Ocean House when Melville stayed there -- for a bed and breakfast ($180-$560 in peak season). Just down the block, learn more about whaling tales that fascinated the author at the Nantucket Whaling Museum ($20 adults; $5 children). Then, mount your own obsessive search for the beast with a 6-hour whale-watching cruise ($155 per person). Cruises run three times a week during summer, with sightings guaranteed. Prince Edward Island, Canada: L.M. Montgomery . Countless young people have grown up captivated by ""Anne of Green Gables,"" L.M. Montgomery's 1908 novel set in this Canadian maritime province. Travelers drawn by Anne will find the island -- with its distinctive red soil, rolling farmland and pristine beaches -- equally captivating. They'll also find its tourism industry based heavily on the book's continued popularity. Whether you arrive by air, ferry or the 8-mile bridge from New Brunswick, head for the North Shore. There you'll find Prince Edward Island National Park, home to sandy beaches and a series of Green-Gables related attractions in and around Montgomery's home town of Cavendish. Check out the farm that inspired the story ($7.50 adults; $3.75 children) and, separately, the site of Montgomery's own home ($4 adults; $2 children). Then spend some time in Avonlea Village ($70 per family; two-day admission) for a taste of the old-fashioned life; daily events include wagon rides, pig racing and samplings of raspberry cordial and homemade ice cream. Cornwall, England: Daphne DuMaurier . Stories like ""The Birds"" and ""Rebecca"" earned Daphne DuMaurier her reputation as a dark writer, expert at creating a sense of foreboding. But the landscape that fed her imagination encompasses some of the most pleasant and beautiful scenery in the United Kingdom. Today, the southwest corner of England, particularly Cornwall, is deeply associated with her vivid fiction. Top spots in Europe for 2013 . Spend at least one night at the Jamaica Inn (about $130-$175). Its history as a hideaway for 18th-century smugglers inspired DuMaurier to pen her novel ""Jamaica Inn,"" and there's now a ""Smuggler's Museum"" on site, including a Daphne DuMaurier Room full of memorabilia. Come in May and you can drop by The Fowey Festival of Words and Music, inspired by DuMaurier's memory and offering dozens of events, from concerts to cruises (tickets range from about $7.50-$23). If the beaches are chilly, try your hand at sailing -- a favorite pastime of the ill-fated Mrs. de Winter -- with a 5-day course at the Fowey Harbour Sailing School (about $735; tel. 44-78/999-62414).","Add a bit of literary history to your summer beach getaway .

"(CNN) -- A search warrant filed in Tampa, Florida, Tuesday says a mother was unconscious and wearing a bloody robe and her two deceased children were covered in blankets when police arrived. Julie K. Schenecker was awakened and taken from a screened-in pool area to inside the home, where evidence was recovered, according to the warrant filed in Circuit Court in Hillsborough County. The search warrant was posted on the website of CNN affiliate WTSP. Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the January 28 deaths of her 13-year-old son, Beau Powers Schenecker, and her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx Powers Schenecker. She was denied bond at a court appearance Monday, a court spokesman said. The warrant provides new details in the case: Five bullets and a Smith & Wesson box and instruction manual were found in the master bedroom; 15 live rounds and five spent shell casings were in the master bath. Also indicated in the search warrant -- both inside and outside the house -- were cigarette butts, note pads, undisclosed medication and paperwork. Police found Calyx's body in an upstairs bedroom. She had been shot twice in the head, police said. Beau's body was later found in the front seat of an SUV inside the home's garage, police said. They said he was shot while he was being driven to soccer practice. A preliminary investigation indicates the teens were killed Thursday night, the police statement said, but the county medical examiner will determine their time of death. Schenecker confessed to killing the children, according to a police statement, eventually recounting her rationale and thought process ""in detail,"" according to a press release. ""She did tell us that they talked back, that they were mouthy,"" Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy told CNN affiliate WTSP late last week. ""But I don't think that will ever serve as an explanation to the rest of us of how you could take a child's life."" Officers arrived at 7:45 a.m. to find Julie Schenecker on her home's back porch, ""a little combative"" and her clothing soaked in blood, McElroy said. Schenecker had initially planned what she called the ""massacre"" -- killing the children and then herself, McElroy said on Monday -- for January 22, but she put it off after learning there would be a three-day check before she could buy a gun. Police later found writings in the house, thought to be from Schenecker, in which she spelled out her intentions in detail. ""There are definitely indications that she planned this,"" McElroy said. ""(The writing) was devoid of emotion."" Police opened, and then dropped, an investigation of physical abuse involving Schenecker against her teen daughter, closing the case weeks before the killings. ""Our belief was that she didn't snap -- she planned this,"" McElroy told HLN's Vinnie Politan on Monday. In November, police opened a child abuse investigation into allegations Schenecker had abused Calyx, according to a report from the Tampa Police. A responding officer, Julie Becker, wrote that she didn't see any ""visible injuries"" on Calyx, nor did the girl complain of any. ""She seemed cautious of what was saying, and at times began to cry,"" Becker said in her report. Calyx told police that days earlier her mother repeatedly hit her while they were driving home, before she was able to run to a safe spot in her room. The girl said that a month and a half earlier, her mother had hit her so hard in the face it caused her lip to bleed. Julie Schenecker told police she had hit the girl three times in the first incident after the girl told her, ""You're disgusting,"" and ""You're not my parent,"" according to the police report. She said Calyx was not bruised or bleeding afterward. The mother also admitted hitting the girl once more than a month earlier, according to her police statement, but she again denied that Calyx had bled. Becker noted, ""There is no prior history (related to) this location and the family."" On December 21, having found ""no evidence of a criminal offense,"" authorities ended their investigation of the case. McElroy, the Tampa police spokeswoman, said Monday that the daughter's seeming ""regret"" over her comments and the fact no wounds could be seen prompted the investigators' decision. ""Parents can discipline their children using physical force, as long as there's no injury,"" said McElroy. ""That's why there was no criminal offense at that time."" But McElroy said police determined on January 28 after they arrived at the family home that Schenecker had plotted to kill the teens. Authorities went to the house after getting a call from the suspect's mother who, after email communications the previous night, was worried her daughter was depressed. Schenecker's husband, Parker, is a colonel in the U.S. Army. He is a member of U.S. Central Command. Police told CNN affiliate WFTS that he was in Qatar when his children were killed. Schenecker appeared in court Monday via video link from jail, WFTS reported. She held a tissue and wept softly during the two-minute appearance. Judge Walter Heinrich said at the hearing that Schenecker likely will undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to CNN affiliates WTSP and WFTS. She did not enter a plea because of that likelihood, according to Hillsborough County Court spokesman Calvin Green. No new court dates are set in the case, Green said. Prosecutors have 21 days to present the case to a grand jury. The mourning for the young victims continues in west Florida, where a vigil was held Friday night. On Monday -- their first day back since the shootings became public -- students at Liberty Middle School in Tampa wore blue and black in memory of Beau, an eighth-grader at the school.

"(CNN) -- A herd of hulking American bison huddles to keep warm during a prairie blizzard in Theodore Roosevelt National Park. It's an image that's as vintage Americana as a Norman Rockwell painting. The bison, often referred to as buffalo, teetered on the brink of extinction in the 19th century. But the bison's destiny changed in 1883 when a young Theodore Roosevelt first came to North Dakota's Badlands for the sole purpose of hunting one. Though Teddy eventually got one for his trophy case, the lessons from that trip became his inspiration to ignite a conservationist movement that would help save the bison and pave the way for the national park system to evolve into an important American institution. 8 amazing outdoor music venues . Today, Theodore Roosevelt National Park serves as a monument to a president who had the foresight to preserve and protect this country's pristine wilderness. It's also a testament to his ability to make such places accessible to all. Park stats: The park was established in 1947 as Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park, but it was not officially designated as a national park until 1978. Its two busiest years were 1972, when it was about 1,100 guests short of 1 million for the year, and 1976 during the Bicentennial, when it again flirted with 1 million visitors. The park has averaged slightly less than 600,000 visitors per year since 2008. The location: Theodore Roosevelt consists of more than 70,000 acres in the North Dakota Badlands, which are not to be confused with the Badlands National Park in South Dakota. The difference, according to park ranger Valerie Naylor, is North Dakota's Badlands are older, look different and have heavier vegetation. There are a number of ways to access the park, which is divided in three parts: North Unit, South Unit and Elkhorn Ranch Unit. Medora is the entrance to the South Unit and is about a two-hour drive from the state capital, Bismarck. The North Unit entrance is about 14 miles south of Watford City and is about three hours from Bismarck. The two Badlands are not contiguous, she says. Throwback lodging: 5 historic stays . The Elkhorn Ranch Unit is 35 miles north of Medora, but the only road access is on gravel roads. The park service recommends speaking with a ranger and getting a map before driving out to Elkhorn Ranch. If you are feeling more adventurous, you can access the ranch from the east by fording the Little Missouri River. If you go: Entrance fees are $10 for private noncommercial vehicles. Individual passes (hikers, cyclists and people on horseback) are $5. The park offers a variety of events, places to visit and outdoor activities. The park is open every day except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Parts of the South Unit Scenic Loop Drive and North Unit Scenic Road close during winter. There are three visitor centers: North Unit, South Unit and Painted Canyon. South Unit and Painted Canyon are open seven days a week. However, the North Unit visitor center is only open on weekends from September 2 to May 31. Meet our ranger: Valerie Naylor, 55, was born in Portland, Oregon, and says she knew in high school that she wanted to be a naturalist. In 1973, she passed through Theodore Roosevelt on one of many vacations she took with her parents. But her mother didn't share Naylor's immediate interest in the park and they quickly moved on. ""I was enthralled with the landscape in this park,"" she says. ""But I thought, 'That's OK, I'll come back here someday.' "" She returned in 1979 as a volunteer for a student conservation association. She then worked as a seasonal park employee for two years and later used the park as a research laboratory for a master's degree in biology at the University of North Dakota. Naylor became a full-time National Park Service employee in 1985 and returned to her ""home park"" in 2003 as superintendent. ""The Little Missouri River, the prairie and the wildlife make it exceptional,"" she says. ""It also has the history of Theodore Roosevelt, who was a great conservation president."" Naylor has also worked at Colorado National Monument, Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Badlands National Park, Petrified Forest National Park, Big Bend National Park and Scotts Bluff National Monument. For a day trip, don't miss: Hiking the Caprock Coulee in the North Unit. The park website lists the 4-mile trail as moderate to strenuous. Less experienced hikers can take the Caprock Coulee Nature Trail, a 1.5-mile shortened version. Be sure to go in the early morning or late evening to maximize the chance to see wildlife, says Naylor. Favorite less-traveled spot: The Elkhorn Ranch Unit. Naylor says the 218 acres are the most historically significant part of the park because it's where Roosevelt built his second ranch. Roosevelt's first ranch was centered around the Maltese Cross Cabin, which has been moved from its original site and is now a museum. He made a second trek to North Dakota's Badlands in 1884 after his wife and mother died on Valentine's Day. With one cattle ranch already established in North Dakota, he chose a trek of land next to the Little Missouri River for the Elkhorn Ranch. ""It's a beautiful unspoiled place along the Little Missouri that is much like it was when Roosevelt first found it in 1884,"" she says. ""And we're trying very hard to keep it that way."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: Prairie dog town in the South Unit. In addition to prairie dogs, the park is home to a several species of deer, a variety of birds, coyotes, bobcats, beavers, badgers, rattlesnakes, elk, wild horses and bison. ""Prairie dogs provide food and shelter for so many animals that they are a great place to see other wildlife,"" says Naylor. Naylor says prairie dog holes are used by snakes, amphibians, burrowing owls and insect. The holes also cause vegetation changes, which provide grazing for bison. Most magical moment in the park: In the summer of 1979, when Naylor spent her first year as a volunteer working in the visitor center conducting programs and sharing park history with guests. ""I did not intend to make it a career,"" she says. ""But after spending the summer working at a national park, I had no other aspirations. And it was this park that did it for me."" Funniest moment at the park: Seeing a bison calf become confused about his mother's identity. ""I once watched a bison calf run across the prairie to mom -- fast as he could go,"" she says. ""When he got about 15 feet, he stopped, turned 90 degrees and ran to another one. That was one of the most amazing things I have seen. It was both interesting and funny."" A ranger's request: The park is home to a variety of wildlife. Understand that the bison are the most dangerous animals in the park, even though they look docile and calm. ""They can run faster than a horse and turn on a dime,"" she says. ""Generally, if an animal reacts to your presence, you are too close. They (bison) do charge humans."" Another park she'd like to visit: Lava Beds National Monument in Siskiyou, California. Located in the high desert of Northern California, it is known for Native American cave art and as one of North America's most continuously occupied geographic areas. Naylor says her goal is to visit every national park and estimates she's been to more than half of them. ""I like large, wide-open landscapes, and it sounds like a fascinating place,"" she says. ""I like to go anywhere I haven't been before."" What national park would you like to visit?

"(CNN) -- You know her best as a multi-platinum recording artist and a 14-time Grammy award-winning singer, songwriter and producer. But Alicia Keys has also made quite a name for herself as a philanthropist and AIDS advocate. It was in 2003, on her first trip to Africa, when Keys witnessed firsthand the disease's devastation. When she returned to the United States, she co-founded ""Keep a Child Alive,"" an organization that has raised millions to care for HIV/AIDS patients in Africa and India. ""So, as I've grown, you know, I think one of the things that I've realized is that there are not the headlines about the AIDS pandemic here in America that there should be, and it is shocking, and it is unacceptable,"" Keys told CNN last month. CDC: Half of young people with HIV don't know it . ""Yet we're not speaking about it, and so that's what's kind of brought me around to really becoming a part of what I like to say, 'bridging the conversation' so that there's not only an international conversation, there's not only a domestic conversation, there's a global conversation that we can all be a part of."" Keys brought that conversation to Washington, where she met with women being treated at the United Medical Center's Infectious Diseases Clinic. She also teamed up with Greater Than AIDS, a national public information group founded by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Black AIDS Institute, to launch her latest initiative -- a campaign aimed at reaching out specifically to American women. It's called ""Empowered"" and phase one features a video of Keys and five women who are HIV-positive from all walks of life. They include Stephanie, a college graduate diagnosed at 19; and Kym, diagnosed three years ago after her new husband got sick and died of the disease (she did not know he'd been HIV-positive for a decade). Also included are Cristina, a graduate student born with the virus; Jen, a wife and mother who was diagnosed at 18; and Eva, a wife, mother, grandmother and home health care professional who found out she was HIV-positive when she was just 17 -- and pregnant. The women share their stories and their determination to change the course -- and the face -- of HIV/AIDS. Keys said she wants all women to know the facts about HIV and its impact on women; to be able to speak openly about the disease with family and friends; to protect themselves and their loved ones; to get tested without shame; and to live rich, healthy lives by getting and staying on treatment. Why youths aren't getting tested for HIV . ""We can't act like it's not happening. We have to make sure we know that we're all at risk. This is all of our issues, you know. This doesn't make you bad. ... You shouldn't feel like you're ashamed. We have to make sure that we are demanding access to being tested. We have to demand access to treatment with dignity."" She found an ally in senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, whose passion about the epidemic inspired her. Part of that passion, Jarrett said, comes from losing her sister-in-law nearly 20 years ago to the disease. ""She was married with a young child and didn't really get the testing that she should have had early on in her illness because it never occurred to anyone that a married mom would actually ... be HIV positive,"" Jarrett told CNN. ""Losing her was just devastating for our family and so that's where I began to realize, of course, this could happen to anybody's family."" More than 1.1 million Americans are HIV positive, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One in five don't know they're infected. One in four people living with HIV is a woman. In Washington, one of the hardest-hit areas in the country, rates among African-American women have skyrocketed -- more than 92% of women living with HIV there are black. It was here, last year, that Keys and Jarrett came together and decided to support each other's efforts. President Barack Obama is committed to the goal of an AIDS-free generation and will do everything in his power to eradicate the disease, according to Jarrett. That includes $23 billion for HIV in next year's proposed budget. But, said Jarrett, HIV still has to be brought out of the shadows. Timeline: AIDS moments to remember . ""We can't pretend it doesn't exist,"" Jarrett said. ""When people share these stories, it de-stigmatizes it, it brings it out in to the light and when we do that, we improve the quality of life that all people will have."" For its part, Empowered will provide community-based grants of up to $25,000 for programs focused on women. That, Keys hopes, will help open up a meaningful dialogue in this country. ""For a woman and a black woman, you know, this is a conversation that we must have as all women. Again, as all human beings, we have to have this conversation,"" she said. ""I feel like this is an incredibly wonderful opportunity that we have to have a real dialogue, woman to woman, mother to mother, sister to sister, brother to sister ... father to daughter, daughter to mother, you know, friend to friend. This is what we have to start absolutely being open about.""","One in four people living with HIV is a woman .

"(CNN) -- Unless Facebook users fight back, the days of the social network's experiment with democracy may soon come to an end. The company on Wednesday proposed to take away its users' right to vote on major issues concerning the governance of its 1 billion-member online network. The reaction online has been less than welcoming. ""Facebook now argues that it is too big for democracy, much like the Chinese government might,"" writes Michael Phillips on the site BuzzFeed. ""Call this new regime Facebook with Authoritarian Characteristics."" Since 2009, in what Facebook calls an experiment with digital voting rights, Facebook has allowed users to vote on major changes to the way it manages user data and privacy, if the online community expressed enough interest. If 7,000 people commented on a particular proposal, that triggered a vote. And if 30% of the site's active users -- which would be 300 million people at this point -- voted against the change, Facebook would abandon it. Now the company says it wants to ditch that system, replacing it with new ways for users to submit questions to Facebook's privacy team. The company lists two primary reasons for the shift away from digital democracy: Facebook has become extremely large, with more than a billion users; and it's a publicly traded company now, which means it is ""accountable to regulators around the world."" ""Democracy can be difficult, especially for a multibillion dollar public company,"" writes Somini Sengupta for the New York Times' Bits Blog. Some technology writers are calling for users to revolt. ""Because it hasn't revoked that right yet, there is still time for you to mount a campaign to retain it, in theory,"" writes Will Oremus for Slate. ""But Facebook knows it's highly unlikely that you will. It turns out that, for all of the shrill cries that fly around the Internet every time (CEO Mark) Zuckerberg and company make a tweak, most people just don't care enough to take action. At least, not on the types of changes that Facebook allowed them to vote on."" Phillips, the BuzzFeed writer, says this is a watershed moment for the Internet. ""By repealing Facebook Suffrage, Facebook abandons a fundamental norm -- that its users are citizens in a community, and not simply datapoints on an advertising algorithm. The vote may be quixotic, but if Facebook remains the indispensable social network, you'll want to be able to tell your grandchildren you fought for Facebook freedom. Who knows how Facebook will develop without your input."" In clinical language released the day before the United States celebrates Thanksgiving, a time when people here are unlikely to take much notice, Facebook says it wants to ""end the voting component of the process."" ""We deeply value the feedback we receive from you during our comment period,"" the site says a press release. ""In the past, your substantive feedback has led to changes to the proposals we made. However, we found that the voting mechanism, which is triggered by a specific number of comments, actually resulted in a system that incentivized the quantity of comments over their quality. Therefore, we're proposing to end the voting component of the process in favor of a system that leads to more meaningful feedback and engagement."" The company adds: ""We will continue to post significant changes to our Data Use Policy and SRR (Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) and provide a seven-day period for review and comment. As always, we will carefully consider your feedback before adopting any changes."" As TechCrunch notes, Facebook is creating other ways for users to submit feedback to the site. ""As a replacement for the vote, Facebook is proposing to continue offering the seven-day comment period on proposed changes to its governing documents. It will also offer two new ways for users to voice their governance concerns,"" Josh Constine writes. ""There's 'Ask the Chief Privacy Officer,' a new feature on the official Facebook Privacy Pages that will let users submit questions to Erin Egan, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer. Additionally, Egan would hold regular live-streamed webcasts where users can ask questions. If the proposal is allowed, these new features will be substituted for the vote."" So there you have it. Webcasts, yes. Voting, no. Read more about the changes and let Facebook know what you think of its apparent move away from digital democracy by visiting the Facebook Site Governance page. Facebook says it will consider user feedback submitted until noon ET on November 28.","Facebook proposes to end its users' right to vote on changes to site policies .

"(CNN) -- As Germany continues to rise as lead survivor -- and decision-maker -- in the European Union's economic mire, the U.S. would do well to take a lesson from the country's economic model, particularly in manufacturing. Losing 4 million jobs over the past 10 years, U.S. manufacturing has hovered at roughly 12% of America's GDP, less than half its percentage in the 1950s. In Germany, however, manufacturing is well on its way toward 25% of GDP. President Barack Obama's pledge this week to lower manufacturing sector taxes to 25%, and January's U.S. manufacturing growth numbers, the highest in seven months, will certainly help stem the tide. But, clearly, a word to the wise is in order. With America experiencing the highest income inequality since the Great Depression, a gap that mushroomed primarily in the past 30 to 40 years because of trade, tax and labor policies, the answer is in our workers. Consider U.S. trade policies, which undermined America's working class through the outsourcing and offshoring of U.S. manufacturing and the erosion of labor protections. Consider its tax policies, which moved wealth from the majority to the minority, thanks to tax loopholes such as low capital gains and dividends taxes, thus favoring nonlabor wealth creation. Consider its labor policies, which failed to increase minimum wages for the majority of America: Minimum wage is worth less now -- adjusted for inflation -- than it was in 1968 when the inequality trend started to take off. Opinion: Nostalgia for factory jobs that will never come back . The way America has treated its workers has helped to create a highly precarious socioeconomic reality: One out of every two Americans is in poverty or low-income. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, roughly 50 million Americans are living below the poverty level and surviving on an average annual income of less than $22,500 for a family of four. Another 100 million Americans are living in the low-income bracket, living on average annual income of less than $45,000 for a family of four -- hardly the American dream. Couple these trends with the devastating financial crisis, which hurt those whose wealth was in basic stocks and first-time home purchases -- as opposed to the wealthy who invested in insurance-backed securities, derivatives and credit default swaps -- and you've bottomed out America's working class. This is where the United States can learn from Germany. How Germany stayed economically healthy, while maintaining a strong working class, might offer a lesson or two for America's woes. Unlike the U.S., Germany recovered quickly from the economic slump in 2009, mainly because German industry managed to keep its skilled work force during the crisis. This was possible because the German government sponsored short-time work, or a reduction of working hours, thus avoiding layoffs. This measure was possible only where decent wages and management-union trust existed, what Germans call a ""social partnership"". Even now, despite some growth in nonunionized companies and income inequality, the export-oriented manufacturing model of social partnership is strong. Those who believe unions, high wages and workers rights are a burden for business should consider that this sector has been Germany's most successful. Exports, mainly manufacturing, grew by 2.3% (even with 2009 data included), higher than the average growth rate of the German economy over the past 10 years at 1.1%. Here's how they did it: Instead of trying to outcompete global markets in cheap goods, German industry specialized in high-quality products and kept its share in a growing global market, as other European countries, Japan and the U.S. lost shares to China. The German manufacturing strategy is based on making existing products better again and again, or as a Mercedes ad put it: ""We are inventing the car. Since 1886."" This strategy is possible only with highly skilled and highly motivated workers and requires managers who promote a constant evolution of improvement in products and processes. This change-oriented management is successful because strong union representation on the shop floor, in the form of ""work councils,"" and on supervisory boards ensures that workers' interests are always considered. In the face of global competition, German manufacturing workers' representation remains strong. It has proved to be successful because it has incorporated the knowledge of workers and their representatives, countering change with fewer conflicts. Contrast this with Germany's services sector, where wages are much lower and the power of unions is much weaker. Growth, not coincidentally, is much weaker, too. Politicians across the Atlantic, but particularly in Washington, would be well-advised to take a look at the German manufacturing sector. The U.S. is only facing increasing global competition. If America wants an economic tide that lifts all boats, the answer is in its workers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","U.S. manufacturing lost 4 million jobs over past 10 years, accounts for only 12% of GDP .

"(CNN) -- Yes, safaris are great and the beaches are diverse and dramatic. But an Africa getaway doesn't just have to be about 4X4 game drives or lazy strolls on cotton-soft sands by crystal blue waters. If you're looking to soak up the continent's breathtaking scenery, and have an eye for adventure, then there's only one place to be: at the top. From the snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro, through the forest-clothed slopes of Mount Kenya, to the Alpine meadows of the High Atlas Mountains, Africa's magnificent rooftops offer glorious views and a wide range of trekking experiences that appeal to all kinds of climbers, from hardcore mountaineers to weekend warriors and families. ""It's the terrain and the ability to combine a wildlife experience with the climb,"" says Sunit Sanghrajka, president of U.S.-based travel group Alluring Africa, explaining what draws outsiders to the continent's mountainous areas. ""Also, Africa being kind of distant and lesser known, there is an allure to it,"" he adds. Sanghrajka says the continent's growing political and economic stability, coupled with improvements in communications and airlift, have all helped attract more and more tourists in recent years. ""The overall interest in Africa has grown exponentially, especially from the U.S. market,"" he says. Here, Inside Africa picks seven of the best treks and hikes from across the continent. Kilimanjaro . Make it to the summit of Tanzania's 5,895-meter Kilimanjaro, and you'll be standing at Africa's highest point. The majestic mountain is Africa's most-visited trekking destination, attracting tens of thousands of tourists and adventurers every year. ""You don't have to be a technical climber to climb Mount Kilimanjaro; you just need to be pretty physically fit,"" explains Sanghrajka. ""We've had more people requesting Kilimanjaro in the last three or four years because it's something they feel is attainable -- it can be combined with a family vacation and that's why I think it's so popular."" There are six routes to choose from, each with varying degrees of difficulty, scenery and success. No special equipment is required. On the way to the ""Roof of Africa,"" you will travel through five different climactic zones, reaching arctic cold temperatures around the glaciers that cap Kibo, Kilimanjaro's summit. You'd better hurry, though, as climate change experts say that the ice and snow in the mountain's upper slopes are melting and could disappear within decades. Watch this: Climbing Kilimanjaro . Atlas Mountains . The High Atlas is an impressive mountainous range in central Morocco that hosts North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal, at 4,165 meters. There's a variety of routes to follow during your ascent but inexperienced climbers should note that the trek through the mountain's challenging terrains is quite demanding. Passing though the rugged landscape you'll get the chance to explore spectacular gorges and rolling valleys as well as encounter the local Berber people who've inhabited these tough terrains for centuries. The best time to climb the High Atlas is during the summer months. Mount Kenya . A long-extinct volcano, Mount Kenya is Africa's second-highest peak, at 5,199 meters. Lying just south of the equator, the mountain's glacial valleys, successive vegetation zones and diverse wildlife will guarantee you spectacular scenery and a fantastic trekking experience. The ascent, however, to the mountain's steep ice-capped peaks is quite challenging. ""Mount Kenya is the most technical, probably, in that East African area,"" says Sanghrajka. At the mountain's crest, temperatures rarely rise above freezing point. There are several routes on the way to the mountain's summit, the majority of which take between three and seven days to complete. Mount Meru . Mount Meru may forever be destined to exist in the shadow of its imposing neighbor, Kilimanjaro, but Tanzania's second-highest mountain (4,565 meters) has its own devotees. ""It's lesser known, but Mount Meru is for the true enthusiast who wants to experience what very few people actually do,"" says Sanghrajka. A beautiful volcanic cinder cone, Mount Meru will treat you to stunning views and diverse wildlife. Its slopes are coated with dense rainforest up to about 2,900 meters, which then give way to rocky areas. Mount Meru is often used by mountaineers for acclimatization before trekking Kilimanjaro, or by those wanting a trek with the local Massai.

With its stupendous rock-hewn churches and medieval castles, northern Ethiopia's rich cultural heritage has long attracted tourists from around the world. But visitors to the area are also increasingly being drawn to the spectacular Simien Mountains, a natural marvel where several jagged peaks of solidified lava are separated by deep valleys to form an overwhelming landscape. The mountains are also home to some of the world's rarest animals, including the walia ibex, which is not found anywhere else in the world. Since 1978, the region's national park has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The highest point is Ras Dejen, at 4,533 meters. Read this: Rock churches 'built by angels' Mount Elgon . Mount Elgon is a magnificent extinct volcano dominating the skyline along the Uganda-Kenya border. Its enormous crater is surrounded by several jagged peaks, including Wagagai, which is the highest point at 4,321 meters. Here you can explore ancient caves and zip past spectacular cliffs, over which Mount Elgon's streams cascade as dramatic waterfalls. Elgon's slopes are covered in ancient dense forests and bamboo belts which then give way to a spectacular moon-like moorland zone blanketed by tree heaths, massive groundsels and lobelias. There are several routes to the mountain's peaks, and the full trekking circuit takes up to five days. A descent into the vast caldera, at 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, is also a must. The Drakensberg . The Drakensberg is a vast mountainous range in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland, rising to 3,475 meters and stretching for some 1,125 kilometers. The giant mountains are ideal for both casual day hikes through indigenous forests and more serious expeditions along tough terrains and rocky terraces. They also host several game reserves and parks, attracting thousands of tourists every year. ""A lot of people like to go and hike there because it's absolutely stunning,"" says Sanghrajka.
